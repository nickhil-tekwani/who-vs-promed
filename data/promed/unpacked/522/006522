UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, WILD BIRDS - SOMALIA

Dozens of dead birds in a flood-ravaged village in Somalia have raised fears
of an avian flu outbreak in a country with limited health facilities,
officials said on Wednesday.
The carcasses of the dead birds, which were thought to be ducks, were found
in Elbaraf, 55 km (34 miles) north of the town of Jowhar, local veterinarian
Ali Hamud told Reuters. "We burnt 51 carcasses," Hamud said.
Scientists have suggested that migratory birds play an important role in the
spread of the deadly H5N1 flu virus, which originated in Asia and has killed
more than 150 people worldwide so far.
Hamud said most of the birds found had tags around their feet and necks
indicating they had been come via the "Orient Institute" in Zagreb, Croatia.
Somalia is already battling floods that have submerged villages and farmland
and washed away bridges and food stocks. "We don't have the capacity to test
the birds here for bird flu or other diseases. Floods are already ravaging
villages here and the last thing we want is an epidemic," Hamud said.
Resident Nur Jimale said the birds were spotted 10 days ago in flocks of
hundreds. "We fear the unusual birds have brought diseases with them. I just
saw their carcasses lying everywhere yesterday. I have never seen such birds
in Somalia," he said.
Already one of the poorest countries in Africa, Somalia has lost tens of
thousands of people to conflict and famine since 1991.

[The location of the flooding can be seen at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/somalia.pdf>. It seems
that Jowhar is also referred to as Giohar and is located about 100 km north
of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu; both names (Jowhar and Giohar) are printed
on the map. At this point, the river Webi Shabeelle is on its way from the
Ethiopian Highlands to join the Indian Ocean.
This is a disturbing report on many levels. First of all, we have no idea
what caused the deaths of these birds and really where the birds came from.
It could be avian influenza, of course, but we have no evidence of this, not
even clinical sign or necropsy reports. I don't need to remind everyone that
there are many causes of wild bird die-offs that are not avian influenza:
botulism, avian cholera (caused by _Pasteurella multocida_), mycoplasmosis,
salmonellosis, trichomoniasis, exotic Newcastle disease, West Nile virus,
aflatoxicosis, aspergillosis, and other more mundane causes such as
parasitism.
Quarterly reports from USGS National Wildlife center indicating high
mortality events and their cause can be accessed at
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/quarterly_reports/2006_qtr_1.jsp>.
The most disturbing aspect of this report, however, is the low likelihood
that we will actually ever definitively find out whether this is avian
influenza unless it becomes such a strong epidemic among either birds or
people that no one can ignore it any longer.
Clearly, Dr Hamud and colleagues do not have the resources to test these
wild birds for avian influenza or trace them back to their origins. In a
country where political instability and wobbling statehood have combined
with natural disasters to weaken civil society, it appears there is no one
to fill the surveillance gap. Furthermore, there also exists a gap in
regional African or international mechanisms to ensure appropriate
surveillance so that we can either rule in or rule out avian influenza in
this and many other cases in Africa. Given that avian influenza has been
previously reported in the region, active follow-up should be routine here
as elsewhere. We can't afford to watch some regions closely and ignore
others. - Mod.PC]
