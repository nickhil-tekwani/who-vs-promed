CDC Update: avian influenza guidelines and recommendations - East Asia
-----------------------------------------------
Background:
-----
Avian influenza A (H5N1) is a viral infection that usually affects wild
birds but can infect and cause serious disease among poultry, such as
chickens. While it is unusual for humans to get influenza virus infections
directly from poultry or wild birds, a number of human infections and
outbreaks caused by certain avian influenza A viruses have been documented
since 1997. See
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/asia.htm>.

Exposure to sick or infected birds has been linked to the transmission of
the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. It is also possible that contact with
environmental surfaces contaminated by H5N1 viruses could transmit
infection. Therefore, care should be taken to avoid contact, when possible,
with surfaces that may have been contaminated by infected poultry, or their
feces or secretions. Currently, there is no evidence for sustained
person-to-person transmission of H5N1 viruses. Limited person-to-person
transmission of H5N1 virus has been documented. One example of limited
human-to-human transmission associated with close contact between an ill
child and her mother is thought to have occurred in Thailand in September 2004.
H5N1 infections in humans can cause serious disease and death. No H5N1
vaccine for humans is currently available. An H5N1 inactivated vaccine for
use by humans is under development in the United States. For information
about influenza antiviral drugs, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/treatment/>.
Situation Update:
-----
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an additional 10 cases of
human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were confirmed by the
Ministry of Health in Viet Nam on 11 Mar 2005; 3 of the cases were fatal.
The official notification to WHO of these recent cases, some of which date
back to late January 2005, is based on new reporting procedures established
by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO staff. Visit
the WHO website <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/> for
the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1).
CDC Recommendations: Americans living in areas affected by H5N1 outbreaks
among poultry (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, and
Viet Nam) should observe the following measures to help avoid illness.
Surveillance and Travel:
-----
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend
the measures for surveillance, diagnostic evaluation and infection control
that were detailed in a health update on 4 Feb 2005
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/professional/han020405.htm>. CDC remains in
communication with WHO and continues to closely monitor the H5N1 situation
in Asia. Situational updates can be found at the Avian Influenza website
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm> and the Travelers Health website
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel>. Information is also available on the WHO
website <http://www.who.int/en/>.
Precautions:
-----
The following recommendations are directed to embassies and U.S. citizens
living abroad in areas where avian influenza cases among humans and poultry
have been reported. These recommendations are based on current experience
and may be revised as more information becomes available. Embassies should
recommend the following precautions to U.S. expatriates living in an area
with avian influenza:
To minimize the possibility of infection, observe precautions to safeguard
your health. Specifically, travelers should avoid contact with poultry
(e.g., chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, quail) or any wild birds, and avoid
settings where H5N1-infected poultry may be present, such as commercial
poultry farms, backyard poultry farms, and live poultry markets. Do not eat
uncooked or under-cooked poultry or poultry products, including food with
uncooked poultry blood.
As with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important preventive
practices is careful and frequent hand washing. Cleaning your hands often,
using either soap and water or waterless, alcohol-based hand rubs, removes
potentially infectious materials from your skin and helps prevent disease
transmission. CDC does not recommend the routine use of masks or other
personal protective equipment while in public areas. When preparing food:
Separate raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use the same
chopping board or the same knife for preparing raw meat and cooked or
ready-to-eat foods. Do not handle either raw or cooked foods without
washing your hands in between. Do not place cooked meat back on the same
plate or surface it was on before it was cooked.
All foods from poultry should be cooked thoroughly, including eggs. Egg
yolks should not be runny or liquid. Because influenza viruses are
destroyed by heat, the cooking temperature for poultry meat should reach 70
degrees C (158 degrees F). Wash egg shells in soapy water before handling
and cooking, and wash your hands afterwards. Do not use raw or soft-boiled
eggs in foods that will not be cooked. After handling raw poultry or eggs,
wash your hands and all surfaces and utensils thoroughly with soap and
water. If you believe you might have been exposed to avian influenza, take
the following precautions:
Monitor your health for 10 days. If you become ill with fever, difficulty
breathing, cough, or any illness during this period, consult a health-care
provider. Before you visit a health-care setting, tell the provider about
your symptoms and that you might have been exposed to avian influenza.
The U.S. embassy or consulate also can provide names and addresses of local
physicians. Do not travel while sick, and limit your contact with others as
much as possible to help prevent the spread of any infectious illness.
