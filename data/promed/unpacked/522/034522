Health experts warn newcomers to Pilbarra of deadly mosquito virus
------------------------------------------------------------------
Flooding in Western Australia (WA)'s Pilbara has spawned a potentially
deadly mosquito-borne virus that authorities warn is particularly
dangerous to newcomers to the region. The WA Health Department says
Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE) has spread south from the Kimberley,
where it caused a death last year [2008], to areas of the Pilbara
affected by weeks of flooding.

Medical entomologist Michael Lindsay said sentinel chicken flocks in
the Pilbara, which were monitored to detect activity of the virus, had
shown [serological] evidence of MVE virus infection. "We expected this
would be the case with the very heavy rains and associated mosquito
breeding that's gone on," Dr Lindsay said.

Initial symptoms of the virus include fever, drowsiness, headache,
stiff neck, nausea and dizziness. "In severe cases, people may
experience fits, lapse into a coma and may be left with permanent
brain damage, or die," Dr Lindsay said. He said a fatal case was
reported in the north-east Kimberley last year, but Kimberley
residents of more than 3 years usually developed immunity to the virus.

"MVE is actually quite common (in the Kimberley) ... but it's not so
common in the Pilbara," Dr Lindsay said. "People that have lived in
the Kimberley for a number of years are likely to have been affected
and not got sick. When we say it's a rare disease, it's one of these
viruses that [infect] people commonly but its very rare that it
actually causes any illness. When it does cause illness, that illness
can be very severe or even fatal."

Newcomers to the regions, including babies, young children, tourists
or new workers, were most at risk of getting MVE, Dr Lindsay said.
"In young children, fever might be the only early sign, so parents
should see their doctor if concerned and particularly if their child
is drowsy, floppy, irritable, feeding poorly or is generally distressed."

More than 25 cases of the milder Ross River, Kunjin and Barmah Forest
diseases had been reported in the Kimberley and Pilbara this year
[2009]. There is no specific cure or vaccine for MVE or any of the
other viruses. People do not need to alter their plans to visit the
Kimberley or Pilbara, but should employ all means to avoid being
bitten by mosquitoes, Dr Lindsay said.

[According to the the Australian Government Department of Health
and Aging Factsheet: "Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is a
flavivirus. It has the capacity to cause severe human disease, with
encephalitis being the most notable clinical feature. MVEV was 1st
isolated from patients who died from encephalitis in the Murray
Valley in Victoria and South Australia in 1951. It was previously
included as one of the causative agents in the disease called
Australian encephalitis, which also included disease caused by Kunjin
virus, another flavivirus. MVEV is now recognised as causing the
disease Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE).

MVEV can commonly infect humans without producing apparent disease
(subclinical infection), or it may cause a comparatively mild disease
with features such as fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. In a small
percentage of all people infected, mild disease may be a prodrome to
disease progression and involvement of the central nervous system,
causing meningitis, or in the worst scenario, encephalitis of variable
severity. Signs of brain dysfunction, such as drowsiness, confusion,
having fits, weakness, or ataxia, indicate the onset of encephalitis.

Infection is confirmed by a significant rise in antibody titre to the
virus in 2 blood specimens taken 7 to 10 days apart. Sera for
diagnosis should be sent to the specialist diagnostic laboratories. A
diagnosis of MVEV disease should be considered in any patient who
presents with encephalitis or central nervous system symptoms and who
has been in the MVEV endemic area within the incubation period of the
disease, especially in the period between November and July.

MVEV is endemic (always present) in northern Australia (Western
Australia and the top end of the Northern Territory). In nature MVEV
is amplified in bird-mosquito-bird cycles and humans become infected
if bitten by infected mosquitoes. MVEV activity increases after heavy
rainfall and flooding. In northern Australia sporadic cases or small
outbreaks of MVE occur every few years, usually during the wet season.

There have been 7 major outbreaks of MVE in Australia since 1917. The
last was in 1974 when 58 cases were reported from all mainland
states. Since 1974 nearly all cases of MVE have occurred in north of
Western Australia and the Northern Territory, with occasional cases
in Queensland, central Australia and central regions of Western
Australia. Serological studies show that only 1 in 800-1000 of people
infected develop clinical disease. Of these 25 percent have died and
a further 25-50 percent have been left with permanent neurological damage.

MVEV is thought to move from endemic areas in northern Australia to
epidemic areas by the movement of infected native birds or infected
wind-blown mosquitoes. However, there is also evidence that the virus
is able to survive in these new areas for at least one or 2 seasons,
possibly within mosquito eggs or by other unidentified mechanisms.
MVEV activity occurs only occasionally in south-eastern Australia,
usually after heavy rains and flooding in northern and central
Australia, and it is likely that these epidemics have also resulted
from reintroduction of the virus. The primary hosts of MVEV are water
birds. Ardeiformes (herons), particularly the Rufous Night-heron, and
the Pelicaniformes (cormorants / darters) are the most commonly
infected. Mode of Transmission The primary mosquito vector during
epidemics is Cx. annulirostris. Other mosquitoes such as _Cx.
australicus_ and some _Ochlerotatus species_ may be involved in other
aspects of MVEV ecology."
