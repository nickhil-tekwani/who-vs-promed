The Health Department in West Australia says there is a sharp
increase in the mosquito-borne viral infection dengue fever in people
returning from Indonesia.

WA Health says last year [2007], 54 West Australians contracted the
disease, almost 4 times the usual number, and almost 60 percent of
people infected in the last 13 months had travelled to Indonesia, in
the main Bali; 16 cases were reported in January this year [2008].

Dr. Gary Dowse, the acting Director of Communicable Disease Control,
says while most of those infected had travelled to Bali, people
travelling to Thailand, Singapore, India, Viet Nam, the Philippines
or anywhere in South-East Asia should take precautions.

Dr. Dowse says dengue fever can be a debilitating illness, and 20
percent or so of their cases have needed hospital treatment; he says
dengue fever is not an insignificant illness.

In far north Queensland, the Mossman and Port Douglas regions are
also on high alert for dengue, with 16 confirmed cases up to 13 Mar 2008.

As this outbreak is a dengue type 3 outbreak, Queensland Health's
Tropical Population Health Unit says the outbreak poses a serious
health risk to anyone in Mossman or Port Douglas who has had dengue before.

Port Douglas and Mossman residents are being urged to take immediate
steps to prevent being bitten, and Queensland Health is working with
local and community councils to manage the outbreak according to the
Dengue Fever Management Plan.

The plan includes disease surveillance, mosquito surveillance and
control, and education.

The Tropical Population Health Network relies on general
practitioners, emergency department doctors and laboratories to
notify them of possible cases of dengue and say any delay in
notification can mean the difference between a small and a large
dengue outbreak.

[The arrival of dengue virus infected individuals in areas where
there are significant populations of _Aedes aegypti_ vectors presents
a real risk of initiation of a local outbreak. The measures being
taken by Australian health authorities to avoid such an outbreak in
Queensland are very prudent. A map of Australia showing the states,

The number of dengue cases in Yogyakarta up to mid-March 2008 has
continued to increase, with some 64 sufferers now being treated at
the Regional General Hospital (RSUD), a hospital official said.

The number of people in Yogyakarta, Bantul and Sleman districts
infected with dengue had increased from 14 in January 2008 to 39 in
February 2008, RSUD chief for public service Agus Sudrajat said here
Wednesday [19 Mar 2008].

The RSUD currently had a sufficient stock of blood components, drugs,
as well as intravenous fluids to treat patients, Sudrajat said.

He guaranteed poor people from Yogyakarta and environs seeking
treatment for dengue at RSUD would not have to pay anything.

"The treatment fees are covered by the Yogyakarta government as well
as the Yogyakarta Social Prosperity Insurance office (Jamkesos),"
Sudrajat said.

Meanwhile, Yogyakarta Red Cross chief Adi Heru Husodo said the dengue
pandemic had depleted its blood component stocks.

"Yogyakarta needs an average of 4500 pouches of blood per month, but
we now only have 2500 pouches in stock," Husodo said.

To replenish its stock, the Yogyakarta Red Cross had requested blood
supplies from other regions including Magelang, Purworejo (Central
Java), and Ngawi (East Java) as well as Bandung, he said.

Sudrajat said blood stocks would be processed into thrombosite blood
[?platelets - Mod.MPP] only after receiving a request from a hospital.

An outbreak of dengue has killed at least 47 people and perhaps twice
that in Rio de Janeiro state this year, officials said Thursday [20
Mar 2008], announcing a hot spot in a hemispheric outbreak that
sickened nearly one million people in 2007.

State officials said 51 cases are being reported every hour as the
outbreak strains public hospitals' capacity.

"What we see today in Rio de Janeiro is a catastrophe," said Edmilson
Migovski, a professor of infectious diseases at the Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro. "The death toll is rising because the
virus is becoming more virulent, and at the same time, people who
were infected once are getting infected again."

Brazil had more than half of the 900 782 cases of dengue in the
Americas last year [2007], according to the Pan American Health
Organization. Of the hemisphere's 317 deaths, 158 came in Brazil,
including 31 in Rio state.

But while federal officials say overall numbers were down in early
2008, they have jumped in Rio state. State officials say dengue has
already killed 47 people and is suspected of killing another 49,
whose deaths are under investigation. The state, which has 16 million
inhabitants, has seen more than 32 000 dengue cases this year [2008],
officials said.

"I am treating it as an epidemic because the number of cases is
extremely high," state Health Secretary Sergio Cortes said.

Mr. Migovski told the Associated Press that the problem may actually
be worse: "An emergency room doctor who has to attend 40 or 50
patients in a morning is not going to be able to inform officials
about all the cases."

Health officials across the Americas are trying to coordinate their
fight against dengue, which has steadily gained strength since the early 1980s.

Experts fear the virus could grow deadlier and more widespread, in
part because tourism and migration are circulating 4 different
strains across the Americas.

Officials fight dengue by spraying insecticides and eliminating
puddles of standing water where mosquitoes can breed: in the crevices
of old buildings, on rooftops, inside used tires, in vacant lots and
garbage dumps.

[The state and city of Rio de Janeiro is currently suffering a severe
dengue outbreak. An earlier report in Bloomberg.com dated Fri 21 Mar
2008 forwarded by ProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett indicated that this
month (March 2008) Rio de Janeiro had 2053 dengue cases in a 24-hour
period.

Globo.com reported on Mon 24 Mar 2008 that there were 47 confirmed
dengue deaths, with 3 additional suspected fatal cases currently
under investigation

ProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp forwarded a report indicating that on
19 Mar 2008, Brazil created an office to deal with the dengue
epidemic in Rio de Janeiro in response to this epidemic (Pan American
Health Organization's EID Updates: Emerging and Reemerging Infectious
Diseases, Region of the Americas Vol. 5, No. 8, 21 Mar 2008

In Pernambuco, the rainy season period -- traditionally known for
starting a dangerous cycle of proliferation of mosquitoes -- is just
beginning. Between the months of January and February [2008], 11
cases (and 977 recorded suspected [cases]) of dengue fever were
confirmed. The number is well below the 225 officially recognized
(and 1313 suspected) in the same period of 2007.

The state government has had a stake in the work of prevention and
education through the plan to combat dengue, made over the past year.

Currently, most suspected cases emerged in the metropolitan region of
Recife (comprised of 14 counties) and the cities Carpina, Caruaru,
Calcado and Ipubi within the state.

In 2007, Pernambuco recorded 33 247 suspected cases of dengue. Of
this total, 10 092 were confirmed. Of the 22 suspected [dengue]
deaths investigated, 13 were confirmed due to the disease in the state.
