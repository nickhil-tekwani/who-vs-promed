An outbreak of cholera in controversial camps in Burundi, set up as part of
an army effort against Hutu rebels, has cost at least 48 lives in the last
week and aid workers fear the epidemic could spread quickly. The Burundian
army has forced an estimated 330 000 civilians into more than 50 of the
so-called "regroupment'' camps in the hills surrounding Bujumbura since
September. Aid workers warned an epidemic could strike at any time in the
crowded and often insanitary camps, with food, medicine and shelter in
short supply. "People are going to die like flies because it is
unimaginably dirty and besides that, people don't have enough to eat,''
said Ester Budiriganya of the Burundian Red Cross. The camps were set up in
an effort to counter a six-year-old rebel insurgency that had begun to
threaten the capital itself. "The figures we have show 48 people have died
since Tuesday of last week and we have already registered 200 cases of
cholera in two regroupment camps,'' Jean Rirangira, director general of
Burundi's health services, said on Tuesday. "But that figure could rise
because we have 58 people still in hospital and people are also dying in
their houses (in the sites) without us knowing,'' he told Reuters.
The worst affected camps are Kabezi and Ruziba, which lie just south of the
capital and house around 25 000 and 12 000 people respectively. "There is
a real fear in a couple of the camps of (the epidemic) growing and even
exploding if they don't tackle it quickly,'' said David Rothrock of
Catholic Relief Services, which works in many of the camps.

Seven people have died of cholera and another 60 have been hospitalized on
the breakaway Comoran island of Anjouan in the past week, hospital
officials said on Sunday. Sources on the small Indian Ocean island, which
declared independence from the Comorian federation in 1997, said supplies
of drugs were limited, and they could soon run out. Abdallah Ahmed Allaoui,
director of Anjouan's biggest hospital, said by telephone: "For the time
being we are controlling the situation. But if it does not improve we will
face a serious problem.'' On the adjoining Grande Comore island, more than
100 people died of cholera earlier this year and 8 200 cases were treated
before the outbreak was brought under control.

Since the beginning of November, 74 cases of cholera and 4 deaths have been
reported in the areas of Kinshasa worst affected by current flooding of the
Congo river and its tributaries. Investigations by the Ministry of Health
with the collaboration of WHO are in progress and preventive and control
measures are being implemented. Rising water levels have caused breakdowns
in the water-supply system, resulting in a significant risk of
contamination.

A month into the rainy season, cholera cases are on the increase in Malawi.
According to documents from the Ministry of Health and Population, cholera
cases have hit almost all corners of the country. In the capital of
Lilongwe, District Health Officer Edward Dzanjalimodzi said as of Friday he
had recorded at least 17 cholera cases from the city and 52 from outlying
areas. "Four of these patients have since died," he said. Blantyre has also
been hit by the outbreak. At Blantyre's main referrals Queen Elizabeth
Central Hospital, Administrator Amin Mkungula said although he does not
have clear figures, the hospital is treating several cases of cholera every
day. "We are referring cholera cases back to other dispensaries to avoid
congestion here," he said.
Mkungula blamed the outbreak on unsanitary
conditions of public health institutions, saying the spread of the disease
is made easy with these conditions. The Health Ministry last week issued a
statement calling on the public to avoid unhygienic practices. It said
cholera cases were on the rise in the country.

At least 17 persons have died of cholera in northern Zimbabwe in the past

of the residents' drinking water. More than 300 people have since been

to the ministry of health to declare cholera a national disaster. "We have
the affected persons in two cholera camps, and are closely monitoring the

Parts of Kansas are facing an outbreak of shigellosis, a bacterial
infection transmitted by people not washing their hands after using the
restroom.
Several counties are affected. Cherokee County has reported 18
confirmed cases of shigellosis since September. Pratt County has had 10
cases, Ford County has had 5. Haskell and Finney Counties have both seen
a few confirmed or suspected cases of shigellosis. To control the outbreak,
health officials are offering these tips on washing your hands after using
the restroom: Use soap and warm running water Wash vigorously for 20
seconds Wash your wrists, back of hands, between the fingers and
fingernails Rinse well dry with a paper towel. Also, use that towel to turn
off the water faucet.
Health officials also say that children with diarrhea
should be removed from daycare and school, and anyone involved with food
preparation should not touch any food with bare hands.

An outbreak of intestinal infection was registered in Pirovy Gorodishi,
Vyaznikovo district of the Vladimir region. [The Vladimir region is the
eastern region adjacent to the Moscow region]. Deputy chief doctor of the
regional Sanitary and Epidemiological service Vladimir Burenkov told
Itar-Tass that over 20 people, including 10 children, have been taken ill.
Doctors think that the infection was caused by the pollution of the
drinking water by waste water leakage. Vyaznikovo district administration
head Boris Avruisky said urgent measures are being taken to fix the
waste-water system. Meanwhile the school and the kindergarten have been shut
down in Pirovy Gordishi.
