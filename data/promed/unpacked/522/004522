Avian Influenza in East Asia - Cumulative Number of Cases - WHO Update 18
---------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 19 May 2005WHO is updating its table showing cumulative numbers
of human cases of H5N1 avian influenza broken down according to phases in
the outbreak, which began in December 2003. [The Table "Cumulative Number
of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO" is
shown below and can be can be accessed at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_05_19/en/index.html>].
Numbers for Viet Nam, where the vast majority of recent cases have
occurred, have been amended in line with case counts provided by the
Ministry of Health during late April and May 2005. Since the 3rd wave of
infection began in Viet Nam in mid-December 2004, 49 cases have been
reported. Of these cases, 17 were fatal. The most recent case was reported
to the Ministry on 17 Apr 2005.
WHO has asked the Ministry of Health in Viet Nam to supplement the numbers
with data on individual cases. Rapid field investigation of new cases,
especially when these occur in clusters, remains essential to assess
possible changes in transmission patterns that could indicate improved
pandemic potential of the virus.
Since January 2004, when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza were first
reported in the current outbreak, 97 cases and 53 deaths have been reported
in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia. Viet Nam, with 76 cases and 37 deaths,
has been the most severely affected country, followed by Thailand, with 17
cases and 12 deaths, and Cambodia, with 4 cases and 4 deaths.
