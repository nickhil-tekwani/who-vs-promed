A 2nd victim of the tickborne viral infection SFTS [severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome] was confirmed on Thursday [30 May 2013] by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "A 73 year old man who ran a cattle farm in Jeju died on 16 May 2013, and we concluded that the cause of death was severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)," the KCDC said, adding that he also owned an orchard and often suffered from tick bites.

This is the 2nd victim of the virus after it was confirmed that a 63 year old woman died of SFTS in Gangwon Province early this week.

[2] 3rd suspected death

A 69 year old man who died this week in the southern port city of Busan may have been the 3rd victim to fall prey to a tickborne virus in the country in recent weeks, although the cause of death is still being investigated.

Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, the medical center to which the man was admitted, said he suffered from a high fever and indigestion before he died of septicaemia. The hospital has reported the case to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying the patient might have been infected with the tickborne virus known as SFTS, or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.

Two people have died from the virus in Korea over the past month or so.

[The 1st report confirms that the 2nd suspected case, a 73 year old farmer, did die as a consequence of tickborne SFTS virus infection. The 2nd report indicates that a 3rd fatality, a 69 year old man, is suspected also to have died as consequence of SFTS virus infection. It is likely that SFTS virus, a bunyavirus, is widespread in ticks in the Korean peninsula. - Mod.CP
