Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: One dead grey heron (_Ardea cinereal_) was found in Guandu Park in Taipei City by the staff of the Taipei City Animal Protection Office (APO) and was sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) on [20 Mar 2019]. H5N2 subtype HPAI was detected and confirmed by the AHRI in the evening of [22 Mar 2019]. The APO disinfected the neighboring areas of the spot where the grey heron was found and has completed clinical examination and sampling of all poultry farms (7 chicken farms) within a 3-km radius of the spot. All chickens in the 7 farms are clinically healthy. They are under intensified surveillance for 3 months. If any positive farms are detected from the intensified surveillance, they will be included in the HPAI reports for poultry.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

[Since 2015 to date, Taiwan continues to have an active event associated with HPAI H5N2. The situation for that event is as follows:

HPAI H5N2: Event started in January 2015; 873 outbreaks reported, and the event is still continuing. According to the latest follow-up report No. 127 on 29 Mar 2019, 4 outbreaks were also reported in Taipei City; the epidemiological comments reported that: "Samples from Taipei City were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 subtype was confirmed by AHRI. The sampling spots in Taipei City were disinfected. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3-km radius of the sampling spot are under intensified surveillance for 3 months. Suspected signs were observed in poultry carcasses during post-mortem inspection in one abattoir in Taipei City. Samples were sent to the AHRI for diagnosis. H5N2 subtype HPAI was confirmed by the AHRI. The carcasses were destroyed, and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted in the abattoir. After tracing back to the farm of origin, any positive results will be included in follow-up reports." See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=29964.

See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16936.

There is a high likelihood that this current outbreak in wild birds is related to the same HPAI H5N2 event. - Mod.CRD
