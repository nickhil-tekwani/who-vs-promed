Wisconsin turkey farm reports 3rd case of bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
Dive brief
----------
- A Jennie-O Turkey Store operation in Barron, [Barron County],Wisconsin, discovered traces of a low-pathogenic bird flu strain, according to Food Processing [http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2017/jennie-o-farm-in-wisconsin-discovers-milder-bird-flu-strain/].
- Hormel Foods, which owns Jennie-O, confirmed the H5N2 strain was detected [4 Mar 2017]. According to the US Department of Agriculture, 84 000 birds are on the farm.
- The discovery is the 3rd reported in the US. Highly pathogenic bird flu (HPAI) H7 was detected at a Tennessee chicken farm, and an unrelated low-pathogenic strain was found at another Tennessee poultry operation.

Dive insight
------------
The turkey farm found low-pathogenic strains of the virus, which the USDA notes do not spread as quickly as the more deadly variety. However, this type of strain can mutate into the more deadly virus if not closely watched.

Although this is the 3rd case of bird flu detected in the United States in the past 2 weeks, officials said that none of the incidents are related.

This could be a sign that testing has improved, since they were all so quickly isolated and identified. But that's probably not going to make consumers feel any better about the state of the industry. However, 3 different active strains of bird flu doesn't mean that US birds are in bad shape. Bird flu is often carried by wild birds that show no signs. The virus is spread easily, through any secretion from an infected animal. Those secretions -- like saliva -- can also contaminate the dirt in a pen, helping the virus to spread through a single coop quickly.

With no signs of infection spreading, there's no danger yet of any shortages of eggs or poultry. As long as there isn't an outbreak like the one from 2015, which cost American egg farmers more than USD 1 billion, the market should stay fairly normal.

[It should be noted that "Hormel Foods, which owns Jennie-O, confirmed the H5N2 strain was detected [4 Mar 2017]." Hormel Foods does not have the authority to confirm the strain, but more likely this was through official channels with the USDA and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory.

While low pathogenic avian influenza can mutate into highly pathogenic strains, let's hope this is not the case in this, or any of the other LPAI situations.

"Biosecurity of the premises" will be the primary emphasis for some time to come in discussions of poultry production. Biosecurity is more than clean feet, it may also mean making sure that workers do not have birds of their own, and have not come into contact with wild birds. It may mean washing trucks before allowing them onto the property. Of course, it implies extra cost that will likely be passed to the producer, but no one wants a repeat of the situation in 2015. - Mod.TG
