Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), which usually surfaces during the
months of April & May every year, has reportedly made its appearance
in several parts of the region this month, sending a wave of panic
among the people.
According to reports, dead bodies of several monkeys have been found
in Chapakhanda, Nagoda and Panchela villages. Some of the residents
of these villages are suffering from fever, suspected to be caused by
KFD virus.
Health officials say the presence of KFD would be determined only
after [lab tests on sick people]. Five people of the region died
of KFD last year.
According to reports, the vaccine for the disease is not available at
the local primary health centres. The people have urged the State
government to ensure immediate supply of the vaccines.
