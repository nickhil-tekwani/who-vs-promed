A woman suspected of mailing a package containing the poison ricin to the White House is now expected to appear in a New York court [Tue 22 Sep 2020], following her arrest at the U.S.-Canada border, authorities said.

The suspect was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the Peace Bridge border crossing near Buffalo on [Sun 20 Sep 2020] and is expected to face federal charges in connection with the package -which was intercepted in the past week-, a law enforcement official said. The letter is believed to have been mailed from Canada.

An earlier court appearance, originally scheduled for [Mon 21 Sep 2020], is now set to take place at 2 p.m. [Tue 22 Sep 2020].

In a weekend statement, the FBI described the missive as "a suspicious letter received at a U.S. government mail facility." Mail addressed to the White House is screened at an off-site location. Ricin, a poison drawn from the husks of castor beans, has surfaced in other plots targeting President Donald Trump, President Barack Obama and other officials. According to the Centers for Disease Control, exposure to ricin through inhalation, ingestion or injection can lead to death.

In 2018, a federal grand jury returned a 7-count indictment against a Utah man, alleging that he threatened Trump and other administration officials in letters, some of which contained the natural ingredients used to make ricin. In that case, a series of suspicious letters were addressed to Trump, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel and others.

In 2001, following the 9/11 attacks, another form of bio-terrorism shook the country when letters containing anthrax were sent to congressional and media offices. Those attacks killed 5 people and sickened more than a dozen others.

Ricin is back in the news with reports that envelopes suspected of containing the poison were sent to the White House and top defense officials. A preliminary analysis showed the substance was castor seeds from which ricin is derived, the Pentagon confirmed [Wed 3 Oct 2018]. The FBI was continuing to investigate. A letter addressed to President Donald Trump at the White House was intercepted by the Secret Service, authorities said. Letters to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Navy Admiral John Richardson were seized at a Defense Department mail facility before reaching their targets, the Pentagon said. A white, powdery substance sent [Tue 2 Oct 2018] to the Houston campaign headquarters of Sen. Ted Cruz, however, turned out to be a false alarm. The Houston Fire Department evacuated the floor in a Texas high-rise where Cruz's officers are located but later said tests on the powdery substance there were negative for the poison.

Weaponizing ricin to attack politicians is not new. In 2014, actress Shannon Guess Richardson was sentenced to 18 years in prison for sending ricin-tainted letters to then-President Barack Obama and then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

What is ricin?
--------------
Ricin is a poison from the husks of castor beans, which are the seeds from the castor oil plant commonly found in nature. Castor oil, a strong laxative, is made by removing the husks and crushing the seeds, which have several other medicinal and manufacturing uses as well. Ricin is part of the waste produced when these products are made.

How deadly is ricin?
--------------------
Weapons-grade ricin is produced in tiny particles that can be inhaled. The smaller the particles the more deadly the poison. It can be in the form of a powder, a mist or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. Unintentional exposure to ricin is highly unlikely, but chewing and swallowing castor beans can release ricin capable of causing injury, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

How does ricin kill?
--------------------
Ricin breaches human cells, preventing them from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this debilitates the entire body, and death may occur.

How are castor seeds turned into weapons-grade ricin?
-----------------------------------------------------
It would take a "deliberate act" to make ricin that poisons people, the CDC says. If made into a partially purified material or refined into a terrorist or warfare agent, ricin could be exposed to people through the air, food or water.

How contagious is a ricin-induced illness?
------------------------------------------
Ricin poisoning is not contagious. Ricin-associated illness cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or clothes, you could become exposed to it.

Has ricin actually been used as a weapon?
-----------------------------------------
The U.S. military experimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent as far back as World War II. Ricin has been linked to the Iraq-Iran war of the 1980s and more recently to terrorist organizations.

Are there any positive uses for ricin?
--------------------------------------
Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

["Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5% to 10% ricin.

Castor oil does not contain ricin. Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need; hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C (176 F).

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, although many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that start within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

Skin and eye exposure: Ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning [may] take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If in suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is to avoid ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated."
