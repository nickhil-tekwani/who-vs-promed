Canada, Fearing nvCJD, Bars More Blood Donors
---------------------------------------------
OTTAWA : Canadians who have spent 6 months or more in France between 1980
and 1996 will not be allowed to donate blood because of fears they might
bring mad cow disease [responsible for new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (nvCJD)in humans to Canada, health officials said on Thursday. The
disease, which slowly destroys the brains of its victims, has caused dozens
[a total of 78 of deaths in the United Kingdom, been identified in France
and has raised fears about food safety throughout Europe. Health Canada
said that the measure was being taken to reduce the risk of transmitting
the human equivalent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).
Last year, Health Canada issued a similar ban on blood donors who had spent
6 months or more in Britain during the same period. There has never been a
confirmed case of the disease in Canada. nvCJD, identified about 5 years
ago, causes dementia, loss of muscle control and coma. It can lie unnoticed
for up to 20 years but usually kills within 12 to 18 months once symptoms
begin.
The department said the European cases had been linked to the consumption
of beef from cattle suffering from the disease. But there has never been a
reported case of transmission of the disease through blood transfusions or
the use of plasma derivatives. But Health Canada said its directive was
based on the best international scientific evidence available and was in
keeping with its policy of taking precautionary measures. About 1 000
people are expected to be affected by the directive, the department said,
adding that regional blood authorities have 3 months to implement the measure.
