Guthenburg
Twenty tons of crayfish tails imported from China have been stopped by the
border control in Guthenburg due to contamination by the _Vibrio cholerae_.
Inger Simon, manager of the local authority for food inspection notes that
the lot cannot be sold in Sweden or the rest of the EU. She says that the
authority is discussing with the Chinese suppliers what to do with the lot.
