Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is transmitted by ticks only which are
not insects but arachnids (ticks are not closer to insects than humans to
fish).

It should be noted that ticks are not insects. Ticks are [in the suborder
Ixodida of the order Parasitiformes.

[Okay, I did not correct the error. Mea culpa! A comment I made was "If
anyone familiar with this episode can let us know the circumstances leading
to the expansion of tick habitat, please do." No one has, but we have
asked a Russian contact to look into it.
As for our grad student Chris Bosio's comment, he is correct, but he could
have come across the hall and told me. Assuming Levin and Brisola
Marcondes already have their degrees on their walls, they have no problem.
