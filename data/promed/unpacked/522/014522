CDC has provided the following information on the ongoing histoplasmosis
outbreak to GeoSentinel for dissemination.
As of 7 p.m Sun 8 Apr 2001, a total of 174 ill students from 23 colleges in
18 US states [have been reported. Most visited Acapulco between 3 Mar and
18 Mar 2001 and most stayed at or visited the Calinda Beach Hotel in
Acapulco. Tissue diagnosis [has been obtained on 2 students: [in one a
transbronchial lung biopsy was positive by silver staining for
histoplasmosis, and one with a positive culture for a mould. [There is
Suggestive serologic evidence of histoplasmosis in several others.
Case Definition:
Any visitor to Acapulco Mexico since 1 Mar 2001 with:
Fever for at least 3 days, and at least one of the following symptoms: dry
cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or headaches.
[Clinicians caring for patients meeting the case definition should first
contact their local public health authorities (state health department in
US) and then inform GeoSentinel by return e-mail.

Federal health officials are investigating more than 200 cases of students
who developed an acute respiratory illness that they suspect is
histoplasmosis. The students are from 37 colleges and universities in 18
states, and nearly all had vacationed in Acapulco in March [2001 and
stayed at or visited the Calinda Beach Hotel there, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The first outbreak was picked up by an alert student-health physician late
last month [March at Villanova, where 29 students got sick about 2 weeks
after returning home.
Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease that primarily affects the lungs and can
be deadly in people with other health problems [particularly in people with
defects in cell-mediated immunity such as occurs in patients with AIDS -
Man.Ed.DS. The fungal spores involved thrive in dirt rich in bird and bat
droppings and can be breathed in when soil is disturbed.
"There was some construction going on around the hotel," said Rana Hajjeh,
a CDC epidemiologist in Atlanta, who is heading the investigation. But she
said it would be premature to conclude the hotel site was the source of the
infection because "the hotel is not the only link that is common." She
said there was also construction near certain bars and nightclubs the
students frequented.
Hajjeh said CDC officials were consulting with Mexico's Ministry of Health,
which is conducting its own investigation. The Calinda Beach Hotel has not
been closed, she said.
While it suspects histoplasmosis, the CDC so far has tentatively confirmed
only one of the more than 200 cases under investigation, Hajjeh said. That
was from a lung biopsy done on a student at Washington University in St.
Louis.
Richard Pacropis, an internal-medicine specialist who directs student
health at Villanova, set off a national alert among college campuses after
he figured out what was likely bringing so many students into his infirmary.
On 28 Mar 2001, a student came in with a high fever, muscle aches, chest
pain, dry coughing and weakness, and she was soon followed by others with
similar symptoms.
"We had 29 students over a 4 to 5 day period," Pacropis said. 6 of them
ended up at Bryn Mawr Hospital, where Pacropis is on staff. In taking
medical histories on the students, he learned that all had spent the 3 Mar
to 11 Mar 2001 spring break in Acapulco. They did not appear to have the
more predictable illnesses, such as flu or mononucleosis. But chest X-rays
revealed [findings consistent with a fungal infection of the lungs.
Pacropis said the sickest students were given a 28-day course of antifungal
medicine. All 29 have recovered.
Pacropis reported the suspected histoplasmosis cases to the Pennsylvania
Health Department, which entered the investigation and alerted the CDC.
