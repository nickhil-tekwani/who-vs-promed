After 8 days fighting for his life, a Venezuelan who entered the country as part of a migrant caravan died of leptospirosis and cardiorespiratory complications in the internal medicine ward of the Gabriela Alvarado Hospital.

On Wednesday afternoon [27 Jul 2022], [a] citizen (43) [years old], originally from [Caracas] Venezuela, died. He had arrived on Honduran soil in the Trojes area, immediately asking for medical assistance. He was admitted to the hospital on 21 Jul 2022, presenting multiple complications.

The deputy director of the care center, Marlon Estrada, reported that "this patient was already admitted with liver and kidney failure, until yesterday [27 Jul 2022] he presented cardiorespiratory complications and died."

"The steps are being taken to be able to repatriate this body or if the Venezuelan embassy does the paperwork with the Honduran government so that it is buried here," explained the doctor. Estrada pointed out that "we think that the body cannot be more than 24 hours because the maintainers are not of the best quality, unless the Public Ministry (MP) provided a space to be able to have the body in better conditions so that it does not...break down."

"According to the information, the Venezuelan came alone in the caravan; at least in the hospital he was alone all this time. Investigations are still being carried out with some of the migrants who arrived in those days because he was going to the United States in the caravan," he said.

The deputy director of the Danlí hospital expanded that "here he was given all the attention he needed; initially it was believed to be a case of yellow fever and he had a final diagnosis of complicated leptospirosis; he had multi-organ failure as a result of the same disease, [and] we are waiting for a response both from the embassy and from the family."

Some communications with the family assure that in their country their relatives live in extreme poverty, and they asked the charity of the Honduran people and the Venezuelan embassy in Honduras to carry out the repatriation of the body.
