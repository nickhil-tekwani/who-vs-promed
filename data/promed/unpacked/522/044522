In an update on the hepatitis A outbreaks of 4 midwestern states battling the viral disease, we look at the numbers in West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.

West Virginia
-------------
Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus [infection]. As of 3 Aug 2018, health officials have reported 791 outbreak cases. While cases have been reported in 2 dozen counties, the bulk of the cases are reported in 2 counties -- Kanawha (416) and Cabell (167). 6 out of 10 people required hospitalization and 2 deaths were reported.

This increase in cases has primarily been among injection and non-injection drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Kentucky
--------
Since 1 Aug 2017 through 24 Jul 2018, Kentucky health officials have identified 1221 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since 1 Aug 2017, primarily among the homeless and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. 687 people required hospitalization and 8 deaths were recorded.

Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

Indiana
-------
Since November 2017, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has been investigating an outbreak of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV). Through 3 Aug 2018, 334 outbreak cases have been reported, with 45 per cent requiring hospitalization and one death. Most of the cases have been reported in the southern counties of the state.

Cases have been infected with HAV strains genetically linked to outbreaks across the USA. Indiana has an average of 20 cases of hepatitis A per 12 month period.

Michigan
--------
Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state. As of 1 Aug 2018, 869 cases were reported with 80 per cent of patients requiring hospitalization. 27 deaths have been reported.

Macomb county, Detroit, Wayne, and Oakland counties have reported the most cases.

[The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically and have left Michigan, the 2nd-highest state for hepatitis A cases, in the dust. As the new reported cases in Michigan have slowed, West Virginia will soon surge past it.

Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs of adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total is in individuals outside the described cohorts. - Mod.LL
