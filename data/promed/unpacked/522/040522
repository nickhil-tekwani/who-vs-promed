The CDC is investigating 2 separate _Listeria_ outbreaks across 18 states involving Fresh Express and Dole-packed salads [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/a1223-Listeria-Outbreak.html].

In the Fresh Express outbreak, 10 people from 8 states are affected by the _Listeria_ strain. All 10 have been hospitalized. One death has been reported as a result of the outbreak. According to interviews with the infected, Fresh Express-packed salads are the presumed origin of this _Listeria_ outbreak. Fresh Express announced on Monday [20 Dec 2021] an official recall of several packaged salad products.

The salad labels include: Fresh Express; Bowl and basket; Giant eagle; Small salad bar; Market side; O Organic; Signature Farms; Simply Nature; Weis Frisk fra Marken; and Wellsley Farms organic.

The outbreak of Dole-packed lettuce is slightly more prevalent, with 16 people infected in 13 states. Twelve people have been hospitalized and 2 deaths have been reported. Investigators found the outbreak strain in 2 packaged salads distributed by Dole. On Wednesday [22 Dec 2021], Dole officially recalled several brands of packaged salads.

[The following is extracted from https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/packaged-salad-mix-12-21/index.html:
"Recalled Food: Packaged salads produced by Dole. Sold under multiple brands: Ahold; Dole; Kroger; Lidl; Little salad bar; Marketside; Naturally better; Nature's promise; and Simply Nature. Products include mixed greens, garden salads, Caesar kits, and many other types of salads in bags or clamshells. "Best if used by" dates from 30 Nov 2021 through 8 Jan 2022. Product lot code begins with the letter "N" or "Y" in the upper right-hand corner of the package. See Dole's recall notice for the full list of recalled salads (https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/dole-fresh-vegetables-announces-voluntary-recall-salads-processed-its-bessemer-city-nc-and-yuma-az). Investigators found the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ in two different packaged salads produced by Dole. Investigators are working to determine if additional products may be contaminated." - Mod.ML]

The CDC advises everyone with these packaged salads to throw them out or return them to the store where they were purchased. CDC has provided a 5-step process for cleaning and disinfecting your refrigerator instead of _Listeria_ outbreaks.

Symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection include headache, confusion, loss of balance, fever and body aches. Pregnant women should be especially careful because of the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.

It should be mentioned that no recent _Listeria_ outbreaks have been reported in Colorado at present.
