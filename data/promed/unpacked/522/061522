With more than 40 cases of mumps now confirmed at the College of Charleston, the school has taken a few new approaches over the past week to contain the outbreak on campus.

Beginning with 3 cases confirmed by officials on 23 Sep [2019], the school's weekly update reported 43 confirmed cases on 14 Nov [2019], a 65% jump from the 26 cases noted a week earlier on 7 Nov [2019].

College of Charleston does require students to have the 3-part MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine that prevents the spread of mumps in most cases, but they are able to request a waiver. Of more than 12 600 student medical records on file, 196 [students] have submitted waivers, the school told the Charleston City Paper in September [2019].

"We will get through this together. In the meantime, every member of our campus community can and should take steps to safeguard themselves and others against mumps," read the 14 Nov [2019] update from College of Charleston president Andrew T. Hsu. Previous dispatches were signed by campus emergency officials.

"We are always evaluating the effectiveness of our various communications and making adjustments as needed," says Ron Menchaca, the college's director of communications. "With this latest update, which included an announcement of a targeted vaccine clinic, the college opted to issue the message directly from the president to differentiate it from previous updates from our emergency management team."

The other new approach, the "targeted vaccine clinic," is specifically geared toward fraternities and sororities but is open to anyone on campus; [it is] scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday [19-20 Nov 2019] this week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Stern Student Center ballroom.

"The targeted vaccine clinic for students involved in fraternity and sorority activities is being held in response to a recommendation from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [SCDHEC] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to known risk factors inherent in this population (living/socializing in close quarters, potential sharing of items that could transfer saliva, etc.)," says Menchaca.

A representative from SCDHEC says that the targeted clinic isn't necessarily for those who have not received the vaccine, but rather for those in at-risk communities to receive a 2nd or 3rd dose in order to maximize their protections against illness.

Along with the climbing number of confirmed mumps cases and the clinic announcement, the school has also started new PSA [public service announcement]-style posts around campus and on social media.

"Don't let mumps ruin your fun. Get vaccinated!" says one of the posts in large block letters above a list of 5 tips for avoiding the contagious disease. Those steps include self-isolating if you feel sick, practicing good hygiene, monitoring your own health, remaining vigilant to those around you, and, topping the list, getting vaccinated.

Those on campus can seek treatment with Student Health Services, located behind the Robert Scott Smalls building near Calhoun Street or at <studenthealth.cofc.edu>.

In any case, many students will likely leave campus over the Thanksgiving holiday, 27-30 Nov [2019]. The last day of exams is [Wed 11 Dec 2019], when students will likely leave again until residence halls re-open on [Sun 5 Jan 2020].

Public Health England (PHE) said it is investigating a number of reports at Toot Hill School in Bingham.

In a statement, head teacher Sandy Paley said they are "working closely" with PHE and advised all parents and staff. She added: "Our 1st priority is always the well-being and health of our students, and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely."

Public Health England has advised anyone who has not received the MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] jab to get themselves vaccinated. The suspected mumps cases come months after hundreds of cases were confirmed among university students in Nottingham and amid a decline nationally in the uptake of childhood vaccinations.

Vanessa MacGregor, a consultant in health protection with PHE, said there has been a rise in suspected mumps cases, with teenagers and young people who have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccination "particularly vulnerable."

"Young adults who have not received the MMR or only received one dose should ensure that they take up the offer of MMR vaccination," she said. "However, it's not just students who are at risk, and we would urge everyone who hasn't received 2 doses of MMR vaccine to do so."

[An earlier report in September 2019 mentions that "Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed 306 cases of mumps across the East Midlands between April and June [2019]. A total of 2028 cases of mumps were confirmed across England during the same 2019 period. That is up from 795 cases confirmed in England during the previous quarter, continuing the increase seen at the start of the year [2019]" (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-49594610).

Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Mumps is most recognisable by the painful swellings in the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive "hamster face" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain, and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.
While mumps is not usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.

A diagnosis can generally be made after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth, and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal. Mumps is spread through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.

A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated.

Spread of infection can be prevented by
- regularly washing your hands with soap;
- using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze; and
- avoiding school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms 1st develop.

The combined MMR vaccine for mumps, measles, and rubella offers protection against mumps infection. The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. - Mod.UBA
