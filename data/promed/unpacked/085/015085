Geisinger and state [Pennsylvania] Health Department investigators still are searching for answers to a pseudomonas bacteria outbreak blamed in the death of 3 infants in Geisinger Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), Geisinger spokesman Joseph Stender said.
The medical center also still is giving expectant mothers expected to deliver before 32 weeks' gestation the option of going to another hospital, Stender said.

Eight newborns were sickened at the hospital by the outbreak. In addition to the 3 who died, 4 were treated and recovered and 1 was still undergoing treatment in recent weeks. Stender was trying to determine late [on Mon 28 Oct 2019] if that was still the case.

The parents of one of the infants who died in September [2019] filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Geisinger on [17 Oct 2019]. [The patient] was born prematurely at the hospital on [24 Sep 2019] and died in the NICU 6 days later. He was the last of 3 newborn infants to die at the hospital following the outbreak, according to attorney Matt Casey, of Philadelphia, who was hired by the infant's parents of Hazle Township, Luzerne County. [The patient] was the 8th newborn to be infected in the hospital's NICU since July [2019], the lawsuit contends. Among the allegations cited in the lawsuit is that Geisinger officials were aware of a trend of infections in early August [2019] but continued to accept premature infants into the NICU for more than a month and did not warn families of the potentially deadly outbreak.

Dr Rosemary Leeming, Geisinger's chief medical officer, said at a [7 Oct 2019] news conference that Geisinger would divert pregnant women likely to deliver at under 32 weeks' gestation to other facilities. Families of infants currently in the unit have the option of transferring their children to a facility in the Geisinger system or an outside facility, hospital officials said.

Three pregnant women expected to deliver before 32 weeks were diverted to Penn State Health Milton S Hershey Medical Center from Geisinger earlier this month [October 2019], Penn State Health spokesman Scott Gilbert confirmed.

[Geisinger Medical Center is a 594-bed hospital that serves as a regional medical center in north-central Pennsylvania with a Level I Adult and a Level II Pediatric Trauma Center; it is located in Danville, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisinger_Medical_Center). Danville is a town of about 6600 residents in Montour County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Pennsylvania). A map showing the location of Danville can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/fSKGExf6J7PRfg899.

The news report above describes an outbreak of pseudomonas infection in newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a hospital in Pennsylvania during August and September 2019. The 3 babies who died were all premature, born before 27 weeks of gestation (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/babies-bacterial-infection-pennsylvania.html). The pathogen, identified as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in other news reports, was not found in water or on any surfaces in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or anywhere else in the hospital (https://wnep.com/2019/10/07/three-infants-died-at-geisinger-medical-center-nicu-from-waterborne-infection/ and https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/babies-bacterial-infection-pennsylvania.html).

Although we are not told if genotyping was done, we could assume a common source outbreak, with 8 cases in a NICU in a relatively short period of time; if the genotype of all the clinical isolates were the same, a common source would be confirmed. We are also not told the clinical manifestations of the pseudomonas infection in the 8 patients, nor the sites (such as blood, sputum, wound, etc) from which this organism was isolated.

_P. aeruginosa_, a Gram negative bacterium commonly occurring in soil and water, is an opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of healthcare-associated infections, especially in premature infants in NICUs. The clinical syndromes that have been described in affected infants include conjunctivitis and endophthalmitis, skin infections, bloodstream infections, meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200009073431004#t=article).

Water is a common source for nosocomial outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ infection and the formation of biofilms on environmental surfaces is well known to cause difficulties in their eradication. However, in some outbreaks, colonized healthcare workers (HCWs) transmitted _P. aeruginosa_ to patients and strict adherence to hand disinfection policies were frequently effective in controlling outbreaks (http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-9-70). One study found that long or artificial fingernails were a risk factor for colonization of the hands of HCWs (https://doi.org/10.1086/501739).

Outbreaks have been traced to a variety of sources including inadequately disinfected or sterilized endoscopes and ventilators, contaminated mattresses, disinfectants, contaminated water supplies, intravenous solutions, and environmental sources such as pools used for physical therapy or hydrotherapy (https://www.isid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ISID_GUIDE_PSEUDOMONAS_AERUGINOSA.pdf).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
