[Choclo hantavirus is endemic in the Azuero peninsula, which includes Herrera and Los Santos provinces. This makes the 4th case of hantavirus infection (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; HPS) in Herrera province so far in 2015. Neither reports of this nor of previous cases indicate which hantavirus is responsible, nor state what specific preventive measures should be taken by people living in this area. Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS. Herrera province is adjacent to Los Santos province, where many cases of Choclo virus infection have occurred.

The preventive measures are elimination of sites attractive to rodents and avoidance of creation of aerosols of materials contaminated with rodent excreta with the virus when cleaning, especially in closed spaces. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
