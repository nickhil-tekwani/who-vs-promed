[According to the Saudi MOH website, with the addition of these 4 newly confirmed cases and 5 deaths reported, there have been a total of 495 laboratory confirmed infections of MERS-CoV including 152 deaths in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 (in prior comments, this moderator has used September 2012 as the start of "reporting" of cases; the actual time of onset of the 1st reported case in Saudi Arabia was in June 2012).

In the above descriptions of newly confirmed cases, 2 were reported as known contacts of confirmed cases and were on home isolation in stable condition, and the other 2 were apparently admitted to a hospital for other health reasons prior to the onset of symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection (although in one instance, there was a 24-hour period between hospitalization for heart disease and onset of symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection). One wonders whether these individuals had been previously identified as contacts of cases and initial laboratory results were negative for MERS-CoV infection. There are so many unknowns -- the natural history of MERS-CoV infection -- what is the true transmission rate amongst close family/household contacts? What is the true symptomatic to asymptomatic infection ratio? What proportion of individuals originally identified as "stable" progress to serious disease requiring ICU (intensive care unit) treatment? How is transmission occurring in hospitals? Is it pure person to person? Fomites?

If this moderator's calculations are correct, with the addition of the cases today (13 May 2014: 4 cases, 5 deaths), globally, there have now been 585 laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals including 179 deaths.

Two of the health care workers who treated a MERS patient in Florida have come down with respiratory symptoms and are being tested to see whether they may have caught the mysterious virus from him, hospital officials say.

In at least one of the cases, it is almost certain not to be MERS; the staffer started showing symptoms just a day after treating the patient, who is the 2nd person to be diagnosed with MERS in the United States.

The incubation period for MERS -- meaning the time it takes from being in contact with someone who is infected to showing the 1st symptoms -- is usually about 5 days.

"We want to be extra cautious," said Dr. Antonio Crespo, infectious disease specialist and chief quality officer for the P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando. "These 2 people were in contact with the patient without a mask."

One of the staffers was treated and sent home, and the other is in a special isolation room at the hospital, like the MERS patient is.

Health care workers who treat patients with the virus are the most likely to become infected themselves, probably because of the close contact.

Crespo said 20 health care workers at 2 hospitals who may have been exposed to the virus are keeping themselves isolated at home and being regularly tested for MERS.

The MERS patient, a 44-year-old health care worker from Saudi Arabia, was visiting family in Orlando when he became ill enough to visit the emergency room on [8 May 2014]. He's been in the hospital since [9 May 2014] and has been kept isolated under special conditions ever since doctors suspected he might have MERS.

Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) is on the rise, especially in Saudi Arabia. It's infected more than 500 people since it was 1st identified in 2012, spread to 16 countries, and killed about a quarter of its victims.

The 1st U.S. patient with MERS, also a health care worker who had been working in Saudi Arabia, has gone home after treatment in an Indiana hospital.

Doctors say the risk to the general public is very low. MERS is not terribly infectious. Studies of those who have become infected show they were usually in close and prolonged contact with a victim. But it's a new virus, and very deadly compared to something like the flu, so doctors want to err on the side of caution.

Health detectives are tracking down everyone who flew on 4 flights with the MERS patient, from Saudi Arabia to London, then to Boston, Atlanta, and Orlando.

The trouble with treating any respiratory virus is they all have similar symptoms: fever, cough, body aches. And people get these viruses all the time. It takes about 2 days to test for something specific like MERS. If MERS is suspected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises hospitals to just act as if it were MERS. So patients are being kept in special isolation rooms with strict hygiene procedures. "When we go and visit the patient -- I went this morning -- I have to wear a special mask called an N-95 (respirator). I have to wear a gown and gloves. Once we get out of the room we dispose of everything," Crespo told reporters.

The MERS patient also visited a 2nd hospital, the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Officials at the P. Phillips Hospital are not precisely sure why -- he didn't go to seek treatment, they say -- but to be extra sure, they've asked 5 hospital staff who were in contact with him to stay home for 14 days, get tested for MERS, and stay away from other people.

But because he did not feel well, the patient didn't travel around the region and mostly stayed home, doctors said. He did not go visit any tourist attractions in Orlando.

Dr. Ken Michaels of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County says hospitals should prepare for cases like this. "I don't think we have seen the last of this," he told reporters. "We are going to see more travel from this part of the world."

With a surge of cases in Saudi Arabia, people are sure to carry the virus on trips with them, Michaels said, something that CDC and World Health Organization officials have also said.

Both of the men who carried MERS to the U.S. worked in hospitals where MERS patients were treated, one in Jeddah, one in Riyadh.

There's no specific treatment for MERS. Patients get what's called supportive care, intravenous fluids, oxygen or a breathing tube if needed, and pain medications.

[Similar articles were submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteurs Mary Marshall and Joseph Dudley.

New information in the above media report is the age and gender of the patient, a 44-year-old male; the fact that the patient presented to 2 different hospitals, one accompanying someone else, the 2nd to seek medical care for himself; that 2 healthcare workers who had contact with this patient are presenting with respiratory symptoms and approximately 20 healthcare workers with known contact with this patient are at home in isolation until the 2-week incubation period is over. Contact with this patient was initially without infection control precautions, so the possibility of transmission to other individuals in the health care environment during these periods is there. Results of laboratory testing on the symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts are still pending.

[3] MERS and PHEIC - opinion piece from the Region
Date: 13 May 2014
From: Jawad Mofleh <jmofleh@yahoo.com> [edited]


MERS virus is member of the coronavirus family that not only affects humans but can affect some animals as well. The virus can have a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic cases, to mild flu, to illness as severe as SARS.

Coronaviruses are infamous for the SARS global epidemic in 2003. MERS, a novel member of this family, was 1st detected in September 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, though later on, it was proven that even before this date, the virus had victims in Jordan, a country neighboring Saudi Arabia.

The World Health Organization has reported 496 cases and around 112 deaths up to 7 May 2014. Countries reporting these cases are Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt, UAE, Yemen, USA, UK, Germany, France, Malaysia and Greece. All cases outside the Arabian Peninsula are related to Arabian cases in one way or another. In July 2013, the World Health Organization announced that the virus is not a public health emergency of international concern [PHEIC] but a serious and great concern.

As reported earlier, countries reported 496 cases till 7 May 2014; the number of cases detected between September 2012 to the end of December 2013 were 176 cases and 74 deaths; during the months of January and February 2014, the number of cases remained low, and only around 26 cases were detected.

We are witnessing a large spike in the disease during April and May 2014, with 290 new cases and 26 deaths. The majority of the cases are being reported from Saudi Arabia with some cases from UAE (Abu Dhabi), Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen and USA. As per a BMJ news item quoting Dr. Ala Alwan, Regional Director of WHO EMR, 3/4ths of the recently reported cases are secondary cases that contracted the disease in a hospital, and only one quarter are primary cases. Health care workers are among infected cases.

Detection of large numbers of cases of MERS in a short time and confined to a small area is a source of concern for this region and also for the world. The EMR region is hosting polio, the disease for which WHO announced a PHEIC on 5 May 2014, and now MERS has become a growing concern for the region.

Though it is still not clear why this sudden increase in the number of MERS cases happened, one can think of the following possible explanations:

1 - The virus has undergone a genetic shift or drift, which enables the virus to transmit from animal to human or human to human more easily than before.

2 - Community transmission is much wider than expected, and once we find a severe case and investigate it, we can detect many other cases attached to it. Hence, probably, we are detecting the tip of the iceberg in some of the settings.

It is impossible to prevent the emergence new pathogens, but on-time detection of novel infections as well as the extension of their spread among humans and animals can prevent further spread, reduce loss of lives, and economical losses.

In the last 2 years, the case definition which has been used for surveillance and case detection paid attention to severe cases (SARS infections) and missed asymptomatic and mild cases and caused further spread of infection. Also, a huge gap and delay in recognition and detection of animal reservoirs caused more spread and infection of more people.

Though we do not understand the exact basic reproductive rate/ratio (R0) of the virus, if we assume that the R0 of MERS is 1-2, we simply missed at least 500-1000 infections in a very optimistic scenario, unless we are sure that all possible contacts of primary cases and contacts of contacts have been investigated. This means that, basically, we are claiming that all individuals involved in one way or another in the chain of infection/transmission have been thoroughly investigated, and no one has bee left behind.

The other question is why only secondary cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia and richer countries in the region (except one case in Yemen) or developed countries? Keeping in mind that probably thousands of individuals are working in cities like Jeddah, Riyadh and UAE and there are regular direct flights from these cities to poorer countries of the region, I believe that health systems in those countries are unable to detect MERS cases because they do not have the capacities to diagnose the virus, and also their surveillance systems do not have the specificity to pick up on the novel viruses. If correct, this delay in detection and diagnosis enhances transmission and spread of the virus, and hence causes a bigger threat for health security. Thus, another PHIEC is coming soon.

[The IHR Emergency Committee met today (13 May 2014) and will be meeting tomorrow, addressing the issue of whether the ongoing MERS-CoV activity in the Arabian Peninsula is a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC). Results of this committee review should be available shortly after the committee meetings and discussions have finished. Major concerns at the international level surround the potential importation of cases to resource poor countries with weak infrastructures, which will be challenged to identify cases early and implement infection control procedures to limit continued transmission of the virus. - Mod.MPP
