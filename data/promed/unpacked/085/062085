Abstract
--------
Anthrax, caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, is a non-contagious infectious disease that affects a wide range of animal species (primarily ruminants) including humans. Due to the often-fatal outcome in humans, quick administration of definitely effective antimicrobials is crucial either as prophylaxis or as a clinical case therapy. In this study, 110 _B. anthracis_ strains, temporally, geographically, and genetically different, isolated during anthrax outbreaks in Italy from 1984 to 2017, were screened using a broth microdilution method to determine their susceptibility to 16 clinically relevant antimicrobial agents. The strains were isolated from various matrices (human, animal, and environmental samples) and were representative of 30 distinct genotypes previously identified by 15-loci multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeats analysis. The antimicrobials tested were gentamicin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, penicillin G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, linezolid, cefotaxime, tetracycline, erythromycin, rifampin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim. All isolates were susceptible to most of the tested antimicrobials, with the exception of trimethoprim for which all of them showed high minimal inhibitory concentration values. An intermediate level of susceptibility was recorded for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, and amoxicillin for treatment of human cases and for post-exposure prophylaxis to anthrax spores, this study shows a high degree of in vitro susceptibility of _B. anthracis_ to many other antimicrobials, suggesting the possibility of an alternative choice for prophylaxis and therapy.

Discussion
----------
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing has a key role in the management of anthrax infections. In this study, a total of 110 _B. anthracis_ strains, isolated in Italy between 1984 and 2017 were studied to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobials. The presence of virulence factors, which were evaluated by PCR, showed that all isolates, except the Sterne vaccine strain, harbored the capC gene (on plasmid pXO2). The pagA, lef, and cya genes (on plasmid pXO1 and encoding PA, LF, and EF, respectively) were not detected in 5 of the tested isolates. However, it appeared that the susceptibility to antimicrobials of isolates lacking plasmids was comparable to those with both pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids.

All isolates were susceptible to most of the tested antimicrobial with the exception of trimethoprim, as expected, for which a high level of resistance was observed, whereas for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime intermediate susceptibility levels were recorded. The results are in agreement with other previously published studies. Moreover, all 30 investigated genotypes showed no difference in antimicrobial susceptibility, probably due to the high genetic homogeneity of _B. anthracis_.

There are few reports on the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of _B. anthracis_. This can be probably explained by the rarity of human anthrax in industrialized and developed countries, where the most of the scientific research is concentrated, by the elaboration of effective control programs over the last 50 years and by efficient therapies with well-known antimicrobials such as amoxicillin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin. The latter are the antibiotics of first choice, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the treatment of anthrax in human cases.

In order to be effective, an antimicrobial treatment should be timely, starting immediately after infection. Healing is possible if you intervene in the initial stages of the disease, and the late administration of antibiotics is often useless. The results in the present study suggest a high degree of in vitro susceptibility of _B. anthracis_ to many antimicrobials. The effective activity of gentamicin, streptomycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, linezolid, tetracycline, erythromycin, and rifampin, on all tested _B. anthracis_ strains demonstrates several appropriate alternative antimicrobials for _B. anthracis_ prophylaxis and/or treatment. All of the tested _B. anthracis_ strains showed intermediate susceptibility to cephems (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) and resistance to trimethoprim. The resistance of _B. anthracis_ to trimethoprim supports a previous report of an intrinsic resistance of _B. anthracis_ to this compound.

The relationship between the indications obtainable from in vitro tests and the real clinical efficacy of an antimicrobial is obviously not absolute and depends on a complex set of factors including the effective in vivo role of the microorganism and the correct modality and timing of administration of the antimicrobial, as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the antimicrobial.

Interestingly, in this study, we demonstrated that the _B. anthracis_ isolates, belonging to different genotypes and isolated from different sources over a long period (1984-2017) showed the same levels of susceptibility to the tested antimicrobials. Further monitoring of the antibiotic susceptibility of _B. anthracis_ is important for the identification of resistant clones and for choosing the best therapeutic strategy when an anthrax outbreak occurs.

[A very interesting paper in many ways, but especially that there was no direction in the antibiotic resistance when it was found, and that only trimethoprim was an antibiotic that the majority of these 110 strains were resistant to. As members assemble culture archives, antibiotic surveillance is something necessary, easy to do, and valuable and useful when done. - Mod.MHJ
