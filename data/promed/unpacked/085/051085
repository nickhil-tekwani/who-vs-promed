Extract
------
Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that can lead to serious complications and death. Although measles elimination (i.e., interruption of year-round endemic transmission) was declared in the United States in 2000, importations of measles cases from endemic areas of the world continue to occur, leading to secondary measles cases and outbreaks in the United States, primarily among unvaccinated persons. To update national measles data in the United States, CDC evaluated cases reported by states from 1 Jan-23 May 2014. A total of 288 confirmed measles cases have been reported to CDC, surpassing the highest reported yearly total of measles cases since elimination (220 cases reported in 2011). 15 outbreaks accounted for 79 percent of cases reported, including the largest outbreak reported in the United States since elimination (138 cases and ongoing). The large number of cases this year [2014] emphasizes the need for health-care providers to have a heightened awareness of the potential for measles in their communities and the importance of vaccination to prevent measles.

Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition. A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting greater than or equal to 3 days, a temperature of greater than or equal to 101 F [greater than or equal to 38.3 C], and cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis) and is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Measles cases are laboratory confirmed if there is detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus nucleic acid from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered imported if at least some of the exposure period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. An outbreak of measles is defined as a chain of transmission of 3 or more confirmed cases.

Patients with reported measles cases this year [2014] have ranged in age from 2 weeks to 65 years; 18 (6 percent) were aged under 12 months, 48 (17 percent) were aged 1-4 years, 71 (25 percent) were aged 5-19 years, and 151 (52 percent) were aged greater than or equal to 20 years. 43 (15 percent) were hospitalized, and complications have included pneumonia (5 patients), hepatitis (one), pancytopenia (one), and thrombocytopenia (one). No cases of encephalitis and no deaths have been reported.

Measles cases have been reported from 18 states and New York City. Most cases were reported from Ohio (138), California (60), and New York City (26). 15 outbreaks have accounted for 227 (79 percent) of the 288 cases. The median outbreak size has been 5 cases (range: 3-138 cases). There is an ongoing outbreak involving 138 cases, occurring primarily among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio.

Of the 288 cases, 280 (97 percent) were associated with importations from at least 18 countries. The source of measles acquisition could not be identified for 8 (3 percent) cases. 45 direct importations (40 U.S. residents returning from abroad and 5 foreign visitors) have been reported. Almost half (22 [49 percent]) of these importations were travelers returning from the Philippines, where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013. Imported cases were also associated with travel from other countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (7 cases), as well as countries in the WHO South-East Asia (8), European (4), Americas (3), and Eastern Mediterranean (one) regions. Measles genotype information was obtained from 103 (36 percent) of the 288 measles cases. Four measles virus genotypes were identified: B3 (67 cases), D9 (23), D8 (12), and H1 (one). [This information is tabulated in detail, and interested readers should access the original report via the source URL to view this information. - Mod.CP]

Most of the 288 measles cases reported this year [2014] have been in persons who were unvaccinated (200 [69 percent]) or who had an unknown vaccination status (58 [20 percent]); 30 (10 percent) were in persons who were vaccinated. Among the 195 U.S. residents who had measles and were unvaccinated, 165 (85 percent) declined vaccination because of religious, philosophical, or personal objections, 11 (6 percent) were missed opportunities for vaccination, and 10 (5 percent) were too young to receive vaccination.

Discussion
----------
Measles elimination has been maintained in the United States since elimination was declared almost 15 years ago. However, approximately 20 million cases of measles occur each year globally, and importations into the United States continue to pose a risk for measles cases and outbreaks among unvaccinated persons. The 288 measles cases reported during 1 Jan-23 May 2014, including an ongoing outbreak involving 138 persons in Ohio, represent the highest number of measles cases reported for that period since 1994. The increase in measles this year [2014] serves as a reminder for health-care providers to be cognizant of the possibility of measles cases occurring in their communities.

Health-care providers should maintain a high suspicion for measles among febrile patients with rash. Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with measles (febrile rash plus cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis), should be asked about recent travel abroad and contact with returning travelers, and their vaccination status should be verified. Measles cases have been initially misdiagnosed as Kawasaki disease, dengue, and scarlet fever, among other diseases, underscoring the importance of considering measles in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible cases. It is important to obtain viral specimens for confirmation and genotyping on any patient when measles is suspected, in addition to serology. Genetic characterization of measles virus can suggest the likely source of an imported virus. Because patients with measles often seek medical care, early recognition of suspected measles cases and implementation of appropriate infection control measures are vital to reduce transmission in health-care settings. Where possible, because of the high transmissibility of measles, patients with suspected measles should be promptly screened before entering waiting rooms and appropriately isolated (i.e., in an airborne isolation room or, if not available, in a separate room with the door closed), or have their office appointments scheduled at the end of the day to prevent exposure of other patients (4). To assist state and local public health departments with rapid investigation and control efforts to limit the spread of disease, suspected measles cases should be reported to local health departments immediately. State health departments should notify CDC about cases of measles within 24 hours of detection.

To date in 2014, a total of 40 importations have been reported among unvaccinated returning U.S. travelers. Among these, 22 acquired measles in the Philippines, where 32 030 measles cases (26 014 suspected cases and 6016 confirmed cases) and 41 measles deaths have been reported from 1 Jan-20 Apr 2014. The large number of importations from the Philippines highlights how importations are related to increases in measles incidence in countries that are common destinations for U.S. travelers. Because measles remains endemic in countries in 5 out of the 6 WHO regions of the world, including India, from where 6 importations have occurred this year [2014], the source of imported cases could be any country where measles continues to circulate. This underscores the importance of ensuring age-appropriate vaccination for all persons before international travel to any region of the world.

Health-care providers should remind persons who plan to travel internationally, including travel to large international events and gatherings (e.g., the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil), of the increased risk for measles, and encourage timely vaccination of all persons aged greater than or equal to 6 months without evidence of measles immunity. One dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for infants aged 6-11 months before travel and 2 doses for persons aged greater than or equal to 12 months, with a minimum interval between doses of 28 days.

In the 3 largest outbreaks of 2014, which account for over a half of all cases this year [2014], transmission occurred after introduction of measles into communities with pockets of persons who were unvaccinated because of philosophical or religious beliefs. Although high population immunity throughout the United States (through maintaining greater than or equal to 90 percent MMR vaccine coverage among children aged 19-35 months and adolescents) prevents spread from most importations (7,8), coverage varies at the local level, and unvaccinated children tend to cluster geographically, increasing the risk for outbreaks (9). Thus, maintaining high measles vaccination coverage is critical to prevent large measles outbreaks in the United States and to protect and limit spread to infants too young to be vaccinated and to persons who cannot be vaccinated because of medical contraindications.

In the United States, routine MMR vaccination is recommended for all children, with the 1st dose given at age 12-15 months and a 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for children and adolescents who have not received 2 appropriately spaced doses. Unless they have other evidence of immunity, adults should receive at least one dose of MMR vaccine, and 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine are recommended for health-care personnel, college students, and international travellers).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations: 1st, underreporting has occurred; 2nd, for a few cases, complete data could not be ascertained (e.g., the source of infection). However, national surveillance is considered adequate to detect measles circulation in the United States in the post-elimination era. These numbers are considered preliminary and are subject to change should additional details become available.

Officials in Pittsburgh have diagnosed another case of measles and now are urging everyone to take extra precautions.

This is the 2nd case of the measles this past month and the 3rd case so far this year [2014]. Measles is highly contagious, and symptoms include a runny nose, watery eyes, a cough and a high fever. After 4 days, a rash starts, but infected people can spread measles even before the tell-tale signs of the rash kick in.

"People with measles are infectious 4 days before the rash starts and 4 days after, so those were places where that person had been during the time he/she would have been infectious," said Allegheny County Health Department Dr. Kristen Mertz.

Now doctors advise everyone that thinks they or a family member might have measles to call their doctor and the health department ahead of time before they show up at the doctor's office.

[ProMED Correspondent Susan Baekeland has indicated that a subsequent report in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on Fri 30 May 2014 has stated that: "This measles case in Allegheny County turns out to be false
[see: http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2014/05/30/Measles-cas/stories/201405300206#ixzz33KNdM5od].

The possible case of the measles reported last weekend has turned out to be a false alarm, according to Allegheny County Health. The person, whom Health Department officials did not identify, tested negative for measles after testing was conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The person had symptoms that were similar to measles, spokesman Guillermo Cole said."

Allegheny County, it seems, will not contribute to those higher numbers with this latest incident. But 2 earlier measles cases were reported in the county: in February and again in May 2014. Those cases were the 1st in the county since 2009. - Mod.CP

A measles outbreak has been reported in Afmadow affecting 72 people, 50 of them children under the age of 5, Somalia's Radio Bar-Kulan reported o Mon 26 May 2014.

Hassan Mursal, director general of Afmadow Hospital, attributed the rise in measles cases to the absence of available vaccinations in the area over the last 2 years.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that measles vaccine coverage in Somalia is less than 30 percent, according to RBC Radio.

Measles outbreaks have been confirmed in Benadir, Lower Jubba, Mudug, Nugal and Galbeed regions since February 2014, and the number of cases reported in the country has jumped from 1200 in the 1st months of 2013 to 2300 in the 1st months of 2014.

"To mitigate outbreak risks, mass measles vaccination campaigns need to be urgently conducted in the entire country," the WHO said.

Delhi has witnessed a spike in measles cases over the last 3 months, with this seen as the 1st such jump in a decade. The spike has prompted the Delhi Health department and civic agencies to conduct the 1st ground survey in slum areas to test both children and adults. With another 10 days to go for the survey, over 4500 suspected measles cases have been found. So far, 450 people have been admitted to the Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital (MVID) under the North Municipal Corporation in the last 3 weeks.

A total of 800 cases of measles have been reported this year [2014], with 363 being reported from MVID hospital between January and March 2014, an official said. Authorities at Delhi's Department of Family Welfare said a preliminary report of the survey has been sent to WHO India experts. From 5-21 May 2014, 90 lakh [a lakh equals 100 000, so 9 million] people have been screened for measles, mostly in congested areas and slums. Half of these are children. According to the report, 4500 suspected cases have been identified, of which 1120 were referred to hospitals and around 450 admitted immediately to MVID as confirmed measles cases. The report stated that 3300 cases were treated at home for complications such as respiratory infections and pneumonia, conditions suspected to be a result of measles.

Dr D K Dewan, director of the Department of Family Welfare, said: "Diagnosed cases of measles are treated only at MVID hospital, since it can spread to other children in routine hospitals. Figures from January to March 2014 at this hospital point to an unusual and unexplained spike in cases this year [2014]. So, we got our field staff to start conducting house-to-house visits, starting with the areas where the initial cases were reported." Dr Dewan said that 90 per cent of high-risk areas -- Sangam Vihar, Mandawali, Mukundpur, Mustafabad and Karawal Nagar -- have been covered. According to health department figures, the capital has recorded 202, 217 and 173 diagnosed cases of measles from January to March in the last 3 years, respectively.

Authorities have started identifying trends from the diagnosed cases this year [2014] to ascertain the possible causes of the sudden spurt. "Most of the children we have confirmed with measles were between 6 and 8 years of age and migrated to Delhi from other states when they were about 2 years old. The measles vaccine has 2 shots, one that is administered after the 9th-12th month after birth, and the 2nd after the 16th month. So, effectively they had missed the immunisation cycle," Dr Dewan said. What is worrying health experts more is the "significant number" of children who were detected with measles despite having been vaccinated. "We have sent blood samples to the National Centre for Disease Control to see if there is any mutation in the virus, which is not being controlled with the vaccine. While every virus has a spurt, the spurt in measles cases this year [2014] has come after 10 years. Routine cycles repeat every 2-3 years. We have also sent a report to the WHO about this," Dr Dewan said.

After children's deaths caused by measles due to incomplete and irregular immunization in the affected villages, the collector directed to lodge FIRs [First Information Reports] against the employees concerned. This action of administration has caused fear and stress among the employees and officers of the district health department.

They also explained in the memorandum that the geographical condition of Jhabua district is very different from the other districts. The villages in which the measles claimed lives of children are on the Gujraat border, and most of the villagers used to go on short-term migration in Gujarat. Due to this, many children used to be left out of immunization.

They further asserted that one ANM [Auxiliary Nurse Midwife] in the health department had to work for 6 to 7 villages, and she has to work according to her available time. According to rule, with a population of 3000, one ANM and one MPW [Male Health Worker] should be posted; but presently in this block, only one ANM is posted for a population of 7-8000. The area-wide situation is more serious, as only one health worker is available to look after an area of 10-15 km in diameter.

Thus, in these circumstances, the action of filing an FIR against the employees is highly unjust, and it has caused widespread anguish among the employees. Therefore, the Medical Officers and Health Workers Union demanded the cancellation.

Measles virus infection has been diagnosed in one of a group of 40 cadets arriving at the Shumkent Training Centre in Southern Kazakhstan from Astana, the capital city. As a consequence, the group has been quarantined and has been confined to the Infectious Diseases Hospital. According to the management of the training centre, the 40 cadets arrived on 12 May 2014, and one already showed symptoms of measles. The quarantine will be maintained until 12 Jun 2014, during which time the students will continue their truing course. During this period, all visits will be prohibited.

As immunity following vaccination is protective for life, it must be concluded that the infected cadet had never been vaccinated previously.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Senior Minister for Health Shahram Khan Tarakai has directed thorough, transparent, and fair investigation into the deaths of 3 children during the ongoing anti-measles campaign in the province. This he said while chairing a meeting of the fact finding committee of technical experts formed to probe the measles vaccine issue here on Friday [30 May 2014], according to a handout. He also directed the officials to furnish a factual and accurate report in the shortest possible time so that the actual causes behind the deaths of the children could be ascertained.

The minister also directed the committee to thoroughly look into different aspects, including the pre-campaign preparations of the health department, the vaccine being used in the campaign, human and technical errors in administering the vaccine, and the medical treatment provided to the children after reaction to the vaccine, and thus come up with a solid and comprehensive report based on actual findings.

Mr Tarakai said that it was of prime importance not only for him but also for his government to ascertain the root causes behind the loss of 3 innocent lives because, if the children had died due to a reaction to the measles vaccine, then those responsible for it would be taken to task.
Mr Tarakai said findings of the committee would be made public through media and nothing would be concealed in that regard. The committee apprised the minister of the progress made so far in the case. Besides secretary health Ghulam Qadir, chairman of the committee Professor Amin Jan, EPI provincial chief and member of the committee Dr Janbaz Afridi, its other members, and WHO representatives attended the meeting.

Since the beginning of the month [May 2014], 47 people, including children and a pregnant woman, have been admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of measles virus infection.

Irina Zubkov, a senior infectious disease specialist, stated that the disease had been brought to the city by people of Roma origin visiting relatives in the city. Most of the patients belong to a single Roma community. Doctors have failed to comment, but it is well-established that vaccination is the appropriate method for controlling the disease.

According to Sergei Kuznetsov, Professor, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Hospital KhNMU, unfortunately, Ukraine is not ready to undertake a vaccination campaign because of inadequate preparedness and the need to purchase appropriate vaccine from other countries. Parents must make their own arrangements.

At the present time, 3 children and 7 adults remain in hospital but are expected to be released in the near future. Experts believe that this outbreak of measles will then have been contained.

More than 500 cases of measles have been reported in Dagestan since the beginning of the year [2014]. Despite a decline in the incidence of measles at the beginning of February 2014, the epidemic situation with regard to measles in the republic remains critical.

During January to May 2014, 526 confirmed cases of measles were registered in the republic, all confirmed by laboratory tests, giving a measles incidence rate of 18.14 per 100 000 population.

Measles is a particular danger for children under one year old who have not yet received vaccination because of their age and to adults who have not been vaccinated and who are at risk of developing more serious disease. As a consequence of the deteriorating situation in Dagestan, a policy of universal vaccination is being introduced. According to an Order of the Government of the Republic of Dagestan, the Ministry of Health will be allocated funds to purchase 150 000 doses of measles vaccine for supplementary immunisation.

Pursuant to the letter of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare, on 9 Apr 2014: "Additional measles immunization" was carried out from 20-25 May 2014 and included pupils, boarding schools, and secondary vocational educational institutions. Immunization was carried out regardless of prior preventive vaccinations. According to Rospotrebnadzor, by 27 May 2014,
47 803 students had been vaccinated at schools, boarding schools, and secondary vocational education institutions, representing 74 percent of the subject children.

Measles is an acute, highly contagious and infectious viral disease, characterized by general malaise, fever, lesions of the mucous membranes of the eyes, respiratory tract, accompanied by a rash. Measles virus is transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person through sneezing, coughing, talking and even breathing. The only measure to prevent this infection is vaccination, A safe, cheap and stable live vaccine is available globally.

Health authorities in the Marshall Islands are on alert following an outbreak of measles on the nearby island of Kosrae, in the Federated States of Micronesia. Two cases were confirmed late last week, both infants, and the fear is that the highly contagious disease could spread to the Marshall Islands, which are linked to Kosrae by airline service.

According to Julia Alfred, the Secretary of Health in Marshall Islands, in the capital Majuro, medical officials are focusing on making sure children are immunised.
