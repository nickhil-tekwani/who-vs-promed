The Department of Veterinary Services says it has contained the anthrax outbreak that was threatening the country's national cattle herd.

The outbreak, which was reported over a month ago, killed 177 cattle. Cases of the disease have been recorded in Bikita, Zvimba, Mahusekwa, Makonde and Marondera, among other areas nationwide. The department's chief director, Josephat Nyika, told the Daly News that the vaccination drive had paid off as no reports of further outbreaks had been received in over 2 weeks now. "The moment we were notified of an outbreak of the disease, the area was quarantined for 30 days following the last case. Anthrax is an acute disease, so usually if you do not record any causality after 7 days, like now it has been over 214 days; it shows that the outbreak has been contained.

"We recorded 177 cattle deaths and we vaccinated 76 201 in several areas to contain the outbreak. Our team has been all over distributing part of the 811 000 doses of the anthrax vaccine we had in stock. We are left with over 100 000 doses that will remain in stock in case of any new outbreaks. But for now we are happy we have not received any new [reports of] cases as yet, which is a milestone and we are monitoring the situation," Nyika said.

Anthrax is a serious disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_, which can be found naturally in soil and can remain alive in contaminated soil for decades [Even though this is possible, survival over 10 years is not every day. - Mod.MHJ]. Zimbabwe usually experiences anthrax outbreaks during the rainy season as rains wash away the top soil, exposing dormant bacteria in the soil. [If that were so they would be washed away also. In fact the dormant spores will germinate and multiply in the root mass of the overlying grazing and having resporulated be available to grazing livestock & wildlife. - Mod.MHJ]

At least 87 people were reported affected as a result of the outbreak.

While Nyika would not comment on the condition of the affected people, referring questions to the Ministry of Health, he said: "We are encouraging the public to refrain from eating meat, especially from animals that would have died on their own. People should eat meat from registered abattoirs." Slaughtering of animals for human consumption is governed by the Public Health Act which requires people to make use of registered abattoirs, but Zimbabwe has numerous reported cases of people who practice home slaughtering, which at times results in cases of human anthrax.

[This is obviously largely a recycle of an official news release. And it is very similar to the report of the 17 Jan 2020; Anthrax - Zimbabwe (07): cattle, human, status countrywide 20200117.6895433. However we should not forget that of the 28 Jan 2020 Anthrax - Zimbabwe (08): (MV) cattle, human, additional cases 20200128.6926936. In this Bikita district development coordinator Mr Bernard Hadzirambwi said the district was still recording cattle deaths despite the ongoing vaccination exercise. Time will tell who was correct, but I would remind members that Mother Nature is illiterate and does not read official government statements. She will do her thing.

Also remember that though anthrax is an infectious disease it is not communicable, though it sometimes appears so. And its incubation periods are a function of the spore exposure dose. Minimal infectious doses have extended incubation periods though most will be subclinical and merely result in seroconversion. And any contaminated soil resulting from this series of animal deaths will present a risk to revisiting animals for at least the next 3 years. So the veterinary service should be planning for annual revaccination before the next 3 anthrax seasons. - Mod.MHJ
