Bulgaria has detected another outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] at a pig breeding farm near the northeastern city of Ruse after the deadly virus was discovered earlier this month [July 2019], the food safety agency said on Wednesday [24 Jul 2019]. That was the 19th case in pigs in farms or backyards.

"Another outbreak was detected at a large industrial farm in the village of Brashl–µn with over 40 000 pigs," said Alexandra Miteva, a senior official for the food safety authority. She said all pigs on the holding would be culled.

The Balkan country had reported on Saturday [20 Jul 2019] the 1st outbreak at an industrial farm, at another pig breeding farm also near Ruse. All pigs at that farm in the village of Nikolovo were culled. Authorities have this week declared a state of emergency in Ruse and another district, Pleven, in northern Bulgaria, where there have been outbreaks among home-raised pigs.

The state of emergency is until [31 Jul 2019] but may have to be extended, the offices of the 2 district governors said. Bulgaria, a European Union member, has also reported around 20 cases of the disease in dead wild boars, in various regions, including border provinces with Romania.

Experts say 500 000 pigs could be culled due to the highly contagious disease that does not, however, affect humans. Bulgaria has mobilized military and police forces to help combat the disease and protect its valuable pig breeding industry. Preventative measures include enhancing traffic control and border points, disinfecting farms and restricting sales of pork and processed meat.

[For the location of Nikolovo in Ruse province of Bulgaria, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/AnN7oTuH5qTf8L4Q8. To view Bulgaria's ASF outbreaks since the beginning of 2019, please go to OIE's interactive ASF world map (data since 1 Jan 2019) at https://tinyurl.com/y58923jb; click on the Balkan area/Bulgaria, zoom in until the required resolution is obtained. By far, most of Bulgaria's ASF outbreaks are found within the oblasts (provinces) Pleven and Ruse, facing Romania. The map illustrates the severity of the ASF situation in several parts of Romania. Note the proximity of infected wild boars, in the provinces Teleorman and Calarasi, to the Bulgarian border.

Bulgaria's last weekly report on its ASF event was submitted 18 Jul 2019; an update is due soon.

As of 18 Jul 2019, the summary of the event was the following:

Total outbreaks = 20 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 93 / 50 / 34 / 59 / 0
Wild boar / 1 / 4 / 4 / 0 / 0

Since the above update, 2 new outbreaks affected commercial pig enterprises in Ruse, facing Romania's southern border. The adjacent Romanian region is suffering severe ASF events in wild boars and domestic swine. - Mod.AS
