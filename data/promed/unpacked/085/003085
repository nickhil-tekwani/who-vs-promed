Fiji has recorded 4 deaths caused by the meningococcal disease so far this year [2018]. This was revealed by the Minister for Health and Medical Services Rosy Akbar in Parliament yesterday [Tue 17 Apr 2018].

Ms. Akbar said the ministry declared a national outbreak of meningococcal C on [20 Mar 2018], after a review was made on the evidence and recommendations by health experts on the National Meningococcal Taskforce.

She added that there have been 46 cases from [1 Jan to 12 Apr 2018]; 22 cases were laboratory confirmed and 24 were either suspected or probable cases with similar symptoms, but not diagnosed by laboratory.

According to her, the Central Division reported 27 cases, Western Division 16 cases, Eastern Division 1 case and Northern Division had 2 cases.

"There have been 4 confirmed meningococcal disease related deaths and 2 suspected from [1 Jan to 12 Apr 2018]," she said. "As of 12 Apr 2018, all cases were in the age groups of less than 19 years. And of these, males account for 63 per cent of cases while females for 37 per cent."

She said the current case number for 2018 includes a cluster of cases reported from Navesau Adventist High School in Ra. Ms. Akbar stated the 1st case was reported on [28 Feb 2018] and so far there had been 10 cases as of [12 Apr 2018], with the latest case reported [19 Apr 2018].

She also added that from the 4th quarter of 2016 to date there had been a significant increase in reported cases of meningococcal disease with 29 cases by the end of the year [2016]. In 2017 there were 48 cases with a total of 7 deaths reported -- including an outbreak at St John's College in Cawaci, Ovalau --, and were reported from January to June 2017 with up to 2 students getting sick within a month. The outbreak was caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_. She added that intervention was taken; the ministry staff visited the college on Ovalau and inspected the school, and antibiotics and vaccination were given to the students [see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Fiji (02): (LM) college, sg C 20170801.5220233. - Mod.ML].
