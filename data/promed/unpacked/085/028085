Foot and Mouth Disease � Turkey � Thrace Region
-----------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
An outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD type
O) was reported in early April 2007 in cattle at
Evrese in Cannakale (Thrace Region � European
part of Turkey). This new outbreak was said to be
due to the unreported movement of cattle from
Adapazari, Sakarya province (where there were 2
outbreaks of FMD). The disease was then spread
locally through the use of common pastures for
grazing and cut feed and also through the visits
of a local private veterinarian (European Commission, 2007).
2. Situation Assessment
The veterinary authorities in Turkey maintain a
programme of routine vaccination against FMD
(serotypes O, A and Asia1) which are endemic in
Anatolia � the Asian part of Turkey. This
outbreak occurred close to earlier outbreaks in
sheep and cattle reported to OIE in early 2007
(OIE, 2007a; OIE, 2007b) and outlined in Defra's
preliminary outbreak assessment (Defra, 2007).
These previous outbreaks occurred in western
Turkey [map available at the above URL. - Mod.AS]
and were caused by FMD types O and A (strain A
Iran 05). The location of this latest outbreak of
FMD Type O in European Turkey is also close to
the borders of the EU member states of Greece and
Bulgaria. This outbreak highlights the potential
risks for the spread of FMD into unaffected areas
in the region through uncontrolled movements of susceptible animals.
3. Conclusion
The likelihood of the introduction of FMD by
legal trade from Turkey to the UK before and
after this outbreak is considered negligible
because imports of susceptible animals and their
products are banned. The likelihood of FMD virus
being introduced by illegal imports remains
present and is difficult to estimate. The
importance of ensuring that enforcement agencies
are vigilant and that a ban on swill feeding is
effectively applied is again emphasised. We do
not intend to carry out and publish a full risk
assessment on this outbreak but will continue to monitor the situation.

[The DEFRA assessment provides a useful summary
of the current FMD situation in Thrace. Readers
are referred to the Turkish report of 28 Feb 2007
(ref 20070301.0726), wherein the source of
infection was claimed to be contact with wild
species, further identified as an infected boar.
It will be interesting to obtain additional
information on this potential source of infection
for livestock, in Turkey as well as in other
Middle-Eastern countries. Swine are known to be
effective propagators of the FMD virus and
significant source for its airborne spread. Wild
boar populations of considerable sizes and
density are believed to be present in several
regional countries. Their possible role as
potential disseminators of the FMD virus in the
region deserves adequate study. - Mod.AS].
