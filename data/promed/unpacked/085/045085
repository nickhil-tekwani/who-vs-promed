The virology center at the Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (FETHA), built by the Ebonyi state government, has successfully treated and discharged 14 Lassa fever patients brought to the centre this year [2019]. Commissioner for Health Dr. Daniel Umezuruike disclosed this during a public health advisory workshop organized by the state Ministry of Health in collaboration with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abakaliki, Ebonyi state capital.

He noted that the disease is currently active in Ebonyi state with a total of 19 confirmed cases with 3 deaths among the cases admitted at the centre.

According to him, the disease ravaged 8 out of the 13 local government areas of the state, which include Abakaliki, Ezza South, Ezza North, Ohaozara, Ebonyi, Izz, Afikpo North, and Ikwo LGAs.

Mr Umezuruike identified symptoms of the virus to include, high grade fever, body pains, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain (sub-sternal), unconsciousness, among others.

"Recent genomic sequencing of the Lassa fever virus in Nigeria shows rodent-to-human transmission is still the main source of infection; therefore, environmental sanitation, especially rodent control, is critical to curtail the spread. Since the current outbreak, the state has intensified its response through enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, and active case [management] in all LGAs by the epidemiology team. Risk communication and sensitization have also been ongoing in all LGAs to increase awareness and promote positive behavioral practices to prevent further spread of the disease."

The commissioner said that a response team from the NCDC and another team from Medicines San Frontiers are currently working with the state team to strengthen the response.

[Lassa fever virus transmission is active currently in Ebonyi state, with 19 confirmed cases and 3 deaths so far this year [2019]. It is encouraging that 14 of these patients have recovered enough to have been discharged from the hospital. Transmission of Lassa fever virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. Community involvement to reduce exposure to the rodent host is a challenge, given that cases have occurred in 8 of the state's 13 local government areas. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.

These rodents can live near or in people's houses.
