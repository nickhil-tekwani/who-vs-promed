The President of French Polynesia has announced that the chikungunya virus has made its appearance on the island of Tahiti.

An investigation was opened after the report of several people with joint pain and fever, sometimes accompanied by skin eruptions [rash].

The analyses confirmed it was chikungunya in 15 cases, mainly in the municipality of Teva I Uta. Further investigations are underway to determine the source and extent of the transmission.

According to a statement from the President, mosquito control measures will be implemented, while the rainy season begins. Chikungunya, like dengue or zika, is a disease [virus] transmitted by the _Anopheles_ mosquito, present in Polynesia [That is not correct. These viruses are not transmitted by _Anopheles_ mosquitoes. They are transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, in Tahiti most likely _Ae. aegypti_. - Mod.TY].

[Tahiti is part of the Society Island archipelago and capital of the collectivity that is French Polynesia. Although ProMED-mail has not received previous reports of chikungunya virus outbreaks on Tahiti, there were cases on New Caledonia in 2011. Given the inter-island movement within French Polynesia, it is not surprising to see chikungunya virus appear on Tahiti, the most populous of these islands, as Zika virus did in 2013. Since there are no commercially available vaccines available yet for chikungunya virus, the only preventive measures are vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
