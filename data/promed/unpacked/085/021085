[From Promed-mail post Avian influenza - Eastern Asia (32) 20040224.0581,
as pointed out below, this moderator's comment was in error. Fowl plague is
indeed the old name for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. They are the
same group of viruses. - Mod.TG]

To the best of my knowledge 'Fowl plague' is one of the old names for a
disease which we now refer to as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The
11th edition of Diseases of Poultry also mentions, among others, various
names such as 'fowl pest', 'Brunswick disease,'and 'fowl disease'. Only in
1981 was the name Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza adopted.

[This moderator wishes to thank Dr. Bolwerk and others for pointing out the
error regarding the names of the diseases. As history has been known to
repeat itself, I hope I shall not eat too much crow on this issue again, as
it will surely be engraved in my mind, henceforth. Â­ Mod.TG]
