Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 5500 / 4612 / 4612 / 888 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 83.85 / 83.85 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Abnormal mortalities were observed in 2 poultry farms in Yunlin County. Samples were sent to the National Laboratory (AHRI) for diagnosis. H5N2 subtype HPAI was confirmed by AHRI. These farms have been put under movement restrictions. All animals on the infected farms have been culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km radius of infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 28 Mar 2015 / Positive
Birds / gene sequencing / 30 Mar 2015 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 1 Apr 2015 / Positive
Birds / gene sequencing / 2 Apr 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Since January 2015 to date, Taiwan has reported 476 outbreaks of HPAI H5N2 (new variant).

Total animals affected as of (14 Apr 2015)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 3 094 102 / 741 643 / 740 221/ 1 133 473 / 0
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017475_20150414_151717.pdf

For many of the outbreaks reported, the total number of animals destroyed is unknown.
The event summary and a updated map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=16936

The morbidity rate of the outbreak in turkeys, described above, was very high (100 percent, all died), compared to 70.4 percent in the geese outbreak. This may express a particular high pathogenicity of the causative agent to this animal species -- or reflect extended diagnosis, allowing continued spread within the flock prior to interference. Previous outbreaks of this HPAI H5N2 virus strain (new variant or "novel strain") which started its circulation in Taiwan early January 2015, affected mainly geese and ducks. It will be interesting to compare the species susceptibility and genetics of the Taiwanese HPAI H5N2 strain with the North American recombinant which has been circulating there since December 2014 and, according to Canadian experts, is of Asian origin (see 20141221.3047300). The new H5 clade 2.3.4.4 has been recently addressed by WHO/OIE/FAO H5 Evolution Working Group (see 20150114.3090250). While there are no reports of H5N2-related illness in humans, as a precautionary measure, public health officials in Canada are monitoring workers who are exposed to affected poultry. It will be interesting to note if such monitoring is being undertaken in Taiwan.

According to information published in the public media, "The country's government has stated that effective in September [2015], it will require that all poultry be raised in enclosed spaces to help stop the spread of the virus." http://poultryproductionnews.blogspot.com/2015/04/avian-influenza-cases-continue-at.html

In 2015 Taiwan has also reported 3 other HPAI outbreaks associated with subtype H5N2 (old variant), subtype H5N3 and subtypeH5N8. These events remain as active.
1. H5N8, start 8 Jan 2015, 1st report 11 Jan 2015, follow-up report No 12, 12 Mar 2015, total 280 outbreaks.

2. H5N2 (old variant), start 6 Jan 2015, 1st report 12 Jan 2015, no follow-up reports, total 1 outbreak.

3. H5N3, start 11 Jan 2015, 1st report 16 Jan 2015, follow-up report No 6 26 Feb 2015, total 25 outbreaks.
