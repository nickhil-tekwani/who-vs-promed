_Phytophthora_ in potatoes has become more aggressive. Clone EU-13 [A2-Blue 13] was already known for being aggressive and difficult to combat. In recent years, 2 new clones have been on the rise in the northwest of Europe: Eu-36 and EU-37 [A2-Dark Green 37]. These clones are supplanting EU-13.

The characteristics that caused these 2 clones to expand has now been researched by Wageningen University & Research [WUR]. Important for the development of _Phytophthora_ [are]: infection efficiency of the spores; growth speed; latent period; size of spots on the leaves; amount of spores created. EU-36 and EU-37 developed more quickly and to a larger extent compared to EU-13. The combination of these characteristics translates into more aggression that could explain why EU-13 has been driven back in the northwest of Europe.

EU-37 is less sensitive to fluazinam [ProMED-mail post 20171029.5412307]. [For] EU-36 and EU-37, no proof has been found that these clones are resistant to other fungicides. However, [they] could [grow] more with very low doses in laboratory experiments compared to EU-13. When disease pressure is high, the new clones will cause a contamination more quickly. Even more alertness [is] important. Dosing and timing of spraying should be even more accurate in the presence of the 2 clones. In 2019, research will have to show whether the combat strategy for these 2 clones should be adjusted.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100% crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Presence of both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen increases the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop.

In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist, and increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge mainly on potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), but recently also on tomato (ProMED-mail post 20180611.5850443). A2-Blue 13 is considered the currently most aggressive strain, with resistances to some widely used fungicides. It creates larger lesions and produces more spores more rapidly and at lower temperatures than other strains. Furthermore, the period between infection and sporulation is only 4.5 days, compared to 6 or 7 days for other strains. It emerged in Europe, then spread to North Africa, India, and China (ProMED-mail post 20130111.1492024); for example, it was found to be responsible for recent outbreaks in southern India (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980).
