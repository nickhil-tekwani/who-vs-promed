One case of a rare, degenerative brain disease has been confirmed in British Columbia [BC]'s Fraser Valley, and a health official says 2 other cases are now suspected. However Paul Van Buynder, chief medical officer for the Fraser Health authority, said late on Friday [14 Jun 2013] that even if the 2 suspected cases end up being Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases, it's not "drastically unusual".

The confirmed case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, was a resident in a long term care home who died a year ago, Van Buynder said. He said the 2 other patients suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are currently in hospital. None of the patients are related, and they all resided in different towns, Van Buynder added. The findings stem from a review officials conducted after they initially believed there were 6 CJD cases in the Fraser Valley, east of Vancouver, over the past year.

Buynder said it's "highly unlikely" that the remaining 3 cases will be confirmed as CJD. Cases can only be confirmed after a sample of brain tissue, taken from the patient post-mortem, is tested at a national laboratory, he said. Before that happens, doctors make an initial diagnosis based on MRI images, blood tested for specific proteins, and an electroencephalogram, a test that measures the brain's activity. Only 30 to 50 cases are reported annually in Canada, and 5 of those cases [would be expected] to occur in BC, he said. "I think the public really need to know that this is probably one or 2 more than I expect, but it's not drastically unusual," said Van Buynder.

"It's not mad cow disease. It has nothing to do with the food chain. Neither the public nor anybody in our hospitals should be worried that they're about to get this nasty disease." Provincial health officer Dr Perry Kendall said CJD causes the rapid onset of dementia leading to a coma, usually within a 6 month time frame, because agents known as prions destroy the brain. One strain has been linked with mad cow disease, but Van Buynder said more than 90 per cent of the cases are sporadic, and health officials don't know their cause, and there is no treatment and no cure. "It's a tragic disease that is rapidly progressing," he said. "It's a degenerative disease of the brain, and usually within 6 months, the afflicted pass away. It's a tragic disease for families, and we just really don't understand it."

[According to the Fraser Valley Regional [FVR] District Administration, the population of the district in 2011 was estimated to be 277 593 (http://www.fvrd.bc.ca/AboutUs/Pages/DistrictStatistics.aspx). Therefore, the occurrence of more than a single case of CJD would be unusual, and 3 cases exceptional, since the incidence of CJD in the population is generally accepted to be about one in one million. The single confirmed case and the 2 suspected cases are clearly not cases of variant CJD, since there is no evidence that the food chain is involved. It would be relevant also to investigate whether blood transfusion is involved in any of these cases. Confirmation of the diagnosis in the 2 suspected cases is awaited. - Mod.CP
