Hundreds of children in different parts of the US have been hospitalized by a mysterious respiratory virus. The virus infection is sweeping the Midwest and has also hit Colorado. CNN reports that one Kansas City [Missouri] hospital has seen up to 30 children a day come in for treatment for the virus [infection], which is similar to a cold, but with worse symptoms. About 15 percent of those children are placed in intensive care. The hospital has seen more than 300 cases so far.

On Friday [5 Sep 2014], a hospital in Illinois starting banning children under the age of 12 in an effort to contain the outbreak, according to Reuters. More than 70 children in Quincy, Illinois, got sick with the virus over Labor Day weekend [30 Aug-1 Sep 2014]. Cases of the virus have also shown up in Ohio, where hospitals in Columbus have seen unusually high numbers of children seeking treatment for respiratory illness, according to The Columbus Dispatch. Doctors have sent out samples to be tested for human enterovirus 68 [HEV68], a rare illness that affects children more than adults. It's not yet clear what the particular virus is in this outbreak.

Clusters of HEV68 have been identified in parts of the US before, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is similar to the rhinoviruses, which causes the common cold. HEV68 symptoms include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, mouth blisters, body and muscle aches, and rash. The virus usually isn't fatal. The virus spreads like the common cold, so to avoid being infected, wash hands frequently and avoid sharing cups and utensils with those who are sick.

A respiratory virus is sending hundreds of children to hospitals in Missouri and possibly throughout the Midwest and beyond, officials say.

The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported now could be "just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases," said Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases. 10 states have contacted the CDC for assistance in investigating clusters of enterovirus [infection] -- Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual. They're actually common. When you have a bad summer cold, often what you have is an enterovirus, he said. The season often hits its peak in September.

The unusual situation now is that there have been so many hospitalisations. The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15 percent of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. In a sign of a possible regional outbreak, Colorado, Illinois, and Ohio are reporting cases with similar symptoms and are awaiting testing results, according to officials and CNN affiliates in those states. "It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented. I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this," said Dr Mary Anne Jackson, the hospital's division director for infectious diseases. The Kansas City hospital treats 90 percent of that area's ill children. Staff members noticed an initial spike on [15 Aug 2014], Jackson said.

"It could have taken off right after school started. Our students start back around [17 Aug 2014], and I think it blew up at that point," Jackson said. "Our peak appears to be between [21 and 30 Aug 2014]. We've seen some leveling of cases at this point."

This particular type of enterovirus -- EV-D68 -- is uncommon, but not novel. It was first identified in the 1960s and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time. But it's possible, Pallansch said, that the relatively low number of reports might be because EV-D68 is hard to identify. EV-D68 was seen last year [2013] in the United States and this year in various parts of the world. Over the years, clusters have been reported in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and various countries including the Philippines, Japan, and the Netherlands.

An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Vaccines for EV-D68 aren't currently available, and there is no specific treatment for infections, the Missouri agency said. "Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment," it said. "Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy." Denver also is seeing a spike in respiratory illnesses resembling the virus, and hospitals have sent specimens for testing to confirm whether it's the same virus, CNN affiliate KUSA said. More than 900 children have gone to Children's Hospital Colorado emergency and urgent care locations since [18 Aug 2014] for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses, including enterovirus and [other] viral infections, hospital spokeswoman Melissa Vizcarra told CNN. Of those, 86 have been sick enough to be admitted to the Aurora facility. And Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children had 5 children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit, KUSA said last week [week of 1 Sep 2014]. In East Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide Children's Hospital saw a 20 percent increase in patients with respiratory illnesses last weekend[6-7 Sep 2014], and Dr Dennis Cunningham said patient samples are being tested to determine whether EV-D68 is behind the spike, CNN affiliate WTTE reported. Elsewhere, Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, reported "recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois," the facility said this week on its Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/HannibalHealth/timeline].

While there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing up to 15 million US infections annually, EV-D68 infections occur less commonly, the Missouri health agency said. Like other enteroviruses, the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people, the agency said. "Unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness, febrile rash illness, or neurologic illness (such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis), EV-D68 has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease," the agency said. Clusters of the virus have struck Asia, Europe, and the United States from 2008 to 2010, and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness, with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation, the health agency said.

[According to the CDC (See: Centers for Disease Prevention and Control "Clusters of Acute Respiratory Illness Associated with Human Enterovirus 68 -- Asia, Europe, and United States, 2008-2010" MMWR Weekly, 30 Sep 2011; 60(38): 1301-4; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6038a1.htm), in recent years, there have been several clusters of respiratory illness associated with human enterovirus 68 (HEV68), including severe disease. HEV68 is a unique enterovirus that shares epidemiologic and biologic features with human rhinoviruses (HRV). First isolated in California in 1962 from 4 children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, HEV68 has been reported infrequently since that time and the full spectrum of illness that it can cause is unknown. Clusters of respiratory illness associated with HEV68 have been described in Asia, Europe, and the United States during the period 2008-2010.

In the United Sates the 1st detailed study was undertaken in Georgia and subsequent detailed analyses in Pennsylvania and Arizona revealed that HEV68 was frequently detected among pediatric admissions for respiratory illness. Abnormal lung examination results and wheezing, particularly new-onset wheezing, were noted. At least half of children with available chest radiographs had infiltrates. Hospitalization lasted a median of 1.5 days, and no deaths were reported. Despite viral testing and blood cultures performed at the Arizona Department of Health Services on patients with specimens available, no pathogen was detected. Nasopharyngeal specimens of 7 patients were sent to CDC for further testing, and HEV68 was identified in 5 of the patients, one of whom also was positive by RT-PCR testing for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.

The role of HEV68 in the current extensive outbreak of respiratory disease affecting children in some locations in the Midwest has still to be determined conclusively. - Mod.CP]
