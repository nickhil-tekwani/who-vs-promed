This is an epidemiological briefing produced to share data useful to other public health investigators. Full technical briefings will continue to be produced when appropriate. For the purposes of this summary, cases refer to confirmed (10 years old and under) and possible (11 to 15 year old) cases -- see case definition in Technical Briefing 3 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acute-hepatitis-technical-briefing). The public health agencies of the 4 nations continue to work with the NHS [National Health Service] to classify reported case-patients who have incomplete laboratory information (referred to as "pending").

Cases in the UK
--------------
As of 13 Jun 2022, there are 260 cases (251 confirmed and 9 possible) cases of acute non-A-E hepatitis with serum transaminases greater than 500 IU/L identified in children aged under 16 years old in the UK, since 1 Jan 2022. Of these, 187 cases (180 confirmed and 7 possible) are resident in England, 32 (all confirmed) in Scotland, 17 (all confirmed) in Wales and 24 (22 confirmed and 2 possible) in Northern Ireland (Figure 1 [see below]). This is the result of an active case-finding investigation starting in April 2022 which identified retrospective as well as prospective cases.

Between 21 Jan 2022 and 13 Jun 2022, 12 children in the UK meeting the case definition have required liver transplantation; no cases resident in the UK have died.

While new cases continue to be identified across the UK, there is an overall decline in the number of new cases reported per week, even allowing for reporting lags. Cases pending classification are usually those in which laboratory testing to rule out known causes of hepatitis has not been completed.

Date not available for 6 cases in England, 3 cases in Northern Ireland and one case in Wales. Week is based on hospitalization date where available, then date of arrival at emergency care department where available, then date of presentation to healthcare.

Associated pathogens
--------------------
Adenovirus remains the most frequently detected potential pathogen in cases. Among 260 UK cases, 241 have been tested for adenovirus, of which 156 (64.7%) had adenovirus detected. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected around the time of admission in 34 of 196 UK cases with available results (17.3%), although in English cases only the proportion positive was lower (9.7%).

Cases in England
----------------
As of 13 Jun 2022, there were 187 (180 confirmed and 7 possible) cases in England. There are no known epidemiologically linked cases in England. A total of 22 potential cases in England are awaiting classification pending further data. Cases are predominantly aged between 3 and 5 years old (99; 52.9%), median age 3 (interquartile range: 2 to 5 years) and 49% are female. The majority are of white ethnicity (142 of 187; 88.2%) where information was available. Nine cases who were resident in England required a liver transplant.

Laboratory data on pathogens reported by the NHS and public health laboratories through SGSS are routinely monitored for changes in trends and statistical exceedances. There has been a marked increase of adenovirus since the end of 2021, apparently driven by adenovirus in faecal samples and in the 1- to 4-year-old age-group, although the number of laboratory diagnoses is now decreasing.

[While this figure is not a curve showing date of onset of symptoms over time, it seems to reflect a contributed downward trend in new cases. No data are shown regarding SARS-CoV-2 serologies reflective of past infection. - Mod.LL

Persons under investigation: children with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While rare, children can still have serious hepatitis, and we do not always know the cause. That is why investigators continue to look at possible causes and investigate.

Numbers of persons under investigation (PUI): 290

PUI does not mean this person is a confirmed case. The states and CDC are looking broadly (including hepatitis cases of unknown origin in children under 10 years of age, since October 2021), so this number may go up or down as CDC and states review medical charts and learn more.

States and jurisdictions reporting at least one person under investigation (41)* as of 15 Jun 2022
(*These may not be recent cases of hepatitis being reported.) [see source URL for map and data table].

States or territories with no reported PUI (all others have possible cases but no numbers given) as "To protect patient privacy, numbers for each state will not be released.": Alaska, American Samoa, District of Columbia, Guam, Iowa, Kansas, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Montana, New Hampshire, North Marianas, Oregon, Palau, South Carolina, Vermont, Virgin Islands, West Virginia, Wyoming.

These data were posted on 15 Jun 2022 and reflect data from 1 Oct 2021. Reported PUIs are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.

[No epicurve or anything like it has been reported for the US data, nor are there substantial data regarding present or past SARS-CoV-2 infection in American children affected. Although CDC is not releasing individual state numbers "to protect patient privacy," individual state numbers do come out. Numbers per state are published by CDC for other infections such as the US nationwide hepatitis A virus outbreak. The etiology or etiologies of this seeming increase in severe liver inflammation remain unclear, although adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 remain in the equation, separately or together. - Mod.LL
