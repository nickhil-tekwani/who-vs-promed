Several newly evolved strains of the disease known as potato virus Y, or PVY, can render potatoes unmarketable and reduce crop yield [but] are particularly difficult to detect with the naked eye. Mark Pavek, Washington State University [WSU]: "In the last 5 years or so, the common PVY-O strain appears to be becoming less common and strains such as PVY-NO and PVY-NTN are becoming more common."

Potato seed [tuber] growers rely on field detection to help their product to be certified as healthy before it is sold to farmers. If symptoms can't be spotted in the field, the disease will spread to healthy plants. Mark Pavek: "Now we have to rely on lab testing." Growers would have to test every single plant - an expensive prospect.

Researchers have developed some varieties that are resistant to PVY, but they are not yet widely adopted, largely because they are relatively new to the industry and processors rely on a wide mix of potato varieties for different purposes. At this point, resistant potato varieties may only fit one niche.

[_Potato virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of the most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber quality. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum, and some other related species. Symptoms vary depending on viral strains and susceptibility level of host cultivars. They may include mottling, distortion, and necrosis of leaves and stems, premature defoliation, tuber necrosis, and plant death, or no symptoms at all.

PVY is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, with _Myzus persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected planting material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and other potato viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use of resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful.

The PVY isolates reported so far have been classified in 3 main strains, PVY-N, PVY-O, and PVY-C, according to leaf symptoms induced on the experimental host _Nicotiana tabacum_. PVY-N isolates have been divided into 2 groups, one causing mild mosaic in most potato cultivars, while the other induces "potato tuber necrotic ring disease" and severe chlorotic mosaic of leaves. It is referred to as PVY-NTN (necrotic group [N] and inducing tuber necrosis [TN]) and is the most virulent strain of PVY. It has been suggested that PVY-NTN isolates may have resulted from natural combination of local strains of PVY-N with PVY-O or PVY-C.

PVY-O isolates induce severe symptoms on potato leaves, such as crinkling, leaf drop, or severe necrotic mosaic. PVY-C isolates causes stipple streak on potato cultivars carrying the Nc resistance gene. Some isolates determined serologically as PVY-O and inducing less severe symptoms in potato than the PVY-N isolates have been called PVY-N-Wilga isolates. PVY-N:O indicates a recombinant strain with PVY-N and PVY-O components.

The emergence of new and recombinant PVY strains is being reported from different areas (examples in ProMED-mail posts listed below). Numbers of co-infecting strains will build up with every crop cycle if PVY infected seed tubers are used, especially if these are moved to different areas where the virus strains they carry may combine with local PVY populations. PVY strains may also occur in (possibly synergistic) co-infection with others of the around 40 known potato viruses, invariably leading to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production in many countries worldwide.
