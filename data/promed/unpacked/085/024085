[1] Cholera - Niger (southern areas)

Over a succession of days in September 2014, cholera cases were declared in southern Niger. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) emergency teams have treated almost 1000 affected people, while 20 deaths were reported since the beginning of the outbreak which has affected several districts: Tamaske, Madaoua, Bouza Tahoua, Maradi, Madarounfa.

The intervention was launched beginning of September 2014 immediately after the 1st cases were identified. "It's important to act quickly, identify the source of transmission, clean it with bleach, isolate patients, and provide appropriate treatment," says Luis Encinas, MSF desk manager in the Sahel. Immediate action from emergency teams when cases are identified is crucial. "Once the infection sources are identified, action is taken to contain the spread as soon as possible," he adds.

MSF is now about to wind up activities in the 2 places, Kieta in Tamaske district and Tufanti in Madaoua district, initially identified as sources of the epidemic. The intervention has moved to 2 newly detected outbreaks, Gradoume in Bouza and Konni in Tahaoua, which are being constantly monitored by the teams. MSF emergency teams are also acting in Maradi and Madarounfa districts.

In Niger, cholera epidemics appear recurrently and are seasonal in nature. This outbreak is affecting several areas of the country: Tamaske, Madaoua, Bouza Tahoua, Maradi, Madarounfa. Vast areas are potentially vulnerable, which concerns MSF: "It is very likely that new outbreaks will emerge in any moment and any place," explains Cristian Casademont, a MSF medical doctor in Niger.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Upper East Region)

An increase in the number of cholera cases in the Upper East Region has resulted in 3 deaths so far in the region. 10 out of the 13 districts in the region Bawku in the Upper East region are on the increase with 3 people dead so far. The region has recorded over 100 cholera cases in 10 out of its 13 districts. The rate of increase has alarmed health officials in the 3 regions of the North that were relatively cholera-free until a few weeks ago.

The deputy public health director in the region, Dr Mensah Afful, said that they are doing all they can to bring the situation under control. "We have had 127 cases, and we have done damage cost. Prior to Bawku, we had quite a number of districts also having cholera at a point in time, but several of them have been contained except a couple of them in Bawku and Pusiga," he told Citi News. "The number of [cholera cases] we have had is not as substantial as it was in the last 2 days when the incident began."

[3] Cholera - Ghana (Brong Ahafo Region)

About 34 cholera cases have been recorded in the Goaso government hospital in the Brong Ahafo region, while one person has died as a result of the outbreak of the disease. All the cases were recorded in the month of October 2014.

The latest cases of cholera have been attributed to the poor domestic and personal hygiene practices observed by residents in the area, according to the municipal health director at the hospital, Duut Berima. In an interview with Citi News, Duut Berima urged residents to observe good personal hygiene to prevent a further spread of the disease. He also emphasized the need for residents in the area to be educated on effective ways of adhering to such practices.

The Greater Accra region has recorded the highest number of cases so far, but the rate of infection has declined.

Mr Nyarko said the Elubo border had been the worst hit of the disease following its outbreak in the district in September 2014. He said prompt reporting at clinics by victims had prevented any deaths.

[6] Cholera - Zambia (Central Province)

Two people are admitted with what health officials suspect could be cholera at a local clinic in Lukanga Swamps in Kapiri Mposhi. Central Province permanent secretary Edwidge Mutale said 2 men were receiving treatment at Waya clinic in Lukanga but described their condition as stable.

Ms Mutale cautioned the public against eating fish from the area and to boil drinking water to prevent the cholera spread. She paid tribute to health personnel for acting quickly to ensure the disease did not spread by providing chlorine and the sensitization of the villagers.

In September 2014, 2 people from Lukanga swamps died of cholera, while three others were treated and discharged. She said it was saddening that the waterborne disease claimed the lives of 2 people. "We are confident that the disease will not spread to other areas," she said.
