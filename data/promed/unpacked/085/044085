Enterovirus D68 in the United States, 2014
------------------------------------------
From mid-August to 6 Nov 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 1116 people in 47 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Every year, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cause millions of respiratory illnesses in children. This year [2014], EV-D68 has been the most common type of enterovirus identified, leading to increases in illnesses among children and affecting those with asthma most severely. Other rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to be detected as well.

Of the more than 2300 specimens tested by the CDC lab, about 40 percent have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3 have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68. Almost all the confirmed cases this year of EV-D68 infection have been among children. Many of the children had asthma or a history of wheezing.

EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 11 patients who died and had samples submitted for testing. CDC is reporting test results to state health departments as we obtain them. CDC has obtained one complete genomic sequence and 6 nearly complete genomic sequences from viruses representing the 3 known strains of EV-D68 that are causing infection at this time. Comparison of these sequences to sequences from previous years shows they are genetically related to strains of EV-D68 that were detected in previous years in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Reports from states during the 4th week of reporting continue to indicate reduced EV-D68-like illness activity overall. However, 3 new states are reporting increasing activity. At about this time, respiratory illnesses caused by other viruses, like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are becoming more common, and enterovirus infections are expected to be declining. It is unlikely that the increasing activity reported in 3 states is caused by EV-D68.

[As of [6 Nov 2014], CDC has verified reports of 70 cases in 29 states that meet the CDC case definition [of acute neurologic illness of undetermined etiology characterized by focal limb weakness and abnormalities of the spinal cord gray matter on MRI] (see: Investigation of Acute Neurologic Illness with Focal Limb Weakness of Unknown Etiology in Children, Fall 2014 http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/investigation/viral/sep2014.html).

According to (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News, the CDC has not released any findings on the role EV-D68 played in the 11 deaths, saying state health departments are investigating those cases. But in early October 2014, New Jersey officials said the virus caused the death of a 4-year-old boy who died in his sleep (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/11/cdc-cites-2-more-deaths-ev-d68-cases-more-polio-illnesses).

As yet, the description of the French case preceding this report remains the best-documented description available so far (see ProMED-mail archive no 20141106.2935270). - Mod.CP]
