Highly contagious bovine TB detected
------------------------------------
Bovine tuberculosis has been discovered in a cattle herd on the border with
Canada �- the 1st finding in Minnesota since 1971 �- and will lead to the
destruction of about 900 animals, state officials said Wednesday [13 Jul 2005].
A federal inspector monitoring the slaughter of a 5-year-old cow in February
spotted suspicious internal lesions. Laboratory tests later confirmed the cow
had TB, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.
The animal was traced back to a herd in Roseau County in northern Minnesota.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture bought a sample of the herd for further
testing, had the animals slaughtered, and found 18 cases of the disease.
On Tuesday [12 Jul 2005], the USDA declared the herd infected and started the
process for destroying it, said state animal board spokeswoman Malissa Fritz.
She said the USDA will pay the owner, who was not identified.
Bovine TB is [caused by] a highly contagious lung bacterium, spread by infected
cattle coughing, bellowing, and snorting in the confines of a feedlot or
pasture. It is rarely passed to humans.
The state has had bovine TB eradication programs since 1917. The board said it
was important for the state to maintain its federal status as a state free of
bovine TB because it allows producers to export the animals without additional
testing.
Bovine TB has appeared in recent years in Texas, California, New Mexico and
Michigan [see Michigan refs. below. - Mod.JW].
"Our surveillance system worked. The disease was detected," said Dr. Bill
Hartmann, a veterinarian and executive director for the animal board, in a
prepared statement. He said officials will now focus on tracing any animals
that left the herd in the last 7 years and determining the source of infection.
Fritz said the state would lose its TB-free designation only if another
infected animal is found, and if that animal was not related to the current
investigation.
The board said it was unlikely the TB would get into the supply of milk or beef
because inspectors were watching for it. Also, cooking kills the bacteria, the
board said in a news release.

Hundreds of Minnesota cattle destroyed in TB case
-------------------------------------------------
Minnesota's 1st cases of bovine tuberculosis since 1971 have resulted in the
destruction of an entire herd of 900 cattle.
USDA inspectors detected lesions in the carcass of a 5-year-old beef cow at
slaughter in March and immediately quarantined the herd while conducting
further testing, which turned up 18 additional cases. USDA is now conducting a
trace-back to locate animals that left the herd over the past 7 years.
For now, Minnesota will maintain its "TB-free" status, but if cases are found
elsewhere, movement of live cattle across state lines to or from Minnesota
could be banned.
Bovine TB is highly contagious within cattle populations. The respiratory
disease can be spread by coughing or bellowing. However, it rarely affects
humans, with the last known case of such transmission at least 50 years ago
[the journalist or his/her source exidently didn't know about the case this
year shown as 1st ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW].

[According to the USDA regulations on how a state is classified, the state is
allowed one case in 2 years without losing its TB-free status. The state will
now be tracing how many animals came into the herd and where animals sold from
the herd went. These animals will be tested as well. Tuberculosis is most often
found in the lungs but may be found in lymph nodes throughout the body. -
