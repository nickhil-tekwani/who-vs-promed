1) Disease Report: France has reported an outbreak of H5N1 LPAI in
decoy ducks on a premises in Calvados and a 2nd outbreak of H5 (not
N1) in decoy ducks in Pas-de Calais [see map at the above URL]. The
site in Calvados contains 45 ducks in 2 aviaries covered with fencing
and kept by one hunter. Two of 10 ducks tested positive for H5N1
LPAI. The 2nd premises in Pas-de-Calais contained 563 ducks in 32
adjacent aviaries owned by a hunter cooperative.

During routine surveillance, 5 ducks each from 3 of the 32 aviaries
were tested for avian influenza. Two ducks from one aviary were
positive, while the other 10 ducks from the 2 aviaries were negative.
Both the infected premises have been placed under surveillance, and
biosecurity has been increased, but other disease controls have not
been applied, and the affected birds were not culled (European
Commission 2009).

2) Situation Assessment: Decoy ducks are used as captive birds to
lure wild birds to a shooting area for hunting. They are kept
tethered when they are taken out to water and have little direct
contact with wild birds. The French authorities will continue to
conduct surveillance for the time being. As there are no commercial
poultry premises within a one-km radius of the 2 premises, no
restriction zones have been imposed.

According to EU rules, immediate culling of birds infected with LPAI
is not required, but they must be kept under restrictions.

There have been previous reports of LPAI H5N1 being detected in wild
birds in Italy and France. Laboratory tests of these viruses
suggested there was no relationship to Asian HPAI H5N1 strains. There
may be some limited wild bird movements between North France and
South East England at this time of year.
