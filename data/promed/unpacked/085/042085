Colombia has declared a national state of emergency following confirmation that a dreaded fungus has appeared in the country's banana plantations, making this the 1st time Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (TR4) has appeared in Latin America. The finding has put the whole region on alert. In 2015, Randy Ploetz, University of Florida, had said that it was possible it was already there. Wageningen University [& Research, WUR] in the Netherlands used molecular diagnostics to confirm TR4 in Colombia.

After eradicating plants on nearly 170 hectares, the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) plans to expand biosecurity controls. Colombia's government is considering helping banana exporters implement measures such as disinfecting machinery, shipping containers, and footwear in quarantined areas. Agriculture ministers from across the region met to discuss plans to prevent further outbreaks.

"Once you see it, it has likely already spread," says Gert Kema, WUR. WUR found that samples of the fungus from soil and plants around the world are genetically identical. Gert Kema says: "This demonstrates that quarantine measures and information around the globe apparently have not had the desired effect." Bananas have become the 4th most important food product in the world, after rice, wheat, and milk.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

In recent years, tropical race 4 (TR4) has been reported in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (most recently from India, see link below) and is of great concern worldwide (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). The diagnosis above is the 1st confirmed report of TR4 in the Americas.
