The heavy rains which have hit the northeast for nearly a month have
contributed to an increase in dengue in the region. The notifications
of this disease this year [2008] now are 48 percent above the [dengue
cases] registered during the same period in 2007. There have been 23
confirmed [dengue] deaths in the region and another 56 deaths are
suspected [due to dengue].

Sergipe was the state in which the disease had increased the most in
2008. The [dengue cases] registered from January - April [2008] now
have risen 1226 percent above those registered during the same period
in 2007, and 7 people -- 4 of them children -- have died due to the
disease. An additional 8 deaths are under investigation in 20 cities
in the state, which are experiencing a dengue epidemic. "We are in an
atypical weather situation where rain, associated with high
temperatures, turn the environment into one favorable to the mosquito
that transmits dengue virus", said the head of Anthropozoonozes of the
Secretariat of Health of Sergipe, Sidney Sa.

In Rio Grande do Norte, notification of DHF, the most serious form of
the disease, has increased almost 10-fold this year [2008] compared to
the same period in 2007. According to state health [authorities], 577
DHF cases have been notified in 2008, versus 59 last year [2007].

In Alagoas, 14 neighborhoods in Maceio and 2 municipalities (Craibas &
Palestina) have a dengue epidemic going on (more than 300 cases per
100 000 inhabitants). An additional 20 municipalities are in alert
status for the disease. The [dengue case] notifications have
increased 136 percent in relation to 2007. The Director of
Epidemiological Surveillance of Alagoas, Cleide Moreira, thinks that
the rains which commenced early this year [2008], were one of the
factors responsible for this increase in notified [dengue cases].

In Bahia, [dengue case] notifications have increased 160 percent.

In Ceara, 9388 cases of classical dengue have been notified as of
this Saturday [19 Apr 2007], versus 8200 in the 1st 4 months of 2007.
The Fortaleza Prefecture is imposing fines on the owners of
localities where _Aedes aegypti_ are found.

Despite the state having been hit by heavy rains, the [number of
dengue case] notifications in Maranhao have fallen 60 percent in
2008. The Superintendent of Epidemiological Surveillance, Henrique
Jorge, said that this [decline in dengue cases] is due to immunity in
the population following the outbreak in 2007.

The decrease in cases in Maranhao cannot be due just to pre-existing
immunity, since the population of all the states have that. It would
be important to discover the true reason. - Mod.JW]

The Secretary of Health and Civil Defense, Sergio Cortes, said that
they [in Rio] are at the apex of the epidemic, with a declining
trend, but there is still no reason to celebrate anything. [He added
that] the only thing that can leave us more at ease is that the
centers for re-hydration have managed [dengue] patients very [much]
better. Fortunately, up to now, there have not been any confirmed
[dengue] deaths among patients who have gone through the centers.
This is a strategy that is working well.

[An earlier ProMED-PORT post citing a report in UOL published on 16 Apr 2008
<http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/2008/04/16/ult23u1932.jhtm>
indicated that in Rio de Janeiro state, 93 498 cases of dengue, with
87 deaths, have been registered [in 2008], and an additional 91 cases
are under investigation. In one week, 18 099 victims of the disease,
with 6 deaths, were registered.

Another article in Globo
<http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL418128-5606,00-MUNICIPIO+DO+RIO+JA+TEM+CASOS+DE+DENGUE.html>
cites a Rio Municipal Health Secretariat report of 56 919 dengue cases
thus far this year (2008) in the city, with no additional deaths. The
total of deaths in the city stands at 54. There were 1466 cases from
Thursday-Friday (16-17 Apr 2008).

One hopes that indeed the peak of the Rio dengue epidemic has been
reached. But, as Secretary Cortes said, it is too early to be sure and
to celebrate. The number of recent dengue cases is still alarming. -

Subtropical Regions [edited]
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentDengueTropicalSubTropical.aspx>


Dengue fever is a common disease caused by a virus that humans get by
being bitten by infected mosquitoes (usually _Aedes aegypti_); it is
the most common cause of fever in travelers returned from the
Caribbean, Central America, and South Central Asia.

Dengue Risk Areas:
The range of areas where dengue virus is located has rapidly grown in
recent years. Today, it includes many tropical countries in Southeast
Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, the South Pacific, the Caribbean,
South and Central America, northeastern Australia, and Africa. See
the Distribution of Dengue maps for areas where cases have been
reported in previous years
[<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-DengueFever.aspx>].

Risk of getting sick with dengue is related to mosquito bites, which
can vary with the season. The mosquitoes that transmit dengue often
breed in man-made and natural containers, which are especially common
in and around houses; therefore, dengue is common where many houses
are clustered.

Many countries reported high numbers of dengue infections during
2007. This trend has continued in 2008, notably with the large
outbreak currently being reported in Brazil [see above and recent
ProMED posts. - Mod.TY].

Prevention Measures for Travelers:
No vaccine is available to prevent dengue, and there is no specific
medicine to cure people who are sick with dengue. Those who become
ill with dengue fever can be offered medications (acetaminophen) to
reduce fever and may require oral re-hydration or intravenous fluids
and, in severe cases, treatment to support their blood pressure.

Travelers can reduce their risk of getting dengue fever by protecting
themselves from mosquito bites. _Aedes_ mosquitoes, the main type of
mosquito that spreads dengue, usually are active at dusk and dawn,
but may feed at any time during the day, especially indoors, in shady
areas, or when the weather is cloudy. Unlike malaria, dengue is often
transmitted in urban as well as in rural areas. Recommendations for
preventing mosquito bites include:

Use insect repellent on uncovered skin surfaces when outdoors,
especially during the day. When using sunscreen, apply it before
insect repellent.
Repellents containing 30 to 50 percent DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide)
are recommended for adults and children over 2 months of age and are
effective for several hours. Repellents with lower amounts of DEET
offer shorter-term protection and must be applied more often.

Repellents containing up to 15 percent picaridin, which must be
applied often, are available in the USA. Repellents with higher
concentrations of picaridin may be available in some regions outside
the USA.

Protect infants less than 2 months of age by using a carrier draped
with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit. For more
information about the use of repellent on infants and children,
please see the "Insect and Other Arthropod Protection" section in
Traveling Safely with Infants and Children and the "Children" section
of CDC's Frequently Asked Questions about Repellent Use.

Wear loose, long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.
Clothing may also be sprayed with repellent containing permethrin or
another EPA-registered repellent for greater protection. (Remember:
don't use permethrin on skin.)

Where possible, stay in hotels or resorts that are well screened or
air conditioned and that take measures to reduce the mosquito
population.
