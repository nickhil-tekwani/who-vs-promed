The 2000 residents of Ottawa County's Carroll Township who were told to avoid their tap water last weekend [7-8 Sep 2013] can thank one person -- not any one of America's thousands of state and federal health laws -- for sparing them from sickness, possibly even death.

Henry Biggert, the township's water plant superintendent since it went online in 1998, knew he had to act fast when he saw microcystin, the potentially lethal toxin in Lake Erie's harmful, blue-green algae, known as _Microcystis_, spike to a level beyond plant capability 5 Sep 2013.

He took the unprecedented action of shutting down the plant and flushing out the system, the 1st time a publicly owned water-treatment facility in Ohio did that because of an impending threat by an algae-related toxin.

The decision he made a few years ago to test for the toxin once a week during algae blooms was voluntary.

Unknown to many people, the US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] does not require publicly operated water-treatment plants to test for microcystin or any of the other so-called cyanotoxins -- that is, toxins associated with harmful blue-green algae.

Microcystin is the same toxin that killed 75 people in Brazil in 1996. It has been the dominant one in western Lake Erie for nearly each of the past 18 summers, including this one.

The Ohio EPA, which falls back on US EPA rules as the basis for most of Ohio's environmental laws, leaves the decision to perform one of northwest Ohio's most vital water-quality tests up to individual plants on a voluntary basis.

Toledo, Oregon, Ottawa County, Findlay, Clyde, and -- luckily for those 2000 residents last week [week of 9 Sep 2013] -- Carroll Township are among area water plants that have taken it upon themselves to test for microcystin voluntarily.

But most test only on a weekly basis, unless a potential crisis such as last weekend's [7-8 Sep 2013] emerges.

That means that during normal conditions, the level of toxin in any given water plant may be unknown for 6 of 7 days each week.

"It comes down to economics," said Brenda Snyder, chief chemist at the Collins Park Water Treatment Plant in Toledo. "If you need to test daily for it, you need 6 times the labor and 6 times the supplies. I would love to test for it every day, but there's a limit."

For nearly 48 hours, Carroll Township officials sweated it out: Did everyone know they weren't supposed to drink or cook with their tap water until further notice?

The media advisory issued after Mr Biggert's decision at 5:30 p.m. 5 Sep 2013 urged people not to boil their water. Boiling doesn't kill the toxin. It concentrates it.

At least 16 pallets of bottled water were distributed 6 Sep 2013.

The advisory was lifted 7 Sep 2013, shortly before 2:30 p.m. Although there were a lot of questions from confused residents, nobody was known to have become ill from the toxin.

The Ohio EPA, which was reluctant to discuss the issue for most of last week [week of 9 Sep 2013], said Friday [13 Sep 2013] the event showed that "cooperative voluntary measures work."

It cited the case as an example of how a potential crisis can be averted through teamwork involving its agency and others.

But one of the township's higher-profile residents, Kim Kaufman, executive director of the Black Swamp Bird Observatory, said in a Facebook post that it was, indeed, a scary event.

"Only a handful of Carroll Township residents were notified about this," she wrote. "We [Ms Kaufman and her husband, Kenn, one of North America's top bird experts] found out when a friend read it on Facebook and warned us. Many people didn't find out for more than 24 hours."

Linda Merchant-Masonbrink, Ohio EPA harmful algae bloom coordinator, told a group of Great Lakes writers on 26 Aug 2013, during an annual workshop at Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Lake Erie's Gibraltar Island, that the toxin needs to be taken seriously.

The latest research places the potential toxicity of microcystin between DDT and dioxin, she said.

Ms Merchant-Masonbrink said it can cause myriad health problems, from nausea to permanent neurological damage, within minutes of ingestion. At high levels, it can be lethal.

No humans are known to have died from it in North America. But some dogs and other animals are believed to have succumbed from it.

The 1996 deaths in Brazil, investigated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were the result of a breakdown in a kidney dialysis center's on-site water-treatment system.

Research also shows the toxin remains embedded in Lake Erie long after the annual bloom fades, usually by mid-October.

Scientists don't know if the toxin lingers for weeks or months, Ms Merchant-Masonbrink said. That's a key question for public health and safety, because the toxin -- unlike the stinky, pea-green algae -- is odorless and colorless, she said.

David Leffler, Toledo's commissioner-plant operations, agreed there is "no direct correlation between the toxin and the algae."

Stacy Kika, spokesman for the US EPA's headquarters in Washington, said the length of time the toxin lingers is unknown. "Toxins can accumulate in sediments and be released later," she said.

Ms Merchant-Masonbrink handed out business cards and encouraged reporters to contact her after her Stone Lab presentation.

The Ohio EPA declined to let "The Blade" do a follow-up interview with her for this story. But in a prepared statement, the agency said the study of algal toxins is an "emerging science," and data regarding toxins at public water sources "were not available until US EPA's National Lakes Assessment was released in 2009."

Ohio didn't begin testing for algae toxins in public beaches until the summer of 2010, said Chris Abbruzzese, Ohio EPA deputy communications director.

The ordeal, Mr Biggert said, continued to be "a blur" for him and other Carroll Township officials last week [week of 9 Sep 2013]. "It seems like I'm learning something daily about microcystis," he said.

Carroll Township got lucky in another respect: It had a backup.

Water service was restored within 48 hours because the township has an agreement to get treated water on an emergency basis from the Ottawa County Regional Water Plant, which serves Port Clinton, Oak Harbor, and other parts of Ottawa County.

The regional plant will supply Carroll Township water until microcystin levels consistently stay below a level of concern, Mr Biggert said.

Carroll Township, which serves 1380 homes and businesses, has a conventional ozone system at its water plant. That, with chlorine, can keep the toxin levels down during normal circumstances.

Small plants typically don't have technology as sophisticated as plants operated by larger cities, such as Toledo.

Toledo uses a variety of treatments, starting with permanganate at its water intake, to improve water taste and remove foul odors.

Many have the ancillary benefit of destroying the toxin, as well as improving overall water quality.

Toledo officials discussed those techniques at the city's water plant Wednesday [11 Sep 2013]. In addition to permanganate, Toledo uses aluminum sulfate, known as alum, powdered carbon, chlorine, and other products. Lyme [sic; lime] is used to soften the water. Particles are removed by several fine screens the water passes through.

The Toledo water-treatment system is envied by others, Ms Snyder said, because water is piped an unusually long distance -- 9 miles [14.5 km] -- from the city's low-service pump station on the Oregon shoreline to the water-treatment plant. The intake is another 3 miles [6.4 km] off shore.

Water takes 3 to 6 hours to travel from the shoreline to the plant. That gives particles more time to bond to carbon, making the water easier to treat at the plant, Ms Snyder said. "It's like every other thing in chemistry; it's time-sensitive," she said. "You don't need to add as much carbon when you have more contact time."

The plant's laboratory also runs many of the area water samples.

Although Toledo's treatments are highly effective, officials said they don't know which individual products yield the greatest results. That research gap is an important one, they said, because some products cause more harm than good if used in excess.

Algae pollution drives up costs for treatment, which invariably get passed on to rate payers. Mr Biggert said he's not sure how much more the toxin costs his township's treatment plant but said it's substantial. Toledo spends USD 30 000 for each load of powdered carbon. During normal operations, when loads are used only for taste and odor control, they last about 3 weeks. That comes to USD 1429 a day.
When microcystin is detected, the plant goes through a load every 4 to 5 days -- more than 3 times faster than normal. That comes to USD 6000 to USD 7500 a day. That means the toxin, on average, costs Toledo more than USD 150 000 each month it's present.

Dave Welch, Toledo utilities director, said those are hidden costs of pollution. They further speak to the need to be proactive and keep algae-feeding phosphorus out of the water, he said.

Agriculture runoff and inadequate sewage treatment are among the biggest sources of phosphorus. "What we should be doing is looking at a regional watershed. But that would have to be 3 states: Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana," Mr Welch said. "We're treating the symptoms now instead of treating the cause."

Mr Welch called the Carroll Township event "a wake-up call."

Toledo has no other water system it could hook into, as Carroll Township did. And there "isn't enough bottled water in Ohio" to hand out if Toledoans ever were told to stay away from their tap water, Ms Snyder said.

Flushing out Toledo's system would take a minimum of 7 days, she said.

Although the US EPA has no laws requiring public water systems to test for algae-related toxins, the federal agency said it has identified 116 "chemical and microbial substances" in drinking water that warrant more consideration for rule-making. 3 are algae-related toxins, one of which is microcystin.

"What happened at Carroll Township was a serious public health situation," Ms. Kika said.

[_Microcystis aeruginosa_ is a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin, microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US, however Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also require sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people that consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people that frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife and dogs are exposed through drinking water and containing _Microcystis_ or ingesting algal mats.
