Date event resolved 18 Dec 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 26 Mar 2010
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza
Serotype H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks

Outbreak 1 Lantau Island, Sha Lo Wan, HONG KONG
Date of start of the outbreak 18 Dec 2010
Outbreak status Resolved (18 Dec 2010)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Species Birds
Susceptible
Cases
Deaths 1
Destroyed
Slaughtered
Affected Population The chicken carcass from unknown source was
detected on the coast of Lantau Island. The body was badly decomposed
at the time of collection.

Epidemiology- Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Since the occurrence of the event,
inspections of the Lantau coast and the nearby villages have been
conducted, no poultry carcass was found, and there was no evidence of
any backyard poultry being kept there (the HKSAR government has
banned backyard poultry since February 2006). There was no poultry
farm within 2 km of where the carcass was found. The HKSAR government
will continue to monitor the situation including wild bird
surveillance and local poultry farm monitoring. The date the event
ended is the same as the finding of the bird (i.e. 18 Dec 2010).

Control measures - Measures applied: Screening; Disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of
affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

[It is worth taking a look at the OIE WAHID map of the where the
dead, "badly decomposed" chicken carcass was found. The carcass was
found on Lantau Island, not at all far from the Hong Kong
International airport. There is really no indication in this report
where the carcass could have originated from, which is obviously a
key piece of information. Unfortunately, we are probably never going
to get much unequivocal information on where the decomposing chicken
carcass could have originated. In November of this year 2010, a
59-year-old woman who had visited China recently became the 1st case
of H5N1 since 2003.

Hong Kong has a special place in the history of H5N1 because of the
outbreak there in 2003. Robert Webster in the Journal of Virology
(May 2004, p. 4892-4901, Vol. 78, No. 9
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/78/9/4892>) indicated that
the virus isolated from ducks in 2 Hong Kong parks was highly
pathogenic for ducks, which is not usually the case, as they are one
of the normal reservoir hosts for avian influenza. Furthermore, the
article indicates that one person died and another was sickened by a
strain of virus closely resembling the one isolated from ducks.

Obviously, an important "One Medicine" approach to helping us
understand the current situation in Hong Kong will be the comparison
of the genetic composition of the dead chicken carcass HPAI H5N1
virus and the H5N1 that infected the 59-year-old woman. Any further
information to clarify the origins of the decomposing chicken carcass
and its relation to the human case would be appreciated. - Mod.PC]
