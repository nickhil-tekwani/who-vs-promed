Recently, rabies virus was recovered from a cat that died in unclear
circumstances. The immunofluorescence test on the brain was negative, but
rabies virus was isolated, and identified as a bat strain.
Not more than 3 people were exposed to the cat, & they have received ERIG
[anti-rabies immunoglobulin and [duck embryo vaccine (PDEV).
I´m not absolutely sure, but it doesn´t seem to be a vampire bat strain.
This is the second case of bat-cat transmission in the area; there was
another one in Americana, not more than 25 km from Campinas, a couple of
years ago. The city of Campinas, 90km NW of Sao Paulo, has not recorded a
case of animal rabies since 1982.
