Cows are suffering and dying from bovine anaemia because farmers and veterinarians are unable to get the necessary drug, according to a dairy owners and a veterinary doctor in eastern Victoria.

Key points:
- Figures suggest anaemia is costing beef and dairy industries AUD 20 million [about USD 15 million] per annum.
- There is a drug available for treatment but it is not approved in Australia.
- The Government has said the drug is a threat to meat exports.

Dairy farmer BK lost 25 cows and as many calves within 6 weeks of moving onto his dairy farm near Bairnsdale, in East Gippsland [Victoria].

"You wake up in the morning and go outside and wonder what kind of a nightmare you're walking into every day," he said.

"All I can liken it to is like watching someone dying of cancer -- they fade away, get weak, can't get up, don't eat or drink and that's the end of them.

"It's just plain cruel watching them go down with this disease and knowing there's something available to treat them and we are unable to get it. "It is view expressed to the ABC by 4 other farmers.

Hobby farmer JK has been working around the clock to keep her pregnant cow alive.

"It's been a long haul with her, carrying feed and water to her every day and trying to put an old rug over her at night-time and just looking after her and hoping she gets better," she said.

"[It's] really upsetting if I know something that could cure her and it's not available, that's heartbreaking."

What is bovine anaemia?
Bovine anaemia is caused by a tick-borne parasite which destroys red blood cells and can leave a cow pale, panting, and unable to stand or fight off secondary infections.

The parasite -- in the _Theileria orientalis_ group -- can infect both dairy and beef cattle, and usually flares when animals are under stress, such as when pregnant or being moved.

Virulent strains of the parasite are now found in all mainland states.

Separate Australian Meat and Livestock reports this year classed bovine anaemia as an "emerging threat" and estimated it had cost the beef and dairy industries AUD 20 million [about USD 15 milion] per annum since 2006.

BK, who as a Murray Goulburn supplier has taken a huge cut in his milk payments, estimated the disease had cost him between AUD 75 000 and AUD 100 000 [about USD 57 000 to USD 76 000] this year.

"Certainly dairy farmers have been doing it very tough recently and theileria is something they don't need to deal with on top of already low milk prices," Bairnsdale veterinarian Jade Hammer said.

Is there a treatment for cows?
A single injection of the drug buparvaquone, if administered early in a cow's infection, can greatly reduce mortality rates, Dr Hammer, a veterinarian said.

He said the drug had been registered in about 20 countries but not Australia, even though the Queensland Government's Tick Fever Centre recommended 5 years ago that tightly controlled use of buparvaquone be pursued "as a matter of urgency".

The drug was used successfully in New Zealand [NZ] in 2013 to stem an outbreak of bovine anaemia across the North Island, according to veterinarian Mark Hosking, who was instrumental in getting the NZ Government to allow the medicine's importation.

"We treated ourselves, our practice, about 600 to 700 (cows)," Dr Hosking said. "I would say 3/4ths of those survived."

The government sees a different picture and that particular drug seems to be a threat to Australia's meat exports.

As the drug can stay in a cow's system for up to 4 months, New Zealand authorities required that milk and meat from treated cows not enter the food chain for long periods -- 43 days for milk, and a year-and-a-half for meat. [Likely the New Zealand government acted out of caution using a year and a half for keeping meat out of the human food chain. However, if there is good withdrawal data, it seems like this is an overabundance of caution if good scientific data is available for 4 months. - Mod.TG]

NZ's Ministry of Primary Industries has told the ABC that use of the drug was tightly controlled and that none of its export markets expressed concern about use of the drug.

"There's lots of benefits but some real challenges around withholding (times) and it comes down to how much animal welfare is an issue in an outbreak, whether it's wanted," Dr Hosking said.

But the risk to Australia's lucrative meat and livestock trade outweighs the drug's benefits, according to Federal Agriculture Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.

Mr Joyce wrote in December [2015] to a concerned dairy farmer who would like to see the drug registered:

"As major overseas markets have not established a Maximum Residue Level (MRL), detection of buparvaquone ... in our exports would be regarded as a violation and have serious adverse consequences for the Australian cattle industry."

Mr Joyce said controlling buparvaquone's use would require "a stringent and onerous regulatory framework" which "is not a preferred option".

Outbreak caused deaths among Australian cows in Viet Nam
The ABC has obtained an email sent in March this year [2016] to Narelle Clegg, the assistant secretary of the live animal exports branch of the Agriculture Department.

It said that pregnant Australian dairy cows sent to Viet Nam suffered abortions or died after arrival and that the vet on the ground recognised it as an outbreak of theileriosis.

There were "lots" of animals affected, the email said.

Cattle in the consignment were then treated with a single-dose medication from Uganda and India -- 2 countries which manufacture buparvaquone -- which brought the issue "under control".

The Cattle Council of Australia and Dairy Australia believe the restrictions on buparvaquone would make it unworkable and that the drug residues would pose too much of a risk to exports.

"Trade is one aspect but many farmers would happily abide by extremely long withhold periods if it meant saving a cow and many aren't involved in the export industry," Dr Hammer said.

"Many farmers have approached me to try and have it registered."

Farmer BK said he would not hesitate to use buparvaquone if that was what the doctor ordered.

"A cow dead in the paddock is worth nothing even if I hold on to it for 18 months to on-sell, it's a much better option than watching it die," he said.

[There are any number of drugs in various countries that have long withholding times. The drugs are necessary to save the animals and the livelihood of the people who raise the animals.

A number of methods of control for the drug exist. The drug could be controlled so that only veterinarians are capable of obtaining the drug and it must be administered by the veterinarian. Furthermore, drug assays could be developed to test for the drug in blood or serum or urine and even in tissues, such as muscle, and liver and kidneys.

The drug testing would provide good evidence that the drug was no longer in the animal's system. It would allow the animal owners to continue to operate and it would show other governments the security system was working. Further, it would start to control the _Theileria_ sp.

_Theileria_ sp. has been affecting the cattle of Australia for some time. The farmers are suffering, the animals are suffering and the number of exportable cattle will decline as _Theileria_ rages through the country unchecked. Consequently, not providing adequate treatment to the affected animals may already be affecting the number of exports available.

While emergency measures are put into place, a research project to clearly document how long the drug is in the meat and organ tissues of a treated animal would further science, and assure other countries of the safety of the drug. Likewise, the animal producers would be able to stay in business and make a living doing what many have done most of their lives.

Even with long withholding times, owners would be able to get another calf out of a living animal, which would help sustain the farming operations. Likely the affected premises would rather have to keep an animal for a long period of time and have a productive animal than a dead animal.

_Theileria_ are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying _Theileria_ feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters the red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (fewer than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies (or horse flies) have also been shown to transmit infection.
