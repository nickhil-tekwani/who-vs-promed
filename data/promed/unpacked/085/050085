[B] Update 88  New cases reported in China and Japan 25 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_25/en/>
WHO has today received reports of new probable cases of SARS in China and
Japan.
China
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported a new probable case of
SARS involving a 77-year-old woman who fell ill in Guangdong Province. The
case had previously been classified as a suspect case and, according to WHO
recommendations, was placed in isolation on 3 Jun 2003.
This is the first new case reported in Guangdong since 17 May 2003. The
last new case reported anywhere in mainland China was on 11 Jun 2003.
WHO is stressing that this is a reclassification of a suspect case as a
probable case and, as such, should not be taken as an indication that local
transmission has occurred. WHO is awaiting further details about the case
and its relationship to documented chains of transmission that may point to
the source of infection and the timing of exposure.
The most likely explanation is that the case, with its onset in early June
2003, will be linked to a chain of transmission that was subsequently broken.
Meticulous records kept by Hong Kong authorities have revealed that the
woman was hospitalized in Hong Kong and treated for other illnesses from 20
to 21 May 2003. As her room was on the same ward as a SARS patient, she was
placed under health surveillance until 1 Jun 2003. No SARS symptoms
developed during this period, which represents the maximum incubation period.
However, a possible link with the Hong Kong hospital cannot be entirely
ruled out at this time. As became apparent during last weeks global
conference on SARS, the disease does not always follow a clinically
predictable course in elderly patients, particularly when they have been
treated for co-morbidity with other diseases.
Guangdong, which saw the first cases of SARS in mid-November of last year
[2002], was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission
on 13 Jun 2003. This retrospective reporting of a case newly classified as
a probable case does not constitute a reason for any change in the status
of Guangdong.
Japan
The Japanese Ministry of Health has today reported a probable case of SARS
involving a 33-year-old man who arrived in Tokyo, for sightseeing, on 21
Jun 2003 and developed symptoms 2 days later. He was immediately
hospitalized and managed according to WHO recommendations.
Initial diagnostic tests have ruled out other common causes of severe
respiratory disease. Further testing is under way and epidemiological
investigations have been initiated. As the patient is a resident of Taiwan,
health officials there are contributing to the investigation.
Comment on new cases
When an outbreak wanes while vigilance is still high, a few additional
cases are almost always detected. Their prompt reporting provides further
assurance that surveillance systems are alert. However, WHO anticipates
that many reported cases during this phase of the outbreak will turn out,
on further investigation, to be background noise  that is, cases of
community-acquired pneumonia caused by agents other than the SARS virus.
In areas that have experienced large outbreaks and therefore accumulated
considerable skill in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of cases,
reports of newly detected probable cases are less likely to be discarded
upon further investigation.

No new probable cases have been reported since 15 Jun 2003. As of 25 Jun
2003 there have been a cumulative total of 686 probable cases and 84 deaths
reported. Since yesterday's report one previously reported probable case
was excluded by the reporting physician. There are an additional 1467
suspected cases reported, and 865 previously reported suspected and
probable cases have been excluded. There are graphic representations of
locations of reported cases and deaths available at the daily SARS website
update using the above given weblink address.

[As of 25 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8460 probable
cases of SARS with 808 deaths reported worldwide. In the past 24 hours
there were 3 new reports of probable cases -- one each from Canada, China
and Japan. In the case of China, the newly reported case had previously
been reported as a suspected case, with a date of onset of illness 3 Jun
2003. According to the description in the WHO update [1][B] it is possible
that transmission had occurred in Hong Kong as the patient was hospitalized
in Hong Kong for another illness in May, in a ward that housed a SARS
patient.
Details on the specifics of the case reported from Canada were not
available, but according to the Health Canada website the date of onset of
the most recent case of SARS is still 12 Jun 2003, so that the new report
does not constitute a new line of transmission, but is most probably
delayed reporting of a case from the earlier cluster under investigation.
As for the reported case from Japan, information on this case gives a date
of onset of illness of 23 Jun 2003 in a visitor from Taiwan. Information
on possible exposures while in Taiwan is not available. According to the
Taiwanese CDC website, the most recent date of onset of SARS case in Taiwan
is 15 Jun 2003. We await further information on this case. As the WHO
update states, there are many causes of community acquired pneumonia that
will first be reported as possible SARS during the period of heightened
surveillance. In the past 48 hours there were press reports of a suspected
case of SARS in Greece, in a visitor from an affected area that has already
been ruled out as not due to the SARS associated coronavirus. That being
said, we await further information on this case in Japan both epidemiologic
as well as laboratory diagnostic testing. - Mod.MPP]
