Japan's environment ministry has raised the bird flu alert to the maximum level after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain in some waters in the southern part of the archipelago and the virus in several dead birds.

This is the 1st time since 2014 that Tokyo has raised the alert to level 3 after detecting this contagious strain in a pond in Izumi in the Kagoshima prefecture, located on the southern island of Kyushu, a ministry spokesperson told EFE.

The bird flu virus has also been detected in 2 dead swans in the Akita Zoo in the northern part of the main Japanese island of Honshu, which tested positive in the preliminary test and prompted the zoo to cull 132 birds. The zoo found the dead birds on Nov 15 and Nov 17 [2016] and sent the bodies to the Hokkaido University to determine if the virus was of the H5N6 strain, detected recently in South Korea, where authorities have culled over 60 000 birds.

The Japanese university is conducting tests on another wild swan found dead in the locality of Nakashibetsu in Hokkaido on 7 Nov 2016.

The ministry also confirmed the presence of the virus in the faeces of a common teal in Tottori in western Japan.

Authorities have set up an observation radius of 10 km (approx. 6 mi) around the places where infected remains have been found and sent special teams to study the possibilities of contagion and the origin of the virus in the Asian country.
