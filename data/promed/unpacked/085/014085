Rabies test of cat a false positive
-----------------------------------
On Thur 17 Dec 2015, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office (YCSO) issued a report that a cat hit by a car in the 3200 block of Date Creek had rabies and was the 1st case of a rabid domestic cat since the 1950s in Yavapai County.

A secondary test by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated the cat was not rabid and the original test was a false positive, according to a press release Tuesday from the YCSO.

Normal CDC protocol dictates the center receive a specimen testing positive with the goal to determine the type of wildlife that originally transmitted rabies to the domestic animal under review, the release stated. It attempts to identify what species to be watchful of in the affected area and upon completion of the test, CDC determined that rabies was not present in the cat, the release stated.

Lab testing has a margin for error, according to the release. The results of the initial test were reported to the community for public safety and awareness. The bite victim has been notified, the release stated. The [bite victim is] doing well and plans to complete rabies treatment [post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.SH] as directed by medical personnel.

[With wildlife rabies common in the US, we are going to see a steady series of reports of rabies in domestic pets and livestock. A cost of reporting is that a number turn out to be false positives. With this lethal disease, rapid reporting is important in maintaining public awareness. And if we waited upon confirmation in each case, we would be in trouble, as positive confirmations are not always publicized. So please be patient.

Why those exposed are continuing with their vaccinations is unclear. Maybe caution, and maybe "let's be ready before our next exposure". Neither to be argued with.

Yavapai County is in central Arizona, south west of Flagstaff and north of Phoenix; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/arizona_90.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
