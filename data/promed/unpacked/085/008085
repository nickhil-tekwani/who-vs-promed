Hospital outbreak of Scabies, Tenerife
-------------------------------------
Scabies, a parasitic skin disease caused by _Sarcoptes scabiei_ is
traditionally a prevalent condition in developing countries, where
healthcare systems have many deficiencies. Nevertheless, its worldwide
spread and being extremely contagious makes it possible to find
outbreaks in unsuspected places.

In fact, as it was reported last Friday to this newspaper by
healthcare workers from Febles Campos Hospital in Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, at least five persons have been affected by a scabies
outbreak, which has led to isolate two wards in the aforementioned
hospital.

The Social and Sanitary Care Institute (IASS, according to its Spanish
initials), which belongs to Tenerife local authority, confirmed the
existence of this outbreak, but it declared the situation is under
control. Certainly, a spokeswoman from IASS, Ms. Margarita Pena,
pointed out that the Safety and Healthcare Committee of the Hospital
had a meeting a few days ago, and decided to put in place the usual
action protocol for these cases.

These measures consist in isolating affected persons, strengthening
sanitary measures, and using scabicide compounds for treating
patients. However, Ms. Pena did not confirm the number of affected
persons in this outbreak, but she said 'only a few persons are
affected'. Nevertheless, healthcare workers from the hospital declared
that the two isolated wards may accommodate 50 persons.

Scabies is frequently found in travelers, it may reach every person in
a given population, and it is a very frequent and easy to treat skin
disease. Its main symptom is intense itching, which becomes more
intense at evening and night time and also with heat.

Itching occurs because of an allergic reaction from the body against
the parasite. Small papular lesions, blisters, and even some
ulcerative and crust-forming lesions may occur. The condition does not
cause fever, unless there is a superimposed bacterial infection. Being
quite contagious, therapy must be administered to every person in the
household.

The parasite may live up to 30 hours on clothing; consequently clothes
must be disinfected with boiling water or exposing them to direct
sunlight for around four hours.
