Smuggled Horses in West Texas
Found to be Diseased

AUSTIN - U.S. Border Patrol agents recently seized 10 adult horses and 4 yearlings as they attempted to enter Texas illegally by walking across the Rio Grande River near Indian Hot Springs, in southern Hudspeth county, south of El Paso. The animals were turned over to the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Service (USDA/APHIS/VS) officials, who tested the horses in Presidio, Texas, for a number of disease conditions that are considered foreign to the U.S. All 10 of the adult animals tested positive for Equine Piroplasmosis (EP). EP is routinely found in Mexico and numerous other countries around the world, but is not considered to be endemic to the U.S. The blood borne protozoal disease can be fatal to horses and could create major constraints to interstate and international movements if left undetected. EP does not affect humans.

According to Dr. Grant Wease, field veterinarian for USDA/APHIS/VS in El Paso, the illegal movement of animals is an ongoing concern in the vast open spaces of West Texas. "In some places the Rio Grande poses no barrier at all to foot traffic for man or animal." According to the latest USDA information, Dr. Wease indicated that "In 2011, approximately 280 head of cattle and 160 head of equine (primarily horses) were intercepted by USDA officials along the Rio Grande." To further complicate the situation, many of the normal import process for livestock entering Texas have been impacted by border violence, making the attempt to smuggle animals into the state even more tempting.

The investigation by USDA and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) is ongoing to determine not only the source of the horses, but the possible destination as well. The TAHC recently passed EP rules requiring testing of race horses prior to entry into a Texas track, and numerous other states have done the same because of recent cases found in that population of horses. "Racing Quarter horses with some connection to Mexico appear to be at highest risk of testing positive to the emerging disease," according to Dr. Dee Ellis, State Veterinarian and TAHC Executive Director. Although the interdicted horses were described as Thoroughbreds, they were considered to be more likely breeding type animals rather than race ready horses. Dr. Ellis went on to state, "This situation highlights the ongoing border security problems Texas is facing, which leads to an increased risk of disease introduction for the Texas livestock population when animals enter our state illegally. I encourage all citizens that witness unusual activity regarding livestock movement near the Mexican border to contact their local law enforcement or animal health officials as quickly as possible to report the situation."

The TAHC strives to provide quality customer service to the citizens of Texas and works with its USDA partners daily to protect Texas livestock and poultry from foreign animal diseases. With limited state and federal resources however, the two agencies must continually review ongoing surveillance efforts along the border to ensure their actions are as effective as possible.

[Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia caballi_ or _B. equi_ (phylum Apicomplexa). The 2 organisms may infect an animal concurrently.

Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal infection of horses. Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence [lack of appetite], and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The disease may be fatal in up to 20 percent of previously unexposed animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _B. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific. In rare peracute cases, animals may be found dead or dying. More often, piroplasmosis presents as an acute infection, with a fever, inappetence, malaise, labored breathing, congestion of the mucus membranes, and small, dry feces. Anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, sweating, petechial hemorrhages on the conjunctiva, a swollen abdomen, and posterior weakness or swaying may also be seen. Subacute cases may have a fever (sometimes intermittent), inappetence, malaise, weight loss, signs of mild colic, and mild edema of the distal limbs. The mucus membranes can be pink, pale pink, or yellow, and may have petechiae or ecchymoses [hemorrhagic spots in the skin or a mucous membrane]. In chronic cases, common symptoms include mild inappetence, poor exercise tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen (palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in the lungs and signs of pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_ merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _B. equi_ merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross." Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films can sometimes be helpful.

Because _Babesia_ organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers, serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can distinguish between _B. equi_ and _B. caballi_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and _Babesia_ identified either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the spread of tick-borne infections. However, preventing the transfer of blood from one animal to another is vital.
