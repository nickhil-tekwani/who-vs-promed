UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, AVIAN - ARGENTINA (02)

The original report of this outbreak, in our translation from the
Spanish, reads:
"Technical personnel took soil and water samples, and they also
collected dozens of dead birds, mainly ducks and eaglets, so that
necropsies will be performed."
It is true that the dictionary translation of the Spanish word
"aguiluchos" is "eaglets," but the list of birds of Argentina online
in Spanish and English shows that the various birds called
"aguiluchos" are actually hawks, mostly of the genus _Buteo_, that
feed on birds and small mammals; see:
<http://www.geocities.com/avesdeargentina/Listadeaves.htm>
Although botulism is certainly a possibility, this outbreak
strikingly resembles those posted on ProMED from 1995 onwards of
avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), which also affects waterbirds and
raptors in certain lakes in the USA (see refs. below). Those
waterbirds had fed on a plant, hydrilla, introduced by the aquarium
industry, which has escaped and now covers huge areas of many lakes
in the USA. In some of those lakes, the hydrilla is covered with a
species of cyanobacterium that produces a neurotoxin. Plant-eating
American coots and ducks die from the toxin and are scavenged by bald
eagles, which die in their turn. Red-tailed hawks have been
experimentally fed with affected coots, and have died with typical
lesions, so a cyanobacterium/hydrilla/ duck/hawk food chain is possible.
If necropsies show the characteristic lesions of AVM in the brains of
the birds in Argentina, investigators should look at the vegetation
in the lake and see if any of the duck food-plants are infested with
cyanobacteria.
