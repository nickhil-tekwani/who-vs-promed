Biloxi shelter shut as evacuees fall ill
----------------------------------------
A shelter for hurricane evacuees was shuttered yesterday, 4 Sep 2005, after
more than 20 people fell ill in what could be an early sign of a public
health crisis that extends Katrina's deadly wrath. Officials at the Biloxi,
Mississippi shelter suspected that those felled by vomiting and diarrhea
had contracted dysentery -- a painful, sometimes fatal intestinal disease
-- as they slogged to safety through fetid water. "Who knows what they
swallowed before they got here," said Biloxi police Corporal Kayla Robert.
In addition to the ongoing risk of dehydration, health experts are warning
of numerous dangers to those in New Orleans and the shelters around the
region. Some, like hepatitis and salmonella, could lurk in the contaminated
water. Others, such as West Nile virus, could be transmitted by the
mosquitoes that thrive in stagnant waters. "We have the potential for a
crop of diseases we haven't seen in years," said Dr Richard deShazo, head
of the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
And thousands of sufferers of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart
disease, and hypertension face additional risks. "Are people being
separated from their medications?" asked former surgeon general Dr David
Satcher on CNN. "The sooner we understand that and the sooner we can
replace their medications, the more likely people are to be protected."
Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, left
Washington on 4 Sep 2005 with a team of health and social service leaders
to assist the tattered gulf region. "We have the ingredients for a bad
situation there," Leavitt said on CNN yesterday, 4 Sep 2005.
Leavitt was criticized after he said, on Wed 31 Aug 2005, that officials
were "gravely concerned about the potential for cholera, typhoid..."
Experts said those devastating diseases rarely suddenly appear in flood
regions where they didn't exist before.

[Although the diagnosis of shigellosis has apparently not yet been
confirmed, bacterial dysentery due to shigellosis is of great concern,
since the infectious dose of shigella is much lower than that of most
enteric pathogens. This very low infectious dose facilitates
person-to-person spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
issued interim guidelines regarding the hurricane affected areas, which are
