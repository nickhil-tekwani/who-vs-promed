Identifying the species and biovar of the Chlamydia organism causing the
outbreak of pneumonia reported in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales would
provide an important insight into the epidemiology of the outbreak. As
suggested by the moderator caution in assuming the species to be _C.
psittaci_ is advisable.
Berger et al (1) found the koala biovar of _C. pneumoniae_ in an ill wild
ground dwelling frog (_Mixophes iteratus_) from the Orara East Forest in
New South Wales, several hundred miles north of the Blue Mountains. This
was the first report of _C. pneumoniae_ in amphibians, and the only
reported occurrence in a wild amphibian. Two subsequent papers reported _C.
pneumoniae_ in captive amphibians in USA and Europe (2,3).
The concluding paragraph from Berger et al is possibly relevant to the
current human outbreak since soil
may have been a possible vehicle for the amphibian case:
"The finding that the sequence of this frog isolate is identical to that of
the koala biovar of _C. pneumoniae_ raises interesting questions. We are
confident that the gene analysis is reliable and does not represent
laboratory cross-
contamination. At this stage, however, we are unsure of the source of
infection, although the Orara East State forest where the frog was found
contains a significant population of koalas and reports indicate that _C.
pneumoniae_ infection is common in most Australian koala populations.
_Mixophyes iterates_ is a ground-dwelling fossorial [able to dig - Mod.LL]
frog with opportunity to come into indirect contact with koalas, who
regularly walk on the ground to move between food trees. Despite recent
investigations into diseases of wild amphibians in Australia, chlamydia
strains have not been identified previously in native frogs or introduced
cane toads, although specific chlamydial tests for asymptomatic carriers
were not done. Several studies have reported the very high genetic
similarity of human _C. pneumoniae_ strains and also the clonality of koala
_C. pneumoniae_ strains, suggesting a possible recent divergence of these
biovars. It is possible that the infection of a wild frog described in this
report was an isolated incident, or alternatively, increased testing may
show that amphibians are commonly infected with _C. pneumoniae_ and that
they are a natural reservoir for this species."
