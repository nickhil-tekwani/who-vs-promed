Kazakhstan: anthrax cases confirmed
-----------------------------------
7 people in the north of the country have been hospitalized with
anthrax contracted from infected cattle. "The situation is that 7
people have been hospitalized with confirmed anthrax," Albert
Askarov, deputy head of the sanitary and epidemiological control
committee, told IRIN from the Kazakh capital, Astana, on Tue 6 Jul
2004.
His comments followed earlier reports, by the Kazakh Emergency
Ministry, that a local resident in Mugalzhar district, in
northwestern Aktobe province, was hospitalized on suspicion of
contracting anthrax. "That patient was hospitalized on 30 Jun 2004,
while the others were detected when health workers began screening
people with whom the hospitalized patient had been in contact,"
Askarov added.
The hospitalized patients took part in slaughtering a calf that had
died of a mysterious disease, with some of them reportedly selling
the meat. "The calf had blood running out of its nose, and they
slaughtered it without notifying the veterinary service and getting a
sanitary certificate," he explained.
"They [the patients] are all now in the infectious diseases unit of
the Emba town hospital, in Aktobe province, undergoing treatment
under the surveillance of health personnel. We think that there won't
be any new cases, as the incubation period [for fresh cases] is
past," Askarov noted.
"All the necessary measures have been taken, and a team of experts,
including Health Ministry specialists, did their work on the ground.
The patients' condition is now good, as they have a mild form of
anthrax," he said.
The recent incident has brought the number of [human] anthrax cases
in Central Asia's largest state to 11, all within the 1st 6 months of
2004, while in the same period of 2003, there were none. Askarov
cited a lack of veterinary control as the root of the problem. "There
need to be veterinary measures, including the vaccination of animals,
and, proper veterinary controls, as all the cases were caused by
infected cattle. Unless this is ensured, people will continue to be
infected, as the disease is contracted only from animals," the health
official explained. He also emphasized the importance of tighter
measures to prevent people from slaughtering infected animals.

[Kazakhstan is in the opening months of an important national anthrax
study for the purposes of better understanding the disease and for the
improvement of control procedures. Dr. Askarov is absolutely correct
in his statement about veterinary responsibilities in the control of
this zoonotic disease. Without proper veterinary inspection of
animals being slaughtered and butchered, there is always the risk of
human infection, human nature being what it is. The blood coming from
the calf's nose would have happened after death, and probably means the
animal was found dead in the morning. - Mod.MHJ]
