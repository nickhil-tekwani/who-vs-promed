Hundreds of sheep on up to 30 West Otago farms are believed to have
died from a disease that causes ewes to abort.

_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Brandenburg cases have surged,
especially in the area between Waitahuna and Clydevale, and mortality
at some farms has hit triple figures. Confirming the details
yesterday [17 Aug 2010], Balclutha-based veterinary surgeon John
Smart said it was far from an epidemic but some farms were caught in
"a bit of a disaster".

Reports suggested 25 to 30 farms were affected in the latest spike of
a blight that has lingered in Otago and Southland since 1997, Dr
Smart said. It had not infected all animals on all affected farms,
but "when you are dealing with triple-figure losses at some places,
then that's significant for individual farmers."

It was natural for disease to have peaks and troughs. It would be
difficult to pin the latest increase on the climate, while there was
very little stock movement in the area at this time of year.
Vaccination rates varied between farms as some considered it a costly
insurance against a disease that might not be prevalent one year but
which reared its head the next, Dr Smart said.

The biggest source of infection was from aborting ewes, but it could
survive in places such as covered sheep yards for up to a year. It
could also be spread by livestock, farm dogs, and machinery, or
through water and the droppings of black-backed gulls.

Factors identified as predisposing ewes to _Salmonella_ Brandenburg
include feed changes, multiple-bearing ewes in late pregnancy,
depressed immune systems, stress from the weather, stock movement, or
time spent in yards. "It will continue to be something that we have
to be aware of -- and it's transmittable to man, so just about
anywhere it can be passed to animals it can be passed to people."

Public Health South medical officer of health Derek Bell said the
most recent statistics suggested there was no corresponding upsurge
in _Salmonella_ Brandenburg cases in people living in the area. There
were no reported cases in the past 2 weeks.

"There is a good degree of awareness in the rural community about
this and other such diseases, so it is good news to see that
something as transmittable as this does not appear to have been
picked up by people."

A Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry spokesman confirmed monitoring
and reporting of the disease was left to local veterinarians.

[How fascinating that an organism known to be a zoonotic and known to
spread so easily is not (yet) appearing in humans! Is this because of
increased awareness in the public and those producers that handle the
sheep such that hygiene becomes of primary concern? Or is this
organism becoming more adapted to sheep?

_Salmonella_ Brandenburg has also been recognised as a zoonosis. It
can cause severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps in people, with
recovery taking up to 6 weeks (Clark et al., 1999). In New Zealand,
_Salmonella_ Brandenburg has been an infrequent human pathogen,
accounting for one percent of human salmonellosis cases (Wright et al., 1998).

Worldwide, the prevalence of ovine salmonellosis is relatively low.
However, when outbreaks occur they often have a severe effect on
individual farms where extensive stock and financial losses occur.
_Salmonella [enterica_] serovars, such as Abortusovis, Montevideo,
Dublin, and Typhimurium have all been recognised as common causative
agents of ovine salmonellosis (Wray and Wray, 2000).

_Salmonella_ Brandenburg causes acute diarrhea and severe illness in
a variety of animals and was first isolated in New Zealand in 1986.
Since 1996 _Salmonella_ Brandenburg has been associated with an
emerging epidemic of abortions and deaths in sheep in the southern
regions of the South Island. Little is known about the specific
epidemiology of _Salmonella_ Brandenburg in sheep and as a result
control to date has been largely based on anecdotal evidence and
general principles.

_Salmonella_ Brandenburg appeared to occur in better performing
flocks, which are often associated with intensive farming methods. At
the farm level, factors such as increased total number of ewes,
feeding of hay, and controlled winter grazing appeared to increase
the risk of disease. Farming methods such as controlled winter
grazing may result in higher stress levels and increase the shedding
of _Salmonella_ Brandenburg organisms. This may create a higher risk
of exposure in sheep yards and on pasture, resulting in a higher risk
of disease. Feeding crop and having hilly terrain decreased the risk
of a farm having disease. A protective effect of hilly terrain could
be due to less intensive farm management, with a subsequent reduction
in stress associated disease risk. Within affected farms, disease
appeared to be more severe with the removal of rams after July,
feeding of hay, and the practices of strop grazing. Shearing after
July, increasing the total number of pre-lamb yardings, and
vaccinating for _Salmonella_ appeared to be protective. Therefore
reducing stress and vaccinating ewes appear to reduce the risk of a
_Salmonella_ Brandenburg outbreak.
