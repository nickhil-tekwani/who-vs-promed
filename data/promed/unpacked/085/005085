U.S. accidentally sent live anthrax to Camp Zama in 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A potentially live anthrax sample was accidentally sent to a U.S. Army post southwest of Tokyo a decade ago, a Pentagon spokesman said Friday [12 Jun 2015], adding that it was disposed of a few years later. The sample was sent while a research program was underway at Camp Zama in Kanagawa Prefecture from 2005 through 2010, and researchers used it for "training and proficiency testing" in countering biological threats. The anthrax was shipped in 2005 and destroyed in 2009, Pentagon spokesman Steve Warren said.

"It's important to note that there currently is no anthrax, activated or inactivated, in Japan at this time," Warren said at a regular Pentagon news briefing. "When we sent it, we thought it was inactive," Warren said. However, the master sample at the U.S. Army facility from which the Camp Zama sample came has since tested active. Warren said that because the Camp Zama sample was destroyed, it would be "impossible" to test if it was ever active.

Five countries outside the United States are now known to have received live anthrax samples: Australia, Canada, South Korea, Britain and Japan. 69 labs in 19 U.S. states and Washington also received live samples. Investigators have been trying to determine whether the inadvertent shipments of live anthrax, which can be used as a biological weapon, stemmed from quality control problems at a U.S. base in Utah known as the Dugway Proving Ground, Pentagon officials said.

In an online report Friday [12 Jun 2015], the newspaper USA Today said that in 2007, lab inspectors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited Dugway for using an experimental chemical method of killing anthrax specimens that was ineffective and resulted in an unauthorized transfer of the bacteria to another facility. It quoted the CDC as saying inspectors found that Dugway staffers apparently ignored the results of their own kill-confirmation tests that showed bacteria growing even after the chemical inactivation was performed -- and shipped the sample anyway.

The CDC referred Dugway to the Department of Health, but the department's Office of Inspector General did not issue any fines even though it agreed that an unauthorized transfer of anthrax had occurred, USA Today reported. It said the CDC had noted that the 2007 case involved a chemical method of inactivating anthrax, not the gamma irradiation method that is the focus of the current probe.

Following the revelation that anthrax was shipped abroad, North Korea has accused the United States of targeting it with anthrax. In a letter made public Friday [12 Jun 2015], it asked the United Nations to investigate Washington's "biological warfare schemes." The letter from North Korea's U.N. ambassador to the council president and the U.N. chief claims the U.S. "possesses deadly weapons of mass destruction" that it is trying to use against it. The spokesman for the current council president, Malaysia, said he had not heard of any initiatives on the council to take up the issue but would inquire further. Ja Song Nam's letter says the shipment of live anthrax to South Korea means the U.S. "is attempting to use them in actual warfare" against his country.

US State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke told reporters in Washington the allegations were "ridiculous" and didn't "merit a response."

[Japan is free of anthrax. Their last human case was in 1994. There were singular bovine outbreaks in 1988, 1991, and 2000; the latter outbreak was in the Miyazaki Prefecture, Southern Japan, and involved a beef cow. Historically it was a problem in Kyusyu because the farmers there imported crushed bones from enzootic countries for fertilizer. In western Kinki (rural Osaka-Kobe) there were both human and animal cases. This was related to the large leather industries importing hides and furs from endemic countries. - Mod.MHJ]

Abstract: The use of _Bacillus anthracis_ as a biological weapon in 2001 heightened awareness of the need for validated methods for the inactivation of _B. anthracis_ spores. This study determined the gamma irradiation dose for inactivating virulent _B. anthracis_ spores in suspension and its effects on real-time PCR and antigen detection assays. Strains representing 8 genetic groups of _B. anthracis_ were exposed to gamma radiation, and it was found that subjecting spores at a concentration of 10**7 CFU/ml to a dose of 2.5 x 10**6 rads resulted in a 6-log-unit reduction of spore viability. TaqMan real-time PCR analysis of untreated versus irradiated Ames strain (K1694) spores showed that treatment significantly enhanced the detection of _B. anthracis_ chromosomal DNA targets but had no significant effect on the ability to detect targets on the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids of __B. anthracis_. When analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), irradiation affected the detection of _B. anthracis_ spores in a direct ELISA but had no effect on the limit of detection in a sandwich ELISA. The results of this study showed that gamma irradiation-inactivated spores can be tested by real-time PCR or sandwich ELISA without decreasing the sensitivity of either type of assay. Furthermore, the results suggest that clinical and public health laboratories which test specimens for _B. anthracis_ could potentially incorporate gamma irradiation into sample processing protocols without compromising the sensitivity of the _B. anthracis_ assays.
[...]
A review of _B. anthracis spore inactivation methods by Spotts Whitney et al. listed gamma irradiation as a method for inactivating _B. anthracis_ spores. Horne et al. described the use of gamma radiation for inactivation of virulent _B. anthracis_ spores and found that a dose of 1.5 x 10**6 rads was required to inactivate live spores at a concentration of 10**6 spores/ml. A more recent study conducted by Dang et al. reported that 2.0 x 10**6 to 2.24 x 10**6 rads was sufficient to inactivate _B. anthracis_ spores at a concentration of 10**8 CFU/ml, but the study used only avirulent strains missing one of the 2 virulence plasmids. In addition, the study reported that irradiation decreased the sensitivity of real-time PCR and antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (PAbs).

The purposes of this study were to determine the gamma radiation dose for inactivating virulent _B. anthracis_ spores in suspension and to characterize the effects of gamma irradiation on the limit of detection for real-time PCR and antigen detection assays. Experiments were carried out using virulent strains representing 8 genetic groups of _B. anthracis_, while testing employed a validated real-time PCR assay currently used by LRN laboratories (15) and 3 ELISAs.
[...]
This study is the 1st to report the gamma radiation dose for inactivating live virulent spores representing 8 described genetic groups of _B. anthracis_.
[...]
For viability testing, a 100-microliter aliquot of irradiated spores, plus a nonirradiated control aliquot for each strain, was spread onto TSAB plates, and plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 deg C. A separate 100-microliter aliquot of each irradiated sample and nonirradiated control was also used to inoculate 3-ml Trypticase soy broth (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), and cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37 deg C with shaking at 300 rpm. Viability was determined by direct observation of plates for colonies and liquid cultures for turbidity. Staining and microscopy were performed as described above to compare untreated versus irradiated spores.

Irradiation kill curves were generated to determine the efficiency of inactivation for each treatment dose. Immediately following exposure to gamma radiation, spore suspensions were placed on ice, and serial 10-fold dilutions were performed in PBS. Dilutions were spread onto triplicate TSAB plates, and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 deg C. Colonies were enumerated, and the percentage of survivors was calculated for each treatment dose.
[...]
For all strains tested, 1.5 x 10**6 rads of gamma radiation was sufficient to inactivate greater than 99 percent of spores. Since 2.5 x 10**6 rads of gamma radiation was sufficient to inactivate 99.999 percent of the spores of all strains of _B. anthracis_ tested, this treatment dose was used for all subsequent experiments in this study.

[3] CDC report

CDC Finds Live Anthrax in All Test Samples Shipped by Military
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now believes that there was live anthrax in all of the samples mistakenly sent by the U.S. military to 69 laboratories in 19 states, Washington D.C. and 5 countries. It has instructed the labs to destroy any remaining anthrax still in their possession.

CDC testing found low levels of live anthrax in all 22 samples it had received from affected laboratories. The samples were from labs that had received supposedly inactivated material from the Army Proving Ground in Dugway, Utah. "We are assuming any samples that were derived from lots prepared at Dugway contain live material," said CDC spokesman Jason MacDonald. "There is no need to test those samples further. The priority is to secure the samples and destroy the material."

Accordingly the CDC has instructed any laboratories that may have received anthrax sample shipments from Dugway between 2004 and 2015 to destroy their existing samples. "If the labs are able, destroy the samples in accordance with standard procedures and with an approved method (e.g., autoclave). The destruction must be completed within 7 days and evidence of the destruction provided to CDC," said MacDonald.

If the lab is unable to destroy the samples on their own they are to be transferred to a more capable "select agent registered site" that can handle and destroy the spores. The CDC and the FBI would assist with the transfer.

A 3rd option would be for labs classified as a select agent registered entity to register their sample with the Federal Select Agent Program and retain it.

Meanwhile the military continues to test the more than 400 lots of supposedly dead anthrax it keeps at 4 military facilities. Some 11 of 91 lots have tested positive for anthrax, and all of those are from the Dugway facility.

Tracing the distribution path of those lots to laboratories has led to the increasing number of affected laboratories that may have received live anthrax. On Friday [12 Jun 2015], Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren announced that a shipment of possibly live anthrax had been sent to Japan in 2005. He said that sample was destroyed in 2009.

Pentagon officials stress that there is no threat to the general public from the shipments of live anthrax pointing to the secure packaging of samples which were sent by Fed Ex. At a Pentagon briefing 2 weeks ago senior Pentagon officials said that the amounts of anthrax being shipped to laboratories for research purposes contained levels of anthrax that were significantly less than the amount needed to infect a healthy person. No lab workers have shown any symptoms of possible anthrax infection, though 31 individuals have been protectively receiving antibiotics as a precautionary move.
