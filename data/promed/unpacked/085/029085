2003/112 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance for
2003 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2003/082) from the
following countries: Algeria, Austria, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been
re-exported and the country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country
is indicated in brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country
is not known to the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.

[Interceptions of regulated plant pests is an extremely important component
of international trade. Cross-border traffic is subjected to a variety of
control procedures, all of which are designed to prevent specific pathogens
from entering countries that are free of regulated pathogens. Countries
such as Australia and New Zealand, which are far removed from many
pathogens that are found in the Americas and Europe, have very strict rules
and regulations, which they exercise with considerable vigor. It goes
without saying that there are always those individuals who will take it
upon themselves to smuggle plants and seeds, and that seems to be part of
the game for such unscrupulous individuals.
This piece is probably a good example of the reported interceptions; the
question is, what was not detected? The plethora of nematode interceptions
is surprising; of the 13 interceptions on potato, 10 were on ware (table)
potatoes and 3 for seed potatoes. Infested/infected seed potatoes are
especially serious, because if not detected, the basis of the seed potato
industry in the recipient country could be at risk. The bacterial and viral
pathogens noted in this report illustrate the need for close examination of
plants and seeds. 2 pathogens, Pepino mosaic potexvirus [PepMV ]and
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _phaseoli_ [Xap] in bean, both seed-borne, are
reported here and were likely identified by serological or molecular tests.
PepMV is found on the surface of infested seeds and is extremely
contagious, as is Xap. The 2 interception reports -- which reported
pathogens not known to occur in the affected recipient countries --
illustrate the need for rapid alerting of plant protection agencies in all
countries. - Mod.DH]
