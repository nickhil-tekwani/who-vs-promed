Hired runners strap bamboo cages loaded with 20 live chickens onto
their backs in China. Under cover of darkness, they navigate
well-worn footpaths across a mountain into Vietnam, where bicycles
wait to haul the clucking contraband away. The smugglers easily evade
patrols along the rugged 1350-kilometer (840-mile) border by using
2-way radios and a network of illegal crossings that have become
gateways for a new threat: bird flu. Vietnam estimates that about
4500 chickens are trafficked into the country this way every day from
China in a trade that is nearly impossible to police because of
scarce resources.
The H5N1 bird flu virus has recently shown up in samples taken from
confiscated birds, raising the stakes in Vietnam's battle to shift
from the hardest-hit country to one that has successfully contained
the virus. ''I think there is a very large undercover, underground
trade that is going on,'' said Dr. Jeff Gilbert, an animal health
expert at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Vietnam. ''I
think the biggest risk of re-infection (in Vietnam) is infection from
China.'' Many scientists believe much of the worldwide spread of H5N1
is linked to the migration of wild birds, but the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health says it is investigating the possible
role smuggling has played in some countries.
In 2005, Taiwan confirmed its 1st case of bird flu, which was found
in birds smuggled from China. A Nigerian official also has blamed
illegal poultry imports for introducing the virus there earlier this
year, though agency spokeswoman Maria Zampaglione said that has not
been confirmed. She said the organization is recommending that
governments worldwide pay more attention to the illegal trade of
poultry but said China is not specifically being looked at as a
source. Chinese officials have not responded to queries about whether
smuggling has occurred.
Most countries have strict quarantine laws to protect against
importing infected animals and meat products. Bans have also been
quickly slapped on countries where bird flu and other diseases like
mad cow have appeared. But a global smuggling network that has long
existed hasn't been shut down by new bird flew precautions.
''There's lots of illicit movements of livestock products around the
world,'' said Dr. Peter Roeder, an animal health expert at the FAO's
base in Rome. ''The meat comes in packed in vegetable containers and
with other goods and the customs authorities just find it extremely
difficult to be on top and inspecting everything.'' In the past,
infected beef and pork smuggled into Europe from Asia were blamed for
outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever,"
Roeder said. Roeder added he wouldn't be surprised if frozen poultry
meat from Asia is entering Europe illegally.
He said another worry is the trade of manure-based fertilizers and
animal feed, which often contains ground-up poultry parts, from
infected countries. FAO is examining what role they could play in the
spread of H5N1. Vietnam, where most human infections and deaths have
occurred, launched a nationwide poultry vaccination campaign in 2005
and has intensified surveillance and public awareness. It has not
detected any outbreaks in poultry for 4 months and no human cases
have been reported since November 2005.
Its success has boosted demand for poultry as more Vietnamese shed
their fears of eating infected meat. That, in turn, has fueled the
smuggling. Smuggled birds typically come from large Chinese farms
where high volume and low feed prices keep overall costs low. The
poultry can be resold in Vietnam for up to 5 times more, depending on
the market.
For instance, older chickens that no longer lay eggs can be bought by
smugglers for about 14 000 dong (88 cents) per kilogram, and can end
up in markets in Hanoi and other cities. In the Vietnamese border
town of Lang Son, such birds fetch 37 000 dong (USD 2.34) a
kilogram -- still 10 000 dong (63 cents) cheaper per kilogram than
Vietnamese-farmed chicken, said Do Van Duoc, director of the Lang Son
Department of Animal Health.
In Vietnam, no outbreaks have been directly linked to smuggled
poultry from China. But it's market inspector Lanh Van Nghe's biggest
fear. He leads an 8-man team responsible for stopping all Chinese
poultry and eggs from entering Vietnam along a 100-kilometer
(62-mile) stretch of border near the town of Dong Dang -- too few to
be really effective, he says. Dirt paths, some as wide as roads, have
been worn into the landscape by traffickers toting in everything from
bootlegged DVDs to shoes and electronics.
''Sometimes we lay our ambush until 2 or 3 in the morning,'' Nghe
said. ''Nearly a month ago, the smugglers built a cart, so they could
use the railway here to transport up to 8 cages of chickens. They
moved the smuggled chickens for 2 kilometers to evade a checkpoint.''

[If the above report is correct -- and there is no reason to doubt it
-- it is clear that Vietnam will have to consider a regular poultry
vaccination policy to protect itself. Los Angeles (San Pedro) Harbour
is one of the largest container traffic ports in the world. One must
wonder how many containers have come through it in the past 12 months
with hidden chicken parts. If they have, so far we have been
fortunate, as have other Pacific-facing ports in the Americas. - Mod.MHJ]
