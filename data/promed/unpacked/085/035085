Over 700 soldiers have required medical aid since complaining of nausea and vomiting after a tainted meal at a military compound in the western Turkish province of Manisa, which already saw a mass food poisoning in May 2017 that left one soldier dead. The Manisa Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on [Sun 18 Jun 2017] that 731 soldiers have been affected.

Defense Minister Fikri Isik and the commander of Turkish Land Forces, General Zeki Colak, visited the soldiers at the hospital, Daily Sabah reports. The defense minister said 372 soldiers have been hospitalized, while the others are being treated at the military facility. "No one is in life threatening condition," Fikri Isik said, as cited by Anadolu news agency. The food poisoning caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, according to the doctors, Hurriyet Daily News reported. Earlier in May 2017, more than 1000 soldiers were struck by salmonellosis infection that resulted in the death of one soldier.

"Upon the repeat incident, our office has launched a 2nd investigation. Blood and urine sample from the suffering soldiers, as well as samples from the chicken and food items, water, and all other ingredients served at the dinner, have been taken and sent for an expert examination," Simsek said, as quoted by Hurriyet.

[In the report above, nausea and vomiting are mentioned in one place and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in another as the symptoms of the large cluster of illness. The presence of diarrhea along with vomiting, especially if combined with fever, would make staphylococcal enterotoxin induced illness unlikely. Knowing the incubation period between the meal and the onset of symptoms would also be important as staphylococcal illness has a short incubation period, as little as 4-6 hours. ProMED would appreciate more information about the outbreak. - Mod.LL
