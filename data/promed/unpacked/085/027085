We would like to comment on a recent ProMED-mail post, dated 23 Aug 2014 (Zika virus - Japan ex Thailand), archive no. 20140823.2716731.

The author stated that using serology, which showed elevation of serum IgM [immunoglobulin M] antibody presumably for Zika virus, led to the diagnosis of Zika fever in a Japanese traveler returning from Koh Samui, Thailand. We are concerned that this conclusion is premature because it was based on the result of an IgM assay alone.

In addition to having similar clinical presentation as dengue fever, serological assays for Zika virus are notoriously cross-reactive among flaviviruses. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that the detection assay for Zika virus IgM cross-reacted with dengue virus IgM.

Accurate Zika virus diagnosis (or any viral infection) must therefore rely on molecular assays such as RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] or real-time PCR. In the absence of the viral nucleic acid isolation, such conclusion is possibly misleading without further scientific evidence as provided by 2 earlier case reports from Canada (archive no. 20130529.1744108) and Germany (archive no. 20131227.2139786).

[Drs. Sompong and Yong make a valuable point -- flaviviruses are notoriously cross-reactive in serological tests. Because of this, one noted virologist described flavivirus serological tests as a "hall of mirrors." Virus isolation or PCR demonstration of specific genomic sequences provide a more convincing diagnosis than serological tests alone. Plaque reduction neutralization tests, if the individual has not had previous flavivirus infections, can also be helpful.

ProMED thanks Drs. Sompong and Yong for their comments. - Mod.TY]
