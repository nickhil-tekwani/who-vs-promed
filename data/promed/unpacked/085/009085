Bluetongue Serotype 8 Epidemic Bulletin by EFSA Epidemiology Working Group:
Bulletin 10 of 14 Dec 2006. Outbreak Period until 12 Dec 2006, updated 15
Dec 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
Main observations:
1. The current bluetongue serotype 8 epidemic is now into its 17th week,
with the case total having risen to 2012 herds, compared to 1994 herds last
week. This week's data confirm the trend of a decrease in the number of new
cases.
2. Due to this small number of new cases, there are no major changes in
this report, compared to last week's report. Nevertheless, it should be
noted that these recent cases have been reported at a considerable distance
from the original primary focus (see weekly time series animation at URL
above).
3. The Netherlands reported again no new cases this week. Luxembourg
reported its 2nd and 3rd bluetongue cases. All new cases occurred in cattle.
4. The spatial pattern of cattle herd density indicates that the separation
between the original outbreak area (central cluster) and the eastern
cluster is through an area of very low cattle density. In contrast, high
cattle herd density does not appear to coincide with spread along the
east-west axis, suggesting other phenomena must play a role.
5. The relative risk map for cattle (expressing case density relative to
the cattle farm density) shows that cattle farms in the central and eastern
cluster have been most severely affected. In contrast, the risk for cattle
farms in the western cluster has been lower.
6. Visual assessment of the data thus far available for sheep supports the
findings for cattle. These findings imply that this year some high sheep
and cattle herd density areas in the vicinity of the central cluster
outbreak area have only been mildly affected. There are several possible
explanations for this phenomenon, including the fact that the epidemic
reached these high-density areas, such as the western cluster, relatively
late during the progression of the epidemic.
The last report for the year will be issued next week.

The Netherlands is going to deploy sentinel cows during next spring in
order to detect, as early as possible, any reemergence of the bluetongue
virus. This has become apparent from the plan delivered by the agriculture
ministry to the European Union.
The sentinel cows (free of the virus and of antibodies) will be placed
throughout the country in locations where the vector midge is known to be
present. The cows will be tested for bluetongue at least once per month.
