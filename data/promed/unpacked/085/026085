An outbreak of typhoid that resulted in the death of a woman and her 2 children has forced the Ministry of Health to impose a 21-day lockdown of Togovere in Rakiraki. Health Ministry permanent secretary Dr James Fong said the situation in the village was a concern for the Western Division health team and measures were taken to contain the outbreak when it was first detected. "Unfortunately, we are getting back data that there are some leakages in our containment measures," he said. "That's why we have escalated to an enhanced form of containment."

Dr Fong said the villagers have been given health advice on how to beat the outbreak. "A lot has to do with food hygiene, water to be boiled before drinking, no communal eating that will help us to pinpoint exactly where the issues are." He said a lot of screening will take place in the village. "The screening is not [a] one-off; it requires testing to be sure a negative person is really negative and anybody who turns out positive will need to be adequately managed."

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with "Typhoid Mary," or Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). Vaccines are available for prevention. - Mod.LL
