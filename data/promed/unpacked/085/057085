A jackal which bit 2 dogs in Afula was found to be suffering from rabies. The [bitten] dogs were quarantined [see comment].

The Health Ministry has requested all those who had contact, or whose animals had contact, with a sick or roaming animal to immediately refer to the nearest health clinic to their homes.

[Animals bitten by rabid or rabies-suspected animals, should - according to Israel's prevailing legislation - be isolated, under continuous, direct veterinary supervision, during 6 months following the incident.

Afula is a city in the Northern District of Israel ("HaZafon"), often known as the "Capital of the Valley" due to its strategic location in the Jezreel Valley. Its current population is about 50 000. - Mod.AS]

The 34th case of rabies for 2017 has been reported from Afula in a jackal. Please note that this is the 8th rabid jackal reported within a single month, all in the valley of Jezreel.

[In the past 10 months, since the start of 2017, rabies has been laboratory-confirmed in 34 animals in northern Israel, of which 20 jackals, 5 dogs and 9 bovines. This is an increased incidence compared to 2016 data (a total of 30 cases during 12 months, including 12 dogs, 7 foxes, 5 jackals, 5 bovines and one horse).

A map, showing all cases recorded since the start of 2017, is available at http://tinyurl.com/yant68p2. Please observe the striking spread of rabies in jackals, in northern Israel: compare the 2017 situation to 2016 (map at http://tinyurl.com/yc8orxt3) and 2015 (map at http://tinyurl.com/yc3oy3uu).

Israel has been applying a countrywide oral vaccination of wild carnivores (foxes and jackals) by the dispersion of baited vaccine since the early 2000's. The current worrying development cannot be attributed to introduction of rabid animals from the neighbouring countries (Lebanon, Syria and north-west Jordan) but to indigenous infection, due to the increased size of the local jackal population, for which the applied number of baits has become insufficient. Foxes and jackals are protected species in Israel.

This development, and particularly the introduction of rabies into urban areas (the cities Afula, Beit-Shean and Carmiel), accompanied by an increased number of human exposures, have led the Israeli Veterinary Services to declare parts of north-east Israel as "high-risk" rabies area. Intensified control upon pet vaccinations and prevention of dog straying are to be applied. A map, showing the (rose-coloured) declared area, has been published on 1 Nov 2017, accompanied by a list of the municipalities involved; see at
http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/About/hozrim/hozrim/Documents/ezor_sikun_kalevet_2017.pdf.

We have been informed that the veterinary services are considering increasing the quantity/density of the (annually dispersed) vaccine-baits. It remains to be seen if this will help discontinuing the concerning further spread of rabies into central Israel, or that further steps, such as control of the wildlife density, will be required. - Mod.AS
