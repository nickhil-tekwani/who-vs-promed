Cutaneous leishmaniasis, Santa Cruz de Yojoa, Honduras
------------------------------------------------------
During the 2nd week of June 2011, the staff of the Francisco Bertrand
Health Center of the city of Santa Cruz de Yojoa treated 7 patients with
skin lesions. Laboratory testing confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis.

Nery Escobar, the chief municipal health authority of this city, expressed
concern about the outbreak of the disease. "So far, in 2011 we have been
working in different communities located in the rural area where the cases
have occurred, but we continue to see more and more patients coming with
the same symptoms."

The 7 cases identified in June are from the communities of El Pedregal and
Zapote; 4 of them occurred among members of the same family, including a 4
month old child.

[Leishmaniasis in Central America including Honduras is has a zoonotic
reservoir and is transmitted to humans by sandflies. There are no recent
data on the number of cases in Honduras. A newsletter from the Pan American
Health Organization PAHO
(http://www.paho.org/english/ad/dpc/cd/leishmaniasis.htm) was updated in
2007 but contains no country specific data.
