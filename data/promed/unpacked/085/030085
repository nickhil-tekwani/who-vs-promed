After the onset of dengue and spurt in malarial cases in the
post-monsoon season, the city is now witnessing a sudden rise in cases
of chikungunya [virus infection], a vector-borne disease [virus]
causing sudden bout of fever accompanied with pain in the joints.

While the out patient departments (OPDs) of government hospitals
including DDU and SPG divisional hospital are reporting more than a
dozen cases of the vector borne disease per day in the festive season,
the health experts are also sounding precautions to curb the spread of
the disease.

As per Sudhakar Pandey, senior doctor in the epidemic cell of CMO
office, the disease witnesses sudden onset of high fever with pain in
the joints and usually make the body weak. The immune system of the
patient is affected and sometimes it proves fatal especially in young
children [This is not accurate; see comments below - Mod.TY]. "The
best prevention against the disease is curbing the growth of
mosquitoes, the vectors for the disease. Apart from maintaining good
personal and community hygiene, prevention against attack of
mosquitoes hold the key," he added.

According to MA Khan, district malaria officer, sporadic cases of
chikungunya have been witnessed in the past and the cases have been
found to swell in the post monsoon season. The fogging operation is
generally held to curb the growth of mosquitoes that tend to swell in
the festive season. "We have already carried anti-larval spray and
outdoor residual spray in sensitive rural pockets and close vigil is
maintained in the urban areas too," he informed.

Meanwhile, sensing the spurt in the cases of vector-borne diseases,
Varanasi Nagar Nigam also intensified the fogging operation carrying
it in the residential colonies to curb the menace of mosquitoes. The
health department under VNN besides covering the main routes in the
city intensified the operation with bicycle mounted fogging machine in
different parts of the city.

[The case fatality rate for chikungunya virus infections is extremely
low, and has only been documented in some 200 cases -- statistically
in the massive outbreak on Reunion Island in 2005 (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20061224.3598) and associated with chikungunya virus
infection in India (especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and
Andhra Pradesh). The European Network for Diagnostics of Imported
Viral Diseases (ENIVD) claims that new phylogenetic variants of virus,
which are fatal, have also been identified on Reunion (see
http://www.enivd.org/). It would be of interest to know which
chikungunya virus variant is circulating in the above outbreak, and if
there are any documented fatalities.

In 2007, there were focal chikungunya virus outbreaks around India
(see ProMED-mail archives cited below).

Sudhakar Pandey's statement about reducing or eliminating mosquito
vector breeding sites as the best preventive measure is important.
Fogging for adult mosquito control provides only temporary population
reduction unless larviciding is also done.
