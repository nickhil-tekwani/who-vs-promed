Update: Measles - United States, January-July 2008
--------------------------------------------------
Sporadic importations of measles into the United States have occurred
since the disease was declared eliminated from the United States in
2000 (1). During January-July 2008, 131 measles cases were reported
to CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], compared with
an average of 63 cases per year during 2000-2007. This report updates
an earlier report on measles in the United States during 2008 (2) and
summarizes 2 recent US outbreaks among unvaccinated school-aged
children. Among those measles cases reported during the 1st 7 months
of 2008, 76 percent were in persons aged less than 20 years, and 91
percent were in persons who were unvaccinated or of unknown
vaccination status. Of the 131 cases, 89 percent were imported from
or associated with importations from other countries, particularly
countries in Europe, where several outbreaks are ongoing (3,4). The
findings demonstrate that measles outbreaks can occur in communities
with a high number of unvaccinated persons and that maintaining high
overall measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage rates
in the United States is needed to continue to limit the spread of measles.

Measles cases in the United States are reported by state health
departments to CDC using standard case definitions and case
classifications. Cases acquired outside the United States are
categorized as importations. Those acquired inside the United States
are considered importation associated if they are linked
epidemiologically via a chain of transmission to an importation or
have virologic evidence of importation. Other cases are classified as
having an unknown source. In the United States, recommendations for
MMR vaccination include a single dose at age 12-15 months and a 2nd
dose at the time of school entry (5). Vaccination as early as age 6
months is recommended for US children traveling abroad and is
sometimes recommended within US communities during outbreaks of measles.

During 1 Jan-31 Jul 2008, 131 measles cases were reported to CDC from
15 states and the District of Columbia (DC): Illinois (32 cases), New
York (27), Washington (19), Arizona (14), California (14), Wisconsin
(7), Hawaii (5), Michigan (4), Arkansas (2), and DC, Georgia,
Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (one
each). 7 measles outbreaks (that is, 3 or more cases linked in time
or place) accounted for 106 (81 percent) of the cases. 15 of the
patients (11 percent) were hospitalized, including 4 children aged
less than 15 months. No deaths were reported.

Among the 131 cases, 17 (13 percent) were importations: 3 each from
Italy and Switzerland; 2 each from Belgium, India, and Israel; and
one each from China, Germany, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Russia.
This is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
(data illustrated by a figure in the original text). 9 of the
importations were in US residents who had traveled abroad, and 8 were
in foreign visitors. An additional 99 (76 percent) of the 131 cases
were linked epidemiologically to importations or had virologic
evidence of importation. The source of measles acquisition of 15
cases (11 percent) could not be determined.

Among the 131 measles patients, 123 were US residents, of whom 99 (80
percent) were aged less than 20 years. 5 (4 percent) of the 123
patients had received one dose of MMR vaccine, 6 (5 percent) had
received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, and 112 (91 percent) were
unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Among these 112
patients, 95 (85 percent) were eligible for vaccination, and 63 (66
percent) of those were unvaccinated because of philosophical or
religious beliefs.

Washington
----------
On 28 Apr 2008, the Washington State Department of Health received
a report of several suspected measles cases in a Grant County
household. The index patient had rash onset on 12 Apr [2008]. During
18-21 Apr [2008], the other 7 children in the household became ill
with fever and rash. 3 of the children developed pneumonia and were
evaluated by a health-care provider who suspected measles; all 3
tested positive for measles-specific IgM antibody. Rash onset
occurred during 13 Apr-30 May [2008] in 11 additional cases
identified in Grant County. All of the 19 cases were linked
epidemiologically, and all but one occurred in children and
adolescents aged 9 months to 18 years. The 19 cases included 16 in
school-aged children, among whom 11 were home schooled. Because of
their parents' philosophical or religious beliefs, none of the 16
children had received measles-containing vaccine. Specimens from 8
patients were submitted for virologic testing, and all contained
genotype D5, which had been circulating in Japan and parts of Europe.
A possible source of the outbreak was a church conference, held 25-29
Mar [2008] in King County, Washington, that was attended by 4 of the
patients, including the index patient. The conference was attended by
approximately 3000 persons, primarily students from junior high
through university age from 18 states, DC, and several foreign
countries. None of these countries or states has since reported
confirmed cases of measles among persons who attended this conference.

Illinois
--------
On 19 May 2008, the Illinois Department of Public Health was notified
by the DuPage County Health Department about a suspected case of
measles. By 27 May [2008], 4 confirmed cases of measles had been
reported to the county, 3 of which were laboratory confirmed. Among
the 4 cases, rash onsets occurred during 17-19 May [2008], suggesting
a common exposure. The 4 patients were unvaccinated girls aged 10-14
years; all had attended an event 5 May [2008] and might have attended
a home gathering 2 days earlier. A teenager who had recently returned
from Italy and reportedly had developed fever and rash attended both
events. Although attempts to obtain further information about the
traveler were unsuccessful, viral isolation from one of the 4
patients yielded genotype D4, a strain circulating in Italy. Through
31 Jul [2008], 26 additional measles cases were reported, all with
epidemiologic links to the 1st 4 cases. Among the 30 cases, 14 were
confirmed in DuPage County, 11 in suburban Cook County, and 5 in Lake
County. One case occurred in a person aged 43 years. The remaining 29
cases were in persons aged 8 months-17 years, including 25 (83
percent) school-aged children, all of whom were home schooled and not
subject to school-entry vaccination requirements. Because of their
parents' beliefs against vaccination, none of the 25 had received
measles-containing vaccine.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The number of measles cases reported during 1 Jan-31 Jul 2008, is the
highest year-to-date since 1996. This increase was not the result of
a greater number of imported cases, but was the result of greater
viral transmission after importation into the United States, leading
to a greater number of importation-associated cases. These
importation-associated cases have occurred largely among school-aged
children who were eligible for vaccination but whose parents chose
not to have them vaccinated. One study has suggested an increasing
number of vaccine exemptions among children who attend school in
states that allow philosophical exemptions (6). In addition,
home-schooled children are not covered by school-entry vaccination
requirements in many states. The increase in importation-associated
cases this year [2008] is a concern and might herald a larger
increase in measles morbidity, especially in communities with many
unvaccinated residents.

In the United States, measles caused 450 reported deaths and 4000
cases of encephalitis annually before measles vaccine became
available in the mid-1960s (1). Through a successful measles
vaccination program, the United States eliminated endemic measles
transmission (1). Sustaining elimination requires maintaining high
MMR vaccine coverage rates, particularly among preschool (greater
than 90 percent 1-dose coverage) and school-aged children (greater
than 95 percent 2-dose coverage) (7). High coverage levels provide
herd immunity, decreasing everyone's risk for measles exposure and
affording protection to persons who cannot be vaccinated. However,
herd immunity does not provide 100 percent protection, especially in
communities with large numbers of unvaccinated persons. For the
foreseeable future, measles importations into the United States will
continue to occur because measles is still common in Europe and other
regions of the world. Within the United States, the current national
MMR vaccine coverage rate is adequate to prevent the sustained spread
of measles. However, importations of measles likely will continue to
cause outbreaks in communities that have sizeable clusters of
unvaccinated persons.

Measles is one of the 1st diseases to reappear when vaccination
coverage rates fall. Ongoing outbreaks are occurring in European
countries where rates of vaccination coverage are lower than those in
the United States, including Austria, Italy, and Switzerland (3,4).
In June 2008, the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency declared
that, because of a drop in vaccination coverage levels (to 80-85
percent among children aged 2 years), measles was again endemic in
the United Kingdom (3,8), 14 years after it had been eliminated.
Since April 2008, 2 measles-related deaths have been reported in
Europe, both in children ineligible to receive MMR vaccine because of
congenital immunologic compromise (4,8). Such children depend on herd
immunity for protection from the disease, as do children aged less
than 12 months, who normally are too young to receive the vaccine.
Otherwise healthy children with measles also are at risk for severe
complications, including encephalitis and pneumonia, which can lead
to permanent disability or death.

The measles outbreaks in Illinois and Washington demonstrate that
measles remains a risk for unvaccinated persons and those who come in
contact with them (9,10). Each school year, parents should ensure
that their children's vaccinations are current, regardless of whether
the children are returning to school, attending day care, or being
schooled at home. Adults without evidence of measles immunity should
receive at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine. All persons who travel
internationally also should be up-to-date on their measles
vaccination and other vaccinations recommended for countries they
might visit. These recommendations include a single dose of MMR
vaccine for infant travelers aged 6-11 months and 2 doses,
administered at least 28 days apart, for children aged more than 12 months (5).

[This update brings together most of the outbreaks reported in
ProMED-mail since the beginning of 2008. Interestingly, the data
taken together indicate that although the number of measles cases
reported during the period 1 Jan to 31 Jul 2008 is the highest
year-to-date since 1996, this increase was not the result of a
greater number of imported cases. Rather it was the result of greater
viral transmission after importation into the United States, leading
to a greater number of importation-associated cases.

For the foreseeable future, measles importations into the United
States will continue to occur because measles is still common in
Europe and other regions of the world. Although vaccine coverage in
the United States is adequate to prevent the sustained spread of
measles, importations of measles will continue to cause outbreaks in
communities that have sizeable clusters of unvaccinated persons. - Mod.CP]
