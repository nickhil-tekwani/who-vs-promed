People in and around Louisiana's capital are being warned to wear long
pants, long-sleeved shirts and insect repellent because eastern equine
encephalitis has shown up in the area's mosquitoes. Although only two
people have been infected and both recovered, eastern equine encephalitis
kills 30 to 60 percent of the people it strikes, according to Dr. Jerome
Goddard, medical entomologist for the Mississippi
Department of Health.
The outbreak has killed dozens of horses and emus in Louisiana, and
officials are trying to contain the disease by spraying pesticides by
plane. Ponds are being treated regularly to kill mosquito larvae.
