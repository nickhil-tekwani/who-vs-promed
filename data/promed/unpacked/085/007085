The rare bacterial infection, melioidosis, has claimed three lives in the
first recorded outbreak of the disease in Western Australia. The One Arm
Point community in the Kimberley is mourning a 57-year-old man and two
women aged 51 and 41 who died after they were infected. Melioidosis is
caused by a ubiquitous soil bacterium - _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_
[_Burkholderia pseudomallei_- and contracted either by walking through
contaminated soil or ingesting contaminated water. Infection is relatively
common in the rice paddies of South East Asia but the last Austra1ian
outbreak was in the summer of 1990-91, when 14 people died in Darwin,
Townsville and Cairns. There have been only 90 cases in the previous 30
years. The One Arm Point deaths are the first known fatalities from
melioidosis in Western Austraila and is the first recorded cluster of cases
in the State.
It has affected five people since November, including the three who died
between late November and New Year's Eve. A 51-year-old woman is being
treated in hospital and another 52-year-old man is receiving antibiotics as
an outpatient. There was one other case of infection, in a 45-year-old man,
recorded and treated in the community in February last year. WA Health
Department director of disease control Jag Gill said the disease was
extremely rare in Australia and usually proved fatal only in people with
existing serious medical conditions. All of these three people had some
condition that made them susceptible to the illness and to death," Dr Gill
said. Chronic lung disease, renal failure or diabetes made people
vulnerable and most health people were able to fight off melioidosis
without showing any symptoms. Acute infection resulted in pneumonia or
septicaemia, with symptoms of fever, aches, pains and abdominal cramps.
Floods, heavy rain and hot weather are associated with outbreaks of the
disease but Dr Gill said it was suspected that earthworks at One Arm point
in October had stirred up the bacteria. Tests on the water supply had come
back free of the organism but soil samples would not be fully analysed
until the end of the week. Transmission was mostly made possible through
contact of the soil with broken skin. Wearing shoes and cleaning and
covering all cuts was the best method of prevention.
Infection in other remote Kimberley communities was improbable and Dr Gill
said no specific warnings had been issued. "lt's not worth testing (other
One Arm Point residents) because many people infected have immunity and
are a symptomatic," Dr Gill said. There was no chance of the bacteria
becoming a threat in the metropolitan area the disease, which occurs in
soil and water throughout the world, was the biggest bacterial killer in
the Northern Territory and north-east Thailand during the tropical wet
season. Australia's most widely published expert on melioidosis,
Associate Professor Bart Currie, of Royal Darwin Hospital, said such a
cluster in the East Kimberley before the wet season in November and
December was unprecedented. Almost certainly it`s related to the earthworks
Professor Currie said.

[Standard microbiology texts describe this infection as often acquired by
inhalation followed by months to years of dormancy, occasionally leading to
a chronic pneumonia that resembles tuberculosis. Underlying chronic
diseases can lead to reactivation of disease. The disease may present as a
fulminant septicemia as described above. - Mod.ES
