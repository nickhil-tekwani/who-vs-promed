Danish officials have solved a _Listeria_ outbreak that had been ongoing for 3 years. Cold-smoked fish products imported from Estonia are the source of the long-lasting outbreak, which had made 9 people sick and linked to 2 deaths since 2016.

Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen), and DTU Food - National Food Institute reported that 2 of the 9 cases that became ill with the same type of _Listeria_ were in 2019. Luise Muller from SSI told Food Safety News that the 1st case fell sick in December 2016; 5 cases were reported in 2017, one in 2018, and 2 in 2019.

"_Listeria_ found in product from the Danish importer is produced in Estonia; we don't know what happened in the production facilities there. We know it is at the Estonian producer, as it is not handled or repackaged in Denmark; it is only relabelled and sent to the Danish consumer. We cannot exclude that more cases could come, due to the long incubation period of listeriosis [up to 70 days]," Muller said.

Cold-smoked fish products have now been recalled by 2 Danish retailers. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration advised consumers that the items should be discarded or returned to the store where they were purchased.

The Danish importer, Food With You, issued a recall of smoked trout after _Listeria_ was found. All dates of "Vores Koldroget Roget Orred," 200 g [7 oz], sold at Bilka and Fotex across the country, are affected. Dagrofa also recalled smoked trout due to the presence of _Listeria_. All dates from 14-27 Mar 2019 of Blue Ocean roget orred, 200 g [7 oz], sold at Meny stores throughout Denmark are involved.

Patients include 4 women and 5 men aged 52-90 years who are spread across the country. Two people died. All patients in the outbreak had serious illnesses that put them at high risk for serious infections.

"We know they died within 30 days from the positive test for listeriosis, but since they are all immuno-suppressed people or people with underlying disease, we don't know if they died from listeriosis," said Muller.

Based on interviews with patients and after finding _Listeria_ in samples taken from the Danish importer, the source of infection was traced to cold-smoked trout and salmon produced in Estonia. These items were sold in Denmark through 2 retailers: Salling Group and Dagrofa.

Muller said whole-genome sequencing was used in the investigation.

"The outbreak was declared in January 2017 when we had 3 matching cases. It is a part of our regular surveillance that we sub-type all human isolates to see if any of them are within the same cluster, and we interview all patients with listeriosis in Denmark regardless of the subtyping. So all this information has been revised along the way, but it is not until now that we have the exact source," she said.

"We are in dialogue with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and other countries to find out if there are any human cases or findings from food isolates in other countries, but this is ongoing at the moment."

In a call to SalmonBusiness, a spokesperson for the authority confirmed it believes it has traced an outbreak of listeriosis from 3 years ago to its source. The agency alleges that fish from Estonian company M.V.Wool are behind [the outbreak].

The prolonged _Listeria_ outbreak has been confirmed by Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, and the DTU Food Institute in a press release. The outbreak included 9 people aged 52-90 who, since 2016, have become ill with the same type of _Listeria_, including 2 people who died in 2019.

An inspection from September of 2018 showed that the Estonian processor's smoked trout products showed a _Listeria_ contamination of 40-570 units, while the maximum is 100.

Based on interviews with patients and after finding _Listeria_ in samples taken from the Danish importer, the source of infection has been designated to be cold-smoked trout and salmon products produced in Estonia. The product -- Blue Ocean roget orred 200 g [7 oz] -- were sold in Denmark through 2 Danish supermarket chains, Salling Group and Dagrofa. Denmark sent Estonia a message through the European food and feed safety alerts system, according to which it has ordered a recall of M.V.Wool's frozen smoked fish products through its Danish reseller.

Luise Muller from SSI told Food Safety News that "_Listeria_ was found in product from the Danish importer, which is produced in Estonia; we don't know what happened in the production facilities there. We know it is at the Estonian producer, as it is not handled or repackaged in Denmark; it is only relabelled and sent to the Danish consumer. We cannot exclude that more cases could come due to the long incubation period of listeriosis [up to 70 days]," Muller said.

SalmonBusiness spoke to a representative from M.V.Wool who strongly disagreed with the accusation. This publication has sent the company several follow-up questions about the Danish authorities' findings.

[This outbreak illustrates the power of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) performed on _Listeria_ isolated from ill persons to identify a cluster of cases that have a common source, as well as the power of WGS performed on suspected food and environmental isolates to confirm the source. There may be additional cases associated with the outbreak strain in other European countries, which is the subject of an ongoing investigation.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

_Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats, like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources for listeriosis due to the fact that _Listeria_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Refrigeration allows small numbers of _Listeria_ that contaminate food at the source to grow to sufficient size to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis. - Mod.ML
