Two more North Island farms have been confirmed as infected with the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_. One is a Hawke's Bay beef farm and the other a dairy farm in Waikato.

The cattle disease was 1st reported in July last year (2018) and these 2 confirmations bring the total number of infected farms to 38, with another 71 under restricted notices. Eleven previously infected farms have now been cleared.

So far almost 24 500 cattle have been culled in the fight against the disease. When the government announced the plan to eradicate the disease, it was estimated that as many as 126 000 animals could eventually be culled.

The Ministry for Primary Industries will hold information meetings in Northland and Canterbury next week.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ can cause lameness, abortions and mastitis in cows, but there is no risk to human health from the infection.
