Three people are sick with malaria in the Madeira archipelago of
Portugal. One is in intensive care for complications of the disease
in the Central Hospital of Funchal; the other 2 remain hospitalized
but stabilized.

These people from Madeira were working in Equatorial Guinea and
returned for the Christmas holidays. There is a 4th, a Brazilian
national who also may be infected and is undergoing diagnostic tests.

Although they are cases of imported malaria, it is noteworthy that
the archipelago of Madeira has a sub-tropical humid climate,
conducive to the development of emerging diseases which are usually
more prevalent in the tropics.

For example, for about the last 3 years the presence of the vector
_Aedes aegypti_ has been documented, and it is now endemic in
Madeira, posing the threat of dengue in the short term. In the
archipelago, including the island of Porto Santo, weather conditions
have allowed the survival of _Anopheles_.

Studies indicate that the next 30 years will see the emergence of
diseases in Madeira, such as dengue, yellow fever, and malaria.

[Portugal reported 41 imported malaria cases in 2008 (Source:
<http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/>). The climate of Madeira in
December with temperatures below 20 C do not support local
transmission of _Plasmodium falciparum_. Malaria is endemic in
Equatorial Guinea, and the risk of infection is high without proper
prophylaxis.

The introduction of dengue fever is a possibility, as in most of
southern Europe. The introduction of yellow fever is a risk because
the vector is present; however, yellow fever is limited to tropical
areas, and Madeira probably does not, at present, have a climate
which supports sustained transmission of yellow fever. - Mod.EP]
