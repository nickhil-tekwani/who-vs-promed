[1] Russia (Krasnodar): H5N1, poultry farm

Russia on Tuesday [4 Sep 2007] reported its 3rd outbreak this year
[2007] of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu after 410 birds died on
a poultry farm in the country's south, but the growing poultry sector
is set to withstand the scare.
Another 414 birds were culled and strict quarantine measures were in
place at the farm in the Krasnodar region after local laboratory
tests confirmed the presence of the virus in dead birds, Russia's
animal and plant health watchdog said.
"It's serious enough to bring in strict measures, including
quarantine, to make sure it doesn't spread," Alexei Alexeyenko,
spokesman for the Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary
and Phytosanitary Surveillance] agency, said. "An investigation is
being carried out to determine the source of the infection."
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain was responsible for the deaths of
birds at the Lebyazhye-Chepiginskoye farm, in the same region where
the virus was detected in dead domestic birds in January [2007].
Russia's 2nd outbreak of 2007 occurred in February [2007], when
several cases in towns around Moscow were traced to the capital's
best-known pet market.
Russia expects to boost poultry meat output 16 percent this year
[2007] to about 1.8 million tonnes, cutting the share of imports
[for] domestic consumption. Russian poultry producers last year
[2006] supplied about 53 percent of the country's consumption.
Dmitry Rylko, general director of the Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies, said Russia's size and its quick reaction to bird flu
cases offered commercial poultry farmers protection against bird flu.
"Such cases will be repeated from time to time in various regions of
the world, including Russia," he said. "In Russia, large-scale
commercial farming is quite well protected against it due to good
quarantine measures and the very low density of the poultry
population, even in the south."
Russia's largest poultry producer is London-listed Cherkizovo
, which last month [August 2007] acquired the country's
4th-largest producer, Chicken Kingdom, for USD 143 million.
Russia is stimulating an increase in poultry production partly by
regulating imports with tariff quotas. Poultry import volumes fell
8.2 percent in the 1st half of 2007, although higher prices meant
their value rose to USD 419.1 million.
Russia last month [Aug 2007] banned poultry from Italy and Germany
after bird flu was discovered at farms in both countries.

[It is indeed very good news that there have been no new outbreaks in
Ghana since the last one reported in June 2007. The Ghanaian animal
health authorities are to be congratulated for their regular
reporting updates during the fallow period between June 2007 and this
final report. However, there is some indication of seasonality in
West Africa, as elsewhere, with disease outbreaks occurring from
November-December through March-April. So, any conclusions about the
ultimate course of the Ghanaian outbreak might best be held in
abeyance until the coming high-risk season passes. - Mod.PC]
