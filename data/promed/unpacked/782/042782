Health officials are blaming the 4 year drought after 5 cases of valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] were recently reported in Washoe County --an illness that is common in south western states, but rare in northern Nevada.

Since 2008, a yearly average of 2 to 3 cases of valley fever have been reported in the region, said Randall Todd, Washoe County Health District director of epidemiology and public health preparedness. Most of those individuals become infected while traveling to other neighboring states, he said.

This year [2015], infected individuals in 2 of the 5 cases said they haven't traveled out of the county, Todd said. Although concerning, it doesn't prove anything, he said. "When we identify a case, (infected individuals) almost always report traveling to areas that have more cases than we do like in California or Arizona," Todd said. "So having a couple of people with confirmed valley fever, but have reportedly not traveled outside the area, it's interesting."

Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis, is [caused by a] soilborne fungus that causes lung infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. People become infected when they breathe in the spores.

Although 60 per cent of infected people don't show symptoms, about 5 to 10 per cent may have long-term breathing problems, Todd said. The illness can also spread to other areas outside the lungs and cause meningitis in about 1 per cent of infected people. The fungus may also affect the nervous system and spinal cord and cause bone and joint problems in others.

Valley fever is common in southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and in the San Joaquin Valley in California. It's also found in Texas, Mexico and most recently in south central Washington [State]. [See ProMED-mail post Coccidioidomycosis - USA: (WA) soil 20140524.2495865.] It's considered highly endemic in southern Arizona and central California. "It kind of just stops shy of us here," Todd said. "The Las Vegas area sees more cases than we do up here. Every time we get one of these cases (in Washoe County), my question to staff is, 'Where have they have been?' " The California Department of Public Health recently issued a warning for valley fever.

"It's [the fungus is] thought to grow best in the soil after a heavy rainfall, but then blow everywhere when it dries up," Todd said. "It's still very much understudied and under investigat[ed], and we don't fully understand how those conditions affect the rates of those diseases. It's amazing; we had a monsoon this July [2015], but we're still in a drought condition," he said. "All you have to do is look at the Truckee River and you'll realize it's been a very dry year."

Reports of valley fever have been steadily rising in south western areas in the past 17 years, according to CDC. In 1998, a total of 2271 cases were reported. In Arizona, 1474 cases of valley fever were reported that year, while California only saw 719. Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah reported a combined total of 72. In 2011, the total number of cases reported peaked at 22 641. Arizona reached 5697 cases of valley fever, while California reached 5697. Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah reported a combined total of 237.

Symptoms include fatigue, coughing, fever and shortness of breath. That also includes headaches, night sweats, muscle or joint pain, and a rash. In extremely rare cases, the spores can enter the skin through a cut and cause an infection, CDC reported. Symptoms usually last a few weeks to several months, but may last longer if the infection worsens. Incubation lasts about 1 to 3 weeks, Todd said.

Valley fever is common in adults 60 or older. People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk and can develop severe forms of the illness. [Such] people include those who have HIV or AIDS, have had an organ transplant or are taking medication such as corticosteroids or TNF [tumor necrosis factor]-inhibitors. Pregnant women, individuals with diabetes, and people within the black or Filipino communities are also at high risk. No vaccine has been developed for valley fever.

"It's an interesting disease," Todd said. "I grew up in the central valley of California, and I suspect if I test myself, I'll probably find that I developed antibodies to this. Once you have this, you won't get it again, unless your immune system is compromised for some reason, then it can reactive," he said.

6 tips to protect yourself from valley fever:
1. Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction or excavation sites. If you can't avoid it, wear a respirator.
2. Stay inside during dust storms and close your windows.
3. Avoid activities that involve close contact with dirt or dust such as yard work, gardening, or digging.
4. Use an air filter at home.
5. Wash cuts with soap and water, especially if you have been exposed to dust or dirt.
6. Take preventive antifungal medication if your doctor says you need it.

[Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the south western United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada and Utah), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. It is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches [5 to 20 cm] of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. The airborne spores can be inhaled and produce an acute infection in humans, as well as other animals.

Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic, but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. It would be interesting to know the frequency of immunologic evidence of prior coccidioidomycosis in populations living in Washoe County, Nevada.

The state of Nevada can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3573696,3549. Washoe County, with a population of 421 407, is located in the north western part of the US state of Nevada. The city of Reno is the Washoe County seat and is known for its casinos. The city, with a population of 225 221 in 2010, is the most populous Nevada city outside of the Las Vegas metropolitan area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno,_Nevada).
