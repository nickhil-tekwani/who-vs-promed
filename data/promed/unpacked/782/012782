Two people have died from Legionnaires' disease at the Wesley Ridge Retirement Community, but it remains a mystery as to how they came into contact with the disease.

"Their best guess is that it's in the water because that's how it's transmitted, through droplets of water that are aspirated into the lungs. It's not a person-to-person contact thing," said Margaret Carmany, CEO for Methodist Eldercare Services.

A team of epidemiologists from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention came to the property on Tuesday [16 Jul 2013] and took 80 water samples, according to the Franklin County Health Department.

Because Legionnaires' disease is transmitted through water droplets, like those from a showerhead, the retirement community told 10TV that it hired a company to superheat all the water pipes to kill the bacteria along with chlorinating the water.

"I'm so sorry, I don't know how we could have prevented this. We are doing everything we can to get this bacteria out of our system, if it's in our system," said Carmany. The outbreak has forced everyone at the location to drink bottled water, and no showers are allowed on site. "For those folks who can't make it off campus, we're providing sponge baths with bottled water," said Carmany. A local hotel is providing showers for others.

The retirement community calls the outbreak a mystery with no explanation about why some people are getting sick or dying while others show no symptoms. "We've got compromised residents, residents who have tested positive for Legionnaire's in every building on campus, and they are separate buildings," said Carmany.

At least 16 cases of Legionnaires' have been reported at the location. The sick residents are between 63 and 99-years-old. At least 5 of the individuals are currently hospitalized.

[Wesley Ridge Retirement Community, operated by Methodist ElderCare Services, offers independent and assisted living, skilled nursing, long-term care, and rehabilitation services, inpatient and outpatient dementia care, and hospice care in a variety of building types on a campus in suburban Reynoldsburg, Ohio (http://www.wesleyridge.com/services#sthash.U8bzQfz6.dpuf). Reynoldsburg, with a population of 35 893 in 2010, is suburb of Columbus, the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio.

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis and is caused usually by inhaling aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of a building's plumbing system. Aerosols of the contaminated water can be generated by showers, spa pools, fountains, and cooling towers. People do not become infected by drinking contaminated water, so it is safe to drink tap water. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.

Although healthy individuals can contract this disease, Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. Retirement communities often house many of these relatively vulnerable people.
