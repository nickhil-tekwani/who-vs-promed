As of [Tue 15 Aug 2017] (until Aug 18), at least 17 scrub typhus (ST) [cases] have been found positive among suspected cases who visited [the] outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). as well as [those] who [were] referred from different hospitals in Kathmandu for laboratory testing. It indicates that ST is becoming more common in Kathmandu than we previously thought. It raises a critical question whether ST is shifting [its] geographic range or [was] frequently under-diagnosed previously or [was] under-diagnosed in urban areas like Kathmandu; [this] deserves further studies. Because, in the past, [the] majority of scrub typhus cases were reported from non-urban remote areas than urban areas of Nepal.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).
