The Department of Health of Valle del Cauca temporarily closed the Davita SAS hemodialysis services following an _Ralstonia pickettii_ outbreak that has infected scores since December [2017], according to an El Pais report (computer translated).

According to the investigations carried out by the Inspection, Surveillance and Control Group of the Departmental Health Secretariat, on 11 Dec 2017, Davita SAS detected the presence of the bacteria among users of the hemodialysis service, and until 20 Dec 2017, it reported the situation to the departmental health authority.

"This public health event is serious, as there was an outbreak in a hemodialysis unit that serves 707 patients, of which 131 have symptoms; 62 of them are contaminated by the _Ralstonia pickettii_ bacterium and have been treated, and 14 patients are hospitalized in stable condition," explained the Secretary of Health of the Valley, Mar√≠a Cristina Lesmes. The investigation has not yet been able to determine the source of bacterial contamination.

Meanwhile, there is a question of determining whether the presence of this bacterium is related to the death of 2 users of the hemodialysis service, which occurred on 22 Dec 2017 and 3 Jan of this year [2018].

_Ralstonia pickettii_, a non-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus, is regarded as being of minor clinical significance; however, many instances of infections with this organism are reported in the literature. Infections can include bacteremia/septicemia caused by contaminated solutions.

"Patients who are undergoing dialysis have decreased defense systems, and, therefore, their risk is greater. The contagion produces a generalized infection called sepsis," Lesmes said.

[_Ralstonia_, a genus previously classified as _Pseudomonas_, includes _Ralstonia pickettii_, _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_ and _Ralstonia insidiosa_ that are linked to human infection. Other _Ralstonia_ species have been linked to plant diseases. _Ralstonia_ are non-fermentative Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that have been isolated from a variety of environmental water sources (http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/jmm/62/7/1025_jmm054759.pdf?expires=1515429040&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=3B60E9466E20294682FBD15D122AF6E5).

_Ralstonia pickettii_ is a nosocomial pathogen, causing infections attributed to use of contaminated solutions such as water, saline, and drugs. These solutions are usually contaminated when the product is manufactured, due to the fact that _R. pickettii_ has the ability to pass through 0.2 micron filters that are used to sterilize medicinal products and has the ability to subsequently grow in the filter effluent, such as 0.9% sodium chloride solution (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4091563). Infections caused by _R. pickettii_ include bacteremia/septicemia, meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16337309).

The investigation of this outbreak in a hemodialysis unit in Valle del Cauca, Colombia has not yet been able to determine the source of _R. pickettii_ contamination. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Valle del Cauca is a department on the Pacific coast of Colombia; its capital is Santiago de Cali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_del_Cauca_Department). - Mod.ML
