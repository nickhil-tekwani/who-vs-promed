Regarding the digest item, PRO/AH> Otter deaths, domoic acid - USA (CA):
not, dated Sun, 23 May 2004 02:52:05 -0400 (EDT):
The Associated Press story indicated that the opossum is not native to
California. However, carcasses of opossums were collected (under license)
in Northern California as road kill remains as long ago as the mid-1980's.
The specimens were properly identified for faunal analysis.
In some rural areas in the north, they are regarded as pests by residents.
They are not as successful in the desert-like regions of Southern California.

[The opossum is the only marsupial native to North America. So when does
an animal become native to an area? West Nile virus made the transition to
endemic from exotic in as short a time as 3 years. I would suggest that
the Associated Press was in error and that the animal should have native
species status. - Mod.TG]
