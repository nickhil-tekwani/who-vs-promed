Luiz Jacintho da Silva

[From these articles it seems likely the vermicide is administered as an
injection. If someone can confirm this as well as exactly how the product
is used, please let us know. - Mod.TG
Rumivac 30 is produced by the Brazilian company Champion
<http://www.champion.ind.br>. According to that website it is an
injectable vermifuge that is also active against ectoparasites: ticks,
blood-sucking flies, screw-worms & others that feed on the blood of
livestock.
Rumivac 30 is for use exclusively on ruminants, & is designed for
meat-producing animals [i.e. not dairy. The active ingredient is
disofenol (2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol).

I have been following this 'outbreak' with interest. One would wonder
what was the preparation injected into these animals. If it was Ivomec,
it would not be dissimilar to the (clostridial) infections we saw in
horses when ivermectin first came to the market in the early 80's. Most
of those cases apparently involved non veterinarian, i.e. owner/trainer,
administered intra-muscular injections. The 'reactions' were significant
enough to cause the voluntary withdrawal of equine injectable ivermectin
by the manufacturer.
