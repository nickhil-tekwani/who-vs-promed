Poison: Toll hits 100 'and may rise'
--------------------------
The death toll from food poisoning in Ukambani and other dry parts of Central
Kenya has risen to 112. Health Minister Charity Ngilu said the figure could
be higher, considering that many deaths went unreported in the remote
areas. "Samples taken in the [worst-hit districts of Makueni and Kitui] have
confirmed that 80 percent of the maize in the homesteads has high levels of
aflatoxin," the minister said.
Ngilu said of the 83 victims earlier admitted at Makueni District
Hospital, 42 have died. At Mutomo, 20 people have died so far with
the rest of the deaths being reported at Makindu Sub-District
Hospital. She said though the latter had admitted 50 patients, half
of them had since escaped from the hospital over what the Minister
described as fear -- and were now presumed dead.
Ngilu, who was giving a Ministerial Statement over deaths that have also hit
Machakos, Mbeere and Thika districts said: "We have reasons to believe [that]
25 are now dead." She said the Government was treating the food poisoning as
an emergency and had put measures to arrest the situation. They include
replacement of affected maize from the 10 000 and 4000 bags of maize and
beans, respectively, in the region and the provision of clean water.
Distribution will be coordinated by members of the armed forces and the
National Youth Service.
The Government had also waived all charges for patients seeking
treatment for the poisoning that the Ministry blames on aflatoxin
caused by fungi thriving in poorly-stored grains.
Ngilu said Government investigations have revealed the source of the
maize was not the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), contrary
to fears expressed by Mwingi South MP David Musila (Narc). She said
although the exact source of the maize was not yet known, initial
investigations showed it had come from Narok district and from
affected area farms. In the latter, it was likely the maize had
actually over-stayed in the stores leading to infection because the
area had not seen a harvest in the last 3 seasons, she said.
Kwanza MP Noah Wekesa (Narc) and Nominated MP Prof Ruth Oniang'o
suggested the Ministry of Agriculture should consider encouraging
farmers to sell their produce to NCPB for safe grain storage.

[Harvested grains are often stored out of doors in some parts of the
world where they are exposed to the elements and subsequently
infected by fungi. This is an all-too-common scenario that has
disastrous consequences for humans as well as animals fed such
contaminated feed.
FAO has provided recommendations for storage of durable foodstuffs
with special reference to storage in the tropics:
