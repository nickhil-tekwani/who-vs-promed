A new study from the CDC revealed that a recent spike in syphilis cases among persons living in the U.S. might be the result of methamphetamine and injection drug use [1]. The study revealed that between 2013-2017, the rate of syphilis cases in heterosexual men and women who also use methamphetamine more than doubled. A key driver of this trend is the noted increase in injection drugs, but most notably the use of methamphetamine. Risky sex behaviors that often accompany such drug use increase the chances of acquiring and transmitting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Such behaviors include multiple sex partners, lack of consistent condom use, as well as exchanging sex for drugs or money.

It's also important to acknowledge that the very aspects of dealing with a substance use disorder can interfere with efforts to prevent the spread of STDs. Persons who are addicted to drugs generally are less inclined to visit a hospital or medical clinic and may be hesitant to identify or find sex partners, which can ultimately lead to adverse outcomes as a result of delays in diagnosis and treatment.

For the study, the researchers evaluated self-reported risk behaviors in heterosexual men and women, along with gay and bisexual men who were diagnosed with both primary and secondary syphilis. The study found that from 2013-2017, the rate of syphilis among women increased nearly 156%, while it only increased 66% among all men. In 2017, the researchers noted that 17% of women with syphilis used methamphetamine, 10.5% used injection drugs, while 6% were found to be using heroin in the past 12 months. The researchers noted a similar trend among heterosexual men, but not among gay men. What's important to acknowledge is that the spike in substance use seen in persons diagnosed with syphilis is similar to the increases noted throughout the U.S. among women and heterosexual men seen in the past several years. The study's findings demonstrate that 2 major public health concerns -- the spike in syphilis cases along with increased substance abuse (particularly methamphetamine) in heterosexuals -- represent 2 intersecting epidemics with devastating consequences.

MSM among gay and bisexual men had been previously identified as one of the main risk factors leading to increased syphilis cases before findings of the current study were revealed. While each "epidemic" alone has the potential to increase syphilis cases, the combined threat is daunting and will require public health officials to coordinate responses on both the mental health and medical fronts to ensure that we address and treat both issues.

What's particularly frustrating from a public health standpoint is that syphilis was nearly eliminated in the U.S. in the past several decades but has continued and made a resurgence, with a notable increase in women of reproductive age as well as newborns. It would be ideal if programs designed to prevent and treat STDs and substance use disorder could integrate the findings of this study to provide more comprehensive care for those affected.

[The summary from the journal article referenced in the news report above is extracted below:

"Summary
-------------
"What is already known about this topic?

"During 2013-2017, the primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rate increased 72.7% nationally and 155.6% among women.

"What is added by this report?

"During 2013-2017, reported methamphetamine, injection drug, and heroin use increased substantially among women and heterosexual men with P&S syphilis.

"What are the implications for public health practice?

"Heterosexual syphilis transmission and drug use, particularly methamphetamine use, are intersecting epidemics. Collaboration between sexually transmitted disease control programs and substance use disorder services providers will be essential to address recent increases in heterosexual syphilis transmission. Linking syphilis patients with substance use disorders to behavioral health services and providing syphilis screening for persons receiving substance use disorder services are needed to address these co-occurring conditions."

After syphilis reached historic lows in the U.S. in 2000, with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people, the United States has since experienced a rising incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis (https://www.cdc.gov/std/sam/2017syphilis.htm). Syphilis rates increased in every region of the US, in a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). More recently, syphilis also increased among women. For example, during 2014-2015, the rate increased 18.1 percent among men, but increased 27.3 percent among women (http://www.loopcayman.com/content/syphilis-cases-increase-1). The increasing incidence in women has been associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis.

The referenced study above showed that during 2013-2017, when the P&S syphilis rate increased 72.7% nationally and 155.6% among women, use of methamphetamine, injection drugs, and heroin more than doubled among women and heterosexual men with P&S syphilis. Similar trends have been seen in Canada (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Canada: (MB) increased incidence, methamphetamine use, 2018 20190131.6287056). The data in the U.S. did not reveal the same increases in drug use among gay men with syphilis, the group with the highest rates of the disease.

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification. - Mod.ML
