The number of measles cases in the Fraser Valley has doubled in the past week, reaching 228 confirmed cases as of Monday [24 Mar 2014], according to the Fraser Health Authority.

Despite the increase, the region's chief medical officer said he is encouraged that hundreds of unvaccinated individuals in the eastern Fraser Valley are coming in to local clinics, pharmacies and doctors' offices to get immunized.

"Despite more than 200 cases, we haven't seen much leakage into the general population," Dr. Paul Van Buynder said Monday [24 Mar 2014]. "At this point, the containment appears to be working around (the eastern Fraser Valley). We are seeing new cases within that community because people who didn't get it in the 1st wave are now getting it." Health officials in the region have been working with school, community and church groups to investigate the outbreak and set up control measures such as dedicated immunization clinics, Van Buynder said.

"If we manage to contain it, as we have so far, then I expect that we'll probably see another hundred or so cases within that community ... but not too much outside."

It is impossible to determine, however, whether members of the religious communities at the centre of the outbreak are now getting immunized, Van Buynder said, noting that people who receive immunizations are not asked about religious affiliation.

There have been no secondary infections linked to a case at Burnaby's BCIT campus, he added. The best protection against measles is 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Van Buynder urged those who have not received the vaccine to get immunized immediately.

Anyone who is not vaccinated and suspects they have been exposed to measles or has developed symptoms should see a doctor, but notify the office beforehand in order to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. The Fraser Health Authority is offering vaccination clinics this week in Chilliwack and Mission.

Two more cases of measles have been confirmed in Ottawa, Ottawa Public Health (OPH) announced Tuesday [25 Mar 2014]. In a news release, OPH said one immunized adult and one unimmunized child contracted the virus from contact with a previous case.

Symptoms of measles may develop 7 to 21 days after exposure to an infected person. Symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough, drowsiness, irritability and red eyes. Small white spots may appear in the mouth and throat. A red blotchy rash begins to appear on the face 3 to 7 days after the start of symptoms then spreads down the body to the arms and legs. This rash usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Symptoms generally last from 1-2 weeks (source: Ottawa Public Health). They said these 3rd and 4th diagnoses since 5 Mar 2014 are not unexpected because virtually everyone who comes into contact with the virus and is not immune will become infected.

OPH said people at the following locations and times should have checked with their healthcare providers if they were unsure about their immunization status:

18 Mar 2014 from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.: Businesses at 411 Legget Drive.
18 Mar 2014 from 1:15 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.: Subway restaurant at 700 March Road.
20 Mar 2014, 6 p.m. to 8:40 p.m.: Shoppers Drug Mart at 1300 Stittsville, Main Street.
21 Mar 2014, 6:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.: Nepean Sportsplex at 1701 Woodroffe Avenue.
21 Mar 2014, 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.: Quizno's Restaurant at 4048 Carling Avenue.
21 Mar 2014, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.: Businesses at 411 Legget Drive.

If you are unimmunized, have a weakened immune system, are pregnant, are a worker in the child or health care sector, or had a child under age one with you when you visited one of these locations during the times above, you're asked to contact Ottawa Public Health at 613-580-6744.

Ottawa's 1st confirmed case of measles in 3 years was announced on 5 Mar 2014 when an unimmunized child returned from the Philippines. Measles can lead to ear infections, pneumonia, swelling of the brain and even death, and is more severe in adults and infants.

Orange County health officials are warning residents of the biggest outbreak of measles in California.

This year [2014], 21 people in Orange County have been diagnosed with the highly contagious respiratory disease, and 7 have been hospitalized. In a typical year, Orange County has no reported cases of measles.

The Orange County Health Department held an emergency meeting Tuesday [25 Mar 2014] night to discuss the unexpected outbreak and encourage residents to get vaccinated. The vaccine is 99 percent effective after 2 doses.

Neighboring counties, such as Riverside and Los Angeles, have also seen a spike in cases.

Measles cases in Orange County this year [2014] have surged to 20, and public health officials said on Monday [24 Mar 2014] that they expect more people to catch the highly contagious disease.

County Health Care Agency spokesman Nicole Stanfield said residents should make sure they have been vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is 99 percent effective after 2 doses.

The agency previously had been issuing notices of potential places of exposure but said the list is now too long. "We know it's in the community," Stanfield said. "The more cases we have, the more people can potentially be exposed." Stanfield said for the 10 most recent cases, 7 adults and 2 children were unvaccinated. The vaccination history of the 10th [an adult] is unknown. The recent cases had come into contact with earlier measles patients, she said. "The important thing is people need to check to make sure they're vaccinated," Stanfield said.

As of Friday [21 Mar 2014] statewide, there had been 36 measles cases reported, although that doesn't include the most recent numbers from Orange County. Last year [2013] at this time in California, there had been 4 reported cases of measles, the Department of Public Health said.

In an interview last week, Dr. Matt Zahn, the county's medical director for epidemiology, said the outbreak has increased demand for the MMR vaccine at doctors' offices and the county's vaccination clinic in Santa Ana.

In a typical year, Orange County sees no cases or one case of measles, an illness that was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.

Measles, an extremely contagious disease, is quickly spreading in parts of California, as dozens of cases have already been reported.

"It starts with a fever, a runny nose, and a dry cough and red eyes. Usually, after around 3 or 4 days into it, [people] characteristically get this red, bumpy rash that starts at the forehead and ears and just goes down the body," the San Diego Health Department's Dr. Eric McDonald said.

There are 47 cases of measles in the state. San Diego's neighbor to the north, Orange County [OC], has nearly half of them. "They're our neighbors, and diseases don't respect geographic boundaries," Dr. McDonald said.

The San Diego Health Department says some of those infected in OC exposed people in San Diego. Investigators had to make sure the disease hadn't spread. San Diego had 4 cases of its own from one person who flew in from out of the country. "We need to reach out and contact well over 1000 people, and give them the information that they were exposed, and also find out if they were at risk," Dr. McDonald said.

All the concern is because measles is so contagious that someone can be exposed [up to] an hour after an infected person leaves the room. "This is one of the most contagious diseases that we know about," Dr. McDonald said.

Public health officials measure the spread of an infectious disease with something called R-naught. For the flu, every person who is sick is expected to infect one [or] 2 people. For measles, every person who's infected can sicken 17 to 20 if they're not vaccinated.

Cases are widespread in certain regions of the word, including Africa, Asia and the Philippines. San Diego health officials are putting up flyers to warn people who travel to those areas to make sure they're vaccinated.

"I only realized it after 3 years staying here in America that I need to have those shots once I go back to the Philippines," one man said.
The man said, after his wife contracted measles in the Philippines, that it is a disease he wouldn't want to get. "I always call my insurance agency [to see] if there's any vaccination that I need to have before going to the Philippines," he said.

Measles is a highly contagious disease and can spread easily through the air, and appears to keep spreading in New York City.

On Tuesday [25 Mar 2014], the number of measles cases went up yet again. There are 21 cases in total now: 10 pediatric cases and 11 adult cases, according to the city's Health Department. The outbreak remains centered in Northern Manhattan, but a case was reported in Brooklyn and other cases in the Bronx.

The cases in New York City range from 3 months to 63 years old. A majority of the children were too young to be vaccinated or within the 12-15 month window when vaccination is recommended.

According to the NYC Department of Education, state law requires that children be immunized against infectious diseases in order to attend school. Parents may request an exemption for either religious or medical reasons. Such requests are scrutinized very carefully and permitted only when standards for exemption are met. Students with exemptions make up about 0.2 percent of the DOE population.

Children without an approved exemption should be excluded from school. If a child has an exemption, the student will not be permitted to attend school if another child is ill with an immunization-preventable illness, according to the DOE. For example, if a classmate of a child with a religious exemption develops measles, the child with an exemption will be excluded from school for a few weeks, according to the DOE.

Of the adults infected, many thought they had been vaccinated but lacked documentation, the NYC Health Department said.

The NYC Health Department tells PIX11 News that no person has gotten sick with measles from being exposed to a contagious measles patient at a hospital, but the Health Department said to call a doctor immediately if you suspect you have measles before leaving to avoid exposing others.

A Whatcom County resident is among those who contracted measles in an outbreak that began earlier this month [March 2014] in the Fraser Valley in British Columbia.

The number of confirmed cases in the Fraser Valley East communities -- Abbotsford, Mission, Chilliwack, Agassiz, Harrison Hot Springs, and Hope -- totaled 237 as of Wed 26 Mar 2014, according to B.C. public health officials.

Officials there declared an outbreak on 8 Mar 2014. Most of the cases were related to a private school with a high number of unvaccinated children, and the outbreak hasn't spread much beyond the Fraser Valley East communities.

The county resident who contracted measles has ties to the school, according to the Whatcom County Health Department. The person has been isolated and is being watched.

"The general public is not at risk," said Dr. Greg Stern, Whatcom County health officer.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is spread primarily through coughing and sneezing. People who aren't immunized are being urged to get vaccinated, not only to protect themselves but also vulnerable community members such as young children.

In an unrelated incident, public health officials put out a warning on Fri 28 Mar 2014 about a person infected with measles who traveled through Sea-Tac airport while contagious. The California resident likely got measles while traveling in Europe, officials said.

Travelers at Sea-Tac during the following times may have been exposed:

- 8:15 to 10:15 a.m. 21 Mar 2014 in Terminal B;
- 6:30 to 10:00 p.m. 22 Mar 2014 in Terminal B.

People who were exposed and who aren't vaccinated could become sick from 28 Mar 2014 through 12 Apr 2014.

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/opinion/remembering-how-to-fight-measles.html


In 1963, when the vaccine 1st came into existence, measles virus infected about 3 million people a year in the United States, hospitalized 48 000 and killed 500. By the turn of the 21st century, however, measles infections had been virtually eliminated. Unfortunately, because some parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children, measles is coming back. Last year [2013], nearly 200 cases were reported. This year [2014], the numbers appear to be even worse, with cases in more than half a dozen states already.

The current outbreak in New York City revealed another problem. The city's deputy commissioner for disease control, Jay Varma, found that some of the cases might have resulted from exposure in hospitals. On 12 Mar 2014, one hospital wrote an email to the staff stating that "nearly 600 patients" might have been exposed. Given its rigorous infection-control procedures, a hospital would seem to have measures in place to prevent such exposures. But the lapse shouldn't be so surprising.

1st, most clinicians and parents have never seen someone with measles. When potential cases come into emergency departments or outpatient clinics, physicians often call in older colleagues to determine whether a child is infected with measles or with other, more common viruses that cause fever and rash. Some of these patients aren't isolated immediately and wait among other people, or walk the halls. That leads to the next problem.

Measles is remarkably contagious. Probably the best example is a measles outbreak that occurred in Indiana in 2005 after an unimmunized teenager traveled to Romania as part of a church group and visited a hospital and orphanage. When she came home, she didn't know she was infected. The next day, at the beginning of her illness -- when she was most contagious -- she attended a church gathering of about 500 people. Of the approximately 450 who had evidence of immunity, less than one percent came down with measles. Of the remaining 50 who did not, 32 percent became infected. Among the 35 church members whose parents had declined immunization, 31 eventually caught the virus, 16 of whom were infected that day. They didn't have to have face-to-face contact with the girl; all they had to do was inhabit her airspace within 2 hours of her having been there.

In my hospital, when someone with measles leaves an examining room, no one else can enter that room for at least 2 hours. They have to wait until the small droplets carrying the virus, which hang in the air like a ghost, settle down.

Clinicians and parents have forgotten how terrifying measles can be. Earlier this month [March 2014], Kristin Cavallari, a former reality-show star and the wife of the Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, told a national television audience that she had decided not to vaccinate her children. "I've read too many books about autism," she said, though the link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly disproved. Ms. Cavallari's cavalier attitude teaches us that not only have we largely eliminated measles; we've eliminated the memory of the disease.

Measles, however, can be deadly. In February 1991, I witnessed an outbreak of measles in Philadelphia that centered on 2 faith-healing churches. Five children died in one month. The city was in a panic.

We're approaching a precipice. If we remain on our current path, measles cases will continue to grow. When we get to about 600 cases of measles a year, we could again see measles deaths, most likely among children. But everyone who isn't immune is vulnerable, including those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons and rely on the rest of us for protection.

What can be done to reverse this trend? One thing we can do is to make it more difficult to obtain nonmedical exemptions. Some states (including California, Washington and Vermont), faced with growing numbers of children with vaccine-preventable diseases, have recently taken that step.

We should also consider returning to some of the tools that helped control the disease in the 1st place, to make the disease come alive without its actually coming alive. I remember when I was a boy there was a wall chart in my pediatrician's office with a title like, "Common Rashes of Childhood." It featured pictures of children with measles, scarlet fever, rubella, chickenpox, and roseola. Below each picture was a one-paragraph description of the disease and an explanation of how to tell them apart. It was fascinating. And it gave my mother and me something to read while waiting for the doctor.

Let's again use charts like this in schools, waiting rooms and anywhere clinicians, parents and children gather. Simple tools like this can put a face to the disease, which is what is needed to instill passion in those on the front lines that this is a disease worth preventing. Otherwise, young doctors and parents will again become all too familiar with measles virus, in the worst way possible.

The Health Service Executive has issued a warning to the public, following an outbreak of measles at NUI Galway.

There are 2 confirmed cases of the condition among students there. The HSE said vigilance is required, given the proximity of many students on campus and the contagious nature of measles.

It is advising all students to ensure they have been given 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Any students who have not received this level of protection should be vaccinated immediately.

The disease can cause serious complications, especially for children. The HSE said a skin rash is the most obvious sign of measles. A person is at their most contagious when this rash is present. Students with a rash, high temperature, or other symptoms should not attend university until 4 days after the rash appears. The HSE West's Department of Public Health is working with the authorities in NUI Galway to deal with the outbreak.

Vaccination clinics may be provided on campus, depending on the requirement.

There has been another case of measles on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.

Queensland Health says a person became infectious while visiting Caloundra last week and also visited Stradbroke Island in recent days. It is the 3rd confirmed case on the Sunshine Coast in the past month.

Dr James Smith says, given the large numbers of people potentially exposed to measles, residents in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast should be on alert. Dr Smith says further measles cases may occur in Brisbane or anywhere in Queensland over the next few weeks.

"If people are adequately vaccinated with 2 recorded doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, they are very unlikely to get the disease," he said. "People who are unsure or have concerns about their immunity to measles should contact their family doctor to check whether they have had both doses of vaccine. True measles is a serious viral infection that causes fever, cough, runny nose, then a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later. Symptoms usually start around 7 to 10 days after infection but sometimes longer, so anyone who develops measles-like symptoms within the next fortnight [2 weeks] should contact their GP for advice. It is very important to call the medical practice 1st to say you could have measles, so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others."

Dr Smith says measles can make people very unwell, and although complications are uncommon, they can be serious.

http://www.guampdn.com/article/20140328/NEWS01/140328005/Public-Health-confirms-case-measles-Guam


The Department of Public Health and Social Services received a report of a laboratory confirmed case of measles.

The patient is a 4-year-old child with no history and/or documentation of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination who returned to Guam on 2 Mar 2014 from travel to the Philippines with the parents, according to a release from the agency.

Epidemiologic investigation has determined that exposure to measles occurred while in the Philippines, the release states.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It is primarily spread through person-to-person contact via large respiratory droplets. Symptoms are characterized by a generalized rash lasting 3 days or longer, with fever (101 F [38 C] or higher) and cough, or coryza (runny nose), or conjunctivitis (red eyes).

It would be advisable for persons traveling to the Philippines to make sure they have been vaccinated for measles (given in combination with the measles and mumps vaccines) 2 weeks before departing. Due to frequent travel of residents between Guam and the Philippines, it is possible that the disease may be brought here.

Public Health is encouraging parents to check their children's vaccination record to be sure they have received their MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.

The current recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are:

- Children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine, with the 1st dose given at one year of age or older and dose number 2 given between 4-6 years of age.
- All persons born during or after 1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of MMR vaccine given on or after the 1st birthday.

All health care providers on Guam are urged to be on alert for possible cases of measles and to promptly report suspect cases to the Immunization Program, Bureau of Communicable Disease Control at 735-7143/7148 or 735-7135.

Furthermore, all health care providers are urged to review and update the immunization status of all patients they see. If vaccination is contraindicated because of illness, a follow-up appointment should be scheduled to update vaccination as soon as the illness is over.

The Tongan Ministry of Health says the country is experiencing a spike in suspected measles, with 400 cases recorded in Nuku'alofa last week.

A medical officer at Vaiola Hospital, Viliami Vao, says about 25 people were admitted to hospital because of the seriousness of their cases. He says the other patients were sent home while awaiting blood test results to have their cases confirmed. But there is some doubt as to whether the fever and rash symptoms being experienced are those of measles, with some saying a mosquito-borne virus being more likely.

Dr Vao says the hospital hasn't seen a spike like this before and is unsure of its cause. "The number for last week was 400 suspected cases of measles, so we are still not sure how we end this spike because it's quite a new situation. We're just hoping this is the peak and from next week we'll have fewer and fewer numbers."

Viliami Vao is calling on the public to be cautious when in crowds to avoid spreading the illness further.
