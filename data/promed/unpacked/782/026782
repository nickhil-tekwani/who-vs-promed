Vanuatu Health authorities have confirmed some dengue fever activity in
Port Vila. The health department has identified eight serological
confirmed cases over the last 2 weeks. The serotype is DEN-2.
At this stage, there has not been a large number of cases. There were 47
clinical cases in the last week of May, and 45 clinical cases to June 8.
There has been a concurrent outbreak of a 'flu-like febrile illness, which
has clouded the picture; however, indications are that case numbers are
remaining low.
Head of the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Unit, Mr. George Taleo,
said [thatthe first case was reported by the Port Vila Central Hospital in
the last week of May. Health authorities have stepped up their mosquito
control program, focussing on both reduction of breeding sites, larviciding
of essential water containers, and spraying for adult mosquitoes in
identified areas of transmission. Local government has conducted a clean-up
campaign as a part of their environment program. The government has
appealed to residents in Port Vila to remove possible mosquito breeding
places, especially tires, flower pots and bases, blocked guttering and
household refuse, and is initiating a community-based mosquito clean-up
campaign.
There have been no cases reported from tourist areas, and there has been no
evidence of spread out of Vila yet. Surveillance and preventive mosquito
control have been stepped in provincial centres. Health staff have
received refresher training in identification and management of [dengue and
dengue hemorrhagic fever, and private doctors have been alerted to the
situation.

[Vanuatu is a tourist destination for Australians and others, so it is
certain the local authorities on Vanuatu will keep a watchful eye on this
situation as it develops, if it develops further. - Mod.CHC
