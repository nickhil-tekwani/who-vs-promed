13 pigs suspected of being infected with hog cholera in Kagoshima
-----------------------------------------------
The Kagoshima prefectural government said, on Wed 21 Jul 2004, that it has
found 13 pigs suspected of being infected with hog cholera at a pig farm in
the city of Kanoya.
The prefecture has imposed a restriction on transferring pigs within a
radius of 3 kilometers from the farm, and, is stepping up efforts to
prevent an epidemic, the prefecture said.
The prefecture has sent specimens to the central government's inspection
institution for further tests. The disease has a fatality rate of almost
100 percent, but it does not infect humans.

[Classical Swine Fever is very contagious. It easily spreads in several
ways, including via pigs that may be incubating the disease, and, via
animal handlers.
It is interesting to note that Indonesia confirmed classical swine fever
yesterday [21 Jul 2004], and now Japan has a suspected outbreak. - Mod.TG]
