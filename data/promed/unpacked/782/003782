West Nile Virus Kills 3 Birds at National Zoo
-------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus killed 2 flamingo chicks and a duck at the National Zoo
this month and is suspected in the deaths of a dozen other captive birds
there. The dead birds are the first victims of West Nile virus in the zoo's
captive population, though the virus has killed hundreds of wild crows in
the District since it was first reported in the United States in 1999. The
virus also has killed birds at other zoos, including in Atlanta,
Philadelphia, and New York.
In hopes of preventing more bird deaths, the zoo's veterinarians are
vaccinating the 300 or so in their captive collection with an experimental
equine vaccine that was used on zebras and tapirs. Zoo staff stepped up
precautions this year, installing mosquito traps and using
mosquito-controlling bacteria in zoo ponds. They already were draining
ponds frequently, aerating them when possible, and eliminating areas with
standing water, zoo spokesman Robert Hoage said.
Birds, especially crows, are the disease's main victims. It also has been
found in horses, cats, bats, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels, and domestic
rabbits. In the District, 26 wild crows have tested positive for the virus
this year, including 3 at the zoo. Keller said West Nile cases this year
have been concentrated west of Rock Creek Park, along Connecticut Avenue.
Last year, when 360 crows died, the high-virus area was in and around
Brookland, in upper Northeast.
Keepers at the National Zoo found their first dead crow in late June. When
a second one was found a day later, zoo pathologists sent tissue samples to
be analyzed at a Cornell University lab designated by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to test zoo birds. The zoo is one of 100
nationwide to participate in a CDC-funded virus surveillance program. Zoo
officials in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore said yesterday that there
have been no West Nile cases this year among their captive populations.
The first dead flamingo chick, a month-old bird whose downy gray feathers
had not yet become pink, showed up on 6 Jul 2002, said the zoo's associate
pathologist, Donald K. Nichols. A second chick died 3 days later. So far,
Cornell has confirmed that West Nile killed the 2 flamingo chicks and a
Eurasian wigeon. The lab has not yet reported results on a dozen other dead
birds (5 flamingos, 3 smews, 2 mergansers, a blue-winged teal, and a second
wigeon), but zoo officials believe they also died of West Nile virus infection.
