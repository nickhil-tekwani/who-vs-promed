Sierra Leone confirms new Ebola case, 2nd in less than a week
-------------------------------------------------------------
Sierra Leone confirmed a new case of Ebola on Wed [20 Jan 2016], its 2nd in less than a week, marking a further setback in efforts to end a 2-year West African epidemic that has killed more than 11 300 people [many unconfirmed. - Mod.JW].

Health ministry spokesman Sidi Yahyah Tunis described the new patient as a 38 year old woman, a relative who had helped care for the earlier victim [MJ] who died from the disease on 12 Jan 2016, and tested positive for Ebola posthumously.
