CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) continues to collaborate with public health officials in multiple states and the Food and Drug Administration to investigate 6 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (for example, water from a turtle habitat). Because most of the ill people who reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.

The 6 multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to small turtles are numbered in the order in which they were identified. The details of each investigation are described below:

Outbreak 1: _S._ Sandiego, strain A and _S._ Newport, strain A
--------------------------------------------------------------
Case count update:
A total of 62 individuals infected with _S._ Sandiego, strain A, and _S._ Newport, strain A, have been reported from 15 states. One ill person infected with _S._ Newport was included in the case count based on epidemiologic and laboratory evidence linking them with this outbreak. The 7 new cases are from California (3), New Mexico (1), Nevada (1), and Texas (2).

Illness onset dates range from 3 Aug 2011 to 24 May 2012. Patients range in age from less than one year to 86 years (median 8 years). 61 per cent of patients are female. Among 44 with available information, 10 (23 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation update:
Among the 47 ill people for whom information is available, 36 (77 per cent) reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. 26 who reported contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; of these, 25 (96 per cent) reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches [10 cm]. Among those reporting small turtles, 10 (45 per cent) of the 22 with information available were exposed to turtles purchased from a street vendor. 10 of the 11 patients who reported the type of turtle they had contact with (91 per cent) reported contact with red-eared slider turtles.

Environmental sampling update:
_S._ Newport, strain A, was isolated from turtle tank water from the household of an ill person infected with _S._ Sandiego, strain A.

Outbreak 2: _S._ Pomona, strain A
---------------------------------
Case count update:
A total of 11 individuals infected with _S._ Pomona, strain A have been reported from 8 states. The 2 new cases are from New York (1) and Pennsylvania (1).

Illness onset dates range from 9 Dec 2011 to 29 May 2012. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 90 years (median 16 years). 73 per cent of patients are female. Among 10 with available information, 3 (30 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Outbreak 3: _S._ Poona, strain A
--------------------------------
Case count update:
A total of 17 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Poona have been reported from 9 states. The 2 new cases are from Tennessee (1) and Texas (1).

Illness onset dates range from 20 Oct 2011 to 6 Apr 2012. Those ill range in age from less than one year to 70 years (median 3 years). 69 per cent of patients are female. Among 12 with available information, 4 (33 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Environmental sampling update:
In May 2012, 2 samples of turtle tank water from the home of an ill person in New York yielded the outbreak strain _S._ Poona, strain A.

Outbreak 4: _S._ Sandiego, strain B
-----------------------------------
Case count update:
No new cases have been reported since the prior update on 10 May 2012.

Environmental sampling update:
In May 2012, turtle tank water obtained in the home of 2 ill people from the same Nevada household yielded the outbreak strain, _S._ Sandiego, strain B.

Outbreak 5: _S._ Pomona, strain B
---------------------------------
Case count update:
A total of 47 individuals infected with _S._ Pomona, strain B have been reported from 18 states. The 8 new cases are from Alabama (1), Arizona (1), California (2), Nevada (1), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (1), and Texas (1).

Illness onset dates range from 21 Jun 2011 to 16 Jun 2012. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 86 years (median 2 years). 49 per cent of patients are female. Among 30 with available information, 9 (30 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation update:
Among the 30 ill people with available information, 19 (63 per cent) reported contact with turtles in the week before becoming ill. Seven ill people who reported contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; all 7 of these (100 per cent) reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches [10 cm]. Four (57 per cent) of the 7 ill people who had contact with small turtles reported buying their turtles from a street vendor.

Outbreak 6: _S._ Poona, strain B, initial investigation announcement
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 25 Jun 2012, a total of 6 individuals infected with _S._ Poona have been reported from 3 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), Pennsylvania (4), and Texas (1).

Illness onset dates range from 1 Apr 2012 to 26 May 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than one year to 74 years (median 8 years). 50 per cent of patients are female. The one patient with available information has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Among the 4 ill people with information available, 3 (75 per cent) reported exposure to turtles before they became ill. The three ill people who reported the size of the turtle they had contact with all described turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches [10 cm]. Three ill people who had contact with small turtles reported where they purchased the turtles, and all purchased the turtles from a street vendor.

In May 2012, samples of turtle tank water from a pet store where 2 ill people from the same Pennsylvania household purchased small turtles yielded the outbreak strain, _S._ Poona, strain B. Also in May 2012, _S._ Poona, strain B (the cutbreak 6 strain) was identified in turtle tank water from a pet store where a Delaware person infected with _S._ Pomona, strain B (the outbreak 5 strain) had purchased small turtles.
