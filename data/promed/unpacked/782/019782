Since April 2008, 383 persons infected with _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint have been
identified in 30 states and the District of Columbia. These were
identified because clinical laboratories in all states send strains
from ill persons to their State public health laboratory for
characterization. The marked increase in reported ill persons is not
primarily due to a large number of new infections. The number of
reported ill persons increased markedly mainly because some states
improved surveillance for Salmonella in response to this outbreak and
because laboratory identification of many previously submitted
strains was completed.

The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows:
Arkansas (2 persons), Arizona (26), California (8), Colorado (2),
Connecticut (2), Florida (1), Georgia (8), Idaho (3), Illinois (34),
Indiana (8), Kansas (9), Kentucky (1), Maryland (10), Michigan (3),
Missouri (9), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (70), New York (9), North
Carolina (1), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (5), Oregon (4), Pennsylvania (2),
Tennessee (4), Texas (131), Utah (2), Virginia (17), Vermont (1),
Washington (1), Wisconsin (5), and the District of Columbia (1).

Among the 243 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 5 Jun 2008. Patients range in age from less
than 1 to 88 years; 47 percent are female. At least 48 persons were
hospitalized. No deaths have been officially attributed to this
outbreak. However, a man in his sixties who died in Texas from cancer
had an infection with the outbreak strain of _S._ Saintpaul at the
time of his death. The infection may have contributed to his death.

State health officials say a New Jersey woman was infected with
salmonella linked to tainted tomatoes. The case is believed to be the
1st in the Garden State linked to an outbreak that has sickened at
least 380 people nationwide. Health and Senior Services Department
spokeswoman Marilyn Riley says the 34-year-old Camden County resident
sought medical treatment in early June 2008 at a Philadelphia hospital.
