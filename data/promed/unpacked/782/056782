An Omani man died of haemorrhagic Congo fever at Sultan Qaboos hospital in Salalah province, [Dhofar governorate] in the southern part of Oman on [Fri 3 Jun 2016], according to the Ministry of Health. The ministry said the man had contracted the disease from handling livestock.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has claimed 8 lives in 2016 so far, according to the Ministry of Health. In 2015, Omani authorities reported 20 cases, and 20 per cent of the patients died. The 1st case in Oman was reported in 1995.

[The 1st case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Oman was reported in 1995.

Between January and April 2016, Oman recorded 6 confirmed CCHF cases, 3 of which were fatal (http://timesofoman.com/article/82756/Oman/Health/Oman's-Ministry-of-Health-announces-two-Crimean-Congo-deaths). The number of fatal cases has increased since then to 8, including the one reported here.

In 2015, health authorities treated 20 patients who contracted tickborne viral diseases, endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia in particular.

The patient in this report had exposure to livestock, which may well have been the exposure leading to disease transmission.

The following prevention and control options are currently available for CCHF:
- education to the high risk groups for possible exposure practices;
- vector/tick control: acariciding (to kill or to destroy mites with a special solution) is not a practical measure except in well managed livestock facilities;
- use of personal protection: prevention of tick bites, avoidance, use of repellents, use of gloves, protective clothing by animal handlers.
