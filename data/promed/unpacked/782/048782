A COVID-19 outbreak in a French nursing home--where 95% of residents, but only a third of healthcare workers, were fully vaccinated-- infected nearly a quarter of residents and 12% of staff, finds a study today in JAMA Network Open. [Burugorri-Pierre C, Lafuente-Lafuente C, Oasi C, et al. Investigation of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a French nursing home with most residents vaccinated. JAMA Netw Open. 2021;4(9):e2125294. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25294, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783985]

Nursing home residents may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and complications owing to impaired immune function tied to advanced age, congregate living, exposure to rotating unvaccinated healthcare personnel, weaker antibody response to vaccination, and underlying medical conditions such as malnutrition, diabetes, and cancer, the study authors noted.

The outbreak occurred in a 77-bed nursing home in Biscarrosse, a town in southwest France, several weeks after the vast majority of residents received 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in January and February [2021]. Of 74 total residents (mean age, 87.8 years; 22.2% men), 70 residents (95%) had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before the outbreak, while 2 (2.7%) had received 1 dose.

The 1st resident was infected by an initially asymptomatic visitor who informed the nursing after testing positive for COVID-19 4 days later. A total of 17 of 74 residents (23%) were diagnosed as having COVID-19, of whom 5 were men and 12 were women. One was unvaccinated, two were partially vaccinated, and 14 were fully vaccinated.

Eight residents became severely ill, 2 were hospitalized, and the 1 unvaccinated resident died.

Of the 102 healthcare workers, 34 (33.3%) were vaccinated, and 68 (66.7%) were unvaccinated. As many as 12 (11.8%) workers tested positive for COVID-19, 5 of whom developed symptoms; none had severe disease. Among the 68 unvaccinated staff members, 9 (13.2%) were infected, as were 3 (8.8%) vaccinated workers, one after full vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine and 2 after partial vaccination with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine.

All infections were attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B117) variant. "To our knowledge, this is the 1st outbreak due to the B.1.1.7 COVID-19 variant described among individuals well vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2," the researchers wrote. They also noted a [30 Apr 2021] study in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on an outbreak of an earlier SARS-CoV-2 variant in a US nursing home where 90% of residents were fully vaccinated.
[Cavanaugh AM, Fortier S, Lewis P, et al. COVID-19 outbreak associated with a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 lineage variant in a skilled nursing facility after vaccination program -- Kentucky, March 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:639-643. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7017e2]

The authors called for further research into ways to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for nursing home residents. "Our study's findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may not be sufficient as the sole means to prevent COVID-19 among [nursing home] residents and that other prevention measures should not be abandoned yet in these settings," they wrote.

[2] Boosters
Date: Mon 13 Sep 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/global-experts-pan-wider-use-covid-vaccine-booster-dose


An international group of vaccine experts, including 2 former US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials, said today that scientific evidence doesn't yet support the broader rollout of COVID-19 boosters.

No drop in protection against severe disease
--------------------------------------------
The group, which also includes experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), based its findings on a review of randomized clinical trials and observational studies. The experts reported their findings today in a Viewpoint piece in The Lancet. [Krause PK, Fleming TR, Peto R, et al. Considerations in boosting COVID-19 vaccine immune responses www.thelancet.com Published online September 13, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02046-8]

Later this week, FDA advisors will discuss Pfizer-BioNTech's application for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, and last week, the head of the WHO pushed for an extension of a moratorium on booster doses until the end of the year [2021] to allow more people in low- and middle-income countries to be vaccinated. https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-brief-fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-pfizer-biontechs-application-covid-19-booster

In the new Lancet review, the authors said observational studies consistently show that the vaccines are still highly effective against severe disease, including severe disease from all variants, with efficacy averaging 80% against any disease.

Though they note that vaccine efficacy is greater against severe disease than against mild illness, even in highly vaccinated populations, those who are unvaccinated are still the main drivers of transmission and are at most risk for severe disease.

In a Lancet statement, Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo, MD, lead author and head of the WHO research and development blueprint, said taken together, the studies don't show credible evidence of declining protection against severe disease--vaccination's main goal.

"Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated," she said. "If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants."

More global headlines

- In China, an outbreak in the Fujian province city of Putian --home to 2.3 million people-- has resulted in a partial closure and other COVID restrictions, according to Reuters. The country reported 42 local cases from the province over the last few days. https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-reports-49-new-coronavirus-cases-sept-12-vs-46-day-ago-2021-09-13/

- Elsewhere in Asia, Vietnamese officials extended restrictions in the country's Ho Chi Minh City hot spot until the end of September [2021], and South Korea is transitioning to a more relaxed COVID-19 response by allowing more people with milder infections to recover at home.

- Australia on [11 Sep 2021] reported a record daily high of more than 2000 cases, as officials in Queensland state considered a circuit-breaker lockdown after a family cluster of cases was detected in Brisbane.

[Re boosters: Also see https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/13/international-review-argues-against-covid-19-vaccine-boosters/

Experts broadly agree that people with compromised immune systems should be receiving 3rd shots of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which were authorized as 2-dose courses. And some experts argue that seniors, who generally mount less robust immune responses to vaccines, should also be eligible for boosters.

But for the general population, experts have been divided over whether boosters are necessary. Some argue that a 3rd shot (or, in the case of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, a 2nd shot) should really be considered part of the initial dosing plan, while others say there is no evidence that the vaccines are losing any strength at protecting people from hospitalization or death from COVID-19 -- the worst outcomes that the shots were primarily designed to guard against.

"Even if boosting were eventually shown to decrease the medium-term risk of serious disease, current vaccines supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations than if used as boosters in vaccinated populations," the paper states.

The authors acknowledge that boosting could eventually be needed for the general population if immunity wanes or a variant emerges that significantly undercuts the vaccines' power. They also point to data showing that the delta variant is leading to more symptomatic breakthrough infections than other variants. But they add that "the message that boosting might soon be needed, if not justified by robust data and analysis, could adversely affect confidence in vaccines and undermine messaging about the value of primary vaccination."

Pointing to the possibility of side effects from boosters doses, the authors write that "if unnecessary boosting causes significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 vaccines."

The FDA, meanwhile, is convening its vaccine advisory committee for a public meeting on Fri 17 Sep 2021 to discuss Pfizer's application for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, at which the topic of whether boosters are necessary is sure to come up. - Mod.LK]

[3] Non-COVID excess deaths

Study looks at US counties' non-COVID excess deaths
---------------------------------------------------
US counties with more excess deaths not attributed to COVID-19 had less health insurance coverage and primary care as well as more at-home deaths, according to a research letter today in JAMA Network Open.

The researchers looked at 2020 data from the US National Center for Health Statistics for 2096 counties with 319.1 million residents and divided county characteristics into quartiles.

Overall, 17% of 2020 excess deaths were not attributed to COVID-19. In counties with the most uninsured people, that share rose to 27%, and counties with the fewest primary care physicians per capita attributed 20% of their excess deaths to non-COVID reasons. Those who reported the least deaths in nursing homes also attributed 23% of excess deaths to non-COVID causes.

The highest share of non-COVID excess deaths (34%) was found when looking at counties in the top quartile of more at-home deaths, which the researchers say could be due to a higher frequency of coroner examinations, a lack of patient healthcare history, and more deaths indirectly related to COVID disruptions, such as drug overdoses.

Counties with more insured people, more primary care physicians per capita, more nursing home deaths, and fewer at-home deaths attributed no more than 17% of excess deaths to non-COVID causes. For 2 metrics, data indicated negative percentages (fewer uninsured individuals, -5%; more deaths in nursing homes, -8%).

Introduction
Approximately 20% of excess deaths in the US in 2020 were not reflected in COVID-19 death counts (1-3). These excess deaths included deaths caused by COVID-19 but not assigned to it as well as indirect deaths from other causes associated with delays in health care and the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. Prior research has documented differences in the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 at the state and county levels (1,3,4). In this study, we examined health care factors associated with excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 at the county level....

Discussion
In this cross-sectional study, a greater proportion of excess deaths were not assigned to COVID-19 in counties with reduced access to health insurance and primary care and in counties with more at-home deaths. Reduced access to health care may prevent a patient from receiving COVID-19 testing and diagnosis, which may reduce the probability of valid cause-of-death assignment. Counties in which residents were more likely to die at home may have been places where indirect deaths, such as deaths from drug overdose, were more likely to have occurred; however, these factors were beyond the scope our study. Cause of death may also be less apparent for at-home deaths, and certifiers may have to make educated guesses based on a patient's medical history (5). Dying at home may also be associated with an increased possibility of a coroner being involved in death certification. Coroners are often lay people who receive less professional training in death certification than medical examiners (6). Limitations of this analysis include use of provisional data; a lack of disaggregated data by age, sex, and race and ethnicity; and a lack of adjustment for other potential factors.

Regardless of the source of the discrepancy, our analysis suggests that marked variation in cause-of-death attribution occurred during the study period. Imprecise cause-of-death ascertainment may obscure the populations most at risk for COVID-19, leading to inadequate policy responses. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including the USA (109 432), UK (30 699), Turkey (24 613), India (24 479), Iran (22 541), Philippines (20 684), Russia (18 178), Malaysia (16 073), Thailand (12 583), Mexico (12 511), and Vietnam (11 172), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6980 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 11 Sep 2021 to late 12 Sep 2021). There appears to be the customary weekend related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 12.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 4.5% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approx. 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 226.09 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.65 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
