Usutu Virus Activity in Austria in 203
--------------------------------------
As anticipated, Usutu virus (USUV) continued to cause avian
mortality in Austria in 2003. Here we report the bird surveillance
data of this year. The first positive bird was found dead on 15 Jul
2003 and the last positive bird on 23 Sep 2003. Thus the time span
of USUV activity for this year almost exactly matched that of last
year's period of USUV activity.
In total, 87 birds were diagnosed USUV-positive by
immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The affected species were 84
blackbirds (_Turdus merula_), 2 great tits (_Parus major_), 1
nuthatch (_Sitta europaea_) and 1 thrush (_Turdus_ sp.). In
comparison to the previous 2 years, the areas of virus activity
were significantly extended this year. USUV-positive birds were
found in the city of Vienna (17), and the federal states of Lower
Austria (65) and Burgenland (5). The districts with USUV activity
(defined as a district where at least one USUV-positive bird had
been found) in Lower Austria were (in brackets number of positive
birds): Baden (14), Bruck/Leitha (1); Ganserndorf (18),
Korneuburg (2), Moedling (2), Mistelbach (1), Neunkirchen (8), St.
Pelten (19, Tulln (6), Wiener Neustadt (6), Wien Umgebung (6),
and in Burgenland: Eisenstadt Umgebung (2), Gussing (1),
Oberpullendorf (2).
These data clearly support the fact that USUV has become a
resident pathogen in Austria and has established an efficient bird-
mosquito transmission cycle. The areas of USUV activity move
predominantly towards the East and South and have already
reached the borders with Slovakia and Hungary.

[Usutu virus is a flavivirus closely related to West Nile virus, but
sufficiently distinct to be ranked as a separate virus species by the
ICTV. This virus is now known to cycle between mosquitoes, birds,
and mammals, and was apparently confined to the African
continent until 2001, when it was isolated unexpectedly from
encephalitic birds in Vienna. There have been no reports of severe
disease in humans.
Recently, serological evidence of Usutu virus infection of resident
and migratory birds in the U.K. has been described (Buckley, A., et
al., Journal of General Virology 84, 2807-2817, 2003), suggesting
that Usutu virus may have reached as far north and west as the
U.K. However, infectious Usutu virus has not been isolated there,
and no avian disease has been attributed to Usutu virus infection in
the U.K. It is suggested that Usutu virus may have been carried
there by migratory birds as persistent low-level infections and may
have become dispersed in the country by indigenous mosquitoes,
remaining as low-level infections. - Mod.CP]
