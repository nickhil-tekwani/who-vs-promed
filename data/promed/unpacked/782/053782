More dead bison have been found in Wood Buffalo National Park, and park staff suspect the cause could be an anthrax outbreak. 14 bison were found dead at Sweetgrass Prairie, in the centre of the park, during an aerial search on the weekend. Another animal showing signs of death from anthrax was found on the park's Parsons Lake Road.

"Parsons Lake Road was already closed, but we put a caution tape at both sides of the road where you can enter the area, and that carcass will be burned," says Tim Gauthier, a Parks Canada spokesperson. Burning the carcasses is the one sure way of killing off anthrax spores, Gauthier added.

34 dead bison were found during an aerial survey last Thursday. Test results to determine whether they died of anthrax are expected back later this week.

Officials say there's no risk to visitors to the park, which is host to about 5000 bison. There have been 13 anthrax outbreaks since park officials started keeping records in 1963.

[I checked with my Canadian colleagues up at the WBNP. Tim Gauthier, PC Communications Officer [<tim.gauthier@pc.gc.ca>] replied that: "Samples have been taken from a number of sites where carcasses were found. Field tests were also conducted, although they came back either negative or inconclusive. We have not yet received the [ADRI] laboratory [Lethbridge, AB] result from the samples we have sent in. We expect to have them back within the next week or so." So, while it is possibly anthrax, it may well be something else.

Troy Ellswoth, Regional Superintendent, South Slave Region, Department of Environment & Natural Resources, Government of the NWT, [<Troy_Ellsworth@gov.nt.ca>] noted that: "We just completed surveys of both the Slave River Lowlands and the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary, and, to date, we have not detected any carcasses." The Slave River Lowlands are on the east side of the WBNP and stretch up to the lake, and the MBS is on the west bank of the Great Slave Lake; see: https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?hspart=Lkry&hsimp=yhs-SF01&p=slave%20river%20lowland&type=YHS_SF_700Â¶m1=iyzTqxyuayxkXZEXjiqI44526MG33mBmsnJAkW5nRMdd1kbhZbGblQW0oqbngVTJppWw78Nvn4f1OHk75yKKe6lw22JeM-swRZYnu6RVg7t72D6xNiM7TY-dE-vjWClx and http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/programs/wood-bison/slave-river-lowlands-population.

During the summer, regular flights are flown to find and locate any dead bison so that they can be quickly checked for anthrax and the carcasses burnt by the hot-shot teams. They are on top of it for sure and very efficient. The places where bison dead from anthrax will be found are well known. MBS has recently re-emerged as affected, but latterly, more seropositive bison have been found in that area as a result of the routine March surveillance bleedings than actual cases. As to the WBNP bison, we will know in a week or 2. - Mod.MHJ
