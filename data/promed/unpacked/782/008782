INFLUENZA - AUSTRALIA: REQUEST FOR INFO
=======================================
In all this "expected" flu activity, I was struck by the inclusion of
Australia and NZ in the list of current infections. This is peak "reverse"
season for flu down there--or are their patterns now somewhat affected by
instant global travel? Have the patterns of flu transmission been changing
(even in some partial degree) in recent years, or is this event very
unusual?? Let's hear comment from the sources down under.
