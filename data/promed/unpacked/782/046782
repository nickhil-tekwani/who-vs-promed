[1] Case update
- 9 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation 8 Jun 2018, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=8564b3ef86

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 8 Jun 2018:
- a total of 59 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 7 suspected;
- 5 new suspected cases, including 3 in Bikoro and 2 in Iboko;
- 5 samples were negative;
- no deaths reported today [total of 27 deaths; 13 of them among the confirmed cases].

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 2145 people have been vaccinated, including 713 in Mbandaka, 498 in Bikoro, 904 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.

Ebola, a month later
- This Sat 9 Jun 2018, the minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, held a press conference to present the results of the 1st month of the government response to the 9th epidemic of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
- In his presentation, the minister of health returned to the events leading up to the declaration of 8 May 2018 before presenting in more detail the specific challenges related to this 9th epidemic and the actions taken by the government to deal with them.
- Beyond the management of the current epidemic, the government's priority is to improve the country's epidemiological surveillance system and the resilience of its health system. Since the Ebola virus has a natural reservoir located in the equatorial forest, the country must expect to face a 10th epidemic and prepare for it. Thus, all the activities supported by the government in the context of this epidemic follow this logic. This includes the establishment of an emergency operations center in Mbandaka and the expansion and strengthening of the Kinshasa emergency operations center.
- In addition, free healthcare, which is now effective in 7 health zones, is part of the government's vision to achieve universal health coverage in the DRC. According to the minister of health, if the DRC manages to make universal health coverage a reality for millions of Congolese in a context as difficult as that of an Ebola epidemic, it means that the country has the means to extend it all over the country.
- Although the chain of transmission is identified and controlled, the minister of health remains cautious because the risk of spread remains high due to the mobility of the population in the affected areas. All efforts are now focused on Itipo, in the health zone of Iboko, where the last confirmed case was reported on 7 Jun 2018.
- Finally, the minister of health emphasized the importance of dialogue and inclusion of communities in the response. Interventions by the Ministry of Health and partners have created interference in affected communities. We are therefore responsible for helping communities to find a social balance that is necessary for sustainable development. To this end, the Ministry of Health facilitated job creation among the young local population in Bikoro and Ikoko-Impenge by initiating community-based work, such as road rehabilitation and transport of national experts. A dialogue with mothers has also been established to identify income-generating activities to increase women's empowerment in affected areas.

[It is not clear if there are 59 or 62 cases of Ebola virus disease, and 5, 7, or 10 suspected cases. The combination of confirmed and probable cases -- along with people who died before testing began -- provides a clearer picture of the trajectory of the outbreak. That number now stands at 52, with 27 deaths.

The possibility of achieving universal health coverage for millions of Congolese is a significant and commendable achievement. It represents a silver lining to the Ebola cloud. Since there is likely to be another outbreak in the region -- this current one being the 9th -- health care for all may help curtail Ebola virus spread. Furthermore, engagement of the community in the response is important and should contribute to controlling the spread of Ebola. It appears that although there are still significant challenges to control, great strides have been made taking into account lessons learned from this and the West African outbreak. - Mod.LK]

[2] 9 Jun 2018. Approach: winning hearts and minds in the newest Ebola zone
[NBC News, summ., edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/winning-hearts-minds-newest-ebola-zone-n881541
[byline: Louise Dewast]

Around 1000 people who have been in contact with Ebola patients have been vaccinated and health workers are working to get vaccine to more remote affected parts of this giant, central African country. And they are working to get the word out to people in city and country alike about Ebola, which has never affected this particular part of Congo before.

It has not been easy, and not only because the region lacks roads, electricity or telecommunications. "These are communities that often deal with many other illnesses, so why is the world suddenly paying attention, coming to their villages to see them," said Mari Nythun Sorlien, an anthropologist working for Médecins sans Frontières (MSF or Doctors Without Borders). "This outbreak has been particularly difficult because we've had a lot cases. Some people have lost multiple family members, so there's a lot of drama and worry," she added.

WHO, MSF, and other groups have learned to take a gentle approach, even as they feel pressed to quickly educate people about the risks of Ebola, whose symptoms can resemble those of a half-dozen common tropical illnesses such as malaria. Patients with suspected Ebola must be isolated as soon as possible and anyone coming into close contact should be protected with layers of gear. The virus is passed in bodily fluids such as blood, feces, and sweat -- all of which can be on the bodies of patients suffering from the virus.

Anywhere between 50 per cent and 90 per cent of people who become infected with Ebola will die. ...

Ebola virus can be transmitted even after death, unlike many other diseases. Burials must be sterile, the bodies wrapped tight. That can go against the grain in communities where sick patients are usually lovingly tended closely, and where the dead are carefully washed and dressed before burial. "It's a human reaction. In every culture, whatever your social background, it's very difficult for someone to be isolated from their loved one whether they are sick or deceased," said Sorlien. "Most important for me is to give a role to the family -- letting them know they can come and visit the treatment center to see their loved ones from a safe distance."

Health workers learned from their mistakes during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, in which 28 000 people were infected and 11 000 died. There, they often lost the trust of communities when strangers stormed in and demanded they hand over their sick and dying. "Before, our approach was top-down and much more medical. This time we made a decision to use a different approach and use community participation," said Raoul Kamanda Mangamfu, a spokesman for the DRC's health ministry. ...

People in this area are not used to hearing about Ebola. And they are not used to taking orders. "Here in Bikoro people like to debate. They don't accept messages as they come, so we spend a lot time explaining where the virus is and how it is transmitted," Sorlien told NBC News. "What works best are community events, Q&As, and discussions. People here like going deep into the issues, which is helpful for us to understand what they are integrating." So trained educators are going door to door, visiting people in their homes. They are calling meetings and using materials they know will work. When possible, people who speak local dialects are employed. "We try using concrete examples and we show them very simple drawings, which are especially helpful with children," said Sorlien, who is working on her 5th Ebola outbreak.

Respect is also important. "When we investigate a case, see a patient, our teams are required to ask permission to ask questions," said WHO representative Dr Franck Mboussou. "Usually it works, and then we ask the patient where they've been and who he/she has been in contact with." ... "People are often worried about side effects, that they'll have to stop working, and so we reassure them," Mboussou said. "We also work with important people in the community, from women's associations or local elected officials for example, and we make sure they accompany us in the field," said Chiran Livera, who leads the International Federation of the Red Cross Ebola response in DRC.

As in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, one of the hardest negotiations is over the funeral. A dozen or more people can get infected with Ebola during the preparation for a traditional burial. "The most difficult for our outreach teams are the burials," said Mboussou. "They've found it's often easier to just bury everyone who dies in the safest possible way, to avoid stigmatizing Ebola victims and their families. Our teams are trained in negotiation and the most important message we always give is that we don't say their family member died of Ebola -- but we explain to them that in a time of Ebola outbreak it is better for the entire community to take precautions," Mboussou said.

Some people were reluctant to believe that a virus was causing the deaths and illnesses. "A majority of people thought it was a masquerade," said a resident of Mbandaka and father of 2. "For example, people who go to certain churches are told the virus is a demon that needs to be chased as the Bible requires." But he said he was convinced by the outreach teams. "In our family, we've made it a habit at home to wash our hands with chlorine," he said. And he said most people now understood the need for hand hygiene. "We also use dispensers at the office and when we go to church," he said. "This is a major logistical and boots-on-the-ground epidemiological endeavor now," Peter Salama, WHO's deputy director-general for Emergency Preparedness and Response, told a news conference in Geneva on [Fri 8 Jun 2018].

"Phase 1, to protect urban centers and towns, has gone well and we can be cautiously optimistic," Salama said.

[3] Status
- 8 Jun 2018. Warning: race against time
[Daily Mail, edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5821781/Ebola-outbreak-DRC-race-against-time-aid-worker-warns.html
[byline: Stephen Matthews]

Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] that is feared to have killed 27 people is a 'race against time', aid worker warns. Officials have already branded the fresh outbreak a 'public health emergency'. International help has flooded in as aid workers battle to contain the outbreak.

Paul Jawor, a water and sanitation expert who works for MSF has just returned home from the African nation, admitted he was 'very scared' about the killer virus in a written account of his time on the ground. Officials in the DRC have already branded the fresh outbreak, which has seen 62 suspected cases, a 'public health emergency'.

International help has flooded in as aid workers desperately battle to contain the outbreak. A mass vaccination campaign has also begun. All neighbouring countries have been placed on high alert and Angola earlier this week [week of 8 Jun 2018] shut a segment of its border to stop the spread of Ebola -- considered one of the most lethal pathogens in existence.

Virologists fear the outbreak is 'reminiscent' of the 2014 Ebola pandemic, which decimated West Africa and killed more than 11 000 people.

Mr Jawor was sent to the DRC on 20 May 2018. He said: "With an outbreak like this, it's a race against time, as one Ebola patient with symptoms can infect several people every day. The best way to contain the disease is to put all measures in place as soon as possible." In a report on the DWB [MSF] website, he spoke of his time battling Ebola in the Equateur province -- where the current outbreak is focused [see: ProMED-mail. Ebola update (29): Congo DR, cases, MSF, antivirals 20180608.5845483].

The outbreak appears to be slowing down. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom today [8 Jun 2018] told Reuters: It's stabilising. We're optimistic, cautiously optimistic."

The current Ebola outbreak began in the poorly-connected region of Ikoko-Impenge and Bikoro -- in the north east of the DRC. It has since travelled 80 miles (130 km) north to Mbandaka, a port city on the river Congo -- an essential waterway -- with around 1.2 million inhabitants.

Virologists fear there is a 'major concern' it will spread to Kinshasa -- 364 miles (586 km) south on the river, where 12 million people live. The city, which is the capital of the DRC, has an international airport with regular flights to European cities Zurich, Frankfurt, and Brussels.

Dr Derek Gatherer, a virologist from Lancaster University, previously warned the fresh outbreak is 'reminiscent' of the 2014 Ebola pandemic. In an editorial for a scientific journal, Dr Gatherer wrote: "The current outbreak has the potential for rapid expansion in numbers." He added: "Mbandaka is a port on the River Congo, the main arterial transport link from DRC's capital Kinshasa to inland cities. With poor to non-existent provision of running water, sewage, and electricity, the similarities with the urban situation... during the west African outbreak are obvious. The risk of transmission to Kinshasa -- central Africa's main megacity -- either by river or by air from Mbandaka's regional airport, is a major concern."

Writing in the Journal of General Virology, he also warned the "question of how to prevent future Ebola outbreaks remains depressingly open" [Gatherer D. Ebola returns to its Congo Basin heartland. J Gen Virol. 2018 May 31. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001096. [Epub ahead of print]]. Dr Gatherer described the DRC basin as "Ebola's heartland". The virus -- endemic in the country -- is named after the Ebola river. The current outbreak of Ebola is caused by the Zaire strain.

There have been 62 suspected cases since the beginning of the outbreak in April [2018] but only 38 have been confirmed in lab tests. Two healthcare workers are known to have been killed from Ebola. Another 3 are known to have had the virus.

In its last situation report, released [Tue 5 Jun 2018], WHO said 880 contacts have been recorded and are 'being followed up actively'. "Our country is facing another epidemic of the Ebola virus, which constitutes an international public health emergency," the Congo Health Ministry said earlier this month [June 2018].

Neighbouring countries have already been alerted about the new outbreak of Ebola, which can cause severe bleeding. DRC borders Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Republic of Congo.

Kenya -- which doesn't border the country -- earlier this month [June 2018] issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola. Thermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border with Uganda and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Concerned health officials in Nigeria, which also doesn't border the DRC, have put similar measures in place to keep its population safe.

Angola shut a segment of its border with the DRC to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus -- even though the outbreak has not yet reached the border. Angolan officials closed the strip of land where Angolans and Congolese most commonly interact. A group of border patrol officers, nurses, and veterinary doctors have also been deployed.

The 2014 international response to the Ebola pandemic drew criticism for moving too slowly and prompted an apology from the WHO. But international aid teams have moved much quicker in response this time -- with vaccination campaigns already underway in several regions. Hundreds of locals and frontline health workers in Bikoro, Iboko, and Mbandaka have already been given the experimental vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV. Currently, there are no proven Ebola vaccines -- but the rVSV-ZEBOV has been shown to be effective in trials in Guinea during the pandemic.

- 9 Jun 2018. WHO: One month marks change of focus
[WHO News, edited]
http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/09-06-2018-at-one-month-mark-in-ebola-outbreak-the-focus-shifts-to-remote-areas

One month into the response to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the focus has moved from urban areas to some of the most remote places on earth. The shift comes after a series of unprecedented actions that have led to cautious optimism about the effectiveness of the response.

A series of firsts
------------------
On 9 May 2018, the day after [the] country declared an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Bikoro, the 1st WHO and Ministry of Health response team arrived in the provincial capital Mbandaka to begin setting up the specialized cold chain needed to store a vaccine that had been successfully used in 2017 to contain another Ebola outbreak.

By 11 May 2018, teams had started to trace contacts of all active cases and WHO partners were setting up treatment centres in Bikoro. The next day, an air bridge was established to Bikoro and a mobile lab deployed to speed up testing for infection.

And then, just 6 days after the alert, the 1st batch of more than 4000 doses of vaccine was on its way from Geneva to Kinshasa. This marked the 1st time vaccines were available so early in a response.

Ring vaccination of contacts began on 21 May 2018.

On 4 Jun 2018, an ethics committee in the country approved the use of 5 investigational therapeutics under the framework of compassionate use, following recommendations from a group of experts convened by WHO. This is the 1st time such treatments were available in the midst of a response.

"It's far too early to declare victory, but the signals are positive and we are cautiously optimistic," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. "We have new weapons and together with the government and our partners, we have acted with urgency to save lives. We will remain vigilant until this outbreak is over."

As of 7 Jun 2018, there were a total of 59 confirmed, probable, and suspected Ebola cases, of which 27 people had died. A new case was confirmed on [7 Jun 2018].

Moving from cities to the forests
---------------------------------
The 1st phase of the response focused on protecting the town of Bikoro and the city of Mbandaka from a potentially exponential increase in cases, which could have threatened major cities in the country as well as its neighbours along the river.

"The next phase is all about expeditionary surveillance: teams of epidemiologists fanning out over hundreds of kilometers by motorcycles through the remote rainforests," said Dr Peter Salama, deputy director-general of Emergency Preparedness and Response at WHO, who returned from his 2nd mission to the country on 8 Jun 2018. "They are working to find each case quickly, tracking the contacts and engaging the communities, including the indigenous population in and around the villages of Itipo and Iboko. We need to pursue the virus wherever it heads and remain agile, responsive and super focused."

As the response in-country continues, WHO is supporting 9 countries bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo to scale up their national emergency preparedness and response capacities. A plan finalized on 7 Jun 2018 outlines how these countries can review their readiness to respond, while identifying any gaps in their capabilities. WHO is working closely with the Ministries of Health and wider government stakeholders, and partners in these countries to put these measures in place.

To reinforce the response and support preparedness, Dr Tedros is traveling to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on [Sun 10 Jun 2018], as well as to the Central African Republic, which is one of the most vulnerable neighbours.

[One hopes that this next phase of 'expeditionary surveillance' will identify individuals at risk who will then be vaccinated, although there is no discussion of the actions that will be taken during this challenging phase of operations besides finding contacts. The indigenous people may demonstrate more reluctance to be vaccinated than people in the cities, and are less likely to understand the dynamics of the disease and mechanisms of spread. Engaging community members with whom they relate, will likely be the most effective approach. - Mod.LK]

- 8 Jun 2018. Ebola outbreak in DRC is 'ongoing' but WHO is 'cautiously optimistic'
[CNN, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/health/ebola-update-who-bn/index.html
[byline: Susan Scutti]

A total 62 people have suffered Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 1st case was reported on 8 May 2018, WHO reported on [Fri Jun 2018]. 38 of the cases are laboratory confirmed, 14 are probable, and 10 are suspected. Over the past month, 27 of these individuals have died.

"The outbreak is ongoing," said Dr Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, in a webcast on Twitter. Salama said he is "cautiously optimistic."

Ebola virus disease, which causes fever, severe headache, and in some cases hemorrhaging, most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. The current outbreak is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, one of 5 separate subtypes and the one with the highest mortality rate, ranging from 60 per cent to 90 per cent, according to WHO.

Beginning with the 1976 discovery of Ebola in an area that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country has experienced 9 outbreaks.

In the past week, one new person was confirmed to suffer from the hemorrhagic disease in Iboko, along with 5 suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro and 3 in Wangata, all regions within the Equateur province. Equateur has an estimated population of 2.5 million spread among 16 health zones, according to WHO.

Salama's optimism arises from the fact that there have been no new reports of illness in Mbandaka, the Equateur province capital, which boasts a population of 1.2 million. "What this is telling us is the response (the WHO's vaccination program) is having an impact in those 2 locations," said Salama.

Since the launch of the vaccination program on 21 May 2018, 1826 people have been vaccinated, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo reported [Wed 6 Jun 2018]. This figure includes 673 people in Mbandaka, 398 in Bikoro, 725 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende, also located in the Equateur province. [According to the MOH report (item [1] above), as of 8 Jun 2018 , 2145 people have been vaccinated, including 713 in Mbandaka, 498 in Bikoro, 904 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

WHO has been working with the Ministry of Health and international partners, including Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) to inoculate only those people at high risk of infection: primary and secondary contacts. "It's extremely likely the vaccine has had a positive effect," said Salama, basing his assessment on the fact that in Mbandaka there have been no confirmed cases since mid-May [2018] and a large portion of contacts have been vaccinated there. Still, everyone remains on "high alert," he said, adding that 2 new confirmed cases in Iboko at the end of May [2018] and a single case on 2 Jun 2018 [reported on 7 Jun 2018 by the DRC MOH. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ], "tells us a lot about why we need to refocus our response." ...

Phase 1 of the vaccination campaign, a plan to protect urban centers and towns, has "gone well," said Salama. During this phase, the plan is to inoculate all health care workers and family members and others who have come into close contact with the ill. "We've reached the majority of contacts -- more than 98 per cent -- with vaccination... and we believe these contacts are now protected against Ebola," he said.

Phase 2 of the vaccination campaign will turn the focus of the response to rural and isolated communities, "some of the most remote territories on earth" and home to "indigenous" and "marginalized" populations, he said.

On the front lines of the outbreak, health officials use a tool called contact tracing to break the chain of transmission of the Ebola virus. It's the identification and follow-up of all people who may have come into contact with a person infected with the infectious disease. Health workers monitor close contacts for 21 days and isolate them should they become ill.

"Overall, the contact tracing has been a huge challenge, particularly in areas hardest to reach," said Salama, noting that Iboko is most difficult. The infrastructure is only beginning to catch up, he added, with motorcycles arriving now. It's a "major boots on the ground" effort that takes several hours to trace each and every contact, he said. "Tough work is going to go on for the next weeks," said Salama.

Dr Vasee Moorthy, WHO research coordinator, said there are 4 unlicensed Ebola treatment products currently available in country: ZMapp (a product of Mapp Biopharmaceuticals), Remdesivir (GS-5734, a product of Gilead), REGN-EB3 (an experimental Regeneron Pharmaceutical product), and a monoclonal antibody treatment created by the US National Institutes of Health.

On [Mon 4 Jun 2018], the Ministry of Health approved the use of these experimental treatments, some used on patients in past outbreaks, during the current outbreak.

"It's clearly very difficult to evaluate efficacy of Ebola products in outbreaks," said Moorthy, who said scientists rely on efficacy data derived from experiments in non-human primates (monkey models). Some of these treatments, when given as late as day 5 of symptoms, led to high protection in monkeys, he said, adding that the choice of product for each patient will be decided by clinicians.

Most recently, a team of Chinese experts will arrive in Kinshasa on [Fri 8 Jun 2018] to join the international effort, which includes nations from the European Union, Japan, and the United States in assisting the Congolese health authorities, according to the Ministry of Health.

"We're cautiously optimistic but there's a lot of work," said Salama. "We've learned the hard way in the past to never underestimate Ebola."
