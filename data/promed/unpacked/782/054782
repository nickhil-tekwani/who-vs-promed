Thirty children died of cholera in the Democratic Republic of Congo's
eastern Kasangani region after drinking water contaminated by flooding of
the Congo River, the UN children's fund (UNICEF) said Tuesday, December 24.
The UN agency said in a communique that the victims were all undergoing
military training at a camp in Kisangani.
It added that 740 people suffering from a diarrhea epidemic were
hospitalized Monday in the Eastern Province of the republic where aid
workers are distributing drinking water.
The agency said although the flood waters were receding in the town, other
towns on the river were flooded, including Mbandaka in the northwest. The
extent of damage was not known. In Kisangani, the flooding destroyed 1,495
homes and left 7,726 people homeless, according to the government.
The floods followed exceptionally heavy rainfall around the Congo River
basin. The Congo runs for 4,650 kilometres (2,885 miles) through the heart
of Africa before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.
The World Health Organisation, UNICEF and Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors
without Borders) began delivering food and medicine to the area at the
weekend.
