Earlier this month [May 2017] the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) quarantined a Weld County facility after a horse residing there tested positive for equine infections anemia (EIA). Now, 6 additional horses at that premises have tested positive for EIA, as well.

On [Thu 4 May 2017] the CDA's State Veterinarian's Office received notice of the positive test from the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The index horse was euthanized following the positive test. At the time, the CDA placed the horse's home facility under a quarantine order restricting the movement of other horses until further testing was completed.

On [Fri 19 May 2017], the Equine Disease Communication Center reported that "3 horses out of 9 horses exposed ... tested positive for equine infectious anemia. Six horses are now quarantined. None of the horses testing positive had clinical signs of the disease."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to a non-infected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies, and more rarely through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia.

[This is sad news for this stable, and for horse owners. Vector control practices, including application of insecticides and repellents and environmental insect control, should be implemented. Hopefully the facility has already done this.

Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places. [Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine 20150915.3645562]. - Mod.TG
