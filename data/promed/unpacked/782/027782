In ProMED posting "Saltwater poisoning, canine - USA: (FL) fatal 20180714.5905907," Mod.MHJ wrote: "Just because you haven't witnessed this problem in the past when playing with your dog at the beach doesn't mean it won't happen next time. So be cautious, and make sure you bring water for your dog to drink. Follow Dr. Katy Meyer's advice."

Right on target, and as a postscript, we can add that we have considerable experience with panics about alleged rabies outbreaks that turned out to have resulted from thirsty dogs 1st guzzling and then vomiting out salt water, which looks at a glance like the classic "frothing at the mouth" of a rabid dog.

Most notoriously, this was a problem in Sri Lanka after the Indian Ocean tsunami in late December 2004, but it was already familiar to animal disaster relief workers then and has occurred many times since.

Most dogs will vomit out saltwater before it kills them. The South Florida case was a bit unusual in that the deceased dog kept the saltwater down for several hours, and then the owner apparently didn't make the connection of the vomiting and diarrhea with the earlier saltwater ingestion.

[Many thanks to Merritt for his informed and experienced comment. It is a hot summer in the US, so we can expect too many dogs drinking seawater because of their thirst. - Mod.MHJ
