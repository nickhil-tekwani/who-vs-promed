Much to the horror of the animal bearers, a large number of deaths have been reported within a week in Ghotki and Sukkur [Sindh province]. According to the villagers buffaloes and cows feel congested in breathing and die in a short time span. The sudden death of buffaloes, cows, and goats has forced the breeders to watch their means of livelihood die in front of their eyes. Moreover, some 1.5 million domestic animals are believed to be suffering from this unknown disease.

I [reporter Hashim Abro] appeal to the President of Pakistan to direct the concerned provincial departments to set up campus for the treatment of the domestic animals in the affected districts and also direct the veterinary doctors to make regular visits to the villages throughout the province so as save the domestic animals, which become a sole source of income and livelihood for poverty and sorrow-stricken villagers in the rural areas of Sindh province.

[Official confirmation of an actual acute health problem in the Sindhi livestock (cattle, buffaloes, goats) and available results of any veterinary investigations applied, will be appreciated. In the absence of epidemiological or detailed clinical information, toxicological, environmental, as well as infectious causes deserve to be considered. - Mod.AS
