To date the government has already destroyed either 7,125 sheep from 93
flocks, the figure Dr. Claude Lavigne, head of animal health programs for
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency gave Ontario Farmer, or more than
10,000 sheep, a figure government officials have provided to the Quebec
sheep federation. There are public concerns about compensation and
government liability.
Farmers are angry about inadequate government compensation. And many
believe the disease came from sheep the federal government provided from
its flock at La Pocatiere, Que., because, apparently, the first flock
identified in this present scrapie situation was a multiplier flock with
stock obtained from there.
Dr. Lavigne was cited as saying that there's no evidence that's true and
says that guess "has not been confirmed." Tracing scrapie is difficult
because the incubation period is 5-7 years and confirmation is only by
brain histology. It also appears to affect sheep breeds differently.
John Speed, vice-president of the Quebec sheep federation, was cited as
saying it supports the government's efforts to control scrapie, but
compensation is inadequate. Lavigne was further cited as saying that the
government has hired consultants to examine the compensation issue,
including all livestock and not just sheep, and expects to have a report by
October.
Farmers say that because compensation is so low, and because there are no
cheap and effective in vivo tests, they are better off to keep quiet when
they spot an animal with symptoms. Some call it three three-S solution -
Shoot them, Shovel them into the ground, and Shut up. That's illegal
because scrapie is a legally reportable disease.
One Quebec farmer who was breeding F-1 sheep from the genetics provided
from the federal government's breeding program at La Pocatiere called in
federal officials when he spotted symptoms. The government confirmed
scrapie, then began tracing the whereabouts of all the animals that this
farmer had sold to others. The list was long because the provincial
government had offered subsidies to encourage the widespread dispersal of
the improved genetics from La Pocatiere.
It also explains why concern has centered on Quebec. Every year there are
scattered reports of the disease - for example, one flock has been
identified in Ontario, leading officials to three additional flocks this
year - but never has the government slaughtered so many sheep. Speed was
further cited as saying the disease is not serious for sheep producers
because it tends to show up in so few animals, and then only when they are
old. But Canada has always wanted to keep it to a minimum.

[1996: 7 cases of scrapie diagnosed -- 4 in Quebec and 3 in Ontario, from 6
sheep flocks. Three flocks were depopulated. A total of 57 laboratory
submissions were made in 1996. No scrapie was diagnosed in goats.
1997: 47 cases of scrapie diagnosed -- 38 in Quebec (14 flocks) and 9 in
Ontario (2 flocks). Ten flocks were depopulated. No scrapie was diagnosed
in goats.
While it may be infrequent this disease can have significant constraints on
interprovincial and international trade in live sheep, and negatively
affect buyers' confidence. - Mod.MHJ
