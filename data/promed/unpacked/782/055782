The number of mumps cases rose to 94 in the Dallas area this week [week of Sun 14 2017]. At the same time, the Department of State Health Services confirms numbers in Central Texas are rising too -- 5 in Travis County in March and April [2017], and 2 cases in Hays County. Public health experts say the MMR vaccine is the key to stopping the outbreak from reaching the Austin area, but even if you got the shots, you may not be immune to the mumps.

That's because the MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective, meaning about 1 in 10 people won't develop the antibodies to fight off the diseases and won't know it.

At Austin Public Health's Far South Clinic, the health care workers are in the business of stopping preventable diseases. That includes mumps. "We have seen a large outbreak in the Dallas area, in Cedar Hill," said public health educator Colleen Christian. "Here in Travis County, we haven't seen anything like that. We do have a few cases of mumps reported." Christian believes there were no cases reported in Travis County last year [2016].

Christian says many adults may not be immune to mumps. "For it to be as effective as possible we recommend people get 2 doses of the vaccine," she said. But 2 doses weren't recommended until the late 1980s. ...

Adults born before 1957 likely have immunity from being exposed to the mumps virus before the vaccine was made available to the public. But if you were born between the late 1950s and late 1980s, doctors can test to see if you have immunity to the mumps. "To find out if you are immune to the illnesses that the vaccines protect against, you could have a titer run which is where they draw your blood and look at the amount of antibodies that are available," Christian said.

Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, throat pain and swelling of the salivary glands between the ear and jaw. If you have those symptoms, or you've been in contact with someone connected to the outbreak in North Texas, call your doctor.

A total of 2 new mumps cases have been diagnosed that are unrelated to the Chapman University outbreak, the Orange County Health Care Agency said [Thu 18 May 2017].

The 2 patients, both in their 20s, did not have contact with the 13 Chapman students who fell ill between January and 18 April 2017, but had close contact with each other. One became sick in April [2017] and the other earlier this month [May 2017].

Neither had traveled outside the country and public health officials are still determining if they had been vaccinated.

Dr Matt Zahn, the county's medical director for epidemiology, said Orange County has had 17 mumps cases so far this year [2017]. The county usually averages fewer than 5 cases a year, with most of those the result of international travel. Zahn said in an email that while it's encouraging that Chapman has not had a new case in a month, it's too soon to say the outbreak is over.

The incubation period for mumps is up to 25 days and he said at least 2 incubation periods should pass.

Symptoms of mumps include: fever, headache, tiredness, muscle aches and swollen and tender salivary glands.

In an advisory sent to health care providers, the agency said all Chapman students who have received fewer than 2 doses of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella shot should be vaccinated.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recommended 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent effective against mumps, while one dose is 78 percent effective.

The Onondaga County Health Department has reported 5 cases of mumps in Onondaga County over the past few days.

According to department officials, one case was at West Genesee High School and 4 cases were reported at Syracuse University. All of the students were vaccinated.

The OCHD says that the mumps vaccine is roughly 88 to 90 percent effective.

All cases are still under investigation, and parents and students of these 2 institutions will receive notifications from health department.

Mumps is a serious contagious disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions.

Symptoms include: fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears or along the jawline on one or both sides. Health officials say an ill person can transmit the disease for 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands. There is no specific treatment.

The Hawaii State Department of Health announced 5 new cases of mumps [Thu 18 May 2017], bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 47 this year.

The DOH says the new cases involved children and adults located on Oahu.
None of the patients required hospitalization.

Numbers of confirmed cases began to rise in March [2017] when the DOH was made aware of 9 people with the viral infection.

Some 10 DOE schools have also been reportedly affected by mumps cases.

In December, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the country was in the midst of its worst mumps outbreak in a decade.

From [1 January -- 22 April] of this year [2017], 42 states and Washington, D.C. reported mumps infections in 2570 people.

Mumps is highly contagious; symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Some people with mumps have very mild or no symptoms.

The disease is not considered life threatening, but there are some lasting side effects, including the swelling of salivary glands and swollen jaws.

The DOH says they are expecting to see a continued increase in reported cases as the disease spreads. They advise getting the MMR vaccine to protect against the disease.

In 2015-16, outbreaks were reported from several university campuses, including a number of smaller outbreaks with limited spread. The 2 largest outbreaks were from Iowa and Illinois, each involving several hundred university students; both held wide-scale vaccination campaigns. - Mod.LK
