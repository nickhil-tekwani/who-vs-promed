The Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) has deployed rangers in Binga's Mlibizi area to help contain an anthrax outbreak that has so far claimed the lives of 1 person, 17 hippos, and fish.

ZimParks spokesperson Mr Simukai Nyasha said that they had received a report that another hippo died over the weekend [29-30 Apr 2017] to add to the previously reported deaths. He said they had partnered with the Forestry Commission and Campfire in deploying rangers who are monitoring areas affected by anthrax, a life threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affect animals.

"Our rangers are guarding and patrolling the area, and we are glad villagers are no longer accessing the meat of the affected animals and fish. The monitoring was suggested as a way of preventing villagers from eating meat from carcasses of the affected animals in order to curb the spread of human anthrax," said Mr Nyasha. "Last week we discovered dead fish in Mlibizi River at the same area where hippos died due to anthrax. Apparently 27 dead fish were picked up and samples were collected and sent to the Department of Veterinary Services for analysis."

Matabeleland North provincial medical director Dr Nyasha Masyuka said that the anthrax outbreak was under control. "As long as villagers are warned and monitored not to eat more of the affected hippo meat and the dying fish, we are sure that the outbreak is under control. During the past week we didn't receive any reports of deaths of those affected by anthrax and we hope to keep it that way. We are continuing to educate the community about not eating meat from animals that die in their own. We are also disinfecting areas where hippo meat was disposed or buried," he said.

The Ministry of Health & Child Care, Binga CPU, Binga RDC, the Environment Management Authority and ZimParks as well as traditional leaders have partnered to control the outbreak.

[Over the past we have seen a number of reports out of Zimbabwe which added little or nothing, either to the number of human cases or dead hippos. However with more feet on the ground they are reporting 17 hippos dead, up from the initial "dozen". As hippos will eat their dead companions it is probable that this is a cause of the added deaths.

Reporting dead fish associated with hippos dying of anthrax is new to me. Fish are not susceptible to this disease so it presumably reflects water quality and maybe oxygen deficiency from the decomposing hippo carcasses. In the past, sick and dying crocodiles have been noted in relation to hippo deaths from anthrax. That also needs clarification as crocodiles are missing from the literature of African park animals confirmed dead from anthrax; see ME Hugh-Jones & V de Vos. Anthrax and wildlife. OIE Scientific & Technical Review 2002; 21(2): 359-383 http://web.oie.int/boutique/index.php?page=ficprod&id_prec=81&id_produit=623&lang=en&fichrech=1.

I have been thinking about how best one might in reality, not scientific fantasy, properly dispose of anthrax affected hippo carcasses. They are not small and finding the manpower and trees to burn them in the African bush is easier said than done, and there are usually many hippo carcasses to dispose of. The same applies to burying their carcasses, if you can find the necessary heavy equipment to dig a big enough hole. Tarp them? Possibly, but would a tarp last long enough, 6 months, to do its job? I fear that the tarps might walk. And the contaminated ground has to be soaked with 10 per cent formaldehyde. As the vegetative cells of _B. anthracis_ do not survive long in water so why not just leave the carcasses in the water to decompose? The anaerobic decomposition plus carcass acidification will efficiently kill the pathogen. We are hearing of dead fish so there are some risks associated with leaving hippo carcasses in the water instead of hauling them out and contaminating the river bank.

I would like to suggest to our African colleagues that the next time that they are presented with hippos dead from anthrax that they critically examine what is happening, take samples not just from the carcasses but from the environment, wet and dry; apropos one might have to take culture media out to the field as any vegetative cells in water samples might not survive the trip back to the laboratory. And also what risk does a floating hippo anthrax carcass present to its live herd mates? Outbreaks must be stopped as quickly as possible. A dozen dead hippos are probably acceptable though regretted but not 24, 30 or 50. - Mod.MHJ
