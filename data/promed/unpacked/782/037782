Plague scare grips Himachal, 3 dead
-----------------------------------
Three people have succumbed to a mysterious disease with plague
symptoms in the town of Rohru in Himachal Pradesh; 10 more people with
a similar infection have been put under quarantine in the state; 5
patients were admitted at Chandigarh's Post Graduate Institute of
Medical Education and Research, two of whom are in serious condition.
A team of experts from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases
(NICD) arrived at the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) hospital in
Shimla and took a blood sample of a patient recovering from a
respiratory illness. The specialist team has moved to the Hathkoti
area near Rohru where the disease was first reported from for
collecting blood and sputum samples.
While the administration tried to allay fears by claiming that no
fresh cases were reported, there was panic in Shimla and Rohru
districts. People rushed out to buy preventive doses of tetracycline
and doxycycline and medical staff in hospitals wore masks to work.
Official sources in the state disclosed that leave of all doctors and
paramedics had been cancelled. Schools in the area were closed.
Doctors at PGI said one of the patients, [a woman died on Thursday.
Her husband was the first victim of the disease -- he died of internal
bleeding a week ago in Rohru.
Health authorities are still clueless about the disease. Said PGI's
Medical Superintendent Dr A.K. Gupta: "The symptoms of pneumonic
plague, anthrax and any other respiratory infection are similar, so
the final diagnosis cannot be made until we get the test reports."
While the NICD team told the Hindustan Times that the culture reports
of the microbe were still awaited [they are expected on Mon 18 Feb,
according to todayÂ´s Times of India. - Mod.JW, doctors at IGMC
maintained that it was pneumonic plague. An IGMC doctor said there was
a less than 1 percent chance that the disease was anything but plague.
Himachal health authorities feel the cause of the infection might have
been contact with some wild animal. "Those affected had gone hunting
just before the onset of the disease," said a doctor.
The Rohru-Jubbal region has had a history of plague outbreaks. One
occurred in 1965 and another in 1984, when eight persons died before
the disease could be contained.
OUTBREAK
How it spreads: For plague to infect a human population, four elements
must converge: the agent (the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_), a vector
(the flea _Xenopsylla cheopsis_), a reservoir (rat) and a human host
Incubation: In humans, the disease sets in after 3-7 days after
infection
Symptoms: High fever, chills, cough, breathing difficulty, body pain,
blood in sputum
Who is at risk? Outbreaks occur in areas with poor sanitation
Types of plague Bubonic (flea-borne, from infected rodents to humans)
Septicemic (spread by direct contact with infected tissues or fluids)
Pneumonic (spread by respiratory droplets from animals [& humans with
pneumonic plague)
Is it a terminal disease? Not really. The mortality rate is 15% when
diagnosed and treated
Treatment: For those who think they are vulnerable, a single dose of
the antibiotic Doxycyclin is enough.

Re: completely unnecessary panic that swept Siliguri, India -- & the
world -- in 1994 ... - Mod.JW>
Just a point of factual correction about the location referred to,
"Siliguri." Siliguri is the site of the deaths from [still
unexplained illness noted in postings to Pro-MED beginning with
20010220.0328, & occurred just about a year ago in 2001. This city is
located in the state of West Bengal, in eastern India.
The plague of 1994 was in western India, in the states of Gujarat &
Maharashtra.

[I stand corrected; I confused Surat, the 1994 plague focus, with
Siliguri. - Mod.JW
