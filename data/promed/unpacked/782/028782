1. The EC is not a member of [the WHO. Compliance with the International
Health Regulations (IHR) is not mandatory.
2. Compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is
contingent upon risk evaluation. In the absence of an approved and
formalised system of quantitative risk assessment, and of generally
accepted levels of tolerable and unacceptable risk, the EC is perfectly
entitled to aim for a different level of health protection than that
considered sufficient by other parties.
