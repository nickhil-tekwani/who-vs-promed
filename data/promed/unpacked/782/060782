Bovine ephemeral fever (3-day sickness) has been detected in the Hunter Region. Mid-January [2022] saw confirmed cases near Maitland, and within a fortnight, the outbreak has now spread through the Lower Hunter in areas including Dungog, Stroud, Gloucester, Barrington, and up the Hunter Valley.

Three-day sickness is a viral disease of cattle and buffalo which affects animals for only a few days following a sudden onset of a fever, severe drop in milk production, or animals' lack of eating and drinking.

"Cases have not yet been detected around more coastal parts of the MidCoast area," a representative from Hunter Local Land Services said. "This appears to be an example of the disease erupting in the Hunter before making its way down the coast from Queensland, which is the more usual pattern of spread, and because we haven't had to wait for its arrival from the north, this outbreak is also a month or 2 earlier than normal."

Due to a widespread outbreak in March and April 2020, many cattle alive at that time were exposed to infection and developed immunity. Consequently, most of the cattle presently affected are young cattle and cattle brought in from further west or south that have not previously had the opportunity for exposure, although there are sometimes older cattle in the herd that have also escaped infection from previous seasons.

"Unfortunately, problems with vaccine availability means producers who had wanted to vaccinate have been unable to do so until now, as vaccine supplies have only just started to arrive on private jets," Hunter Local Land Services said.

NSW Local Land Services reminds all owners of cattle to monitor herds daily for lethargic, dull, drooling, or lame cattle (lameness often appears shifting from leg to leg) and ensure owners have adequate resources to support exposed cattle.

Affected cattle often seek shade due to the high fever the virus creates.

"If they are down, protection from hot sun, a tub of water, and hay is crucial as cattle can die from dehydration associated with BEF.

"In most cases in young, light cattle, the disease is mild for one to 3 days, but heavier cattle, bulls, and cows are likely to need extra care; bulls in particular can suffer infertility from the fever, and cows can abort," Local Land Services said.

Veterinary advice should be obtained in any sustained cases.

[It should be noted that bovine ephemeral fever is not a zoonotic disease.

The following is excerpted from Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th edition:

"Diagnosis
-----------
Although the clinical and epidemiological presentations of bovine ephemeral fever are highly characteristic, laboratory confirmation is required. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer, or preferably, seroconversion, can be detected by enzyme immunoassay, including blocking ELISA, by neutralization assays, which are virus specific, or by immunofluorescence or agar gel precipitin tests, which are cross-reactive with related rhabdoviruses. Although virus isolation was the traditional 'gold standard,' real-time RT-PCR assays are now routinely employed to achieve rapid (i.e., 'same day') confirmation of bovine ephemeral fever.

"Immunity, prevention, and control
---------------------------------
Infection results in solid, long-lasting immunity. Because outbreaks tend to involve a high proportion of animals in a herd, repeat clinical episodes usually involve young animals born since previous outbreaks. Prevention by vector control is impractical in the areas of the world where this disease is prevalent. Vaccination has been used in endemic countries, including Australia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey. Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are used, although repeated immunization is often required. Problems with conventional vaccines stem from their lack of potency: inactivated vaccines require more antigenic mass than it has been possible to achieve economically, and live-attenuated vaccines suffer from a loss in immunogenicity linked to the attenuation process (see Chapter 4: Antiviral Immunity and Virus Vaccines). Immunization with the bovine ephemeral fever virus G protein alone can confer protective immunity in cattle, as can recombinant vectors that express this protein." - Mod.TG
