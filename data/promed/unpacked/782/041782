Detection of grapevine virus B associated with rugose wood (corky bark)
symptoms in grapevine cv. Napoleon in Murcia (Spain)
------------------------------

Departamento de Biotecnologia y Proteccion Vegetal. Instituto Murciano de
Investigacion y Desarrollo Agrario y alimentario (IMIDA), c/ Mayor s/n,
30150 La Alberca (Murcia), Spain. Accepted for publication 5 Nov 2004.
During a survey in early spring 2004, of table grapes cv. Napoleon in
Murcia (Spain), symptoms of rugose wood and corky bark were observed in
several plants. The causal agent of the rugose wood disease complex, which
includes corky bark, has been attributed to members of the _Vitivirus_
genus, such as Grapevine virus A (GVA) and Grapevine virus B (GVB)
(Martelli et al, 2000). GVB has been recognised as the primary cause of
corky bark in grapevine (Nickel et al, 2002).
A total of 18 plants from 9 different fields showing corky bark symptoms
were analysed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
with specific primers for GVA (H7038; C7273) and GVB (H6980; C7439)
(MacKenzie et al, 1997). All samples tested positive for GVB, producing a
single band of the expected size of 460 bp, but none were positive for GVA.
Petiole extracts of 2 symptomatic positive plants, in phosphate buffer (pH
7.5) containing 2.5 per cent nicotinic acid, were used as source for
mechanical inoculation of _Nicotiana benthamiana_ and _N. clevelandii_ [Nc]
(isolates M5 and M9). Only inoculated Nc showed symptoms: systemic stem
necrotic spots and leaf malformation. These plants tested positive for GVB
when tested by RT-PCR.
The products were cloned in pGEMT-Easy vectors (Promega) and sequenced
(EMBL Acc. No. AJ748850 and AJ748851 respectively). The nucleotide identity
of both isolates (M5 and M9) was 81 per cent in the 416-bp region
corresponding to the partial ORF encoding the RNA binding protein, with
respect to a published Grapevine virus B sequence (Acc. No. X75448;
Saldarelli et al, 1996).
The deduced amino acid sequences of isolates M5 and M9 were compared to
X75448, the analysis revealed that they shared identities of 85 and 84 per
cent respectively and a similarity of 93 per cent in both cases. These and
other isolates are now being further characterised, by sequencing other
genome regions and determining the host range with additional test plant
species.
Within Europe, GVB has previously been reported from Italy, France, Greece
and Portugal, but to our knowledge this is the 1st report of GVB in Spain.

[The vitiviruses are a genus of viruses associated with the rugose wood
disease complex. 4 vitiviruses are known: A (GVA), B (GVB), C (GVC) and D
(GVD). All are transmitted by mechanical inoculation, those infecting
grapevine with greater difficulty. Transmission is by grafting, and
dispersal through propagating material is common with grapevine-infecting
species. GVB is transmitted in a semi-persistent manner by different
species of pseudococcid mealybugs in the genera _Pseudococcus_ and
_Planococcus_. GVB is widely distributed. Vitviruses are presently linked
with rugose wood disorders, and some progress has been made in the
understanding of their basic genome structure. Full-length infectious
molecular clones of GVA and GVB from Italy have been used to inoculate
grapevines in an attempt to provide essential pathology. GVA is associated
with Kober Stem Grooving and affected vines may show swelling at the graft
union and fail to thrive.
Ungrafted vines may be infected, but usually do not show symptoms. GVB is
associated with corky bark disease. The disease affects only grafted vines.
The severity of corky bark is more pronounced in vines infected with other
rugose wood complex viruses. Corky bark causes an incompatibility to
develop at the graft union. Leaf symptoms resemble those of Leafroll but
are more severe. Leaves on cultivars such as "Pinot Noir" may develop a
yellow chlorosis before they turn red. The wood at the base of canes may
swell slightly, causing the bark to split. Depending on the cultivar,
various wood groovings also may occur. Neither GVC nor GVD have been proven
to cause disease in grapevine, but their structure and genetic profiles
have shown that they belong to the Vitivirus genus. Detection technologies
include grafting to indicator hosts, serology (primarily ELISA) and PCR.
Disease management depends upon use of certified healthy stock or known to
be virus-free. Trees should not be planted in soils where viruses have been
found previously. Trees exhibiting suspicious symptoms should be removed.
