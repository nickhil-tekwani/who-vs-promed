As I understand it, there is not a single, documented case of natural
brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle. It is hoped that legal
decisions are based mainly on "just the facts, m'am, just the facts." It
remains amazing to me the power that a minor minority, ranchers, can wield
in the legal and political arenas. This group constitutes a single-digit
percentage of the population, but dictates a significantly greater
percentage of policy in western states. Much of the west awaits a true
sense of political representation that bases its decisions on scientific
evidence when dealing with the animal that symbolizes the American West.
As bison cross the invisible, artificial, and arbitrary line of the park
boundary and are hence shot, it illustrates sharply western society's
persistence in thinking that humans are separate from the rest of nature.
It is this very philosophy that has been responsible for many emerging
infectious diseases. Extreme efforts to bottle up, pen up, and otherwise
control nature have resulted in backlashes by nature, most notably by the
microbes.
ProMED-mail is doing an excellent job in reporting emergent diseases, but
it also shines in its efforts to show the social, economic, psychological,
and political contributions made to those outbreaks of disease.
