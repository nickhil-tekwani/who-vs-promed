Abstract
A novel pestivirus species was discovered in a piglet-producing farm in Austria during virologic examinations of congenital tremor cases. The emergence of this novel pestivirus species, provisionally termed Linda virus, in domestic pigs may have implications for classical swine fever virus surveillance and porcine health management.

[Background]
The genus Pestivirus consists of 4 approved species within the family Flaviviridae. Besides bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, border disease virus (BDV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), several unassigned strains and tentative species are represented by the so-called atypical pestivirus strains. An atypical pestivirus of swine emerged in 2003 in a commercial pig-breeding farm in Australia and was later termed Bungowannah virus (BV). This well-studied virus caused reproductive disorders, stillbirth, and sudden death in piglets, resulting in the loss of around 50 000 animals in the 2 affected farms. Because of its marked pathogenicity, BV was considered a threat to global pig health, but this virus or relatives were never found at other location.

Recently, a novel group of porcine pestiviruses, termed atypical porcine pestiviruses (APPVs), was discovered. These viruses were identified in North America (3,4) and subsequently detected in Europe. There is strong evidence that APPVs are a causative agent behind the type A-II congenital tremor (CT A-II) syndrome of piglets (4). CT A-II is characterized by a generalized shaking of the whole body associated with variable degrees of hypomyelination in the brain and spinal cord. However, hypomyelination is also apparent in the brains of fetuses of sheep, cattle, and pigs after late-gestation state infection with BDV, BVDV, or CSFV. We report results of an investigation of CT in piglets on a farm in southeastern Austria in which a novel pestivirus species was discovered.

The Study
A small-scale piglet-producing farm in Styria, in southeastern Austria, reported major piglet losses from CT in January 2015. Animals from this farm were examined and samples were taken by authorized veterinarians. The CT-affected piglets showed a severe lateral shaking and were often incapable of sucking milk, which led to elevated preweaning death rates. The prevalence of CT varied from 20-100 percent within the affected litters. Litters affected by CT were not used for the production of replacement gilts. The outbreak of CT abruptly stopped in July 2015, when all sows had produced 1 CT-affected litter. Only 22.4 piglets per sow were weaned in that year, compared with an average of 25.8 piglets/sow/year before CT symptoms occurred. Pathological examinations were performed as described previously, confirming the presence of typical CT A-II lesions.

Conclusions
A previously unknown pestiviral agent was found in CT-affected piglets on a farm in Austria. We observed a severe hypomyelination in the entire white matter of the spinal cord and detected pestivirus antigen in the brain of the CT-affected piglets, suggesting a causal relationship between infection and lesions. Analyses of the assembled genome allowed an unambiguous assignment of LV within the genus Pestivirus with regard to the presence of pestivirus-specific genes (Npro and Erns) and sequence homology to other pestiviruses. In contrast to APPV, which hardly infects cultured cells at all, LV could be easily propagated on porcine cell lines without the need for adaptation, similar to what has been reported for BV. We suggest that LV likely shares a common ancestor with BV.

After its description around 10 years ago, BV was intensively sought worldwide, but the virus has never been detected outside Australia. The broad cell culture tropism of BV led to the hypothesis that the virus recently jumped from another species to porcine hosts. The discovery of a related pestivirus with substantial sequence divergence in swine on a different continent suggests that both viruses probably have a porcine origin. The identification of the cross-reacting E2-specific monoclonal antibody 6A5 indicates that a cross-reactivity to related pestiviral proteins exists, which might interfere with the serologic testing for CSFV. Further work is needed to investigate the prevalence and the epidemiology of LV in Europe and to assess its virulence in controlled animal experiments.

[It is nice to see the thorough characterization of this atypical swine pestivirus and a description of its pathogenicity. This virus presents a potential significant threat to swine production in Austria and beyond. One assumes that this virus and the disease it causes will be included in swine health surveillance in Austria and other European countries. Readers interested in the details are urged to see the entire report and the video it contains.

Interestingly, in 2015, a veterinarian described tremors due to infection with a novel swine pestivirus as similar to those seen with Parkinson's disease in humans, but more severe. The Kansas State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory identified and characterized a proposed new species of pestivirus, named atypical porcine pestivirus or APPV. It was identified through metagenomic sequencing of swine serum samples submitted to the diagnostic lab.

The search for the etiologic agent(s) of porcine congenital tremors continues to lead to the discovery of previously unknown agents. While congenital tremors may mimic the clinical signs of Parkinson's disease, the immediate onset after birth and association with early parity sows has suggested an in utero agent(s) was(were) the inciting cause. Although congenital tremors have deleterious effects on individual litters or farrowing groups on some swine farms often requiring euthanasia of the affected piglets, the relative rarity of the condition compared to other diseases in swine production makes it unlikely any of the agents will be widely tested for outside of affected herds. However, if one of more of the agents in question are found to interfere with testing for agents like CSFV as has been suggested for Linda virus, it may necessitate the development of a rapid differential field test given the on-going spread of CSFV into Europe and the ongoing eradication efforts in several European countries. Cross-reactivity would also have international trade consequences that could severely affect export markets so clearly being able to differentiate CSFV from the atypical porcine pestiviruses will be critical for certain nations and may necessitate changes in screening procedures used at ports of entry for pork products. - Mod.JH

I am struck by the statement, "The outbreak of CT abruptly stopped in July 2015, when all sows had produced 1 CT-affected litter." which may imply that immunity may develop fairly quickly. - Mod.TG

I would point to the apparent resemblance of the clinical signs (video) to Border disease (Hairy Shaker) in lambs. - Mod.AS]
