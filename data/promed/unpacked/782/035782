China is dumping chemicals into a southern river to try to neutralize
a toxic spill and contain the 2nd environmental disaster to hit the
country in as many months, a local official and state media said on
Friday.
The cadmium-containing slick, which has cut tap water for tens of
thousands of people downstream for 5 days, was flushed into the North
River running across Guangdong province north to south from a
Shaoguan zinc smelter last week.
The government has already lowered dam gates at the Baishiyao
hydropower plant near Yingde, 90 km (54 miles) downstream from
Shaoguan, to try to stall and dilute the pollutants. Now it is to
dump chemicals into the water, Yingde government spokesman Huang
Zhensheng told Reuters by telephone.
"With only 1200 tonnes of the chemicals, toxicity can be reduced by
30 percent," the Southern Metropolis News quoted an expert as saying.
Cadmium, a metallic element widely used in batteries, can cause liver
and kidney damage and lead to bone diseases. Compounds containing
cadmium are also carcinogenic.
In China's northeast, the front of a slick of benzene compounds that
poisoned drinking water for millions after a chemical plant blast
last month has crossed the Russian border through the frozen Amur
River. China apologized again to Russia on Thursday, while Russia's
far east city of Khabarovsk readied alternative water supplies,
though taps had not been turned off. "Analysis of the water showed
that the benzene content does not exceed ... the maximum allowable
concentration," RIA-Novosti news agency quoted an Emergencies
Ministry official as saying.
"As a result, the city authorities have decided not to turn off the
Khabarovsk water supply."

[There are a number of chemicals that may work as chelators for
cadmium, but in excess, they may be as likely to cause problems as
not. Metals such as selenium, zinc and mercury all interact with
cadmium. So I am unsure what chemical has been chosen to chelate the
cadmium. - Mod.TG]
