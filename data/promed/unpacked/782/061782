- Brazil (Alto Floresta, Mato Grosso state). 12 May 2011. Suspected
dengue cases now total 173 between January and April [2011], a
reduction of approximately 47 per cent in relation to last year
[2010], when there were 325. Nevertheless, the Department of
Environmental Surveillance does not discard the possibility of an
epidemic due to the high prevalence of mosquito infestation in
different parts of the city, such as the Setor Norte 3, with [an
_Aedes aegypti_ household index of] 4.08 per cent.
