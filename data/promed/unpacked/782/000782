The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Health placed a barn under quarantine after 2 horses tested positive for EHV-1.

According to the Equine Disease Communications Center, on 7 Dec 2018, the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory in Harrisburg, PA confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy in a horse with hind limb ataxia, which tested positive for EHV-1 (G-strain).

As of 10 Dec 2018, 2 horses were affected, and both horses have been euthanized at the premises, a pleasure horse barn in Snyder County. Eight horses remain on the premises and are being monitored for clinical signs of EHV-1 infection, and biosecurity precautions have been implemented to prevent the spread of the virus off of the premises.

No additional clinical signs have been noted in the remaining horses.

[The number of horses having been euthanized this year (2018) alone because of this disease is heartbreaking. I believe it is especially sad, because we really have nothing, no vaccination, no specific treatment, just supportive care, to try to treat these animals. I realize it takes quite a bit of time to research a disease and try to produce a vaccine. But this disease is not new, yet I do not know of any ongoing work for a vaccine. Somehow, when West Nile virus struck our horses, the companies and researchers jumped on this disease, and we had a provisional and then complete vaccine in relatively short order, so we know it can be done, but why hasn't it been done? - Mod.TG
