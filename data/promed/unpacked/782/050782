Potato growers on the Atherton Tablelands in far north Queensland are
being warned a new virus has the potential to seriously set back the
industry.

Growcom spokesman David Nix says the disease known as 'virus Y' has
shown up across most seed potato growing areas in southern states. He
says seed potatoes should be tested before planting because the virus
is a serious threat.

"It is a significant disease particularly in processed potatoes and
the washed variety because it produces a brown necrosis on the skin of
the potato and in processing that brown area cooks black," he said.

Mr Nix says the virus has been found in southern growing areas and
every effort should be made to stop it spreading to the Tablelands.
"There is a test that can be done on the seed before you get it and
it's important that growers know their seed source and know that it
has been tested for the disease. It's very important that we keep as
strict a control of it as we can," he said.

[_Potato Virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of
the most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber
quality. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum, and some other related
species. Symptoms vary depending on viral strains and susceptibility
level of host cultivar. They may include mottling, distortion, and
necrosis of leaves and stems, premature defoliation, tuber necrosis,
and plant death, or no symptoms at all.

It is transmitted by aphid vectors in a non-persistent manner, with
_Myzus persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be
spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected
planting material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and
other potato viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use
of resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus
reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful.

If virus-infected seed tubers are used, virus populations and numbers
of co-infecting species and strains will build up with every crop
cycle. Even more severe problems may result if viruses in infected
seed tubers are moved to a different area where they may combine with
local pathogen populations and/or encounter lack of host resistance.
The risk posed by the use of farm-saved seed tubers and the emergence
of new PVY strains has recently been reported from different areas
(see ProMED-mail posts listed below).
