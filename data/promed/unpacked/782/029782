Another 4 wild Formosan ferret-badgers have been determined to be infected with rabies, bringing the number of confirmed rabies cases in animals in Taiwan to 49 since an outbreak was reported in mid-July 2013, authorities said Wednesday [7 Aug 2013]. The new cases were found in Chihshang Township in Taitung County, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center.

The 49 confirmed rabies infections to date have all been detected in Formosan ferret-badgers except for one case in which the disease was found in an Asian house shrew, the center said.

The confirmed infections have been discovered across 31 townships in 8 counties and cities in Taiwan. No humans have been found to be affected by the disease.

[It must be presumed that the person earlier reported to have been bitten by a rabid ferret-badger received immediate post-exposure prophylaxis and is now considered no longer to be at risk. The widespread distribution of the rabies-infected ferret-badgers indicates that rabies virus is likely to have been present in Taiwan for some time and is not a recent introduction.
