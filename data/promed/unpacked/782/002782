In Florida, More Cases of Ciguatera Poisoning from Fish
-------------------------------------------------------
Numbers are increasing in Florida of people getting sick from toxic
fish. The culprit is being narrowed down to grouper, as 5 more
individuals have been diagnosed with ciguatera. This type of
poisoning is caused by the consumption of certain subtropical and
tropical marine fish.

In Palm Beach County, the health department has confirmed that 5 more
people have become seriously ill from ciguatera just in the last
week. The health department usually only has a few cases in a year's
time. In recent years, Florida has had outbreaks of ciguatera
resulting from kingfish and amberjack. Other fish known to cause the
illness include barracuda, snapper, jacks, mackerel and triggerfish.

Signs of poisoning will usually occur within 6 hours after
consumption of the toxic fish. Symptoms include numbness, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. Some have even had experiences where they were
unable to discern between hot and cold (hot items felt cold and cold
items felt hot). The signs of poisoning usually only last several
days but severe cases have been known to persist for months.

Even with the numbers of ciguatera rising in South Florida, the CDC
has not issued any warnings against eating grouper at this time. A
warning of this kind could hurt a wide range of businesses as grouper
is one of the more popularly eaten fish in many restaurants.

What can you do to protect yourself from ciguatera poisoning? Experts
agree there really aren't any foolproof ways to protect against this
type of food poisoning. A person buying the fish at the store or even
catching it fresh in the ocean will not know by appearance if the
fish is toxic. The fish will have no signs from taste, smell or color
if it will cause ciguatera. Two of the individuals that have become
ill had eaten fish they caught themselves near the Bahamas.

[In February 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a
warning regarding ciguatera fish poisoning from Mexico. Perhaps this
alert was an early warning of conditions this year being right for
production of this toxin.

Readers are referred to ProMED-mail posting 20080207.0497 which
provides information regarding fish susceptible to the poisoning, as
well as clinical signs and symptoms in human beings. - Mod.TG
