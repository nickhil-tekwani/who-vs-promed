With the wind season gaining pace in the past week, a viral disease called 'parvo' has begun taking a toll on the dogs in [the city] Trichy [Tamil Nadu]. The lack of awareness on the treatment for the disease has put canines at the risk of death.

Being an airborne disease, the parvovirus has already infected several dogs in the city. This was evident from the number of dogs that were brought to the veterinary polyclinic in Palakkarai in Trichy. There are 13 such polyclinics across the district and sources said that all clinics were witnessing a rise in such cases since the commencement of wind season.

An animal welfare activist claimed that the polyclinic in Palakkarai received 20 to 30 cases of parvo daily in the past week. "Though viral diseases affect dogs normally, it is virulent during the wind season," said honorary animal welfare officer G Ramakrishnan. He pointed out that there was a huge gap between the number of affected dogs and those being brought for treatment. He blamed the public for not identifying the virus and not bringing the affected dogs to veterinary centres for treatment.

It was observed that majority of pet lovers were unaware of the symptoms of parvo. Affected dogs will exhibit symptoms such as diarrhea with blood, fever, weight loss, weakness, etc. "People can easily notice that affected dogs would not take food for 2 days continuously. This is a major symptom. If not treated immediately, the dog may die," said Ramakrishnan.

People's unawareness would result in the disease spreading to other dogs in the area. Doctors advise 5 to 7 days treatment to save the dogs from the virus.

"Parvo affects pups from when they are 2 months old. Once infected by the disease, the dog will develop immunity to fight the virus. But they should be treated when they are affected for the 1st time," said clinician Dr V Varadharan, veterinary polyclinic, Palakkarai.

Stating that most dogs infected by parvo are left untreated to die, Ramakrishnan suggested organising camps in all areas by NGOs to identify stray dogs and vaccinate them, to prevent such diseases including rabies. It may be noted that there was no survey on stray dogs in the district.

[Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is one of the most important enteric pathogens of dogs. This virus is extremely contagious, causing high morbidity with increased incidence in shelters, pet stores, and breeding kennels. The disease is characterized by a rapid clinical course with death that can often occur 2-3 days after onset of signs in non protected hosts. It can affect dogs at any age, but severe infection is most common in puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. All breeds are susceptible to the disease, although the mixed breeds are described to be less susceptible than many purebreds. Rottweilers, Doberman pinschers, English springer spaniels, American pit bull terriers, and German shepherds are the purebreds that have been reported with higher risk for CPV enteritis.

Throughout the years, 3 genetically-differentiated variants of CPV-2 have been identified globally: CPV-2a (VP2 426Asn), CPV-2b (VP2 426Asp), and CPV-2c (VP2 426Glu). India is one of the countries in which all 3 variants have been identified in affected canines (see "Fig. 3. Geographical distribution of 3 CPV variants based on 426 residue detected in domestic dogs worldwide" on page 2048 of ref 1 below; http://tinyurl.com/ydbmkd6a).

The infection is generally acquired by the faecal-oral route through the contact with faeces from infected dogs or contaminated surfaces. Upon entering the body, the virus affects mainly mitotically active tissues, such as the lymphoid tissues, intestinal epithelium, and bone marrow, as well as the heart in neonatal pups. Following an incubation period of 3-7 days, the disease can be characterized by 2 clinical forms, the enteric form that comprises vomiting, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, depression, loss of appetite, fever and dehydration in younger dogs. Myocarditis may be seen after infection of neonatal puppies, where the clinical signs are seen a number of weeks after infection. Canine parvoviral infection is also characterized by a drop in the white blood cell counts as a result of the infection of the bone marrow infection and other lymphoid tissues.

The main method for controlling the disease in domestic animals is by vaccination. After the emergence of the disease, modified live virus vaccines were soon developed, with the 1st CPV vaccine becoming available in 1979. The vaccines appear to be safe and to confer protective immunity allowing much of the disease to be controlled. However, the virus is still widely distributed in nature, and if pups are not vaccinated, and or when maternal antibodies interfere with their vaccination, they generally become naturally infected. The evolution of the virus raises questions about the efficacy of some vaccines, so that an understanding of the variation is required. For the above and additional information on canine parvovirus, subscribers are referred to the review in ref 1.

The attribution of the current spread of canine parvovirus in Trichy to the wind season and airborne route of infection, is debatable.
