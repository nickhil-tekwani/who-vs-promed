Your recent post refers to Stachybotrys as deadly -- a surprise to me
on such a sophisticated list as this.
What is the evidence that Stachybotrys is deadly, and is there in fact
convincing evidence that it causes disease at all?
Please check further into this... CDC and others no longer believe
there is a cause and effect relationship between Stachybotrys and
infantile pulmonary hemorrhage etc. -- just a nice spurious
association with poor data. Still there is a lot of talk and a lot of
anxiety, except that the little fact that once existed has evaporated.
It would be nice to set the record straight here.

Stachybotrys is the cause of serious disease. - Mod.JW

Questions and Answers on _Stachybotrys chartarum_ and other molds

Q 4. What is _Stachybotrys chartarum_ (_Stachybotrys atra_)?
A. _Stachybotrys chartarum_ (also known by its synonym _Stachybotrys
atra_) is a greenish-black mold. It can grow on material with a high
cellulose and low nitrogen content, such as fiberboard, gypsum board,
paper, dust, and lint. Growth occurs when there is moisture from
water damage, excessive humidity, water leaks, condensation, water
infiltration, or flooding. Constant moisture is required for its
growth. It is not necessary, however, to determine what type of mold
you may have. All molds should be treated the same with respect to
potential health risks and removal.

Q 8. Does _Stachybotrys chartarum_ (_Stachybotrys atra_) cause acute
idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage among infants?
A. To date, a possible association between acute idiopathic pulmonary
hemorrhage among infants and _Stachybotrys chartarum_ (_Stachybotrys
atra_) has not been proved. Further studies are needed to determine
what causes acute idiopathic hemorrhage.
