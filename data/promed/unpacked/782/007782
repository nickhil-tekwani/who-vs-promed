Disease affects crops in Nellai district
----------------------------------------
Farmers in and around Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai [Tirunelveli
district -- nicknamed Nellai -- Tamil Nadu province] are in shock
over a mysterious disease, which caused heavy damage to the crops.
They have cultivated cotton, vegetables, and sunflower on 600 acres
(243 ha). They bought seeds from private companies and recently
noticed a white liquid secreting from the stem of cotton.

Immediately they sprayed pesticides, but they found no improvement as
the disease started to spread rapidly and damaged all the crops. The
vegetables and sunflower crops also faced a similar problem. The
farmers even tried to control the disease by spraying kerosene, but
that too did not yield any result.

The farmers, who submitted a petition to the district collector
(in-charge) during a grievance day meeting here on Monday [30 Jun
2008] demanded compensation for the damaged crops. Tirunelveli
district collector, who saw the affected crops brought by the
farmers, directed the officials of the Department of Agriculture to
inspect the affected areas and submit a report immediately.

[The reference to a white discharge from infected plants may point
towards a bacterial pathogen. Some of the plant pathogenic bacteria
have a wide host range and may be able to affect a range of crops, or
the crops may be affected by different pathogens. We would be most
grateful for any further information on this problem.
