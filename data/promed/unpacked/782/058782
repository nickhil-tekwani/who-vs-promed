The death of a 5 year old girl and a 2 year old girl from suspected avian
influenza fanned worries in Indonesia today, as the government promised to
destroy infected poultry flocks, according to news agencies. The Associated
Press (AP) reported that 9 people were hospitalized in Jakarta for
treatment of suspected avian flu.
Authorities were awaiting test results for them and the 2 deceased girls,
the report said. Indonesia has had 4 deaths attributed to H5N1 avian flu so
far, including that of a 37 year old woman on Sep 10 (though the World
Health Organization [WHO] has recognized only 2 cases as laboratory-confirmed).
The 5 year old died at Jakarta's Sulianti Saroso Hospital for respiratory
disease after being admitted on Tuesday, according to an Agence
France-Presse (AFP) report. Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari
said the girl "most likely" died of avian flu, the Jakarta Post reported.
But she also said an initial local laboratory test on the girl was
negative, according to a Reuters report. An AFP report said the 2 year old
girl died at Jakarta's Christian PGI Hospital after suffering a high fever
and respiratory problems. A hospital spokeswoman named Rosiana said the
girl's illness should be considered a suspected case.
Sardikin Giriputro, deputy director of the Sulianti Saroso Hospital, said
the hospital had 3 new patients with suspected avian flu this afternoon,
according to AFP. One was a 9 year old girl who visited Ragunan Zoo in
Jakarta just before it was closed this week after 19 captive birds there
tested positive for avian flu. The other 2 patients were teenagers who had
contact with birds before they fell ill, the story said.
The government promised today to destroy infected poultry flocks, something
it has been reluctant to do until now because of cost concerns, according
to the AP. Indonesia has many small backyard poultry flocks. Agriculture
minister Anton Apriyantono said mass slaughters would be carried out in
areas found to be "highly infected," meaning infections in 20 per cent of
the poultry, according to the AP and USA Today. Meanwhile, the ministry's
director of animal health told news services she had been fired for
allegedly failing to control avian flu.
A WHO official said today the agency is prepared to provide the antiviral
drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) if signs of a flu pandemic show up, according to
a Voice of America (VOA) report. Shigeru Omi, director for the WHO's
Western Pacific Region, said the agency is prepared to send doses to
Indonesia "if and when a pandemic starts." A 5-member team of US officials
is in Indonesia to find out how the United States can help the country
battle avian flu, AFP reported today. The team includes officials from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies,
according to the information from US embassy spokesman Max Kwak. The team,
which is on a regional fact-finding mission, arrived 18 Sep 2005 and will
leave 24 Sep, the story said.
Earlier this week, WHO director-general Lee Jong-wook said the agency would
not push for a generic version of oseltamivir to increase the supply for
people in poor countries, according to a Sep 19 AP report. The story said
some countries have suggested that Roche, the Swiss-based manufacturer of
oseltamivir, should relinquish its patent so that other companies could
produce cheaper versions of the drug.
Roche announced in August 2005 it would give 3 million treatment courses of
the drug to a WHO-managed international stockpile. Lee told the AP that
with Roche "doing its part," pressuring for a generic form of oseltamivir
is not a good way to encourage the company to do more.

A woman's death from avian influenza in Jakarta has caused considerable
alarm there, but genetic tests performed in Hong Kong on samples of the
virus from the woman showed on Wednesday [21 Sep 2005] that the virus had
not yet mutated in ways likely to make it more of a threat to people. The
genetic evidence suggests that cases identified so far in Indonesia may be
no more dangerous by themselves than the nearly 100 cases recorded since
the beginning of 2004 in Thailand and Viet Nam.
But the disease remains a potentially serious threat to human health
because it could still evolve to become more readily transmissible among
people. The virus in the dead woman "seems like a virus that has gone
directly from birds," said Dr Georg Petersen, the World Health
Organization's representative in Jakarta; he called that "reassuring for
all of us."
The government of Indonesia had declared Monday that the disease was an
"extraordinary event," a step allowing additional spending beyond usual
budget restraints, and allowing the government to force suspected victims
to be hospitalized and isolated. A half-dozen people with flu-like [that
is, febrile] symptoms have been isolated, and Siti Fadila Supari,
Indonesia's health minister, warned on Wednesday that the disease was
becoming an epidemic, but later withdrew the remark [As of today, 22 Sep
2005, only 2 of the cases of suspected avian influenza in Indonesia have
bee confirmed by laboratory testing. - Mod.CP]
The Indonesian government has also begun an extensive slaughter of chickens
in or near flocks where birds have been infected with the disease. The
culling marks a shift in policy, as Indonesia had resisted large-scale
culling in 2004, when the disease spread through Thailand and Vietnam;
Indonesia tried then to vaccinate chickens instead. Petersen said that a
genetic sequence analysis of the virus from the dead woman, a 37 year old
worker at Jakarta's airport, had just been completed in Hong Kong. The
sequence showed that the virus was essentially the same A(H5N1) avian
influenza virus that had already been circulating in poultry in Indonesia,
he said. Health officials around the world have been watching to see if the
virus will evolve to acquire the capability to pass easily from person to
person, a necessary step for the virus to start a pandemic.
Malik Peiris, the Hong Kong University expert who did the genetic
sequencing, cautioned that not all the virus had been analyzed yet, but the
segments analyzed so far match avian versions of the virus. This suggests
that the virus has not mixed [that is, reassorted genome subunits or
undergone genetic recombination - Mod.CP] with human influenza viruses and
thereby acquired the genetic material that would allow it to pass more
easily among people.
The death of 2 young girls with flu-like symptoms this week in Jakarta --
one Tuesday and one Wednesday -- has fed public concern there. But Petersen
said that Indonesia had a fairly high rate of infant mortality by
international standards and that laboratory tests would be needed to
conclude whether the girls had been infected with the A(H5N1)influenza
virus. The airport worker's death followed the death of a father and 2
daughters in Jakarta in July 2005 following flu-like symptoms. The father
was conclusively diagnosed as having had the virus, while lab tests showed
that his 8 year old daughter probably had the virus and his 1 year old
daughter might have had it. But health checks on 300 people who had been in
contact with the family showed no sign that the virus had spread. Bird
feces across the street from the family's home tested positive for the
virus. Chickens wander in many neighborhoods of Jakarta and are an
important source of protein in the local diet. Petersen said that avian
influenza virus had not yet been found in birds from the neighborhood where
the dead airport worker lived.
Avian influenza has been attracting increased attention in Europe because
of cases in birds in Russia, Kazakhstan and western China. Scientists have
said that it is impossible to predict when the virus might mutate in a form
that spreads easily among people. But they have warned repeatedly that as
ever more birds carry the virus and spread it to other species, notably
pigs, it becomes more likely that the virus will adapt to people. The WHO
and health ministries across Asia have been sending viral samples to Hong
Kong for sophisticated and partly because medical researchers here have
been studying the disease since 1997, when an outbreak prompted the
immediate culling of poultry in the territory. The WHO added another bird
flu death Monday, a 35 year old farmer, to its count for Viet Nam. That
brought the total there since the beginning of 2004 to 64 cases, 21 of them
fatal. There were also 17 confirmed cases of bird flu in Thailand in 2004,
12 of them fatal.

Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 31
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today confirmed a further human
case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. The case, in an 8 year old
boy, was confirmed as positive for H5N1 infection by a WHO reference
laboratory in Hong Kong. The boy remains in hospital for observation and
treatment. Current investigations in Indonesia have produced no evidence
that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person.
Background on avian influenza in Indonesia
------------------------------------------
Since mid-2003, Indonesia has experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in
its poultry population. Prior to the new case announced today, 2 human
cases of H5N1 infection in Indonesia have been laboratory-confirmed, one in
July and another in September. All 3 cases have been investigated by the
Indonesia health authorities, with WHO support, and searches for further
cases have been conducted.
As investigations have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is
spreading easily from person to person, WHO has not raised its current
level of pandemic alert. WHO will, however, continue to monitor the
situation closely. Given the experience of other H5N1-affected countries in
Asia, the detection of further human cases in Indonesia or elsewhere would
not be surprising.
Laboratory confirmation of cases in Indonesia has led to heightened public
concern, intensified surveillance for further cases, and strengthened
government commitment to contain the disease. As a result, several patients
with respiratory symptoms and a history of possible exposure to the avian
virus are being evaluated as part of ongoing surveillance efforts. Samples
from these patients have also been sent for analysis by the WHO reference
laboratory in Hong Kong.
Overall assessment
------------------
In all affected countries, most human cases of H5N1 infection have been
linked to contact with poultry. In a few instances, limited human-to-human
transmission of the virus may have occurred following close contact with a
patient during the acute phase of illness. In all known instances, such
transmission has been limited and has not led to larger outbreaks in the
general community, indicating that the virus does not spread easily among
people at this time.
WHO has sent all countries a document outlining recommended strategic
actions for responding to the avian influenza pandemic threat. Recommended
actions aim to strengthen national preparedness, reduce opportunities for a
pandemic virus to emerge, improve the early warning system, and accelerate
vaccine development.

[It is reassuring to learn that the Indonesian government has now
undertaken to destroy infected poultry flocks, something it had been
reluctant to do previously because of cost concerns. Until the results of
laboratory tests on the increasing number of suspected cases are received
from Hong Kong, it is difficult to assess the level of risk for the human
population. As of Thu 22 Sep 2005, the number of confirmed cases stands at
3, and the existence of a substantial epidemic in the human population has
yet to be established. - Mod.CP]
