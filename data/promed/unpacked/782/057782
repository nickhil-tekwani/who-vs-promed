Customers who have purchased packs of Taste the Difference beef burgers from Sainsbury's are being told to avoid eating them after people "became unwell with _E. coli_". The retailer is recalling its 4-pack Aberdeen Angus British Beef Quarter Pounders.

The Food Standards Agency said a very small number of people had caught _E. coli_ O157, which can cause vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Symptoms can last up to 14 days and while most people get better without treatment, it can lead to serious complications and kidney failure.

Anyone who bought packs of these burgers, which have best before dates in July, September or October 2018, should return them.

[Undercooked hamburgers made from commercial ground beef is the prototypic vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. _E. coli_ O157:H7 literally burst on the scenes with the report of hemorrhagic diarrhea outbreaks associated with hamburgers in the USA states of Oregon and Michigan associated with a fast food chain. The publication was:

Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al: Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983;308: 681-685.

Abstract
--------
We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P equal to 0.0005) and with eating any of 3 sandwiches containing 3 ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat.
