CJD-BSE CONNECTION? UK (5)
==========================
I'm interested in the logic that suggested a rare event, namely a cross
species infection, could explain the pattern of disease that is seen. It
would seem to fit equally well and perhaps better with a bovine prion that
was being spread more effectively by the food route than its normal route of
spread.
How is this possibility excluded?

- Firstly, of course, BSE was a result of a cross infection from scrapied
sheep. Secondly, would someone involved in the UK CJD/BSE surveillance
studies please reply to this query, as well as to aim people at the
relevant scientific literature. There seems to be an extreme divergence
of risk appreciation between the informed scientific BSE/CJD community and
the popular press. This subject will be revisited as prion-based diseases
are newly described in other species (horses, kangaroos, turkeys, etc) that
are consumed by humans. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-AHEAD Moderator
