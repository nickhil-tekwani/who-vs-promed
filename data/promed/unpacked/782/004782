The measles outbreak in New Brunswick, Canada has now spread to a 2nd high school; the 12 cases are all linked to the initial case. The province's chief medical officer, Dr Jennifer Russell, confirmed on Sat 1 Jun 2019 that the latest confirmed case is someone who either works or studies at Hampton High School, north east of Saint John.

As of Sat 1 Jun 2019, there were 12 confirmed cases of the highly contagious disease in the Saint John area, all of them linked to New Brunswick's 1st confirmed case, a person who travelled outside the province before showing up at Saint John Regional Hospital in late May 2019.

Russell said the other cases involve people exposed either at the emergency department at Saint John Regional or at Kennebecasis Valley High School. The latest case is linked to a previously confirmed case at Kennebecasis Valley High School, she said.

On Sat 1 Jun 2019, health officials said a special clinic would be set up to immunize those at Hampton High School who may have been exposed. "The fact that they're all directly linked is reassuring, in the sense that we know how everybody contracted measles," Russell said in an interview.

About 9000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed to deal with the outbreak, but many people in the province are having trouble getting a preventative shot. The New Brunswick Pharmacists' Association says local pharmacists have run out of the vaccine and likely won't get more until July 2019. Late last week, US health officials reported 971 measles cases so far this year [2019], the highest tally in 27 years.

[2] Canada (New Brunswick, St John): vaccine shortage
Date: Fri 31 May 2019

The measles outbreak in the Saint John area has many New Brunswickers scrambling to be vaccinated, only to be turned away by the provincial health-care system and some pharmacies. Dr Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that in an outbreak situation, doses of the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine are reserved for those who have potentially been exposed, with exceptions for infants. "During the outbreak, the people who are most at risk are the people who came into direct contact with somebody with measles, and so that's why we reserved the doses of the vaccine for those individuals," Russell told CBC News.

The exceptions include the regularly scheduled vaccination program for 12 month old and 18 month old children. Babies between 6 and 12 months are also being vaccinated as a "protective measure", Russell said. She said the vaccine supply in each province is secured "with a contract that explicitly says these doses can only be used for the outbreak management."

There are 11 confirmed cases of the highly contagious respiratory disease that's transmitted through the air or by direct contact with an infected individual. At least 2000 people have potentially been exposed to the virus either through 9 cases at Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis or 2 others who visited the Saint John Regional Hospital's emergency department, officials have said.

Paul Blanchard, executive director of the New Brunswick Pharmacists' Association, said people are turning to pharmacies for the vaccine and coming up empty. "Our members are getting calls from people all over the place," Blanchard said. "On average, in some places, Saint John for sure, 5-8 to 10 calls an hour just asking if you have the vaccine." He said most pharmacies are out of the "small inventory" they would normally have on hand, and doses are on back-order until the summer.

Dr Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, said no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, meaning people who have received 2 doses of the MMRV vaccine could develop measles. Russell said she understands the public's concern and frustration, but she said statistics indicate the vaccine has a 3 per cent failure rate, meaning even people with 2 MMRV doses could still develop measles. "That's why that extra dose we offer in an outbreak setting is so critical because you're covering off that 3 per cent of the individuals who had the misfortune of being one of those people for whom the vaccine wasn't 100 per cent effective," Russell said.

The stockpiling of doses will stop once the outbreak is declared over, and Russell said that can't be done until 2 incubation periods -- roughly 40 days -- pass since the last confirmed case. The incubation period is between 7 and 18 days.

https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2019/05/vancouver-area-measles-outbreak-spread-between-unvaccinated-children-at-home-in-church.html


At the end of 2018, a 10 year old girl arrived in Clark County from the Ukraine. She was taken to an urgent care clinic for a fever, cough and a skin rash that looked suspiciously like measles. Within 2 weeks, the girl and 12 more people tested positive for a strain of the measles virus that is currently running rampant in eastern Europe.

A report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the Washington-Oregon outbreak was 1st incubated in homes and churches, where it spread quickly before dispersing into the Portland and Clark County communities. The report provides the 1st official insight into how the outbreak spread throughout the Vancouver area, other than an ever-growing list of potential infection locations released during the early winter. 30 of the 71 confirmed cases of measles were linked to each other. That transmission happened mostly at churches and in households where unvaccinated people passed the disease to each other.

Just over half of all the cases were spread within households, likely meaning that many of the cases were young relatives, such as siblings. A quarter of all cases were spread in churches. Only 5 churches were listed by Clark County Public Health as potential infection spots, which indicates that families with high infection rates might attend those churches and spread it to other unvaccinated people.

Clark County has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Washington, a state already lagging behind much of the country in immunizations. Since 2013, Clark County has been 10% to 14% behind the 88% vaccinated statewide average.

Health department officials added Kane County to the list of communities affected by the largest measles outbreak in the US since 1994.

The Kane County Health Department confirmed a case of measles on 28 May 2019 and made the information public Thursday [30 May 2019] morning. The person is no longer infectious but visited several local retailers and restaurants during a period when the infection could be spread, the news release said.

The city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) announced on Wed [29 May 2019] that 7 measles cases have been reported in Staten Island since the beginning of the outbreak in October 2019. Six of those cases occurred in March 2019 but were only recently reported to DOHMH.

Now that Staten Island has officially become part of the disease's resurgence in the United States, here are some facts to know:
The MMR vaccine works, and medical professionals say it's safe. Despite what anonymous ramblings on the internet might suggest, medical professionals say that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe. "When the proper schedule is followed, measles immunity is usually lifelong," he said. "It's a very good vaccine."

[6] USA (Oklahoma, Okmulgee county): 3 other measles cases identified in Okmulgee county Oklahoma
Date: Wed 29 May 2019
Source: Google News [abridged, edited]
http://healthmap.org/ln.php?6493700&u8901


Earlier this month [May 2019], the Oklahoma State Department of Health announced that the 1st measles case was confirmed in the Sooner State in Tulsa. Now, officials say the number of confirmed measles cases in Oklahoma has grown to 4.

Investigators say all 3 other cases are close contacts of the initial patient, and no other cases of measles have been identified in any counties outside of Okmulgee County. Health officials say they are still investigating and have interviewed more than 250 people that might have come into contact with the virus.

"This is a coordinated effort by a number of public health professionals," said state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed. "It is important for us to identify settings where individuals may have been exposed to advise them of their risk and implement measures to prevent the spread of illness to those who may be unvaccinated, and persons who may be at greater risk of illness due to compromised immune systems or children who may not be old enough to receive full protection."

As of 24 May 2019, there have been 940 cases of measles in 26 states across the country, making it the highest number of cases in the US since 1994. Approximately 90 per cent of US cases reported so far this year [2019] were either unvaccinated or had an unknown history of vaccination against measles.

The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (PHD) has confirmed the 1st case of measles in the county since 2016. The person identified is a resident of Santa Barbara in his 20s. The individual is considered infectious between 25 May 2019 through 2 Jun 2019 but has been in isolation since 29 May 2019.

The PHD is confident that the exposure was limited, as the individual spent much of his infectious period outside the county of Santa Barbara. At this time, the PHD is involved in contacting and interviewing persons who may have been exposed to the individual to confirm immunization and immunity status. PHD is also working closely with Riverside County, Los Angeles County, Ventura County, and San Francisco, as the individual traveled to these areas during his infectious period.

[8] US: New measles cases break 25 year old record, health officials say 971 so far this year in US
Date: Thu 30 May 2019
Source: National Public Radio [abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/2019/05/30/728382757/new-u-s-measles-cases-breaks-25-year-old-record-health-officials-say?t=15593948


The number of new measles cases in the United States so far this year [2019] has hit 971, exceeding a record established 25 years ago that covered a whole year of new measles cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thu 30 May 2019. The federal figures show that most of the new cases this year [2019] have been concentrated in New York City and Rockland County, NY, where the virus has been spreading mostly among unvaccinated children in Orthodox Jewish communities.

There have been 550 confirmed cases of measles in New York City since September 2018, according to the city's public health officials. Those caught unvaccinated in 4 Brooklyn ZIP codes can face fines up to USD 1000.

CDC officials warned that if the current rate of outbreaks continues, the virus may lose its status as being eliminated in the US, which public health experts have been worrying about since measles outbreaks starting occurring in recent years. "That loss would be a huge blow for the nation and erase the hard work done by all levels of public health," federal health officials said in a statement. Widespread vaccination efforts overseen by the CDC had virtually eliminated measles from the United States by 2000. But health officials say it has been reintroduced by people who have traveled to other countries.

Earlier this week, the CDC reported that the tally of new measles cases had reached 940, which was the highest since 1994, when 963 cases were reported from an entire year, officials said. The new numbers mean that the 1st 5 months of 2019 have officially surpassed the year-end total in 1994. Two years earlier, in 1992, the nation saw more than 2200 measles cases.

To be sure, the recent uptick in new measles cases is a far cry from the 1950s, when millions of people caught measles and hundreds died each year from the virus, CDC data show. Vaccinations against the highly contagious virus are widespread across the US, with some 94% of kindergartners having received vaccination coverage, according to CDC. In response to the recent resurgence, CDC says it is further strengthening state and local programs aimed at spreading the word that the safest and most effective way to protect against measles is to get vaccinated.

The World Health Organization reports that more than 82 500 measles cases across Europe were reported last year [2018], a significant surge from the previous year. Officials on Thu [30 May 2019] said vaccination is especially important when traveling to places currently dealing with measles outbreaks, including Israel, Brazil, Japan, the Philippines and some countries in Europe and Africa.

There were 864 measles cases in Italy in the 1st 4 months of the year [2019], the National Institute of Health (ISS; Istituto Superiore di Sanità) said on Fri [31 May 2019]. It said that there were 299 cases in April 2019 alone. The regions with the most cases were Lazio (245), Lombardy (233) and Emilia-Romagna (144). The ISS said there were complications in 32.6% of the cases. It added that the number of children and young people in the EU who are not vaccinated against measles has reached 4.5 million.

An increase in vaccine skepticism has been blamed for the rise in the number of cases by experts. Some members of the ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) have in the past voiced sympathy for the No Vax movement. The M5S has said it is not against vaccinations but thinks the current system in which they are obligatory for school admission should be revised.

A case of measles has been confirmed in the region covered by the MidCentral District Health Board this week. Medical officer of health Rob Weir confirmed the case and said MidCentral's public health service had acted to minimise the risk of further spread.

When asked where in the region the case was, a MidCentral spokeswoman said the patient lived in the southern part but had travelled to other parts while potentially infectious. "The patient has been in quarantine following contact with a confirmed case out of the region," Weir said. "However, there is a period of time before entering quarantine when the patient was infectious."
