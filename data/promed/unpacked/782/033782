CASES OF SICKNESS ATTRIBUTED TO RAW OYSTERS DECLINE BY 10
Kirk Wiles, assistant director of the Texas Health Department's seafood
safety division was cited as saying Tuesday the number of people reportedly
sickened by eating raw Galveston Bay oysters dropped from a high of 316
Monday to 306 cases due to some Florida cases that were evaluated and found
to be unrelated to raw oysters from the Galveston Bay area, 30 miles
southeast of Houston, adding, "Florida had previously reported 53 cases and
they have readjusted their number to 41." Meanwhile, Georgia reported two
new cases.
Officials believe the illnesses are linked to the bacterium _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ is a naturally occurring organism in the bay.
Oyster-related cases had been steadily increasing each day, from an initial
18 cases reported to state health officials in mid-June to the more than
300 recorded this week.
Wiles was further cited as saying that the health department received
results on the first batch of tests it is conducting to try to explain the
recent outbreak of cases, adding, "This is just the beginning of a series
of tests to help us make the appropriate associations between the illnesses
and the bacteria."
Oyster harvesters voluntarily stopped collecting from Galveston Bay more
than a week ago.

NEOGEN PROVIDES NEW OYSTER BACTERIA TEST TO TEXAS OFFICIAL
LANSING, Mich.-- Neogen Corp. provided a new test to Galveston Bay, Texas,
area health officials to rapidly detect the oyster-borne bacteria blamed
for sickening more than 300 people across the country. In a press release
Wednesday, Neogen said its new test can detect the presence of the _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ bacteria in 18-20 hours, compared to the 5-6 days
required by conventional laboratory testing.
Fishery managers can use the test to easily and relatively quickly test
their facilities to ensure the safety of their products.
