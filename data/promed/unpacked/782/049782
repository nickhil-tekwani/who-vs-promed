France Galop released a statement on [Mon 25 Feb 2019] revealing an outbreak of equine flu at a yard in Lamorlaye, which forms part of the wider Chantilly training center. No details have been given as to the identity of the trainer, nor as to the number of cases or whether any infected horse had raced in recent days [for additional missing information, see comment].

France's Réseau d'Epidémio-Surveillance en Pathologie Equine [RESPE] -- which monitors the spread of contagious disease among the wider horse population -- recorded its 1st cases in December 2018, though they were restricted to riding schools and other equestrian establishments.

France continued to allow runners from other European countries, including Britain, to train and race, during the recent outbreak at the yards of Donald McCain and Simon Crisford--cases which led to the British Horseracing Authority suspending racing for 6 days.

During that time extra biosecurity requirements were introduced by France Galop for racehorses traveling into the country from other European jurisdictions. The only recorded case within the thoroughbred population in France was isolated to a single mare at a breeding establishment in Normandy on [Wed 20 Feb 2019].

But the fact that there is now a confirmed infection in an area where more than 2000 horses are trained is bound to be a source of major concern. The RESPE is yet to give details of the Lamorlaye case, while France Galop's statement said simply that "the trainer and their vet have taken precautions to control the infection."

[Notably, the above article also does not provide information on the virus strain which is the causative agent. This is, most likely, EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1. This virulent virus strain has been found responsible for the recent events in the UK and in several other West European countries.

A letter published in the Veterinary Record of 19 Jan 2019 (Paillot R, Pitel P, Pronost S, et al. Florida clade 1 equine influenza virus in France. Vet Rec. 2019; 184(3): 101. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.l1203; http://tinyurl.com/y2cgahhn) presents observations made in France during recent outbreaks of equine influenza caused by the Florida clade 1 [FC1] virus; the authors paid special attention to vaccination.

Lamorlaye is a commune in the Oise department in the northern region Hauts-de-France.

According to recent reports, the same virus strain has recently been identified in horses in Munster and Leinster, Ireland; see
