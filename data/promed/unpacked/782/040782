Fears of an intestinal virus outbreak which has hit 46 people and may have
killed an eight-year-old girl have eased, health experts said yesterday.
They said the potentially deadly enterovirus 71, which can attack the
brain, is unlikely to strike many more people. Health chiefs said the virus
outbreak in Taiwan, which has killed more than 55 people, many of them
children, is also fading there.
Hospital Authority and Department of Health officials outlined discussions
they had had with Taiwan health experts after a four-day trip there last
week.
Dr Paul Saw Thian-aun, deputy director of health, said the number of people
with hand-foot-mouth disease, which the virus can cause, had dropped by
about 10 in the past two weeks.
Some 46 people were admitted to hospital with the disease in the week
ending Aug 1, compared to 57 in the [previous week ending July 25.
