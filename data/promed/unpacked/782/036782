The massive pilchards kill along the South Australian coast is expected to
hit Western Australia next week after spreading 100km in the past 24 hours.
SA Fisheries director Gary Morgan said yesterday dead pilchards had been
found on the beach at Point Bell, 40km west of Ceduna in the state's west.
Fish had also washed up on the beaches of the Murray Mouth, south of
Adelaide, although the kill did not seem to be spreading as fast in the
east of the state.
But Dr Morgan said the density of the dead fish in west coast waters was
not as great as in 1995, when tens of thousands of tonnes of pilchards died
in waters stretching from WA along the southern and eastern coasts to New
Zealand.
Scientists expect to isolate the herpes-like virus suspected of killing the
fish this weekend. Dr Morgan said laboratory tests would be conducted on
the fish at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong at the
weekend. He also said no other species were thought to be affected by the
virus, after reports of dead snapper, squid and crabs along metropolitan
beaches this week.
