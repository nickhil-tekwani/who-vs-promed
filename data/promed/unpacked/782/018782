A Citrus County man who is among the latest to contract flesh-eating bacteria (the cause of necrotizing fasciitis - Mod.LL) says he is grateful to be alive. When he contracted necrotizing fasciitis, he didn't show symptoms for several weeks.

ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska talked to the man from his Citrus County home. After spending nearly 2 weeks in the hospital, he was able to return home on 11 Jul 2019. The man and his wife vacationed in the Panhandle [of Florida] in late May 2019. Before the trip, the man said he got shots for pain in his lower back and buttocks. "It got in, possibly, most likely through this slight little tiny injection site where the steroids were put in. The bacteria got in through those pinhole-type injections," he said.

After returning home, the patient said he felt a little discomfort. However, weeks later he knew something was wrong. "When it got to be like the size of a lemon inside one of my butt cheeks, it was a sign something wasn't right," he said. "I could feel this like an abscess-type thing forming on my bottom, really inflamed, hot, and very swollen."

If he didn't decide to go to Citrus Memorial Hospital when he did, doctors don't think he would've survived. "They operated 6 days straight; 6 consecutive days had surgeries to make sure they got everything out. It spread to my pelvis," he said. "They cut me from here to here, and they took my digestive system out and inspected it to make sure there was nothing necrotizing on it and then put it all back in."

The man, 68, said he doesn't have an autoimmune disease and never thought his body wouldn't be able to fight off the infection. Now he wants to raise awareness for anyone swimming with an open wound or [who] recently was vaccinated or got a shot. "It could happen to anybody; it's made me aware of my mortality, that life is precious. You don't know you are just going to go swimming and maybe not make it. Something could happen; we don't know," he said. "If you are thinking of going swimming and you have a little tiny cut, maybe think twice about going."

[This is a strange story. It is unlikely that necrotizing fasciitis would lie dormant for several weeks and that an injection site would be the portal of entry more than one to 2 days later. Additionally, necrotizing fasciitis does not produce abscesses per se. It is possible that an infection developed by seeding a "sterile abscess" produced by the corticosteroid injection, which then broke down causing necrotizing fasciitis. The organism causing the process is not stated, but if linked to sea water, it would likely be _Vibrio vulnificus_. - Mod.LL]

For one family, a trip to Panama City Beach was an annual tradition for some fun in the sun. But this time, things almost turned deadly for the father. "I almost lost my leg or my life," he said.

It started off with flu-like symptoms around 5 days after he got back, but as he got worse, he began getting medical help. At 1st, a nurse practitioner thought it was a kidney infection, but it wasn't until he discovered his leg was turning purple that the Colquitt resident decided to go to Southeast Health. Meredith was put on triage, and doctors took a bacterial culture to see what was going on. "The doctor had told me it was a type of strep, but then, when he'd come and seen me, he told me it was the flesh-eating kind," he said.

The man had necrotizing fasciitis, which had seeped into a barely noticeable scratch below his knee while he was in the water. "The skin is the body's most important barrier to infection," Dr. Andrew Sawyer said. "Any violation of that skin, even something as small as a scratch, has the potential to increase the potential for waterborne infection."

The man said that any beachgoer should be aware of the risks of playing in the ocean water. "Anybody that's going to the beach, they need to really, really be real cautious before getting in the sand or the water," he said. "I never thought it would happen to me."

An examination of reported cases of necrotizing fasciitis in 2019 shows that this is the 1st confirmed case in 2019 to have originated in Panama City so far. Despite the ordeal, he said all he has now is a throbbing foot and a 4-week recovery period.

The Bay County Health Department has released this statement in response: "Bay County has no confirmed cases of _Vibrio vulnificus_. Necrotizing fasciitis, sometimes called "flesh-eating bacteria," and severe infections with _V. vulnificus_ are rare. If you are healthy with a strong immune system, your chances of developing complications due to this condition are extremely low."

[Again, in this case, the specific organism is not stated, but with a sea water exposure, _Vibrio vulnificus_, or at least another species of _Vibrio_, may have been the etiology here. The report in from Dotham, Alabama, but it is not clear where the patient resided.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: 1st, vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and 2nd, most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
