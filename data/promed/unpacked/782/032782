PLAGUE IN WILDLIFE, 1997 - USA (COLORADO, NEVADA)

[Below are listed] the first positive plague surveillance samples for 1997.
Serological analyses were performed at CDC and fluorescent antibody assay on
the fox squirrel [_Sciurus niger_] from Manitou Springs [near Colorado
Springs, central Colorado] was performed at the Colorado Department of Health.
Fox squirrel (FA positive) - Manitou Springs - collected 1/10/97
(Note: This squirrel was infected during an epizootic that began in Fall 1996
in western Colorado Springs and nearby Manitou Springs. During Fall 1996, a
total of 25 fox squirrels were found to be plague-positive in these areas.
El Paso County [Colorado Springs] Health Department officials placed
insecticidal bait tubes in affected areas and conducted an educational
campaign among residents. Special plague surveillance activities, including
a canine serosurveillance program, are still being conducted to assess the
extent of the epizootic and the likelihood that it will continue during
Spring 1997.)
A total of 54 sero-surveillance samples were recently submitted to CDC for
analysis by Daniel J. Maxson, R.S., Senior Environmental Health Specialist,
Clark County Health District, Nevada. These samples were collected from four
counties in southeast Nevada (Clark, Lincoln, Nye and White Pine). Listed
below are only those samples that tested POSITIVE for antibodies to the F-1
antigen of _Yersinia pestis_ [the etiologic agent of plague]. All samples
were collected between 11/22/96 and 2/4/97. None of the 23 samples submitted
from Clark County (Las Vegas is located in this county) were positive. The
high percentage of positives from the other three counties suggest that a
widespread epizootic is occurring in the other three lightly populated
counties north and northwest of Las Vegas, NV (Titers greater than 10 are
considered positive in passive hemagglutination assays.)
