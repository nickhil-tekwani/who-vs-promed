Health officials are investigating 9 cases of muscle weakness or paralysis in Colorado children and whether the culprit might be a virus causing severe respiratory illness across the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] on Friday [26 Sep 2014] sent doctors an alert about the polio-like cases and said the germ -- enterovirus 68 [EV68, also referred to as EV-D68] -- was detected in 4 out of 8 of the sick children who had a certain medical test. The status of the 9th case is unclear.

The virus can cause paralysis but other germs can, too. Health officials don't know whether the virus caused any of the children's arm and leg weaknesses or whether it's just a germ they coincidentally picked up.

"That's why we want more information," and for doctors to report similar cases, said the CDC's Dr Jane Seward.

The cases occurred within the last 2 months. All 9 children are being treated at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, and most are from the Denver area. A hospital spokeswoman said the patients' families didn't want to talk to the media.

The 9 children had fever and respiratory illness about 2 weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness. None seems to have a weak immune system or other conditions that might predispose them to severe illness, but the cases are still being investigated, Seward said. Investigators don't think it's polio -- 8 of the 9 children are up to date on polio vaccinations. It's not known whether the limb weakness or paralysis is temporary or will be long-lasting.

The cases come amid an unusual wave of severe respiratory illness from enterovirus 68. The germ is not new -- it was fist identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before, including in Georgia and Pennsylvania in 2009 and Arizona in 2010. Because it's not routinely tested for, it's possible the bug spread in previous years but was never distinguished from colds caused by other germs.

This year [2014], the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month [August 2014], a flood of sick children began to hit hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago -- kids with trouble breathing, some needing oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many -- but not all -- had asthma before the infection.

The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday [25 Sep 2014] reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68. So far no deaths have been attributed to the virus, but Seward said 15 still are being investigated.

Health officials know enterovirus can cause paralysis. Published reports count at least 2 people in the US who were paralyzed and were found to have the virus in their spinal fluid. One was a New Hampshire 5-year-old in 2008; details are scant on the 2nd case, a young adult, which happened many years earlier.

Earlier this year [2014], Stanford University researchers said they had identified polio-like illnesses in about 20 California children over about 18 months. 2 tested positive for enterovirus 68. CDC officials say it's still not clear if the virus was a factor in those cases.

Paralysis is a rare complication of enterovirus 68 infection, but with so many more cases of enterovirus being reported this year [2014], it may not be surprising to see that problem, said Dr Larry Wolk, chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The CDC is asking doctors to report patients 21 or younger who developed limb weakness since [1 Aug 2014] and who have had an MRI exam that showed abnormalities in the nerve tissue in the spinal cord.

Seward said a test that showed the germ in a patient's spinal fluid would be good evidence that the virus was causing paralysis. Unfortunately, lab tests of spinal fluid often fail to identify bugs like enterovirus 68, even if they're present, she added.

Since [8 Aug 2014], 9 Colorado children have been stricken with muscle weakness or paralysis and Colorado health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday [26 Sep 2014] they're investigating a link to concurrent viral outbreaks.

The CDC has issued a national alert for doctors in other states to watch for similar symptoms.

All 9 children's symptoms were preceded by respiratory illness, said Dr Larry Wolk, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and a pediatrician.

"This is a very small number of patients," Wolk said. "That's why we're asking if there are other cases. People shouldn't panic."

The cases were identified between [8 Aug 2014 and 17 Sep 2014] at the Children's Hospital Colorado among children ages 1 to 18 -- most from the Denver metro area. The health department has been working with Children's for about a week, Wolk said.

"All 9 had some kind of lesion show up on their MRIs," Wolk said. The CDC advisory says symptoms include limb weakness and "abnormalities of the spinal cord gray matter on an MRI," or magnetic resonance imaging.

Wolk said he didn't know how many of the 9 children suffered paralysis. And officials don't know if any paralysis is permanent. He said none of the 9 have recovered yet from their symptoms, but he didn't know if all remained hospitalized.

"Everything from just being limp or having decreased movement all the way to paralysis-like symptoms where the children can't move have been reported to us," Wolk said. "Some of these kids are pretty young, so it's hard to make that diagnosis of paralysis."

Officials said the children did not experience altered mental status or seizures.

The past 2 months have seen tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of kids sickened by a rare pathogen called enterovirus 68 as well as the common cold, rhinovirus, Wolk said. But the state doesn't have firm numbers, because reporting these viral cases is not mandatory because such illnesses are so pervasive.

Officials have test results for 8 of the 9 children, Wolk said. 4 children tested positive for enterovirus 68 and the other 4 were positive for either rhinovirus or another enterovirus.

Of the 9 children 8 have been confirmed to have up-to-date polio vaccinations, a CDC health advisory said.

Wolk said he wanted to emphasize that myelitis, an infection or inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord, is "a rare but not unexpected complication" of viral infections. "We've seen this in the past and have studied these kinds of clusters in the past," Wolk said.

Recent viral outbreaks in Colorado have shown double-digit increases over more typical years.

The enterovirus 68 outbreak associated with severe respiratory illness is nationwide, the CDC reports.

So far this year [2014], enterovirus 68 has been confirmed in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the CDC.

The CDC recommends that patients under 21 suffering from acute onset of focal limb weaknesses on or after [1 Aug 2014], with an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter, should be reported to state and local health departments.

Acute Neurologic Illness with Focal Limb Weakness of Unknown Etiology in Children
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an official CDC Health Advisory
Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network
26 Sep 2014

Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working closely with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and Children's Hospital Colorado to investigate a cluster of 9 pediatric patients hospitalized with acute neurologic illness of undetermined etiology. The illness is characterized by focal limb weakness and abnormalities of the spinal cord gray matter on MRI. These illnesses have occurred since [1 Aug 2014] coincident with an increase of respiratory illnesses among children in Colorado. The purpose of this HAN Advisory is to provide awareness of this neurologic syndrome under investigation with the aim of determining if children with similar clinical and radiographic findings are being cared for in other geographic areas. Guidance about reporting cases to state and local health departments and CDC is provided. Please disseminate this information to infectious disease specialists, intensive care physicians, pediatricians, neurologists, radiologists/neuroradiologists, infection preventionists, and primary care providers, as well as to emergency departments and microbiology laboratories.

Background
----------
The CDPHE, Children's Hospital Colorado, and CDC are investigating 9 cases of acute neurologic illness among pediatric patients. The cases were identified during [9 Aug-17 Sep 2014] among children aged 1-18 years (median age 10 years). Most of the children were from the Denver metropolitan area. All were hospitalized. Common features included acute focal limb weakness and specific findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord consisting of non-enhancing lesions largely restricted to the gray matter. In most cases, these lesions spanned more than one level of the spinal cord. Some also had acute cranial nerve dysfunction with correlating non-enhancing brainstem lesions on MRI. None of the children experienced altered mental status or seizures. None had any cortical, subcortical, basal ganglia, or thalamic lesions on MRI. Most children reported a febrile respiratory illness in the 2 weeks preceding development of neurologic symptoms. In most cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses demonstrated mild-moderate pleocytosis (increased cell count in the CSF) consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process. CSF testing to date has been negative for West Nile virus and enteroviruses, including poliovirus. Nasopharyngeal specimens were positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus in 6 out of 8 patients that were tested. Of the 6 positive specimens, 4 were typed as EV-D68, and the other 2 are pending typing results. Testing of other specimens is still in process. Eight out of 9 children have been confirmed to be up to date on polio vaccinations. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of these cases are ongoing.

The United States is currently experiencing a nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory disease. The possible linkage of this cluster of neurologic disease to this large EV-D68 outbreak is part of the current investigation. CDC is seeking information about other similar neurologic illnesses in all states, especially cases clustered in time and place. CDC has particular interest in characterizing the epidemiology and etiology of such cases.

Recommendations
---------------
Patients who meet the following case definition should be reported to state and local health departments:
Patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with:
- Acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after [1 Aug 2014];
AND:
- An MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter.

State and local health departments should report patients meeting the case definition to CDC using a brief patient summary form (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/investigation/). State health departments should send completed summary forms to CDC by email at <limbweakness@cdc.gov>.

Providers treating patients meeting the above case definition should consult with their local and state health department for laboratory testing of stool, respiratory, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens for enteroviruses, West Nile virus, and other known infectious etiologies.

Health departments may contact CDC for further laboratory and epidemiologic support by phone through the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100), or by email at <limbweakness@cdc.gov>. Confirmation of the presence of EV-D68 currently requires typing by molecular sequencing.

For more information:
Please visit the CDC enterovirus website (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/) for general information about enterovirus infections, including EVD-68, and for up-to-date guidance about infection control measures.

[In February 2014, there were reports of a polio-like illness in approximately 20 children since the fall of 2012. Descriptions of the illness included "severe weakness or paralysis, which strikes rapidly -- sometimes after a mild respiratory illness. Scans of the patients' spinal cords show patterns of damage similar to that found in polio sufferers...." -- Basically the same as described in cases in Colorado reported above. At the time there was mention that 2 of 5 children evaluated at Stanford University Medical Center had evidence of infection with enterovirus 68 (the virus was recovered from stool specimens; see Polio-like illness - USA: (CA) enterovirus 68 susp, RFI 20140224.2296126).

Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) have been associated with polio-like paralytic disease. As part of the global polio eradication initiative, stool specimens are to be collected and sent for virus isolation on all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) that are identified. This massive laboratory-supported effort has led to the identification of many non-polio enteroviruses associated with AFP (see references listed below for a representative sampling of the types of viruses associated with AFP). Of these NPEVs, EV71 has been most notably associated with paralytic disease, and more recently, sub-genogroup C4a was associated with AFP in Australia (see ProMED-mail Human enterovirus 71 - Australia: sub-genogroup C4a, acute flaccid paralysis 20130526.1738087). While EV68 has been anecdotally associated with AFP, it has been identified as a cause of severe respiratory disease (see ProMED-mail Human enterovirus 68 - novel pathogen, worldwide 20110929.2945 with a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article summarizing the reports of respiratory illness associated with EV68). In late August 2014, there were reports of severe respiratory illness in children in Missouri (see ProMED-mail Human enterovirus 68 - USA: (Kansas City, MO) 20140830.2737051), followed by reports of enterovirus 68 activity with severe respiratory illness in other Midwest states, then in the Northeast and in Canada. As of 24 Sep 2014 there have been a total of 220 confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection in 32 states.

In 2003 and 2005 there were a cumulative total of 17 individuals with neurologic symptoms associated with EV71 infection in Colorado, including 2 presenting with AFP (see https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2006/webprogram/Paper22621.html for details of this cluster presented as a poster at the IDSA Pediatrics 1 poster session on 13 Oct 2006: Perez-Velez C, Robinson C, McFarland E, et al: Outbreaks of paralytic enterovirus 71 disease in Colorado).

Based on the clusters reported in California earlier this year (covering an 18-month period preceding February 2014) and the cluster of 9 additional cases mentioned above, and the concurrent large outbreak of EV-D68 respiratory illness, CDC has issued an alert to all states to report similar cases of "acute neurologic illness with focal limb weakness of unknown etiology in children". The case definition is: Patients 21 years of age or younger, with an acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after 1 Aug 2014, and an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter.

More information on these cases would be greatly appreciated.
