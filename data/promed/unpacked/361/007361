CASEOUS LYMPHADENITIS, SHEEP - UK

A disease brought to Britain in a cargo of goats from Germany seven years
ago is spreading rapidly through flocks of sheep, veterinary scientists
warned yesterday. The disease is caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), a bacterial
infection that can be fatal and causes abscesses on the skin and damage to
the lungs, lymph nodes and other organs. Vets urge that all affected sheep
are destroyed. People can also contract CLA, though such cases are rare.
Four outbreaks have been confirmed recently among pedigree sheep on farms
in Northumberland and the Scottish Borders. As the sheep-shearing season
gets under way, farmers have been urged to look for signs of the disease.
