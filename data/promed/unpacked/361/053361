Biosecurity Queensland is managing a new Hendra virus case on a property between Cairns and Port Douglas after a positive test result was received late last night [6 Sep 2012].

Queensland Chief Biosecurity Officer Dr Jim Thompson said the property owner contacted a veterinarian on Monday [3 Sep 2012] after the horse became ill. The horse died before the vet arrived at the property.

"Biosecurity officers are currently assessing the situation but from preliminary information we understand there are 13 other horses on the property," Dr Thompson said.

"Tracing is a priority to determine what contact the infected horse may have had with other animals.

The positive result comes only days after a quarantine order on a Redlynch equestrian centre was lifted.

This seems quite far north, perhaps the farthest north yet reported. This virus just seems to continue hanging on.

The vaccine is, I am sure, anxiously awaited. In the mean time, keeping horses away from fruit trees where the flying foxes like to feed is quite important. A consistent vigil for any signs of illness in your horses is most important as you will need to potentially take protective measures for yourself and your family and pets. - Mod.TG]
