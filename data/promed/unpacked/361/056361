The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is
today (28 Dec 2010) investigating a case of confirmed infection by
_Streptococcus suis_ (a kind of bacterium isolated from pigs).

The patient is a 56-year-old man who lives in Sha Tin. He developed
fever, chills and confusion on 23 Dec 2010 and was admitted to Prince
of Wales Hospital on 25 Dec 2010. He was diagnosed to have meningitis.
He is now in stable condition. His blood and cerebrospinal fluid grew
_S. suis_. A CHP spokesman said the patient had no recent travel
history. His home contact did not have any symptoms.

This is the 10th case of _S. suis_ infection reported this year
[2010]; 6 cases were reported in 2009 and another 6 in 2008. The
spokesman said _S. suis_ infection may present as meningitis
(inflammation of the membrane enclosing the brain), septicaemia
(bloodstream infection), and less commonly endocarditis (inflammation
of the inner lining of the heart chambers), arthritis, and
bronchopneumonia (a kind of lung infection involving the bronchioles).
_S. suis_ infection can be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

To prevent the disease, members of the public are advised to always
practice personal and environmental hygiene. They should avoid contact
with pigs that are sick or dead from diseases and their excreta or
body fluids. If contact with pigs or raw pork is necessary, one should
use protective gloves; wash hands after handling pigs or raw pork; and
clean and cover all wounds properly.

Members of the public with suspected symptoms should consult their
doctors as soon as possible and report their relevant exposure
histories.

[Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis
that has been reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also
toxic shock if the strain produces the appropriate toxins, and less
commonly bacteremia, pneumonia, septic arthritis and endocarditis.

Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who
slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs
from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection.
However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food
from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection.
Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see
<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201>). The news
release above fails to note the risk factors for _S. suis_ infection
in this Hong Kong case.

_S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent
strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs
(polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and
growing pigs (meningitis). In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes
pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in adult pigs.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is
thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.

Sha Tin District is one of the 18 districts of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and is
located in the New Territories [on the mainland]. A map of Hong Kong
showing the location of the Sha Tin district can be found at
