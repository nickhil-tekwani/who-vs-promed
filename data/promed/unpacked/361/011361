[In the last ProMED-mail update on 11 Feb 2017 I commented that it appeared as though transmission of MERS-CoV infection was slowing down, as there had been a total of 4 newly confirmed cases reported since 1 Feb 2017 as compared with 12 newly confirmed cases reported during the 1st 11 days of January 2017. With the addition of these 3 newly confirmed cases, it brings the total of newly confirmed cases reported since 1 Feb 2017 to 7, compared with 14 cases reported during the 1st 13 days of January 2017.

The locations of the newly confirmed cases are in 3 different regions - Al Madinah, Al Bahah and Al Qasim, and can be seen on the maps of Saudi Arabia available at the source URLs.
