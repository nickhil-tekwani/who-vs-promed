The Ministry of Health & Medical Services - Fiji reports 2068 lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year [2022]. A slight upward trend in cases with case numbers is noted above the outbreak threshold nationally, driven by cases in the Western Division.

Case numbers in the Western Division are increasing and remain above the outbreak alert threshold, indicating more cases than the expected number for this time of the year for this endemic disease.

The leptospirosis bacterium [_Leptospira_] spreads to humans through the urine of infected animals, such as cows, pigs, rats, and dogs. To reduce your individual risk, it is important to understand that exposure to animals, soil, mud, and floodwaters during work or recreational activities increases your risk of infection.

Important prevention measures include wearing full covered footwear at all times when going outdoors, avoiding wading or swimming in flooded waters, using clean fresh water to wash up after exposure to muddy waters, and keeping all food and drinks covered and away from rats. For workplaces, practice good personal hygiene at all times, cover cuts and wounds well, and use protective equipment, especially footwear when in flooded and/or muddy areas.

Parents and guardians are urged to prevent children from playing in the mud or swimming in flooded rivers or creeks, and ensure that they wear shoes when outside.

Leptospirosis can be treated with appropriate antibiotic medications prescribed by a doctor if treatment is sought early. Danger signs for severe leptospirosis include shortness of breath, coughing blood, chest pain, yellow eyes/skin (jaundice), signs of bleeding (including unexplained bruising), decreased or increased urination, and difficulty staying awake.

Severe leptospirosis is life-threatening, and anyone with these symptoms must be taken to the hospital immediately.

The news report above says that the total lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year (2022) have risen from 1394 cases on 24 Mar 2022 to 1528 cases in early April 2022, and now to 2068 cases (see Archive number 20220403.8702385). The worst-hit region has been the Western Division.

The sources of the current outbreak in Fiji have been attributed to illegal piggeries and the improper disposal of wastewater in informal settlements, in addition to flooding (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Fiji (02): illegal piggeries/improper wastewater disposal, flooding 20220319.8702072).

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls and flooding with fresh water. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). Fiji suffered flooding due to Tropical Cyclone Cody in January 2022, especially in the western side of Viti Levu (Western Division) (https://floodlist.com/australia/fiji-tropical-storm-cody-floods-january-2022). Viti Levu is the country's main island and home to 70% of the country's population (about 600 000 people). - Mod.ML
