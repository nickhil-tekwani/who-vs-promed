It is well known that Rift Valley fever virus often causes abortion in
animals. Any data regarding this pathological property of the virus in
humans?

[Within 2-6 days of RVF virus infecting a flock of sheep 90%-100% of lambs
<7 d old die, 20%-60% of older lambs and adult sheep die, and 90%-100% of
pregnant sheep abort. The respective figures for cattle are: 10%-70% of
calves die, 10%-20% of adult cattle die, 80%-100% of pregnant cows abort.
Data for goats, buffaloes and camels are limited.
A study of abortions in humans infected with RVF virus during the 1977 RVF
epizoodemic in Egypt was not conclusive. (Abdel-Aziz AA, Meegan JM, and
Laughlin LW (1980) Rift Valley fever as a possible cause of human
abortions. Trans. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 74:685). I know of no other
data regarding abortions in humans. - Mod.CHC]
