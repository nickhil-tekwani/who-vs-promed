A national crisis unit is mobilized and an investigation is underway at the Pierre-Boucher Hospital in Longueuil (Montreal's 2nd most populace suburb), where the "killer fungus" has spread, Radio-Canada has learned. This is the 1st time an outbreak of _C. auris_ has occurred in Quebec.

Most hospital employees are unaware that this intruder is present in their facility. According to a public health source, authorities asked those informed to exercise discretion. _C. auris_ attacks hospitalized patients, mainly those with weakened immune systems or those undergoing surgery or intravenous treatment. An infected person has a 30% to 60% chance of dying.

As early as 8 Sep 2022, the presence of the deadly fungus was suspected in the armpits of a 65-year-old patient treated for pneumonia in Pierre-Boucher. The positive case was confirmed on 15 Sep 2022 by the Public Health Laboratory of Quebec.

Then, on 19 Sep 2022, a 2nd case was confirmed. It was another occupant of the same room. He died the next day in intensive care from another cause. What worries the health authorities is that neither of the 2 patients was returning from abroad. An outbreak declaration was issued on Tuesday [20 Sep 2022] to the relevant health personnel.

The CISSS [the Integrated Center of Health and Social Services] of Montérégie-Est informed Radio-Canada that 3 other users of the hospital who had close contacts are under investigation. However, according to our sources, dozens of patients would have been screened, on several units, because they would have had direct or indirect contact with the positive cases.

It worries me a lot, says a member of the medical staff of the establishment, informed of the situation, who is not authorized to speak about it. "We knew that eventually _C. auris_ was going to come to Quebec; it was a matter of time when we look at what is happening in the United States. I'm just surprised [it's] in Quebec so quickly." The super-yeast is of growing concern to US health authorities. On Wednesday [21 Sep 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) again issued a warning.

In addition to being difficult to detect, _C. auris_ is resistant to antifungal treatments. The problem has become endemic in the United States, where more and more cases are being detected in hospitals.

It is difficult to get rid of the fungus on surfaces, up to several weeks. In 2019, at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, sections of the walls and ceiling had to be removed and replaced to eradicate the fungus from the contaminated walls. An article from The New York Times reported that everything was positive for _C. auris_ around infected patients: telephones, doors, handles, mattresses, windows, etc. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html).

The CISSS of Montérégie-Est ensures that additional precautionary measures were put in place as of 8 Sep 2022 with suspected cases and close contacts who have been isolated. From 15 Sep 2022, when an outbreak was suspected, measures were added, such as wearing masks, gowns and gloves, as well as the use of chlorine products to disinfect surfaces. "Since [8 Sep 2022], the care teams concerned have been kept informed of the measures to be applied[....] Additional information on _C. auris_ was transmitted to the personnel concerned on [13 Sep 2022]," said Caroline Doucet, spokesperson for the CISSS of Montérégie-Est. According to our sources, the Anna-Laberge Hospital in Châteauguay [another suburb of Montreal] is also the subject of increased surveillance because the 1st positive patient spent a day there this summer [2022].

The National Institute of Public Health of Quebec (INSPQ) is mobilized in this file, alongside the Ministry of Health and Social Services. According to the INSPQ, Quebec had known only 3 isolated cases of _C. auris_ in the past, all patients returning from abroad (Africa and the United States). It is therefore the 1st time that Quebecers have been infected without having stayed outside the country.

Only one outbreak had been reported in Canada before, in British Columbia, for a total of 37 cases in the country since 2012, including the latest in Longueuil. These are mainly people returning from medical tourism trips abroad.

Studies have shown that the super fungus adapts to higher temperatures. This heat tolerance could contribute to its emergence as a fungal disease in humans. Researchers from the United States and the Netherlands suspect that global warming could contribute to the spread of this infection. Some scientists even think that the expansion of _C. auris_ could be linked to the massive use of fungicides in agriculture. The unwanted fungus is the perfect example of one of the major threats to humanity listed by the World Health Organization (WHO): antibiotic resistance. This growing problem could cause the death of 10 million people worldwide in 2050, according to a study funded by the UK government, more than annual cancer deaths.

_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen that causes healthcare-associated infections, associated with high mortality. _C. auris_ has the ability to persistently colonize environmental surfaces, and epidemiologic investigations of hospital outbreaks find widespread _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms, and surfaces that were frequently touched, such as computer screens, touchpads, and keyboards.

The CDC recommends that infection controls for _C. auris_ in healthcare settings include hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions (isolation of patients in single rooms or housing people with the same MDR infection in the same room), disinfection of the patient environment, communication with other facilities when transferring patients, screening contacts of patients, and prospective laboratory surveillance to identify new cases in facilities where _C. auris_ has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html).

Screening cultures of patients at multiple sites (e.g., axilla, groin, rectum) in nosocomial outbreak settings commonly find asymptomatic colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-screening.html). Patients at highest risk include close healthcare contacts of patients with _C. auris_ infection or colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html). Colonized or infected patients frequently have prior extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, highlighting the value of careful and thorough communication at inter-healthcare facility transfers. Patients with _C. auris_ colonization should be placed on appropriate transmission-based precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html#transmission). Investigations of the causes of hospital outbreaks frequently find infection control lapses, undoubtedly compounded by the care required for critically ill ICU patients.

_C. auris_ can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole, and many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are least commonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the initial empiric drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy.

Montérégie (pop., about 1.5 million residents in 2016) is an administrative region that includes the city of Longueuil (pop., 239 700) on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River in the southern part of Quebec.
