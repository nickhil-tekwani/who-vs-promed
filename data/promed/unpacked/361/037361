PSEUDOMONAS, UNUSUAL VIRULENCE FOR NEONATES - NEW ZEALAND

Pseudomonas, unusual virulence for neonates - USA, Boston 970916175849]

From: "Mona Schousboe Dr.FRCPA Canterbury Health Laboratories Christchurch

We have had experience with a prolonged outbreak of
_Pseudomonas_ in neonates in our neonatal unit in
Christchurch approx. 1980 - 1984. Many neonates were
colonized and several died. All isolated were sero and
phage typed and they all belonged to the same type.
[After] prolonged investigation the source was found in
contaminated detergent, produced by a local outfit. The
detergent was used to clean breast pumps, which were
thereafter disinfected in hypochlorite, but the _Ps.
aeruginosa_ could still be isolated. From there it got into
the expressed breast milk and by nasogastric tube into the
neonate. We introduced sterile detergent and autoclavable
breast pumps and the pseudomonas disappeared and has not been seen since. I
do not think the organism had any increased virulence and it was sensitive
to the routine antibiotics used for pseudomonas.
[Is there a lesson here for developing countries? Or don't they use breast
pumps and nasogastric tubes in neonates? - Mod.JW]
