I am writing to you in reference to a posting that I read in ProMED-mail,
on January 10, 1998. This posting was a commentary on the manufacture of
human influenza vaccines in egg free substrates. The moderator's response
was that indeed there were new vaccines in the works. At Origen we have
developed a chicken embryo cell line for use as a substitute for chicken
embryo fibroblasts. Although we have primarily focused on using these
cells for the production of avian disease vaccines, such as Marek's Disease
Virus, we have found that many influenza virus species also grow in these
cells. Thus they represent a potential alternative to eggs for a substrate
for the production of influenzavirus vaccines.
