Staph aureus food poisoning linked to Sunnyside Child Care Center outbreak that sickened dozens
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to a report Wednesday [24 Jun 2015], Alabama health officials have detected _Staphylococcus aureus_ toxin in several food products served at both locations of the Sunnyside Child Care Center in Montgomery. 86 children attending the facilities have been treated at local hospitals this week for symptoms that include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, cramps and lethargy. Clinical samples were all negative for norovirus and are being tested for other enteric pathogens such as _Salmonella_, _Shigella_ and _E. coli_. Laboratory test results are pending.

Public health environmentalists are working with the facility regarding the kitchen and food handling to avoid any reoccurrence and prevent future food-related outbreaks. A kitchen at the Sunnyside Child Care Center on S. Court Street prepares meals for children there and caters food served at the Sunnyside Child Care Center on Norman Bridge Road. Public health staff members have inspected the centers and collected clinical and environmental samples that are being processed at the Bureau of Clinical Laboratories. An investigation protocol that includes detailed questionnaires is being utilized.

On the afternoon of 23 Jun 2015, a concerned parent contacted Health Department personnel to report this suspected outbreak. More than 300 children attended the 2 day care centers that day. The department has closed the kitchen and has asked the child care center to remain closed while the investigation is ongoing, and cleaning and prevention measures are being implemented.

State Health Officer Dr. Donald Williamson has advised parents not to take ill children who attended these centers to any day care providers while this investigation is underway. Parents are urged to follow guidelines for child care admittance, such as being free of fever and other symptoms for 24 hours before returning to day care.

[Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in 4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any fever. The patients usually recover within a day.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
