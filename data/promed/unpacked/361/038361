Fabian Ndomo Ekue (1954-2014)
-----------------------------
We regret to inform you that ProMED-FRA moderator Dr Fabian Ndomo Ekue, DVM, MSC, PhD passed away in his sleep early yesterday morning [22 Feb 2014] at 60 years of age. He went to a concert in Houston, Texas, USA with a friend from Cameroon, came home, ate something, wished his son and daughter-in-law a good night and laid down to rest with his clothes still on. He never woke up. He must have had a heart attack in the very early morning and was found by his son, Collins. He was 60 years old.

After schooling at St Joseph College, Beau and CASST Bambili-Cameroon, Fabian Ekue obtained his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria in 1979. He supported himself and others through school by playing club soccer in Ibadan. He was a very solid student and a respected leader in the class of 52 students. During the typical 6 week study period for the final set of DVM exams in Medicine, Surgery and Public Health, he rushed back to Cameroon every weekend to lead his home soccer club PWD Workers to the Cup of Cameroon Championship game. He sailed through his exams at school, while being nicknamed "Le docteur" on the field. Fabian then returned home to work for the government and again play soccer, this time for the national team, the Indomitable Lions. Before long his director made him choose and he chose Veterinary Medicine. This led to both a Master's and PhD degree at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, where he trained as a virologist and completed a very progressive PhD in the epidemiology of African swine fever under the direction of Philip Wilkinson in 1989. They worked at the molecular level to map the various African swine fever strains and then Ekue carried out field surveys, documenting the magnitude of economic devastation caused by the then recent outbreak of African swine fever which had killed over 85 percent of the pigs in Cameroon.

Fabian came home to serve his country but was not immediately able to use his laboratory skills. He spent almost a decade in the North at Mankon and Wakwa as the Director of Animal Health programs where he took on management responsibilities, which he somehow maintained during the economic crises, structural adjustments and other economic challenges. Throughout, he always found enough to send his children to the best schools. He then returned to the capital Yaounde as the Director of Animal Production and Fisheries Research at the Institute for Agricultural Research and Development (Institut de Recherche Agricole pour le Developpement, IRAD), Cameroon. He reached the rank of Research Professor and was inducted as Fellow of the Cameroon Academy of Sciences. He consulted and lectured nationally and internationally.

In Yaounde, Fabian became an experienced manager working with budgets and taking several management short courses. He left in 2004 to become the Program Director of the Rumpi Area Participatory Development Project, a multi-year African Development Bank project. He later served on the founding staff as the Vice President of Academic Affairs in the University Institute of the Diocese of Buea, Cameroon. Fabian had the scientific pedigree from the UK, the support of mentors, the dynamic personality, and the drive to work anywhere in the world with specific opportunities he didn't pursue. He was soberly dedicated to development in Cameroon, step by step, obstacle overcome by obstacle overcome. He always struggled to have a positive impact on his people and to lead them well. He worked very hard and long every day to accomplish positive things when he could and he left the rest to itself as long as he could. He didn't always get the support that his talent and vision required but on a person to person level, he made progress steadily. In 2009, he joined as a Veterinary Moderator for the ProMED-mail French language list. For the last several years, he resided with his family in Houston, Texas, USA.

Fabian had a massive heart attack last September [2013] and we thought we had lost him at that time. Fortunately, after several days he regained consciousness and returned to full and complete health. We would talk often and he really was completely fit, looking forward to settling in the United States and the new life for his family here. It was quite amazing how he bounced back from his 1st heart attack. In a week or so, he was himself again and within 3 weeks he was completely active again with the one caveat of no more soccer. But he was gently exercising even last week when I talked with him. Last September, he was diagnosed with an underlying congenital cardiac hypertrophy but was healthy, fit, enjoying himself in Houston with his son, daughter in law, and 2 granddaughters and visits from his grandson in Kansas as the young family tries to juggle budding careers as a petroleum engineer and accountant. Fabian was really enjoying his granddaughters as he had missed much of this phase of life with his own children because he was away in the UK when they were small.

Fabian was a gentle man whose polite countenance belied the fact that he was one tough African. He put himself through veterinary school by playing club soccer as a foreigner in Ibadan, Nigeria. He left Cameroon and his young family twice, to get degrees at the University of Surrey and at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright. Upon his return, he struggled through the structural readjustment days. Suffice it to say, he knew who he was, what his principles were and had a magic resilience that allowed him to always move forward whether his dedication, vision, effort, skills and talent were recognized or not.

We will miss Fabian a great deal. I owe him a great deal personally. Not only did he help me succeed in my studies in Ibadan by teaching me a bit about what was proper to do and when to do it, but also how African societies are structured. He taught me a lot personally about rising to the challenge, how to enjoy life and everyone around you when others are unjustly attacking you, and lately how to base your life on your spiritual beliefs, whatever they may be. I can't even begin to count the number of ways that I admire him.
