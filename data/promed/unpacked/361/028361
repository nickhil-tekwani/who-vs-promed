The 1st case in the current bluetongue outbreak was detected on a French sheep farm on 11 Sep 2015. The French government has extended veterinary measures after 18 cases of bluetongue disease were detected in the country since 11 Sep 2015.

Since the 1st case of bluetongue disease in France was detected on a sheep farm, a further 17 have been identified, all in the Massif Central region, a major livestock farming area in the heart of the country.

"The 1st phase is to ensure that live exports can happen to avoid the economic consequences of an export ban," said Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll. He added that 2 measures would protect export markets: "Firstly, test animals for bluetongue, and, when those tests are negative, allow immediate export as planned. Secondly, launch vaccination."

He said that 1.3 million doses of vaccine were available to cover all planned live exports of cattle, sheep and goats until the end of this year [2015]. "Anybody who wants to export must vaccinate; there will be no discussion," Le Foll added. The measures include breeding animals.

Strict animal movement controls are in place, with the Sommet de l'Elevage event -- one France's largest livestock shows -- planned to take place between 7 and 9 Oct 2015 under threat from a suspected case on a neighbouring farm.

Mainland France has had bluetongue-free status since 2012, and this is the 1st outbreak in the EU since then. The French authorities say they are still investigating how the disease of a strain not seen since 2008 resurfaced this month [September 2015].

[It will be helpful to obtain information on the population(s) to be vaccinated according to the ministry's decision:
- Species?
- Within the affected zone? around it? elsewhere?
- Is it meant to protect France's susceptible livestock (in particular, sheep) from clinical disease or just facilitate exports according to EU's legislation, which deserves to be clarified?

Vaccine doses currently available to French authorities so far are "not enough" to contain the virus, according to Professor Peter Mertens, Head of Pirbright Institute's Vector-borne Viral Disease Programme. A package of 1.3 million doses was released on Monday [21 Sep 2015], which will be focused on animals intended for export.

"The vaccine requires 2 doses to work in cattle," said Professor Mertens, meaning the number of cattle that could be safeguarded is only in the hundreds of thousands. "They can't hope to vaccinate all of the cattle now. Measures such as movement restrictions, increased surveillance and testing and vaccinating animals for export are being rolled out." On discovering the virus on a sheep and cattle farm at Les Brulards in central France, French authorities imposed a 150-km protection zone, containing 4.6 million cattle, 700 000 sheep, and 160 000 goats.

BTV [bluetongue virus] can be spread by _Culicoides_ midges or via the movement of infected sheep, goats or cattle. Likened to "aerial plankton," Professor Mertens said midge clouds, that may include infected insects, will usually only move at up to 10 km an hour, the limit of their tolerance to wind. Commenting on this speed of travel, he said: "Midges often fly at dusk or dawn, and their activity and movement depends on both temperature and wind speed, although their movement over land is relatively slow. The assumption is that midges have a mechanism to stop them landing in water, so when they reach the English Channel, they could spend up to 10 to 16 hours in the air, and at wind speeds of 10 km per hour, they could potentially be travelling up to 160 km, easily reaching the UK from France in a single night."

The Met office is monitoring and modelling wind conditions and keeping Pirbright and Defra informed about the risks. Discussion with vaccine manufacturers are taking place, although there are also concerns with BTV serotype 4, which has re-emerged in Southeastern Europe, he added.

Official reports of cases of serotype 4 were released in Romania and Hungary earlier this month [September 2015]. A year ago, BTV-4 swept across the Balkans northwards from Greece before cooler weather led to a drop in notifications through the winter.

Scientists know the French strain to be serotype 8, an aggressive form of the virus that hit Europe in 2006 causing massive losses, particularly to the sheep industry, with Belgium losing 1/3rd of its national flock during the late summer of 2007. BTV-8 killed around 25 per cent of sheep and around one per cent of cattle back in 2006/7/8, also decimating farms in the Netherlands and much of France and Germany. Although fatality rates in cattle were much lower, the cattle industry was hit by movement restrictions, loss of trade, reduced milk yield, decreased reproductive performance, as well as surveillance and vaccination costs.

"There's no reason to think that this strain would not be just as damaging, and while we know it is serotype 8, we are currently undertaking a genome analysis with French colleagues to assess if the strain is in any way different," said Professor Mertens. But Professor Mertens that added it can have a "disastrous effect" in gestating cattle.

"Deformities known as dummy calf syndrome are caused by the virus infecting the foetus, causing defects in the central nervous system, and as a consequence, the calf can be born with no brain at all, where the cerebral hemispheres are virtually absent and replaced by fluid-filled fragile translucent sacs."

Anyone keeping ruminants should be aware of the potential risk posed by BTV and be wary of lameness, swelling around the head and mouth, loss of appetite, excessive salivation, conjunctivitis, mouth ulcers, reduced weight gain, as well as other signs of depression and poor condition. "If a shepherd knows their animals, they'll spot it, but it is not as obvious in cattle," advised Professor Mertens, meaning dairy farms should monitor for a drop in milk yield.

Monitoring milk production 2 or 3 times each day means dairy farms can pick up on a less obvious subclinical sign, said Jules Dare of Westpoint Veterinary Group. He noted that bulk milk tanks can be sampled for antibody levels and virus presence. "Watch out for swelling around the mouth and teeth," he stressed. "People have to keep an eye for it; if there's any doubt, call your vet." Clinical samples would then be sent by the veterinary services via official routes for laboratory testing and confirmation at the Pirbright Institute.

Animal health advisers in the UK have said that the main lesson learnt from the 2007 outbreak was that Defra's decision to administer 22 million doses was a major success, preventing the re-emergence of the disease in the UK during 2008. Rob Howells of Merial said: "The outbreak in 2007 showed the companies were very good at reacting, although the vaccination response can only be as good as market uptake. He said he was confident of vaccine production to respond "fairly quickly" if required. He warned that clinical BTV signs, while apparent, could be missed for something else: "We had farmers thinking they had foot and mouth disease back in 2007, and runny noses and lethargic behaviour could also suggest a pneumonia outbreak."

[Professor Mertens' views, as expressed in the above item, deserve the attention of the French and EU veterinary authorities.

On 15 Sep 2015, EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (Section Animal Health & Welfare) reportedly held a special meeting addressing the agenda: "Update from France on the Bluetongue Epidemiological Situation and the Measures Taken." Publication of the meeting's discussions and conclusions will help assess the current situation.

Regarding Prof. Mertens' comment on congenital malformations caused in cattle by BTV-8, subscribers may refer to abstract 20.003 of IMED (International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance 2009, Vienna, 13-16 Feb 2009), "Bluetongue Virus Vaccines: Solution or Part of the Problem?" By J. Maclachlan, cited in posting 20090218.0684. The said abstract included the following statement: "Until the emergence of BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) in northern Europe, congenital BTV infection only was described in regions where MLV (modified live virus) vaccines are used. The European strain of BTV-8 commonly causes teratogenic brain defects in the progeny of cattle infected during early gestation, defects that are identical to those caused by the original MLV vaccines, a fact that raises concerns regarding the origin/history of this strain of BTV-8." - Mod.AS
