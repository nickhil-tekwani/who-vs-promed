Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Transmitted Between Sheep
---------------------------------------------------
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) has been transmitted naturally
between sheep for the 1st time, a study has shown [see reference below].
Confirmation that such a thing is possible reinforces fears that the
disease may have entered sheep as well as cattle on farms in Britain.
The revelation that lambs at a government experimental station appear to
have caught BSE from their mothers coincides with plans to relax anti-BSE
controls in cattle and was not mentioned at a meeting of the Food Standards
Agency in London this week.
Scientists will now seek to estimate from ongoing experiments whether there
was ever enough infection in flocks to make the disease survive for long.
No evidence of BSE has emerged from testing sheep in abattoirs or on farms,
although this did not begin until well after the BSE epidemic in cattle was
in steep decline. Safety advisers have previously warned that any sheep
with BSE entering the food chain would be potentially far more dangerous
than a single cow, since there are far more parts of the animal that can
carry infection.
The report on infected lambs, in the journal Veterinary Record [reference
below], also comes as officials review contingency plans in case BSE is
ever found in sheep on normal farms. The present worst-case scenario
assumes that around 25 million sheep might have to be destroyed. There
would be severe shortages of sheep meat, since an entire year's crop of
lamb, some older sheep bred for mutton and many breeding ewes would have to
be killed.
But the plans have been based on hypothetical models. Now scientists from
the government's Veterinary Laboratories Agency have revealed that 2 ewes
fed 5 milligrams of BSE-infected material had lambs that died of BSE after
showing signs of infection in their tonsils 546 days after birth. Their
mothers had shown no outward signs of the disease at lambing, one showing
them 73 days after lambing, and the other 198 days after. But it is still
not certain that the lambs were infected while in the uterus, or shortly
before or after lambing. The disease may have spread through the birthing
fluids or in some other way. The evidence so far suggests this is far more
likely than the lambs catching the disease from other apparently unaffected
sheep. It is already known that BSE-like diseases can be transmitted via
blood in humans as well as animals, but there has been no evidence that it
has been handed from dam to calf in cattle, or mother to baby in people.
The sheep involved were of a genetic type that in lab tests previously
appeared most susceptible to BSE. But it is unclear how many such sheep are
in flocks on farms. There are 15 different genetic types [genotypes], and
unlike in BSE in cattle, genetic type seems important.
Unfortunately at present there would be no way of identifying resistant
sheep in time for them to go into food, while banning others. The fear
about sheep has existed for years because, until the late 1980s, they were
fed the same sort of feed as cattle. However if it was ever in sheep, there
is no suggestion that it ever existed on a large scale.
There is some good news. The lambs that seem to have inherited BSE showed a
brain signature similar to BSE in cattle. Officials have been worried that
some BSE in sheep, if it existed, might have been masked by a similar
disease called scrapie, not known to be dangerous to humans. The relatively
small scale of the vCJD epidemic in humans so far might give some
reassurance too, given the size of an enormous BSE cattle epidemic. Peter
Jinman, a leading veterinary surgeon on SEAC (the scientific body advising
the government on anti-BSE measures) said: "This clearly is an important
finding. It is another part of the jigsaw." SEAC would consider the
implications next month.
The Food Standards Agency said the study "adds to the scientific knowledge
in an area of continuing scientific uncertainty". It did not advise the
public against eating sheep, but would continue to recommend "precautionary
and proportionate measures".
The Department of the Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) pointed out
that nearly 2700 scrapie samples had been tested for BSE since 1998 with no
sign of the disease, although 2 samples with anomalous results were still
being tested, using mice.

[The continued decline in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases in
proportion to the eradication of BSE from cattle in the UK provides some
reassurance that the BSE agent has not spread in UK sheep flocks to any
extent. The UK Food Standards Agency has not placed any restrictions on the
sale of sheep products (mutton, lamb and wool).
