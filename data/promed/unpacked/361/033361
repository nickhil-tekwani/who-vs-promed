Three people have tested positive for swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] at Om Hospital and Research Centre [Kathmandu], while 3 others are suspected to have been infected with the same virus.

According to director of Om Hospital and Research Centre Dr. KP Devkota, test samples were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory. "After being diagnosed with swine flu, one woman died, and another was airlifted to India for treatment. Meanwhile, one man is receiving treatment at the hospital, and his health condition is improving," Dr. Devkota said. "Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says that [influenza A/H1N1 pdm 09] virus causes seasonal flu. However, the National Public Health Laboratory's report has marked it as swine flu."

Meanwhile, Dr. Bibek Kumar Lal said that though [influenza A/H1N1 pdm 09] virus was called swine flu in the beginning, the World Health Organisation has termed it seasonal flu now. "In the beginning, swine flu viruses transmitted to humans from pigs, but at present they transmit from humans to humans," he said. "Seasonal influenza is not a new kind of disease. People need not to worry even if they are diagnosed with the influenza. It can be treated completely."

According to the National Public Health Laboratory, Teku, 168 people diagnosed with seasonal influenza were recorded from [17 Nov 2018 to 10 Jan 2019]. Of these, 146 were diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09; 9 were diagnosed with influenza A/H3; and 13 were diagnosed with influenza B.

"The number of patients being diagnosed with seasonal influenza is increasing. We are trying to respond immediately and are also providing free vaccination to the hospitals and people," he said.

Health minister Sophia Chan Siu-chee and Hospital Authority chief executive Dr. Leung Pak-yin faced angry and upset staff during a meeting at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei, where doctors from across the city recounted stories of overwork and overcrowded wards.

Public hospitals have been under severe pressure since early January [2019] when the city entered the peak flu season, once again placing long-standing staff shortages under the spotlight. The flu outbreaks even triggered a decision by the government to bring forward the Lunar New Year holiday at all of the city's about 1000 preschools. The move was aimed at curbing rampant spread of the flu and reducing pressure on children's wards at both public and private hospitals.

On [Sat 26 Jan 2019] afternoon about 100 public sector doctors gathered in a theatre hall at Queen Elizabeth to voice their grievances in front of Chan and Leung.

Dr. Cheng Kai-chi, an associate consultant at Kwong Wah Hospital's department of surgery, said doctors were being morally blackmailed into overwork because officials knew they would not leave patients in need untreated. "We have to examine patients and even take off their clothes in corridors. They have no privacy," Cheng said. He slammed the government and the authority, which manages all public hospitals in the city, for what he said was their failure to retain experienced doctors. "The first step is to retain manpower and treasure us experienced doctors," he said. "They don't treasure us. Instead they try to hire cheap labour."

A doctor with the department of pediatrics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, who identified herself only as Lee, said: "Even when my official working hours are over, I cannot go home. I have to stay behind to look after the patients overnight because no other doctors can do so. Then I go back to work the next morning. It breaks my heart to see the medical service for patients deteriorating. I hope the government and authority can exhaust all possible means to solve these problems." Wards had become increasingly crowded over the years and consultation time with patients had reduced, she added.

The heartfelt appeals came less than a week after more than 100 nurses protested and demanded action over the staffing shortages.

Hours before [Sat 26 Jan 2019]'s forum, Hospital Authority chairman Dr. John Leong Chi-yan took to a radio show to apologize to the public for failing to provide satisfactory services. But he said the problems could not be solved overnight or by the authority alone.

The few hundred new doctors entering the sector this year [2019] from university would only replace older colleagues leaving for private practice, Leong said. He pledged to review bonuses offered to specialists and other senior doctors for working extra shifts at weekends, and said the authority would make a bigger effort to retain experienced and retiring staff.

Minister Chan said she had received many constructive and practical suggestions during her 1 and a half-hour meeting with the doctors. She urged the authority to prepare a short, medium and long-term manpower plan. "If there is a need for extra resources, the government will definitely try our best to provide them so we can solve the problems, of manpower in particular."

Chan also said she hoped more partnerships with private hospitals would help relieve the burden on public facilities.

Leung meanwhile said HKD 500 million (USD 63 million) in emergency funding to help hospitals deal with the flu surge had been received from the government in December [2018] and distributed to all public hospitals. "There is also more internal funding," he said. "Even if the HKD 500 million [USD 63 million] is running out, we can add HKD 300 million [USD 38 million], HKD 400 million [USD 51 million] or even HKD 500 million [USD 63 million] more. Frontline staff does not need to use resources tightly."

Hong Kong's shortage of medical practitioners has long been a problem. Critics attribute the shortfall to the high threshold set by the doctors' regulatory body for foreign doctors to practice in the city.

The Society for Community Organisation, a local church-backed group helping the underprivileged, on [Sat 26 Jan 2019] said it hoped doctors' unions would agree to import qualified overseas doctors to ease their workload.

The authority announced last [Fri 25 Jan 2019] that a one-off 10% increase in an allowance for its frontline staff had been endorsed and would come into effect on [Mon 28 Jan 2019] as a way to encourage them to provide extra help over the winter flu season. The new rate will be in effect for 12 weeks until the end of April [2019].

As of [Thu 24 Jan 2019], 86 people had died as a result of flu since Hong Kong entered the peak season at the turn of the new year. Some 71 of those people were older than 65. A total of 194 cases of flu have been classed as serious.

Occupancy rates at public hospital wards reached 105% on [Fri 25 Jan 2019], meaning temporary beds have had to be laid out in corridors or between fixed ones. On the same day 5917 people visited accident and emergency departments, and 17.7% were admitted to wards.

In the 2018-19 financial year, the authority added 574 beds citywide and allocated HKD 520 million [USD 66 million] for public hospitals to prepare for the increase in workload expected from flu patients.

[3] Sweden: seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus detected

Week 3/2019 (14-20 Jan 2019)
----------------------------
In Sweden, a seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus was detected in a specimen collected at the end of December [2018] from an adult. Preliminary whole genome sequence analysis suggests that the virus is a seasonal reassortant containing HA and NS, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 genes of human seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus and NA genes of human seasonal A(H3N2) influenza virus. No increase in virulence is expected compared to seasonal influenza strains. Further analysis is being conducted by the WHO Collaborating Center on influenza. More information can be found here: https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/globalassets/statistik-uppfoljning/smittsamma-sjukdomar/veckorapporter-influensa/2018-2019/influensarapport-2019-03.pdf [in Swedish].

[On 20 Mar 2018, the National International Health Regulations focal point for the Netherlands notified WHO about a human infected with a new reassortant A(H1N2) of seasonal influenza viruses that was detected in the routine sentinel influenza surveillance for influenza-like illness and other acute respiratory infections in the Netherlands (https://www.who.int/csr/don/23-march-2018-seasonal-reassortant-ah1n2-netherlands/en/]. The virus likely resulted from a reassortment event between circulating human seasonal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

Human infections with reassortant A(H1N2) viruses have occurred rarely in the past, but these were reassortants with the A(H1N1) virus that circulated prior to emergence of the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that triggered a pandemic. This is the first reassortant of seasonal 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal A(H3N2) viruses. Previous laboratory experiments with past A(H1N1) reassortants have suggested that these have limited capacity for transmission.

Risk assessment
This A(H1N2) reassortant virus is thought to pose a health risk similar to other seasonal influenza viruses. The virus has not been detected beyond this one person and current seasonal flu vaccines would likely offer protection against this virus. Additionally, this virus does not have markers associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs, and thus should be susceptible to treatment with currently licensed and available flu antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/netherlands-infection.htm). - Mod.UBA
