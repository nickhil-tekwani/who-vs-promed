The National News Agency [NNA] reported 11 children from Akkar were hospitalized on [Thu 13 Mar 2014], after displaying symptoms similar to those exhibited by a young relative just before he died, with one of the fathers demanding his kids be tested for swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) virus].

Tensions ran high in the northern town of Fnaydeq after 3 siblings and 7 cousins of the man, who died 2 days ago, began to show signs of shortness of breath and a high fever, both symptoms associated with swine flu. He died shortly after being admitted to a hospital for suffering from exactly the same things and the cause of his death is still unknown.

A sister of the victim was in such a critical condition that she was immediately taken to St Georges Hospital in Beirut, according to the NNA. Her 2 brothers were initially admitted to the Monla Hospital in Tripoli before being transferred to the American University of Beirut Medical Center [AUBMC] later in the day.

When contacted by The Daily Star, both the St Georges Hospital and AUBMC's emergency rooms refused to confirm or deny that the siblings had been admitted, citing patient confidentiality. The transfer reportedly occurred following calls made by Future MP Mouin Merhebi to Health Minister Wael Abu Faour.

Fnaydeq Mayor Khaldoun Taleb announced that "7 other children, who are the [cousins of the man who died], were transferred by a municipality car to the Mounla Hospital in Tripoli as a precautionary measure."

Monla Hospital Director Abdel Karim Mounla released a statement confirming that the father of the 7 children had asked staff to test them for the H1N1 virus, otherwise known as swine flu. "But this type of analysis is not available in the hospital, only at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut," he said.

An emergency room employee at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital confirmed that the hospital did have the capability to conduct tests to detect swine flu, but told The Daily Star that no H1N1 cases had been admitted to the hospital in 2014.

According to Monla, the father of the 7 children "refused to cooperate and insisted on admitting them to the hospital, even though their cases did not call for that."

Following a medical examination, the NNA reported, doctors determined that the condition of the 7 children was very different from the victim and his 3 siblings, but that tests were still underway.

Subsequently, Mayor Taleb said another child had been transferred to hospital after he also contracted a fever and started suffering from shortness of breath.

The Health Ministry warned the public earlier in March 2014 about the dangers of the H1N1 virus after a number of cases emerged, advising flu patients to consult a doctor if their fever persisted more than 5 days or if they experienced breathing difficulties.

[It is unclear when the victim first developed symptoms but his presentation is consistent with an influenza event culminating in progressive influenza pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia and death. Other respiratory viral processes can produce a similar outcome but, if the contacts do indeed have the same infectious agent, influenza virus would be at the top of the differential diagnosis list. As recognized in the 2009 pandemic, the young adult cohort (similar to what occurred in the Great Pandemic of 1918-1919) had a mortality rate out of proportion to what occurs in seasonal influenza. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding this cluster of cases in northern Lebanon. - Mod.LL
