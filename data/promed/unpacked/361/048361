Another 11 people have been infected with anthrax in Shahzadpur [Shahjadpur] upazila [sub-district] of Sirajganj [district, Rajshahi
division] within the last 24 hours. The affected people, SS, 25; RI, 20; FH, 22; R, 11; H, 35; M, 15; B, 25; M, 18; N, 14; H, 12; and A, 4, hail from Moshipur Uttarpara village in the upazila. They were given primary treatment at the upazila health complex.

Although the district administration took initiatives and issued orders to stop slaughter of sick cattle, such act did not stop.

The upazila health department has sent several medical teams in the anthrax affected village in the upazila to tackle the ongoing outbreak of infection and identify the fresh infected people, said Dr Jafarul Islam, Shahzadpur upazila health and family planning officer.

Quoting the victims, Dr Jafarul said one of the village slaughtered a sick cow on [3 Jul 2016] and distributed its meat among the villagers. Those who took part in the meat processing are being infected with anthrax, he added.

With the latest 11, the disease has affected a total of 61 people in the upazila since May this year [2016].

[This article has a nice photo of multiple small lesions on an affected forearm.

They were told to not slaughter and butcher sick cattle, but they continued to do it and to distribute the meat. If nothing else, the authorities can name names to bring home the importance and immediacy of what they are saying. And those affected will carry the scars, if they are lucky, for the rest of their lives. They are biologically branded. To overcome this foolish behaviour the cattle must be vaccinated throughout the upazila.
