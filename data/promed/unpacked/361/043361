Subject: Ribavirin/Virazole
Yesterday I had a chance to speak with Dr. H. Fernandez at ICN
Pharmaceuticals and he told me that ribavirin is not approved in the USA
although it is approved and marketed abroad. ICN has no plans to market the
drug in the USA or seek approval. They do however manufacture the drug for
this country and distribute it free of charge on request. Dr. Fernandez said
he was puzzled by the apparent fuss over rivavirin on the net and had left a
message for C. Callisher but hadn't as yet heard back.
In light of Dr. Fernandez' statements, I am puzzled over the quoted "cost"
of treatment with ribavirin reported on ProMED.
Dr. Fernandez also explained in some detail the supply situation but I will
leave that for him to explain to anyone interested except to note that there
doesn't appear to be any shortage and it seems to me too bad that FDA
doesn't approve the drug.

[Charlie Calisher is travelling at present (Paris, Rabat ... somebody has to
do it) and I am sure he will respond after he returns on April 8th. Anyone
wanting to question Dr Fernandez will have to do it via John Gullett as he
has not provided the latter's email address. MHJ]
