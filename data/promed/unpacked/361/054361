In response to Dr Calisher's question concerning dengue in the Torres
Strait Islands: The epidemic of dengue 2 in the Torres Strait finished at
the end of the wet season of 1997 (about April) and there have been no
further cases there since then (ref  "Two contiguous outbreaks of dengue
type 2 in north Queensland". J.N. Hanna et al. Medical Journal of Australia
(1998) 168, 221-225.). The dengue 3 epidemic that started in Cairns in
December 1997 has persisted over the cooler months of 1998 (May to
September) and the number of cases is now increasing in the town of Mossman
about 80km
north of Cairns (still dengue 3) as the weather warms up. There is a
potential, of course, for the epidemic to move back to Cairns or to other
areas of north Queensland.

[The reason I asked, in a footnote to a message about Japanese encephalitis
vaccinations, about dengue in the Torres Strait islands was to bring up the
question of antibody enhancement. Has anyone data regarding risk of dengue
hemorrhagic fever in people, particularly young people, who are infected
with a non-dengue flavivirus, such as JEV, and then infected with a dengue
virus? Yellow fever vaccination then infection with a dengue virus?
Natural infection with West Nile virus then infected with a dengue virus? -
