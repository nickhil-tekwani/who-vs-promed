Researchers at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France -- Bernard La Scola, Christelle Desnues and Didier Raoult -- have discovered a new giant virus. It was found living inside an amoeba found in an eye patient's contact lens fluid. Inside the virus, they also found a new type of virophage (a subviral agent that reproduces in amoeba cells) which contained an unknown genetic parasite they're calling transpovirons. The discovery of the virus is detailed in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [See abstract, reproduced below. - Mod.CP].

Lentille [virus], as the researchers named it, belongs to a class [Family] of viruses called the _Mimiviridae_. Researchers named the virophage Sputnik 2. According to Phys.org, "Inside of the virophage, they found fragments of DNA that didn't belong to the amoeba, the giant virus or the virophage, indicating that it was class of unknown genetic parasite that they've named transpovirons." The DNA of transpovirons outnumbered the DNA of Lentille up to 14 to 1. Researchers believe that transpovirons might piggyback on virophages like Sputnik 2 to, in effect, jump from giant virus to giant virus.

Is this cause for concern? No. There's no killer virus lurking in your contact lens fluid. But the infected amoeba was discovered because it had contaminated the eyes of a 17-year-old French girl. So if your eyes are red, you might be infected. Researchers suggest that their work will likely result in more research into giant viruses.

Abstract
----------
"A distinct class of infectious agents, the virophages that infect giant viruses of the _Mimiviridae_ family, has been recently described. Here, we report the simultaneous discovery of a giant virus of _Acanthamoeba polyphaga_ (Lentille virus) that contains an integrated genome of a virophage (Sputnik 2), and a member of a previously unknown class of mobile genetic elements, the transpovirons. The transpovirons are linear DNA elements of around 7 kb that encompass 6-8 protein-coding genes, 2 of which are homologous to virophage genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the free form of the transpoviron replicates within the giant virus factory and accumulates in high copy numbers inside giant virus particles, Sputnik 2 particles, and amoeba cytoplasm. Analysis of deep-sequencing data showed that the virophage and the transpoviron can integrate in nearly any place in the chromosome of the giant virus host and that, although less frequently, the transpoviron can also be linked to the virophage chromosome. In addition, integrated fragments of transpoviron DNA were detected in several giant virus and Sputnik genomes. Analysis of 19 Mimivirus strains revealed 3 distinct transpovirons associated with 3 subgroups of Mimiviruses. The virophage, the transpoviron, and the previously identified self-splicing introns and inteins, constitute the complex, interconnected mobilome of the giant viruses and are likely to substantially contribute to interviral gene transfer."

Amoebae, large single-celled organisms, are commonly found in air-conditioning systems in large buildings and often harbour various bacteria and viruses inside them, which can go on to infect people working in those buildings. The world's largest virus, a giant virus that lurks inside amoebae and may cause pneumonia in humans, was discovered in a sample taken from a water cooling tower in Bradford, UK in 1992. This virus, subsequently named "_Mimivirus_," has at least 900 genes, an enormous number for a virus, and its size is more like that of a bacterium. It can be seen using a good optical microscope, whereas most viruses can only be visualised by electron microscopy. In terms of DNA, it is approximately 1/5th bigger than any previously characterised virus considered to be the largest in the world.

Now, another mimivirus, named Lentille virus, has been isolated from an _Acanthamoeba polyphaga_ host that was present in contact lens fluid of an eye patient, and presumably considered to be a fortuitous contaminant. Its present significance is that it is the host of another minivirus named _Lentille virus_. This virus contains the integrated genome of a virophage (designated Sputnik 2) and a member of a previously unknown class of mobile genetic elements, designated transpovirons. The transpovirons are linear DNA elements of approximately 7 kb that encompass 6-8 protein-encoding genes, 2 of which are homologous to virophage genes. The free form of the transpoviron replicates within the giant virus factory and accumulates in high copy numbers inside giant virus particles, Sputnik 2 particles, and amoeba cytoplasm. The virophage, the transpoviron, and the previously identified self-splicing introns and inteins constitute the complex, interconnected mobilome of the giant viruses and are likely to substantially contribute to interviral gene transfer.

Understanding of the significance of these complex genetic interactions and their role in the evolution of life forms must be left to the reader's imagination. - Mod.CP]
