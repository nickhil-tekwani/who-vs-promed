Measles outbreak shuts down universities in Tokyo
-------------------
Waseda University on Monday [21 May 2007] suspended almost all
classes after 30 students were confirmed infected with measles amid
an outbreak spreading throughout the Tokyo area, officials said.
About 55 000 undergraduate and graduate students were told not to
come to school until 29 May 2007, the officials said.
The university is the largest in terms of number of students whose
activities have been affected by the outbreak. Other universities in
the Tokyo area have already closed their doors because of the measles
scare. According to a survey compiled by The Asahi Shimbun, at least
150 000 students attending major universities based in Tokyo have
been affected.
Waseda University, based in Shinjuku Ward, canceled almost all
classes from 2:40 PM Monday [21 May 2007] after the number of
students who had developed measles symptoms reached 30 by 11 AM, the
officials said. The decision was made at the discretion of a doctor
at the school's Human Services Center. Students were instructed to
refrain from coming to all campuses, except the graduate school's
Kita-Kyushu campus in Fukuoka Prefecture. As for club activities,
such as baseball, students can practice and take part in other
functions if they can prove they have already contracted and
recovered from the disease or have authorization from doctors showing
that they carry the appropriate antibodies.
Chuo University shut down its Tama campus on Sunday [20 May 2007] and
the Korakuen campus on Saturday [19 May 2007]. The 2 campuses will
remain sealed off from students until [28 May 2007], university officials said.
Of the 14 colleges at Nihon University, 4, including the College of
Humanities and Science, canceled classes from Wednesday through
Monday [?23 to 28 May 2007]. About 800 people were initially
scheduled to take the TOEIC test on [27 May 2007] at Nihon
University's College of Economics building in Chiyoda Ward. But the
building was closed off because of the measles outbreak, and the test
organizer had to switch the test-taking site to nearby Tokyo Denki
University on Friday [?25 May 2007].

Officials had to notify test-takers of the change by express mail.
They also told the test-takers that the examination fees could be
refunded and that they could postpone the test date. But Tokyo Denki
University on Saturday suddenly decided against the use of the school
building for TOEIC out of concerns of a measles infection. The
organizer had to secure another location for the tests, according to
the officials.
Komazawa, Seikei, Wako universities and the Tokyo University of
Agriculture have also canceled classes.
Sophia University, which had canceled all classes from [12 through 19
May 2007], resumed classes Monday [21 May 2007]. But the university
remains on alert for additional infections. Other major universities
in Tokyo, including the University of Tokyo, Keio, Hosei, Meiji, Toyo
and Senshu universities, confirmed that some of their students have
developed symptoms of the disease, but they have not suspended classes.
According to the Tokyo metropolitan education board, 279 students and
pupils attending 104 metropolitan-run schools had been diagnosed with
the disease by Friday [18 May 2007]. A total of 9 of those schools
have or had suspended all of their classes because of the outbreak,
while 2 schools canceled some classes.
The measles outbreak has spread to Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa
prefectures. In Chiba Prefecture, at least 350 students at more than
10 colleges and universities were confirmed to have developed measles
symptoms by Thursday [17 May 2007]. There are 4 students at Saitama
University who had also shown symptoms, reports said.
Under regulations of the School Health Law, measles is designated as
a highly contagious disease spread by an airborne virus. A school
principal can ask students who have contracted the disease to stay
home. The infected students can be asked not to attend classes until
3 days have passed since their fevers have abated.

Measles outbreak blamed on lack of youth exposure
------------------
The rash of measles outbreaks among people in their 30s and younger
is believed to have been sparked by weakened immunities to the
disease as children have grown up lacking early exposure to the
virus, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said Tuesday [22
May 2007].
The Kanto region has recently seen an outbreak of measles, with many
universities calling off classes as a result, affecting at least 150
000 students, including Waseda University, which closed its main
campus Monday [21 May 2007].
Many are still wondering why there has been a sudden outbreak. A
prevailing characteristic this time around is that most of those
infected are in their 20s and 30s, an age that some claim never
received sufficient vaccinations as children. However, according to a
survey by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry in 2005, youth
vaccination rates have been high, with more than 95 percent of people
aged 2 to 19, 88.6 percent of people in their 20s and 85 percent of
people in their 30s having been vaccinated, while just 52.3 percent
of people aged 40 and over have been vaccinated.
Why is it the younger generation that is affected by this outbreak
when so many of them have been vaccinated? The institute says that
with so many people being vaccinated, measles outbreaks have dropped
sharply, which means people have had less exposure to the virus and
less opportunity to build up resistance.
About 5 percent of people cannot build an immunity with just once
vaccination. These people, having since reached adulthood, are
contributing to the current spread of the disease, according to the
institute. Middle-aged people and the elderly have strong immunities
as they have been through many outbreaks and are not as easily
affected by this outbreak.
A single vaccination may not create immunity or could see a
deterioration in immunity after several years. To prevent this, a
double vaccination system was introduced from April last year [2006].
Children entering primary school are now subject to the double
vaccination system. However, this measure is expected to take 10
years before the effects will be noticeable. Therefore, the only
preventive measure existing is protective inoculations. The institute
advises people not vaccinated who have never been infected to get vaccinated.
Women wanting to have children in the future are especially advised
to get vaccinated, because measles symptoms are more pronounced
during pregnancy, risking the lives of both mother and child.
However, women who are pregnant cannot receive vaccinations.
There is no cure for measles. Those infected need to avoid crowds and
rest at home. The ministry says measles cannot be diagnosed in its
early phase and people who have insufficient immunities may have a
lack of symptoms such as rashes. The ministry is alerting people by
telling them if cold-like symptoms appear to take precautions, such
as wearing masks, so as not to pass the disease to others.
Stockpiles of vaccine reduced by 30 percent in 2 days
---------------------------
Stockpiles of measles vaccines decreased by about 160 000 doses in 2
days, more than 30 percent of the total stockpile, the Health, Labor
and Welfare Ministry said. The ministry added that there is plenty of
vaccine and it will not run out soon. However, the ministry also has
called for the wise distribution of vaccine, asking vaccination
centers to "please efficiently prevent the disease from spreading by
confirming whether a person has immunity before vaccinating."
There were about 450 000 individual doses of vaccine as of [16 May
2007], but the number was about 290 000 as of Friday [18 May 2007].
Most of the stockpile is believed to have been bought by medical
institutions and local governments.
Major universities that have called off classes are: Nihon University
from 16 to 31 May 2007, with 91 students infected, affecting 27 000
students; Komazawa University from 17 to 30 May 2007, 13 infected,
about 16 000 affected; Tokyo University of Technology from 17 to 26
May 2007, 5 infected, about 6000 affected; Wako University from 18 to
24 May 2007, 5 infected, about 3500 affected; Seikei University from
18 to 27 May 2007, 8 infected, about 8000 affected; Chuo University
from 19 to 28 May 2007, 13 infected, about 27 000 affected; Tokyo
University of Agriculture from 21 May 2007 to 3 Jun 2007, 8 infected,
about 8000 affected; and Waseda University from 21 to 29 May 2007, 30
infected, about 55 000 affected.

[Since the 1st report of measles activity in Japan (see prior
ProMED-mail posting Measles - Japan (Tokyo, Saitama): alert, RFI
20070424.1337), the measles activity has expanded from Tokyo and
Saitama prefectures to now include Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures as
well. All of these are neighboring prefectures to Tokyo (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/japan_divisions.jpg>
for a map of Japan with prefectures).
According to the Infectious Disease Surveillance Data
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/idwr/kanja/weeklygraph/12measles-e.html>,
there appears to be an increase in reported cases of measles
nationwide beginning week 15 (7 Apr 2007) with the increase more
marked by week 17 (21 Apr 2007), but as mentioned previously the
overall rates are lower than the past 10 years with the exception of
2006. While the graph states it refers to sentinel case reports, the
Y-axis is not clear as to what is being measured (? actual case
numbers, population based rates).
Of interest is that the newswire mentions school closings
particularly universities, whereas the earlier report we had
mentioned elementary, junior and senior high schools. Measles is a
vaccine preventable disease. Receipt of 2 doses of potent vaccine
(properly stored maintaining cold chain temperature requirements from
time of production through time of administration of the vaccine)
results in vaccine efficacies of 99 percent when the 1st dose is
received at 12 months of age or older (see Measles Pink Book Chapter
at: <http://www.cdc.gov/Nip/publications/pink/meas.pdf>).
According to the WHO immunization profile for Japan:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/globalsummary/immunization/countryprofileresult.cfm?C='jpn'>
the official vaccination schedule as of December 2006 included one
dose of measles containing vaccine to be administered between the age
of 12 to 90 months. The occurrence of measles cases in the older
school age population may well be a reflection of the single dose
schedule that has been in use in the country. The 2nd newswire above
mentions that a 2nd dose of measles was introduced into the routine
vaccination schedule in April 2006 for school enterers. Given the
current outbreak, the need to widen the age range of those
recommended to receive a 2nd dose of vaccine should be considered,
rather than wait for a natural "catch up" to occur. - Mod.MPP]
