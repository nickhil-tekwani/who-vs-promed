According to the Wyoming Livestock Board, a wild eastern cottontail has tested positive for Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 in Albany County.

The disease is a viral pathogen that causes sudden death in rabbits and can be spread through direct contact with infected rabbits, meat or fur, or materials that come in contact with those carriers. It is only known to affect rabbits, both wild and domestic. It is highly contagious, fatal, and is not related to coronavirus. It is not known to infect non-rabbit domestic pets, humans, or livestock.

The virus was previously identified in New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah.

There are no licensed vaccines produced in the US, but the process is underway for importing 2 vaccines. Accredited veterinarians may import a vaccine with approval by the state veterinarian and the USDA.

The virus could seriously impact the pet rabbit industry, 4-H, and FFA [youth organizations] projects, and academic, industrial or hobby groups such as laboratories, exhibitions, pelt, and hunting.

Rabbit owners/breeders are advised to tighten biosecurity, ensuring their stock does not come in contact with wild rabbits, limiting introduction of new rabbits to the colony, and barring visitors from the facility. Additionally, good measures for the owners include hand washing before and after handling animals, change clothing and footwear, and not sharing equipment-- like water bottles or containers -- with other rabbit owners.

For more information about this disease rabbit owners should contact their own veterinarian.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (less than 2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia.

Regarding this case, an immediate notification was sent to the OIE on 18 Dec 2020. The epidemiological comments mentioned that: "Wyoming (WY)--RHDV2 confirmed in a wild Eastern cottontail rabbit (_Sylvilagus floridanus_) in Albany County, Wyoming. This is the 1st detection of RHDV2 in Wyoming and the 1st detection of RHDV2 in an Eastern cottontail rabbit in the United States. The Wyoming State Animal Health and Wildlife Officials and USDA, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will continue to investigate reports of suspect sick or dead wild rabbits and feral or pet domestic rabbits for surveillance.
