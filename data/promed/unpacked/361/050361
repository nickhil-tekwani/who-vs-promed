Tests did not show why one person died and 9 others at the same work
place became sick in Lanping County, southwest China's Yunnan
Province. "No evidence was found to substantiate an epidemic through
tests of the patient's blood and urine samples as well as tests of
the drinking water," the county's health bureau said in a statement
released Saturday [28 Feb 2009].

All of the patients were workers at a construction site near Biyuhe
Village in Lanping County. They developed symptoms including numb
limbs, dizziness, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting nearly a month ago.
As of 28 Feb 2009, one person had died and 3 others had
life-threatening conditions. The other 5 were under medical
observation. Local health authorities were investigating the cause of
their illness, but failed to draw a conclusion.

[An article in Chinese dated 2 Mar 2009 in Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao
says that the illnesses began on 18 Feb 2009 and that food and water
poisoning have been ruled out

[More epidemiological information is required to begin to formulate
possible etiologies here, such as the epidemiological curve, the time
course of symptom occurrence, as well as the length of illness. A
toxin illness, either biological or otherwise, seems to be more
likely than infection per se.
