About 500 people have fallen ill in a _Salmonella_ outbreak in a Venezuelan state. The Anzoatiguense Institute of Health (Saludanz) reported 480 people had tested positive for _Salmonella_, mostly from the El Carmen and San Cristobal area of the Simon Bolivar municipality. In mid-December 2020, the agency revealed 240 children and adults had been affected and seen at different health centers after a significant increase in salmonellosis in November 2020.

Investigations so far have pointed to contaminated water as the source of infection, but officials have not ruled out a type of Brazilian sausage being behind some cases in the outbreak. They urged the public to buy food and water from hygienic places that comply with the necessary permits. People were also advised to follow good hygiene standards at home, such as boiling water as well as washing and cooking food sufficiently before consuming it.

Because of the increase in infections, authorities are disinfecting trucks with water and inspecting businesses that sell drinking water as well as food outlets. A group of 6 inspectors are making daily visits to such businesses. Some of those affected had reported water does not reach them regularly and when it does arrive, it is cloudy in color and has an odor.
