Regarding the blinding disease in elephants. Did you ever obtain a biopsy
for microscopy? Electron microscopy might be helpful if LM (Light
Microscopy) does not give diagnostic clues. How about microsporidia?

I am a reader of the postings in ProMED and find great interest in the
topics covered.
I can only offer a suggestion that indicates a lack of vitamin A in the
diets of the elephants. I am not suggesting that the quantity of vitamin A
in the diet is low but, maybe, low protein intake or intake of too many
nitrates or preservatives is destroying the available vitamin A.
Hydrogenated oil such as coconut or palm oil could destroy the chance of
absorption of vitamin A. How often are food ingredients restocked (rancid)?
Have those ingredients changed? Does this restocking occur when symptoms
disappear or re-occur? For the imported animals -- has there exposure to
light increased directly or indirectly (highly reflective painted surfaces
or intensity of sun exposure) which would dramatically increase the need for
vitamin A?

I would like to ask whether there is any temporal association between the
ivermectin given 4 times per year (I assume about every 3 months) and these
inflammatory ocular episodes every 3-4 months? Were they receiving
ivermectin prior to their transfer to Jerusalem? If there is an
association, one hypothesis might be that these elephants have a chronic
microfilaremia (if elephants can get filarial disease -- one with ocular
tropism like onchocerciasis in humans?) and that partial treatment with the
ivermectin leads to an antigen flare and subsequent inflammatory bilateral
eye disease (not clear to me whether all recurrent episodes are a
keratoconjunctivitis or also have an anterior uveitis component?). Given the
periodicity of a variety of human filarial diseases, a routine blood smear
for parasites might not be a sensitive way of detecting such an
infection.

Another thought would be Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), particularly if
the animals had any contact with wildebeest or sheep. There is an a good
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test (whole blood) for both SA-MCF (Sheep
Associated Malignant Catarrhal Fever) and WD-MCF (Wildebeest Derived
Malignant Catarrhal Fever). This disease does cause corneal opacity and
probably should be ruled out.
