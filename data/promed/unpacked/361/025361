HANTAVIRUS INFECTION - BRAZIL (FEDERAL DISTRICT)

There have been 4 more cases of hantavirus
infection confirmed in the Federal District.
These suspected cases were confirmed by
[laboratory] tests in the Adolfo Lutz Institute
in Sao Paulo, [results of which] were sent to the
Secretary of Health nearly a month ago. Of these
reported cases, 2 were from a rural area in
Planaltina, one from an agricultural zone in
Brazlandia and the other from a city still not
identified, but which is definitely located in
the Federal District.
These cases were analyzed when a 16-year-old
student died in Sao Sebastiao, presumably a
victim of hantavirus infection.
The Secretary of Health indicated that there was
no cause for alarm. "The behavior [of the
disease] this year [2007] is the same as in 2006
with the first cases occurring up to June and the
last in August (2006)," affirmed the Subsecretary
for Health Surveillance, Eduardo Pinheiro Guerra.
In 2004, half of the 30 recorded [hantavirus
cases] occurred in Sao Sebastiao. However,
according to the Director of Epidemiological
Surveillance, Disney Antezana, the risk of
contracting the disease is the same in any rural
area. "The cases are concentrated somewhat in
Sao Sebastiao because the city is very close to
the rural areas. But care [to avoid infection]
must be the same in whatever region of the
countryside," said the specialist.
Within the next 15 days, 300 people will be
contracted for 3 months to clean up the city [to
combat rodents] and educate the public.

[It would be interesting to know if these
reported infections are due to Juquitiba virus,
which occurs in Brazil, or some other hantavirus,
and which rodents are the hosts in this area.
Although hantaviruses can be extraordinarily
difficult to isolate, it would be of value to
develop a repository of hantavirus isolates in
Brazil for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes.
