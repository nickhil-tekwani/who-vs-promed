I have been forwarded an email from a person living in Haiti with the
following report:
"There appears to be a recent tropical disease in Haiti that is
becoming epidemic. It is being compared to kala azar or black fever.
They are also referring to it as [hemorrhagic] dengue fever. It is a
parasitic infection spread by sand flies and there have been similar
cases in India, Nepal, Sudan & Brazil. The 20-year-old son of a
friend of ours died of it this week, and we have a very close family
friend who was air-vacced out of Haiti on Friday and is in critical
condition at [name deleted] Hospital. We also know 2 other friends in
Haiti that were diagnosed. 4 within a week. Several of them have
beach houses out by Trou Baguette."
Leishmaniasis seems extremely unlikely, but DHF or severe malaria are
certainly possibilities. Any additional info would be welcome.

[The message contains no data on the clinical presentation, just a
guess that the clinical picture could be compatible with
leishmaniasis or hemorrhagic dengue fever. Visceral leishmaniasis
does not present with cutaneous bleeding, and the rash, bleeding and
renal failure of complicated dengue fever infection offer little
overlap with the symptoms described.
Leishmaniasis seems improbable. It has never been reported from
Haiti, and although there is a focus in the Dominican Republic of
cutaneous leishmanisis (Leishmaniasis in the Caribbean Islands. A
review. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1992 Jun 16;653:154-60), this does not make
it more likely that the present outbreak is visceral leishmaniasis.
ProMED would be very grateful for further information on clinical
signs and symptoms from this outbreak. - Mod.EP]
