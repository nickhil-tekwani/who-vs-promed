Three additional cases of hepatitis C related to the outbreak in Ward County have been confirmed, according to the North Dakota Department of Health. To date, 50 cases have been identified as part of the outbreak in Minot.

"The department is conducting testing in the area to better understand the scope of the outbreak and make sure those infected are aware of their status and can seek appropriate medical care," state epidemiologist Tracy Miller said in a press release.

Hepatitis C is a virus that affects the liver and is transmitted through blood. Most people have no initial symptoms or only mild, non-specific symptoms. Hepatitis C can go undiagnosed for years due to a lack of symptoms.

The Department of Health urges those who inject drugs or have received tattoos from an unregulated source to be tested for hepatitis C. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends that people who were born from 1945 to 1964 should be tested at least once in their lifetime for the virus.

[The previous postings regarding hepatitis C in Minot, North Dakota were related to cases linked to a nursing home which could have been related to situations such as glucose point of care testing via inadvertent contamination of testing equipment and medication contamination by drug-abusing health care workers. This posting does not mention the nursing home, but it is likely the case.

Unlike hepatitis A and B, acute manifestations of HCV infection are quite uncommon, and the infection is generally found serologically. Chronic infection may occur in 85-90 percent of cases, but clearance seems to be higher when acute infection is overt and when acquired in childhood. As compared to hepatitis B, sexual transmission and perinatal transmission are much less common. No vaccine is yet available, and gamma globulin preparations do not seem to prevent transmission when used post exposure. A certain percentage of infected individuals will slowly progress to cirrhosis, and some will develop liver cancer, but these complications are usually over decades. At least in a geriatric nursing home setting, HCV is not likely to be a significant issue in morbidity or mortality.

The therapeutic bandwidth for hepatitis C is expanding rapidly since the time when the interferon and ribavirin combination was the only choice. A number of highly effective medications have recently or will soon reach the marketplace and will change the playing field. Although cost of therapy can be an issue, the cost savings in preventing the medical costs of cirrhosis and liver cancer should be entered into the equation. Not all individuals with chronic HCV infection develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and most, when they die, will die with HCV and not from HCV. Distinguishing those with HCV who will progress is, however, not easy. - Mod.LL
