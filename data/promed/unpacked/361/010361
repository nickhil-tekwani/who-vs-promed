[Colombia's animal health authority (ICA) has been prompt to report this case of FMD to the OIE and to all stakeholders and has taken immediate actions to contain the outbreak. The following statement is summarized from an ICA press release reported on 1 Oct 2018.

"As a result of the surveillance and control measures established for those herds located in the containment zone, which include some of the municipalities in the departments of Cundinamarca, Boyaca, Casanare y Arauca, following the 2017 FMD outbreaks, an outbreak was detected in a herd located in the rural zone of Sogamoso, Boyaca. A 3 year old cow in this herd of 18 animals exhibited the following FMD-compatible clinical signs: salivation, lingual epithelial shedding and drooling.

"ICA's National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory conducted molecular tests (PCR) that were positive, and then conducted virus isolation where they identified FMD serotype O.

"Following genetic sequencing, it was concluded that the virus isolated was related to previous FMD cases which occurred in 2017 within the containment zone. To date (2 Oct 2018), no other case has been detected.

"ICA has issued quarantine [orders] and implemented cleaning, disinfection, and control measures for the affected premises, and will order the depopulation of the infected and contact animals."

Following this immediate notification received from the delegate of Colombia, the OIE withdrew the approval of the containment zone, and the "FMD free zone where vaccination is practised" status of Colombia, which was recognized by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in Resolution No. 22 during the May 2018 General Session, was suspended effective 17 Sep 2018; http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/suspensionreinstatement-of-status/.
