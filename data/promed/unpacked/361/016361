1st rabid cat in over 50 years found in Prescott Valley
-------------------------------------------------------
A cat hit by a car in the 3200 block of Date Creek on [3 Dec 2015] had rabies, the 1st case of a rabid domestic cat since the 1950s in Yavapai County [Arizona], a sheriff's spokesman said.

The cat bit a person who tried to help it after the accident. The man was treated and released at the hospital, Dwight D'Evelyn said. The cat died and an animal control officer took it for rabies testing. On [11 Dec 2015] the results came back positive. Officials informed the bite victim, who received rabies treatment, he said.

They also informed others who might have been exposed and also quarantined a 2nd cat because it had been in a fight with the infected cat. "It is important to know that rabies is present in this area and that unvaccinated domestic animals can present a danger to humans," D'Evelyn said. "Also, please remember it is important to report any animal bite so that testing and tracking of the potential rabid animal can be done quickly and proper treatment for the bite victim can be sought."

For any questions regarding rabies issues, contact the County Animal Control Office at 928-771-3282.

[Yavapai County is in central Arizona, south-west of Flagstaff and north of Phoenix; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/arizona_90.jpg.

The Arizona Department of Health Services reported a total of 27 cases of rabid skunks in 2013-2014 in southern Arizona. This year (2015) to date rabies was diagnosed in 64 bats (51 in Pima County and 3 in Yavapai County), 35 skunks (29 in Santa Cruz County), and in 3 foxes, 2 bobcats, and 2 coyotes (all in Gila County). For these data see: http://www.azdhs.gov/documents/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/rabies/data/2015.pdf. At this point and until the virus is typed, we might presume that this cat got infected from playing with a sick bat.
