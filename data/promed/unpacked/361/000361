A 9th fatal case of [infestation with] the "brain-eating amoeba" _Naegleria fowleri_ has been reported in the Karachi area of Pakistan, according to a News Tribe report today [3 Sep 2014]. The victim was a 32 year old man, according to the report. Like most of the _N. fowleri_ cases reported this year [2014] in Pakistan, it is not reported how the deadly parasite was contracted.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, _Naegleria fowleri_ is found around the world. In the United States, the majority of infections have been caused by _Naegleria fowleri_ from fresh water located in southern-tier states. The amoeba can be found in bodies of warm fresh water, such as lakes and rivers, geothermal (naturally hot) water, such as hot springs, warm water discharge from industrial plants, geothermal (naturally hot) drinking water sources, swimming pools that are poorly maintained, minimally-chlorinated, and/or un-chlorinated, and water heaters. _Naegleria fowleri_ grows best at higher temperatures up to 115 F (46 C) and can survive for short periods at higher temperatures and soil. _Naegleria fowleri_ is not found in salt water, and so not in the ocean.

[Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is rare, and the reports of 9 cases within a short period is unusual. In the ProMED-mail posting from 24 Aug 2014, we pointed to the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to CDC. The deadly parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices where water is introduced into the sinuses is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_.

It should be noted that diagnosis based on microscopy alone has pitfalls, and molecular methods should be used in every case to confirm with certainty a case of _Naegleria fowleri_. - Mod.EP
