Botulism in cattle
------------------
Since 29 Sep 2013, hundreds of clinical cases suspected to be botulism have been reported from 21 cattle farms in 17 (named) locations throughout Israel, distributed in Hazafon (North) and Hadarom (South) provinces. About 100 of the affected cattle have reportedly died or been euthanised. The disease affected mainly young animals, predominantly fattening calves. The source of intoxication/infection has been suspected to be poultry manure fed to the cattle. In several of the affected farms, a common source for the poultry manure was found, namely a company which specializes in the treatment and supply of poultry litter to the cattle industry. Farmers have been advised to discontinue at present deriving poultry litter for cattle feeding from the said source; investigations into the matter by the producer/distributor and by the State Veterinary Services have been initiated.

The farming industry and veterinary practitioners, countrywide, have been updated in detail about the events. Farmers have been encouraged to check the vaccination history of their stock with the recommended vaccine (against _Clostridium botulinum_ C and D) and to fill any gaps, following manufacturer's instructions.

Materials sampled from affected cattle are under investigation in the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI].

[The preliminary suspicion of botulism, likely to be accurately suggested based on the typical symptomatology, is yet to be laboratory confirmed. According to a flowchart of botulism testing in the KVI, attached to the report above, it may take more than 7 days to confirm (or otherwise) _C. botulinum_/toxins in the tested material.

One of the etiologies for consideration when poultry litter is suspected as the cause of neuromuscular signs and death in cattle are ionophores; this may happen if the litter derived from poultry was recently treated with a ionophore [substance able to transport particular ions across a lipid membrane in a cell] coccidiostat [a chemical agent added to animal feed (as for poultry) that serves to retard the growth and reproduction of pathogenic coccidia so that disease is minimized and the host develops immunity], such as maduromycin. Cattle are highly susceptible to residues of this drug.

Botulism in cattle, caused by recycled poultry litter, has been recorded from various industrialised countries in recent years.

In the UK, an ad hoc group of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) looked into the matter following an increase in the incidence of bovine botulism associated primarily with exposure of livestock to poultry (broiler) litter. Their report (2006) is found at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf.

The Group assessed the risk to the public from food produced by herds affected by botulism and concluded that for disease associated with toxin types C and D, "there should be no requirement to restrict sales of meat or milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle. In addition, there should be no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred." (see ProMED-mail post 20120829.1271101).

Israel has witnessed several outbreaks of botulism in domestic ruminants throughout the years. In 1978, a major outbreak of botulism type D caused the deaths and emergency slaughter of more than 1000 animals, most of them dairy cattle. Spores of _C. botulinum_ type D spread to many farms from 2 central animal feed plants by recycled, non-sterilized poultry manure that included remains of avian cadavers. Subsequently, annual botulism vaccinations of cattle and of other vulnerable animals with a vaccine, including toxoids of _C. botulinum_ types C and D adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide gel, have been introduced and are routinely voluntarily applied in most parts of the country. Sporadic cases involving unvaccinated animals (mainly young cows) have been reported to occur every year.

The feeding of milking cows, sheep, and goats with poultry manure has been officially banned since 1996, while feeding of all animals is prohibited during 15 days prior to slaughter.

Botulism in animals is not reportable in Israel, or OIE-listed. - Mod.AS
