France-Belgium border closed to animals
-----------------------------------------
Officials in northern France imposed, essentially, a ban on animals
crossing the Belgian border, saying there were "very strong suspicions" of
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD)in Belgium.
The prefecture in the Nord department (county) said "due to very strong
suspicions of FMD in Belgium," the top government official had issued an
order forbidding as of midnight 3 Mar 2001 the movement of any live animal
with cloven hoofs including cattle, sheep, pigs and goats.
