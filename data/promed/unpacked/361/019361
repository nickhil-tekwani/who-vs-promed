Operations of the response
------------------
This Thu 23 May 2019, the UN has taken a series of measures to strengthen their support for the response to Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In particular, by strengthening its political commitment and operational support, the UN wants to help improve the environment in which the response teams work to facilitate access to affected communities.

Security
-------
Nurses in the Musienene health zone have denounced the death threats and destruction of health facilities they have received in recent days because of their role in the Ebola response. The Musienene nurses held an extraordinary meeting on Thu 23 May 2019 to evaluate their working conditions. They asked the politico-administrative authorities to get involved in putting an end to this phenomenon of violence against health workers because, if the threats do not stop, they plan to go on a dry strike.

Because of this targeted violence, several doctors and nurses in the Beni and Lubero territories had to move or temporarily leave their homes, forcing some health facilities to close their doors. This is especially the case in the Kyondo health zone, where activities have been suspended at the Kyakumba Reference Health Center since Tue 21 May 2019, since the attending physician and the nursing staff left the feared zone for their safety.

Between 1 Aug 2018 and 20 May 2019, 132 attacks against medical units were recorded as part of the Ebola outbreak, causing 4 deaths and 38 injuries among health workers and patients. As the minister of health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, recalled at the 72nd World Health Assembly in Geneva, this violence against health workers must be condemned unreservedly, and a clear distinction must be made between community involvement and targeted violence by armed militias. Linking the 2 is tantamount to stigmatizing the entire community of affected communities, portraying them as deeply violent communities, and blaming the health workers who are the 1st victims of this targeted violence.

Figures
------
- 122 695 vaccinated persons
- 827 people vaccinated on 22 May 2019.
- Of those vaccinated, 33 718 are high-risk contacts (CHR), 60 094 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 28 883 are 1st-line providers (PPL).
- Persons vaccinated by health zone: 32 281 in Katwa, 24 944 in Beni, 15 549 in Butembo [total numbers of people vaccinated can be seen at the source URL above];
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

Points of control
---------
- 60 043 584 people under control
- 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (PoC).
- 105 contaminated health workers
- The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 105 (5.6% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 35 deaths.

[It is disgraceful that doctors and nurses have had to move from their homes to protect themselves. The consequence is not merely the disruption to their families from displacement, but also the fact that some health facilities were forced to close their doors as a result. Another distressing statistic is 132 attacks against medical units since this most recent Ebola outbreak began in Aug 2018, causing 4 deaths and 38 injuries among health workers and patients. Since August, a staggering number of children, 545 aged less than 18 years, have been infected. The global community must get behind the control effort to stop the outbreak. All the tools are at hand, but the population must be won over, clearly easier said than done, but new approaches must be put into action. - Mod LK]

Operations of the response
------------------
- The sub-coordination of the Ebola response officially handed over a batch of 40 mattresses to the Baraka Hospital Center located in Munzambaye, in the Butembo health zone, on Wed 22 May 2019. Two health workers from CH Baraka / Munzambaye, known as "Chez Bambuti" (pygmy note), representing their colleagues, received symbolically one of 40 mattresses.

- It should be noted that this donation is the result of the partnership concluded between CH Baraka and the teams of the response, which formerly had difficulties carrying out their preventive health actions within CH Baraka. After realizing that their resistance to the teams of the response in their health facility posed a threat to the peaceful population, the medical staff of the latter ended up doing its "mea culpa" by radically changing its position and engaging in a perfect collaboration with the teams of the response. CH Baraka's healthcare workers called on other health facilities that continue to resist following the Ebola outbreak in the Butembo health zone.

Operations of the response
----------------
- On the sidelines of the 72nd World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, the minister of health, Dr. Oly Ilunga, the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and the director of the WHO Regional Office in Africa (AFRO), Dr Matshidiso Moeti, reported on the evolution of the Ebola outbreak and regional preparedness activities at a meeting of AMS Committee A on Tue 21 May 2019.
- All stakeholders recognized that the main barrier to ending this epidemic is the security context and violence against the response teams. The minister of health recalled that, from the point of view of public health, Ebola virus disease is not a particularly difficult disease to contain, especially since the country currently has a diagnostic, therapeutic medical arsenal and comprehensive preventive for the 1st time in the history of the virus. He recalled that to break the chain of transmission, it is enough to do a series of important activities around the confirmed cases, dead or alive, in particular the sensitization, the epidemiological investigations, the disinfection of the household, the vaccination, and the follow-up of the contacts, and funerals worthy and secure. All these activities are available, but teams are sometimes prevented from doing them because of insecurity or mistrust of the population. The director of WHO emphasized that the Ebola epidemic in the DRC is still ongoing, not because the teams do not have the means or the skills, but because they cannot get regular access to the sick in the communities. If the security environment improves and access to communities is guaranteed, the response teams will be able to put an end to this epidemic.
- While welcoming the work of the Congolese government in containing the Ebola outbreak, the director of WHO-AFRO presented the progress of regional preparedness in case the Ebola outbreak spreads outside the DRC. To date, no cases of Ebola have been detected in DRC's neighboring countries, thanks to the efforts of the government and partners, who have examined more than 50 million travelers at the various health checkpoints located east of the DRC. As part of the regional preparedness plan, the 9 countries bordering the DRC now have an emergency plan, 16 Ebola treatment centers have been built in neighboring countries, and 270 technical experts have been deployed to support the efforts of border countries.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 23 May 2019
[WHO (Disease Outbreak News)] [edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/23-may-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Although this past week continues to bear witness to a steady rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall security situation has allowed for the resumption of most response activities. While no major insecurity incidents have occurred, outbreak response teams, local healthcare workers, and community members cooperating with response efforts are increasingly subjected to threats made against them by armed groups present in hotspot areas such as Katwa and Butembo. These threats are often disseminated through leaflets or direct intimidation. Armed groups' presence, activities, and increasing direct threats against response teams continue to be reported in other EVD-affected areas, in particular Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, resulting in some healthcare workers being unwilling to don personal protective equipment or perform critical infection prevention control (IPC) measures out of fear of violence being levied against them or the healthcare facilities where they operate.

During the past 3 weeks, reports indicate that transmission remains most intense in 7 main hotspot areas: Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 349 cases reported in the last 21 days between 1-21 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 15 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2).

As of 21 May [2019], a total of 1866 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1241 died (case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (1051) were female and 30% (545) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases). A total of 490 EVD patients who received care at CTEs have been successfully discharged.

Situation update
There was a steady increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases reported during this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The past week was marked by a relative decrease in the number and severity of security incidents, and most response activities were conducted as planned. However, despite this short lull, the situation remains highly unpredictable, as threats against EVD response teams and facilities continue to be received, especially in the Butembo/Katwa hotspot. As such, further attacks or attempted attacks remain likely in the short term. Additionally, in line with the trend observed in the previous few weeks, armed groups' presence, activities, and increasing direct threats against EVD response teams (leaflets and intimidation of local health workers collaborating with response teams) continue to be reported in Lubero, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, and Komanda. Another particularly concerning development is that some healthcare workers are refusing to wear personal protective equipment and clothing in healthcare facilities and performing only normal infection prevention and control measures due to threats of violence by members of the community.

Community members in hotspot areas such as Katwa, Mandima, and Mabalako reportedly continue to feel frustrated by the outbreak response, as indicated in the latest community feedback. However, the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners remain committed to strengthening community engagement efforts to help address their feedback, encourage greater participation and ownership of various response activities, and urge individuals suspected to have contracted EVD to proactively engage with response workers and to seek care early in order to improve their chances of survival, as well as to reduce the risks of transmission in the community. Meanwhile, an infection prevention and control (IPC) campaign is currently in progress at 4 healthcare facilities in Butembo and Katwa. The campaign is promoting key messages for healthcare workers to aid in stopping transmission of EVD within healthcare facilities, specifically addressing hand hygiene and the importance of safe injections. Activities will be in place throughout the week to promote IPC in these facilities.

This week, week ending 19 May 2019, a total of 121 new confirmed cases were reported. Most of these cases originated from hotspot areas within the Mabalako, Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mandima, and Musienene health zones. In the 21 days between 29 April to 19 May 2019, 86 health areas within 16 health zones reported new cases, representing 48.6% of the 177 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 338 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Katwa (22%, n=75), Mabalako (18%, n=62), Butembo (13%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=36), Kalunguta (10%, n=33), Mandima (9%, n=32), and Musienene (9%, n=31).

Cumulatively, as of 19 May 2019, a total of 1826 EVD cases, including 1738 confirmed and 88 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1218 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1130 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1826 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 54% (993) were female, and 30% (540) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 102 (6% of total cases).

- Mon 20 May 2019. Ebola control in the DRC: sanitized burials under high protection
[Media Congo] [online trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-51486_lutte_contre_ebola_ en_rdc_des_ enterrements_aseptises_sous_haute_protection.html

"Decent and secure" burials are intended to avoid any contact of the living with the fluids of the deceased, at very high viral load. These sanitized burials, with relatives kept apart, provoke violent reactions that worry the health authorities already facing the attacks of Ebola treatment centers (CTEs).

At the arrival of the body in a coffin at the back of a pick-up from the CTE, the family is already onsite at the cemetery. The grave hole is already being dug by the Red Cross teams to save time, the AFP photographer said.

The coffin and the car are escorted by half a dozen policemen, who remain on the watch during the ceremony. The body is buried in silence, without religious ceremony, by members of the Red Cross who donned gloves. A family member or relative is allowed to put a cross on the grave, after having also donned gloves.

On Friday [17 May 2019], 2 teams of "safe and dignified burials" (EDS) were attacked in Butembo and Bunia in the neighboring province of Ituri, reported Saturday [18 May 2019] the Ministry of Health.

"When the team arrived at the cemetery on Friday [17 May 2019], the graves were covered, and people threw pebbles at them, wounding an EDS officer," the ministry says of the Butembo incident. "Sometimes, some people cover the graves during the night to mark their opposition to burials."

Anthropological shock
The "EDS" represent a sort of anthropological shock for local communities accustomed to closer proximity to the body of the deceased to begin their work of mourning.

"It is customary for the body of the deceased to come home 1st, and when people cry, they have the opportunity to touch the body for the last time," says S Muyisa Kamathe, AFP guide and interpreter in Beni and Butembo. "Before going to the cemetery, we open the coffin so that people look at the body of the deceased for the last time. It is family and neighbors who have the monopoly to go to find a good location to dig the grave," he explains.

This shock of funeral rites goes hand-in-hand with the denial of the disease by a part of the community.

These "resistances" had already been observed in (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) during the great epidemic of 2014 (11 000 deaths).
The current epidemic, the 2nd most serious after that of 2014, presents unprecedented singularities. It affects a region that lives in the distrust of authorities unable to stop massacres of civilians in Beni since 2014.

The announcement by the authorities of the postponement of the presidential election on 30 Dec [2018] due to Ebola has aggravated the resentment in this stronghold of the opposition.

A total of 1198 people have succumbed to the Ebola virus since the declaration of the epidemic on 1 Aug [2018].

"It is not possible to stop Ebola in such a situation of communal tension, political manipulation, and with all active armed groups," said a senior official of the World Health Organization. (WHO) returning from a mission to Beni-Butembo this weekend.

Health officials want to remain optimistic by recalling that more than 118 000 people have been vaccinated against the virus, which has spared the 2 neighboring countries on their guard, Rwanda and Uganda.

- New Ebola czar
- Thu 23 May 2019. UN names new "Ebola czar" for growing DRC outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/un-names-new-ebola-czar-growing-drc-outbreak
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The United Nations (UN) today announced the creation of an emergency Ebola response coordinator, a role that officials hope will tackle the security and political challenges facing the response efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) 10-month-long Ebola outbreak.

The UN appointed David Gressly, MBA, currently the UN's deputy special representative for peacekeeping missions in the DRC, to the post. Gressly is expected to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO).

"The Ebola response is working in an operating environment of unprecedented complexity for a public health emergency; insecurity and political protests have led to periodic disruptions in our efforts to fight the disease," said Gressly in a WHO statement. "Therefore, an enhanced UN-wide response is required to overcome these operating constraints, and this includes moving senior leadership and operational decision making to the epicenter of the epidemic in Butembo. We have no time to lose."

Despite the liberal use of an effective vaccine, the current Ebola outbreak has proven difficult to manage, with an up-and-down transmission pattern caused by frequent violent attacks in the region. Additionally, community resistance to healthcare workers and response team members has made surveillance difficult.

The DRC will likely confirm 11 more new cases today, raising the outbreak total to 1877, including 1241 deaths, according to the WHO's Ebola dashboard.

Yesterday, the DRC's ministry of health said another health worker had been infected in Katwa, the current epicenter of virus activity. The worker was unvaccinated.

The case raises to 105 the number of health worker affected by this outbreak. Healthcare workers represent 5.6% of Ebola cases in the DRC, and 35 have died.

DRC wants more Merck vaccine
-----------------
As of yesterday, 121 868 people in the DRC and surrounding countries had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, in a ring vaccination campaign that focuses on case contacts and contacts of contacts.

Yesterday, the DRC called for more of Merck's product -- and asked that it be licensed -- to continue vaccination efforts, rather than introduce Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine into the outbreak setting.

According to Reuters, officials worry that introducing another new vaccine into the outbreak region may cause confusion. They also quoted DRC's minister of health Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, as saying that authorities will roll out a new "geographic" ring vaccination strategy.

"Not only do you vaccinate the people in the household, you also have to consider the household as the case, and then vaccinate all the households around the case," he said.

Kalenga said the new strategy could interrupt transmission chains quickly, and that by licensing VSV-ZEBOV, the vaccination process would be streamlined and faster.

Uganda to start Janssen vaccine trials
--------------
In other vaccine news, the Uganda Virus Research Institute will begin 2 human trials of Janssen Pharmaceutical Company's Ebola vaccine candidate in July [2019]. The vaccine has already been tested in the UK.

Healthy volunteers will be given 2 doses, a priming dose, and a booster. According to All Africa, the vaccine contains strains from Ebola Zaire, Ebola Tai Forest, and Ebola Sudan viruses, as well as Marburg virus.

With Ebola response teams struggling to contain the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the World Health Organization and its partners can make changes to shore up their effort and try to prevent the crisis from escalating further, according to a handful of experts surveyed by STAT.

The experts are wary of criticizing WHO officials and others trying desperately to stop the virus from spreading. Violence aimed at Ebola response workers and a refusal to cooperate with control measures in some communities has rendered this outbreak, the 2nd-largest on record, unlike anything the world of Ebola responders has seen before. There have been repeated attacked on Ebola treatment centers, and, on many days, response workers have been unable to move about in outbreak hotspots.

At the same time, the experts believe global health officials have opportunities to bolster their efforts. Here are 3:

Good data are key.
The foundation of any Ebola response is epidemiology. Knowing where the virus is spreading and who is in its path is crucial to bringing an Ebola epidemic under control. But from the earliest days of this outbreak, that's been a problem.

"I don't think there is a good record of what's going on. I don't think there's a good database," said Dr. Pierre Rollin, a veteran Ebola responder who retired earlier this year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We're just driving in the fog because we don't have good data."

Every single previous Ebola outbreak was stopped using the same techniques: find the cases and isolate them so they cannot infect more people. Figure out with whom they've had contact and monitor those people daily. If any of them become ill, isolate them and find their contacts. Bury the dead safely, so that funeral rituals don't end up infecting more people.

In this outbreak, responders have had an additional tool: an experimental vaccine.

For this approach to work, though, the surveillance teams need to know in which social networks the Ebola virus is spreading. In this outbreak, that often hasn't been the case. Significant numbers of the new cases were not previously on contact lists. Their health hadn't been monitored, and they weren't offered vaccine because no one knew they had been exposed.

The impact of these unidentified chains of transmission appears to be growing as the outbreak expands. Since the beginning of May [2019], only 1/3 of new cases were known contacts of a previous case. Only about half of those had agreed to be monitored to see if they were developing symptoms. Most had not agreed to be vaccinated.

Dr. Scott Dowell, deputy director for surveillance and epidemiology at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, shares concerns about the expanding number of unrecognized cases.

"I think there is very likely a large pool of unrecognized transmission out there and unidentified patients," said Dowell, who worked for decades for the CDC and has worked a number of Ebola responses. "And it's uncertain just how big that pool is. And also uncertain to me about whether the current response can get on top of it, which is really worrisome."

Rollin, who is following the outbreak closely, is worried about the fact that so few probable cases are being added to the outbreak totals. Probable cases are people who had Ebola-like symptoms and who had contact with people who either were known cases or who also had what looked like Ebola. Often these are people who died and were buried without being tested for the disease, but for whom there is a high likelihood that they were infected.

Given how many people are refusing to cooperate with the Ebola response teams -- staying home when they are sick, fighting off safe burial teams that try to test corpses -- there should be a steady stream of probable cases, Rollin said. And yet they are rare. "So they're missing a lot of cases," he said.

Lab capacity needs to be increased
There are serious concerns that the existing laboratory capacity to test samples from suspected Ebola cases can no longer keep pace with the number of tests that need to be conducted.

DRC's National Biomedical Research Institute -- INRB -- is overseeing the testing. Rollin and others fear the current needs exceed its capacity, leading to delays in getting test results. "The lab is overwhelmed," Rollin said.
