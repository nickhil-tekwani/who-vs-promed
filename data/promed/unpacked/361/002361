Chagas disease exists only on the American continent. It is estimated that
16-18 million people are infected by _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the parasite that
causes Chagas disease and that 100 million, i.e. 25% of the population of
Latin America, are at risk of acquiring the infection. There are 2 stages
of the human disease: the acute stage which appears shortly after the
infection and the chronic stage which may last several years and
irreversibly affects internal organs, namely the heart, oesophagus and
colon as well as the peripheral nervous system. Chagas disease is an
endemic parasitic disease in Uruguay where vectorial domiciliary
transmission is effected through the triatomine insect _Triatoma
infestans_. The other mode of transmission is through infected blood
transfusions [At one time not so long ago 3%-5% of blood collected by the
Buenos Aires blood banks was contaminated. MHJ. Important progress made
towards elimination of transmission of Chagas disease in Uruguay has been
reported in a previous issue of the WER. Entomological and
sero-epidemiological data for 1997 confirm that Chagas disease transmission
has been interrupted. An independent Commission was appointed to certify
the interruption of transmission.
WER Editorial Note: These data rank Uruguay as the first Member State of
the Southern Cone Countries Initiative to have accomplished the goals set
by the Ministries of Health of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay
and Uruguay for the elimination of vectorial and transfusional transmission
of Chagas disease since the multi-country programme was launched in June
1991. An independent multinational Commission met in Uruguay in September
1997 under the auspices of the Pan American Health Organization/WHO and
certified the interruption of vectorial and transfusional transmission of
Chagas disease in the country.
[While Uruguay is to be congratulated on achieving this very meaningful
status, we should not forget Chris Schofield, one-time WHO officer, in our
congratulations. Chris has been striving and pushing for the eradication
of this disease from the southern cone countries since 1990. He has had a
catalytic impact. PAHO has eradicated polio from the Americas; Chagas is
in retreat; there is excellent progress with FMD (with freedom expected by
~2003); and brucellosis, thanks to new vaccines, should disappear by the
end of that decade, maybe earlier. - Mod.MHJ
