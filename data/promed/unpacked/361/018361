A cleaner, greener rice industry
--------------------------------
In what the New York Times described as a "stunning success" and one of the
"largest agricultural experiments ever," scientists from the
Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) found a new
way to control a major disease in rice without using any chemicals. By
planting different types of rice alongside each other, they found they
could almost completely control the spread of rice blast, a disease that
can cost the rice industry millions of dollars a year. Thousands of farmers
in China's southern Yunnan Province have adopted the technique, claiming it
[reduces reliance on chemicals, improves profits, and increases incomes.
For Dr. Tom Mew, the head of IRRI's Entomology and Plant Pathology Division
and the project's coordinator, it represents the culmination of decades of
work trying to help rice farmers [control pests and diseases that cost
hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Scientists like Dr. Mew realized
there were cleaner, greener ways to control pests and diseases besides the
use of pesticides. By the mid-1980s, "integrated pest management (IPM)"
[emerged as the way to assess any cultural strategy that could control pests
and diseases. "Over the past 10-15 years at IRRI, we have been looking at
scores of different ways to control pests and diseases, all with the aim of
reducing chemical use," Dr. Mew explained.
While it has not been easy to wean rice farmers from their dependence on
[insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers, other IRRI researchers have
achieved notable success in Vietnam. Their research was based on the
premise that farmers' perceptions, rather than an economic rationale, were
behind most of their pest management decisions. For example, it was
believed that farmers generally overestimated the seriousness of many pests
and so sprayed too much.
In Vietnam's Long An Province research [in 1994 showed that spraying within
40 days of seeding was unnecessary [and farmers were told it was a waste of
money. They were encouraged to experiment and spray only a part of their
crop to see whether they would lose yield on the part they didn't spray.
The effects were soon obvious, and by 1997 the campaign had been [adopted
by 11 other provincial governments, [including 92 percent of the Mekong
Delta's 2.3 million farm households. By 1999, insecticide applications
[decreased 72 percent to only one application. At the same time, the gross
rice output of the Mekong Delta increased from 11 to 14 million tons per
year.
One of the leaders of the campaign, IRRI entomologist Dr. Kong Luen Heong,
believes that insecticide use can be further reduced by another 50 percent
without affecting rice production. Dr. Mew faced the same problems in
Yunnan. "They were using huge quantities of fungicide to combat [rice
blast," he said, "sometimes spraying a single crop 6 or 7 times. We
didn't know what kind of environmental damage that was causing."
Three years ago, IRRI began working in the province with the Yunnan
Agricultural University as well as the national agricultural research
systems (NARS) in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines to try to overcome
the problem.
The scientists reasoned that, in a massive, single-variety rice crop, such
as that grown in the Red River Valley of Yunnan, a single disease such as
blast could easily explode into an epidemic. After the pathogen adapted
itself to the physiology of one plant, it was then ready and able to attack
the remainder of the crop. [However if there was biodiversity in the crop
and if dissimilar plants surrounded [a diseased plant a massive increase of
the pathogen was unlikely.
Dr. Mew said, "We focused on interplanting or growing different varieties of
rice in the same field. At the beginning, doubt and skepticism existed."
But an experiment in 1997 covering a few hectares suggested that
interplanting could achieve 92 to 99 percent control of rice blast as well
boosting farmers' yields [by half a ton to a ton per hectare.
In 1998, 812 hectares were planted with hybrid rice and glutinous rice, 4
rows of one and one row of the other. The crop was sprayed with fungicide
only once. Yields [for hybrid and glutinous rice were 9 and nearly a ton,
[respectively, per hectare. [Moreover within the interplanted crop, [rice
blast incidence fell to 5 percent from [the common level of 55 percent and
yield loss dropped from 28 percent to [zero.
[By 1999, the area had [increased to 3342 hectares, and farmers involved
[in the project boasted that interplanting was providing about US$150 more
income per hectare. By the end of 2000, the IRRI-Yunnan team plans to extend
the scheme to [about 60 000 hectares and to expand it into the Philippines,
Thailand, and other rice-producing nations.
IRRI's director general, Ronald P. Cantrell, says that this success, coupled
with the earlier work in Vietnam by Dr. Heong, is clear evidence of IRRI's
and the rice industry's commitment to ensuring a cleaner, greener
environment. "The days of unsustainable high-input rice production are a
thing of the past," Dr. Cantrell says. "At IRRI, we are focused on
sustainable increases in production that are not only friendly to the
environment but, most importantly, help farmers achieve a better quality of
life."
