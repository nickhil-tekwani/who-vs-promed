Uganda: Disease Wipes Out Goats, Sheep in Karamoja Region
-----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of goats and sheep in Karamoja region have died of a highly
contagious disease suspected to have spread from neighboring Kenya.
The spread of the suspected Pest des Petits Ruminants (PPR) disease
was discovered during a field visit to Rupa sub-county by veterinary
doctors from Karamoja and Kenya on Wednesday [21 Mar 2007].
The doctors were undergoing a 3-day training on Rift Valley Fever
(RVF), PPR and building capacity to train animal health workers to
create community awareness on the dangers of the diseases.
The training on emerging diseases in the Karamoja sub-region was
organized by the Matheniko Development Forum (Madefo), with support
from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations and the European Commission of Humanitarian Aid. It targeted
veterinary and animal husbandry officers working for local
governments and NGOs.
PPR is a severe, fast-spreading disease of mainly domestic small
ruminants characterized by the sudden onset of depression, fever,
discharges from the eyes and nose, sores in the mouth, disturbed
breathing and cough, foul-smelling diarrhea and death.
The disease has put the whole of Turkana district in Kenya at risk,
and the neighboring districts have been asked to be on alert.
In Rupa sub-county, which borders Turkana, one livestock owner
claimed to have lost about 400 goats out of the 560 he had before.
Dr. Daniel Wachira Irura, Program Manager, Turkana Livestock
Development Program, said the discharges from eyes, nose and mouth,
as well as the loose feces, contain large amounts of the virus.
"Fine infective droplets are released into the air from these
secretions and excretions, particularly when infected animals cough
and sneeze. Other animals inhale the droplets and are likely to
become infected," Dr. Irura said.
"Although close contact is the most important way of transmitting the
disease, it is suspected that infectious materials can also
contaminate water and feed troughs and bedding, turning them into
additional sources of infection."
These particular hazards are, however, probably fairly short term,
since the PPR virus, like its close relative rinderpest, would not be
expected to survive for long outside the host.
Dr. Irura said: "Trade in small ruminants at markets, where animals
from different sources are brought into close contact with one
another, affords increased opportunities for PPR transmission, as
does the development of intensive fattening units."
A veterinary doctor, Paul Lochap, said the disease was 1st noticed in
Kotido district, killing almost 2/3rds of the animals in some areas.
"We realized this disease [was present] in June last year [2006] and
reported the matter to higher authorities, but to date, we have not
gotten the results confirming the existence of PPR," Dr. Lochap said.
PPR outbreaks can be controlled through quarantine combined with the
use of focused "ring" vaccination and immunization in high-risk populations.
The vaccines can protect small ruminants against PPR for at least 3 years.

[Karamoja sub-region is a region in northeastern Uganda comprising
the districts of Kotido, Moroto, Kaabong and Nakapiripirit; see details at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja> and map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf>.
Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute contagious disease
caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It
affects small ruminants, especially goats, which are highly
susceptible, and occasionally wild animals. PPR occurs in countries
in Africa lying between the Equator and the Sahara, the Arabian
Peninsula, throughout most of the Middle Eastern countries, and southwest Asia.
The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually
acute and characterized by serous ocular and nasal discharges. PPR is
characterized by severe pyrexia, which can last for 3-5 days, erosive
lesions, which occur in the mouth, diarrhea and pneumonia. At
necropsy, characteristic zebra markings may occur in the large
intestine, but are not a consistent finding. Lesions also occur in
the lungs showing congestion or bronchopneumonia when associated with
bacterial infection.
The disease must be differentiated from rinderpest, bluetongue, foot
and mouth disease and other exanthemous conditions.
No information on the presence of PPR in Uganda is currently
available in OIE's databases Handistatus and WAHID (covering the
period from 1996 to date); its presence in Uganda has been reported
by Wamwayi et. al. in 1995 (see ref 1).
Laboratory confirmation on the current recorded outbreaks in Uganda's
Karamoja sub-region is anticipated, followed by official notification
to the OIE.
Kenya's official report on PPR started on 3 Aug 2006, was confirmed
on 17 Aug 2006 and submitted to the OIE on 16 Jan 2007 (see archive
20070117.0226). As indicated by the moderator, the outbreaks were
located in the northwestern part of Kenya, fairly near the borders
with Uganda and Sudan.
