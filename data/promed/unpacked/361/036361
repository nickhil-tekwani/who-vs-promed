Increase in Prevalence of Ross River Virus Infection
----------------------------------------------------
On Wed 27 Dec 2000 the Department of Human Services warned South Australians
to take particular care to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The warning
follows an increase in reported cases of Ross River virus across different
parts of the State. The Executive Director of the Department of Human
Services Statewide, Professor Brendon Kearney, said that cases of Ross River
virus infection have been reported on the West Coast, Kangaroo Island, and
near Lake Albert. In November, 30 cases were reported and another 30 cases
have been reported so far during December. Ross River virus is carried by
mosquitoes may cause serious illness. Professor Kearney urged people living
or on holiday in South Australia to take protective measures against
mosquitoes by covering exposed skin with appropriate clothing and using
repellents against mosquitoes. The State Government recently launched a
television and radio community awareness campaign called "Don't Let the
Bloodsuckers Bite". Brochures are also being distributed to local councils
in rural areas.
Symptoms of Ross River virus infection include joint swelling and early
morning joint stiffness, pains in muscles, sweating, headache and fever. A
rash occurs in many people, usually on the trunk or limbs. The rash
generally fades after 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of the infection usually appear
within 3 to 11 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito. After a few
weeks most of the symptoms generally disappear, however Ross River virus
infection is an unusual illness in that some symptoms may return for periods
of time, even after the virus is undetectable. Some may suffer for months
with joint pain. A small percentage of people will take more than a year to
fully recover, but the severity of symptoms generally decreases with time.
While children who become infected with Ross River virus do not usually
become ill, they should still be protected against insect bites.

[Ross River virus is classified in the 7th Report of the ICTV as a
constituent species of the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_.
Epidemics of benign polyarthritis associated with Ross River virus
infection, involving several thousand of cases, occur regularly in
Australia. The virus is endemic in most costal regions, and inland along the
course of rivers. Since 1980, Ross River virus has been reported from a
number of south Pacific islands. Several species of mosquito are implicated
as vectors. Barmah Forest virus is a serologically distinct alphavirus that
produces a similar but milder polyarthritis. - Mod.CP
