More than 190 people have been affected by acute watery dysentery while
another 8 people, including a child, have been confirmed infected with
cholera in Madang province.

Provincial health coordinator, Markus Katchau, yesterday [1 Nov 2009]
declared a dysentery and cholera outbreak in the province during a press
conference attended by provincial health authorities and partners. Mr
Katchau said that out of the 15 stool samples sent for laboratory testing,
8 had presumptive evidence of cholera. He said he had also received reports
that 17 people in the Usino-Bundi electorate were admitted and treated at
different health facilities in the district, while other districts in the
province were taking precautionary measures.

He said that 14 people believed to be students at Brahman High School in
the Usino-Bundi electorate had been diagnosed with acute watery dysentery
while another 3 were also diagnosed at Sausi sub-health centre. He said one
of them died while another was referred to Lae's Angau Hospital.

A study by the Central Department of Statistics has vindicated the claims
of health officials who said open defecation was one of the major reasons
of cholera outbreak in the west that claimed around 400 lives. The study
showed only 16.8 per cent households in the Midwestern region use toilets,
well below the national average, which itself is dismal at 23.3 per cent.
The cholera outbreak, which started from Jajarkot district in the
Midwestern region in April [2009], had claimed around 300 lives in the
region including 154 in Jajarkot alone.

The department, however, put access to drinking water in the region at a
relatively good state. Organizing an interaction in Nepalgunj, the
department said 44.3 per cent of people in the region have access to
drinking water, which is around the national average of 45 per cent.

The government has stepped up a fight against an outbreak of waterborne
diseases in several parts of the Coast province in the aftermath of the
floods. Coast provincial medical officer [PMO] Dr Anisa Omar on Tuesday [3
Nov 2009] confirmed that 12 people have been admitted at Lamu district
hospital after contracting cholera. She, however, said the victims were in
stable condition after they received treatment at the public hospital.

At the same time, Dr Anisa said several people at Kanagoni in Magarini were
being treated by a team of medical personnel following an outbreak of diarrhea.

The PMO and a team of medical staff toured Kanagoni among other areas to
assess the situation. She noted that the areas affected by the outbreak of
water-borne diseases included Lamu, Magarini, and Tana Delta district.

A cholera outbreak in Cameroon has killed 65 people and infected hundreds
since it started in September 2009, state media said on Friday [30 Oct 2009].

"Up to 27 Oct 2009, 407 cases (of cholera) were recorded (in northern parts
of the country), including 65 deaths," according to a government statement
in the state newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune. More than 60 per cent of
those who died did not go to hospital, the statement said.

Cholera outbreaks are common in northern Cameroon, especially during the
rainy season, the official said, but this year's [2009] has proved
particularly bad.
