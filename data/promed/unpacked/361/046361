On Sat 23 May 2015, 13 adults and 3 children were vaccinated against rabies at the University Hospital Center [CHU] of Saint-Etienne.

Between Thu 7 and Sat 16 May 2015, they all were in contact with a bull terrier that died of rabies. However, 36 potentially infected individuals are still being sought.

The team of the infectious diseases department of the CHU of Saint-Etienne worked hard over the weekend to cope with the demand.

Simultaneously, the police interviewed the owner of the infected dog and several people around him as part of a preliminary investigation ordered by the prosecutor of Saint-Etienne. The aim was to determine the number and identity of persons who have been in contact with this dog. The animal was acquired in Eastern Europe and contracted rabies during a recent stay in Algeria.

6 people "who were seen in contact with the white dog and who petted it" are still missing, according to the Departmental Directorate of Population Protection (HADD) of the Loire. They are all about 30 years old. Their lives may depend on their responsiveness, so urgency is required. A public information cell (04 77 48 47 58) set up in the prefecture of the Loire received about 30 calls from people who had contact with the deceased dog (or with stray cats) in the neighborhood of La Romiere, where he lived in the town of Chambon-Feugerolles (Loire).

"People who have been in contact with this 6-month-old bull terrier should certainly not wait until the symptoms appear beyond 15 days incubation of the virus, because it will be too late to effectively treat this infection that is invariably fatal in humans," said Nathalie Gershon, Director of the HADD of the Loire.

A prefectural decree restricted the movements of domestic carnivores not validly vaccinated against rabies or not identified up until 27 Oct [2015] in the territory.

Rabies cases like the one found in this dog returning back home after a visit to a country where the disease has not been eradicated are, nevertheless, extremely rare in France, a country known to be free of rabies since 2001.

Rabies, France
----
Information received on [and dated] 22 May 2015 from Dr Loic Evain, Directeur General Adjoint, Direction Generale de l'Alimentation, Ministere de l'Agriculture, de l' Agroalimentaire et de la Foret, Paris, France

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 16 May 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 21 May 2015
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: April 2014
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Lyssavirus (RABV type Africa 1)
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Le Chambon Feugerolles, Loire, Rhone -Alpes
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 May 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 18 May 2015
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: On 16 May 2015, a seven-month-old dog showed signs of aggressiveness, having bitten several people and another dog, associated with hyperthermia, which led the owners to see their veterinarian. Given the risk of rabies, the dog was placed under quarantine at the veterinarian's. During this surveillance, the animal died on the night from 17 to 18 May. A rabies investigation was then launched and the Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis on 21 May 2015.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comment: The dog was introduced illegally (minimum age not reached, no vaccination and no identification) in France from Hungary in late December 2014. Despite surveillance imposed by the French authorities, the dog's owners stayed with their animal in Algeria from 21 April to 7 May 2015, again without respecting the regulations on movements of domestic carnivores. During this stay, the dog would have run away. After returning from Algeria, the animal stayed on the same site from 7 May until the quarantine at the veterinarian's on 16 May. During this period, the animal was in contact with at least 9 people and a dog. The typing of the virus strain (type Africa 1) confirms contamination of the animal during the stay in Algeria. Following confirmation of the diagnosis, a regulated zone was put in place in order to limit the movements of domestic carnivores, to establish increased surveillance and to strengthen the capture of stray animals. Carnivores non properly vaccinated that could have had contact with the case will be euthanized. Carnivores properly vaccinated that could have had contact with the case will be under clinical monitoring for 6 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type :
Pasteur Institute, Paris (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Dogs/ direct immunofluorescence (DIF) test / 20 May 2015 / Positive
Dogs / direct sandwich ELISA / 21 May 2015 / Positive
Dogs / pathogen isolation on cell culture / 21 May 2015 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This report complements the information that was recently published by ProMED-mail post 20150524.3382864; see also comments in the indicated post.

According to the official information included in the French notification to the OIE (item 2 above), the dog was 7 months old when it died from rabies on the night 17/18 May 2015, in France. This means it was less than 3 months old, not vaccinated against rabies and not identified (by the prescribed electronic identification system, transponder) when introduced from Hungary to France in late December 2014, thus breaching EU's pet travel regulations (pets= domestic dogs, cats and ferrets). Similarly, its reintroduction from Algeria was illegal.

For EU pet travel regulations, and particularly the requirements for pet movement from non-listed third countries and their entry
into all Member States, please refer to http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org/Travel/Pet_Travel_Regulations.aspx

Among others, such pet should be accompanied by a passport, with valid rabies vaccination and confirmation of serological test applied in a blood sample taken at least 30 days after vaccination and 3 months before movement, with positive results indicative of the required immunity level. (The 3-month period shall not apply to the re-entry of a pet animal whose passport certifies that the test was carried out, with a positive result, before the animal left the territory of the Union).

It may be assumed that the dog was not vaccinated in France, between its arrival from Hungary late December 2014 and its departure for Algeria (21?) April 2015, but this is in need of confirmation.

According to the epidemiological comments in the OIE notification, during its stay in Algeria, "the dog would have run away" when it apparently was exposed to rabid animals and infected, as also apparent from the typing of the virus strain (type Africa 1).

Based on quantitative information found in the WAHID database section "Detailed countries disease incidence" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail, during 2014, Algeria reported 568 outbreaks of rabies. (Note: to view the information on rabies in Algeria, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease and choose the region and country and time period).

The French authorities are probably extending their investigation into the matter; detailed results, including the transport means used for the travel from and into France are anticipated (airlines, airport and harbour authorities, are expected to check the certification of transported animals).

Since the dog was in France during its last 10 days, most probably all risky exposures took place in France. However, excluding possible
exposures, particularly of close contacts, during its last days in Algeria would not be out of place. - Mods.AS/CRD
