[1] Liberia: quarantine lifted
Date: Sat 30 Aug 2014
Source: New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/africa/quarantine-for-ebola-lifted-in-liberia-slum.html


Liberia's government announced Friday night [29 Aug 2014] that it would lift an Ebola quarantine on a large slum here in the capital [Monrovia], 10 days after attempts to cordon off the neighborhood from the rest of the city sparked deadly clashes and fueled doubts about President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's ability to handle the outbreak. Residents of the neighborhood, West Point, will be free to move in and out starting Saturday at 6:00 a.m., said Lewis Brown, the minister of information. The army, which had pressed for the quarantine and took the lead in enforcing it in the 1st 2 days, will be removed from West Point, leaving only the police, Mr. Brown said.

[2] New drugs

ZMapp post-exposure antiserum

-----
29 Aug 2014: (BBC) The only clinical trial data on the experimental EVD [Ebola virus disease] drug ZMapp shows it is 100 percent effective in monkey studies [with 18 monkeys], even in later stages of the infection.

The researchers, publishing their data in [the journal] Nature, said it was a "very important step forward". Yet the limited supplies will not help the 20 000 people predicted to be infected during the outbreak in West Africa. And 2/7 people given the drug, have later died from EVD.... This included animals given the drug up to 5 days after infection. For the monkeys this would be a relatively late stage in the infection, around 3 days before it becomes fatal ... [more]

BioCryst post-exposure antiviral
---------------------------
29 Aug 2014: BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced this morning that their small-molecule, nucleoside analogue, BCX-4430, would be entering a dose ranging efficacy study in non-human primates within the next few weeks.... So, unlike with a vaccine, BCX-4430 is being developed as a post-exposure measure for those in environments where conditions are conducive to accidental viral exposure ... [more]

NIH/GlaxoSmithKline vaccine tests to start
------------------------------------------
Federal researchers next week will start testing humans with an experimental vaccine to prevent the deadly ebolavirus.

The National Institutes of Health announced Thursday [28 Aug 2014] that it is launching the safety trial on a vaccine developed by the agency's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline. Beginning Tuesday [2 Sep 2014], it will test 20 healthy adult volunteers to see if the virus is safe and triggers an adequate response in their immune systems.

This isn't a treatment for the disease, but a hoped-for preventative measure. Fauci said the vaccine cannot cause EVD in the volunteers being tested. He cautioned that there is no guarantee it will work: "I have been fooled enough in my many years of experience."

The US vaccine takes a single protein from the ebolavirus and pairs it with a chimpanzee cold virus to help as a delivery system. Past vaccines have the used the same protein but different delivery systems.

Usually, the 2nd stage of drug trials involve testing on larger numbers of people before it goes into final testing.

A British consortium has pledged USD 4.6 million to help speed up the vaccine tests. With some of that money, GlaxoSmithKline will be able to begin manufacturing up to 10 000 doses of the US vaccine, if the tests are successful. The 10 000 doses will be ready by the end of the year [2014] and if needed, production can be ramped up for stockpiling, GSK spokeswoman Sarah Alspach said.

Fauci doesn't expect results from this initial round of testing until the end of the year....

The major target of the vaccine, if it works, would be health care workers ... [more]

Guinea: riot in Nzerekore over disinfectant
-----------------------------------
29 Aug 2014: Residents of Guinea's 2nd-biggest city have rioted after the market was sprayed with disinfectant in a bid to halt the spread of the ebolavirus.... Local traders were apparently not warned and held a protest march to the city's hospital, which was attacked. Police responded by firing tear gas and a 24-hour curfew was imposed. Local Red Cross workers had to flee to a military base.... Youssouf Traore, president of the Guinean Red Cross, said the rioters had fired guns. "A rumour, which was totally false, spread that we had sprayed the market in order to transmit the virus to locals," he said ... [more]

Indonesia: hajj pilgrims
------------------------
29 Aug 2014: Around 170 000 Indonesians are set to fly to Saudi Arabia for the annual haj pilgrim in the coming weeks, but few are aware of the lurking danger of the ebolavirus, following the deaths of at least 1500 people in western Africa over the past 6 months. While Indonesia is fully geared up to handle the virus with isolation facilities established in around 100 hospitals nationwide, the country's preventive measures against the virus have been questioned. Indonesian Haj and Umrah Tour and Travel Union (Kesthuri) and Nahdlatul Ulama's Haj and the Umrah Counselors Association (Asbihu-NU) said recently that they had received no information from the health authorities on precautionary measures against the virus.... The 1st batch of Indonesia's haj pilgrims is slated to depart for Saudi Arabia on 1 Sep 2014, and will return in the 1st week of October.

EVD in mind, US and UK colleges screen some students
29 Aug 2014: (AP) US universities count 9728 active students from Nigeria, 204 from Liberia, 169 from Sierra Leone and 95 students from Guinea, according to the USA federal government. College students from West Africa may be subject to extra health checks when they arrive to study in the USA, as administrators try to insulate campuses from the worst EVD outbreak in history.

Universities in the United Kingdom also are on alert with the expected arrival of thousands of Nigerian students there. Universities UK, which represents universities, has circulated guidance from Public Health England advising administrators on how to recognize and react to possible cases.

[4] Sierra Leone: working in a triage tent
Date: 26 Aug 2014 [updated 27 Aug 2014]
Source: Stuff, New Zealand [edited]
http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/africa/60882592/Kiwi-nurses-on-Ebola-front-line-in-Sierra-Leone


New Zealand Red Cross nurses fighting the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone are unable to work inside the hospital where they are based because it is too dangerous. "21 of its medical staff have died and the staff who do turn up to work are scared, depressed and tired," health co-ordinator Sharon Mackie from Wellington, 45, said in a blog. She and mother of 4 Donna Collins, 48, from Whangarei recently arrived in Kenema, the worst-hit area of Sierra Leone. They are part of a multinational Red Cross team that opened 2 triage tents outside the Kenema Government Hospital.

"The local staff are traumatised," Mackie said. "This is a hospital that has lost most of its senior staff to ebolavirus due to poor understanding of isolation techniques." The goal of the triage tents was to help support patient flow and identification of suspected EVD cases, ensuring the hospital received the right patients at the right time, providing reassurance and confidence for local staff ...

[It is well worth reading the rest of this report for its description of working conditions around the isolation hospital. One has to admire the bravery of people who leave their families to work in the hot zone.

[5] Ebolavirus: genomic studies
Date: Fri 29 Aug 2014
Source: IFL Science [edited]
http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/ebola-claims-lives-five-study-co-authors-paper-published


Unfortunately, before the paper "Genomic surveillance elucidates ebolavirus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak" could be published online yesterday [28 Aug 2014], 5 of the 50 co-authors fell ill and died from the Ebola virus disease (EVD) raging on in West Africa.
[See first page in memoriam http://nextgenseek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EBOLA-Genomics-in-memoriam.jpg. - Mod.JW

In the paper, the researchers sequenced the genomes of the ebolavirus from 78 patients across the affected region, including Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. They identified the incredibly rapid mutation rate within the virus, which is currently changing twice as fast as ever before. They were able to determine that although the virus was originally transmitted to humans through an animal reservoir, the spread has been due to human interaction with infected individuals and not by several animals infecting humans in several locations.

The co-authors who had died from EVD all had ties to Kenema Government Hospital (KGH)'s Lassa fever ward in Sierra Leone. Since the start of the outbreak, over 24 KGH personnel have died because of the EVD. Lassa is similar to EVD in that they are both acute hemorrhagic fevers with similar symptoms, though the viruses are not related ... [more]
