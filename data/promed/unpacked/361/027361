[According to WHO's rabies bulletin for Europe (see http://rbe.fli.bund.de/Queries/Surveillance.aspx?Issue=2012_3), during the years 2000-2012 Spain reported 11 cases of rabies in animals, including 6 in domestic dogs, 1 in a stray dog, and 4 in bats.

The planned "vaccination in response to the outbreak" is, most probably, a measure resulting from possible exposure of local animals to the illegally introduced rabid dogs since their arrival in Spain.

Canine rabies is widely distributed in Morocco; according to the country's recent annual report, during 2012, 318 new outbreaks were recorded in dogs and 19 human cases/deaths.
