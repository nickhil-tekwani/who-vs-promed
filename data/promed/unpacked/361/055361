An 18-year-old youth presented with symptoms compatible with those of
[a] hantavirus [infection] and is admitted to intensive care at the La
Plata Hospital Italiano. His status is "very delicate" [critical],
according to medical sources. The Buenos Aires Minister of Health
explained that "this coming week we will know the results of the
[laboratory] tests [for the samples] that were sent to the Instituto
Malbran and that confirm, or not, [the diagnosis] of the disease." He
underscored that "despite that this is just a suspected case, we will
work the same way [as if it was confirmed] in the place where we
presume that he contracted the disease." The young man lives near the
la Rueda location and besides studying, plays football in the 1st
division of the Villa San Martin de Abasto Club, the place where he
lives.

The young man "first felt a strong stomach pain and fever, so had a
test done, but later felt worse -- he had a fever and vomiting -- and
when he went to the hospital he was admitted and was kept in intensive
care," added the report. One of the suspicions was that he could have
contracted the virus [infection] in his home, since the residence is
located along side a balanced feed production plant, and, according to
the explanation of medical sources, "it is a swarm of rats."

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus might be involved in
this case, if a hantavirus is proven to be the cause of the disease.
Since the report here is incomplete, one does not know if the clinical
picture is compatible with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by
infection with a New World hantavirus. Since no mention is made of
symptoms of hemorrhagic fever with renal involvement, it is unlikely
that this case is due to infection with the widely-distributed Asian
Seoul hantavirus found in _Rattus_ species, particularly in maritime
port cities.

Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in
Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown);
Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O.
flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_);
and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. This case
may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection, but without
laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty.
