A British Columbia man has died of a rare viral rabies infection, the 1st such case in the province since 2003. Provincial health officer Dr Bonnie Henry says the man was in contact with a bat in mid-May [2019] and developed symptoms compatible with rabies 6 weeks later. She says in a news release that while the exposure in this case was on Vancouver Island, bats in all areas of BC are known to carry rabies.

The Health Ministry is not releasing further information about the man to ensure privacy for his family. The news release says family members, close community contacts, and healthcare workers who cared for the man are being assessed and given post-exposure rabies preventative measures if needed. Overall in Canada, there have been only 24 known cases of viral rabies infections since the 1920s, and the most recent cases were in Ontario in 2012 and Alberta in 2007.

"If anyone in BC comes in contact with a bat (even if there is no obvious bite or scratch), wash the area with soap and water. Then consult a healthcare provider or local public health department immediately. They will assess the risk of rabies and may provide a vaccine to prevent infection," the release says. It adds that bats are the only known carriers of the rabies virus in the province, and about 13% of bats tested in BC are positive for rabies.

"This presents an ongoing risk for people and for companion animals, such as cats and dogs. It is important to ensure pets' rabies vaccinations are up-to-date. If you believe your pet has had contact with a bat, consult your veterinarian." [Livestock such as cattle and horses are also at risk. There are vaccines for these animals as well. - Mod.TG]

[2] Virginia: bat, human exposure

An injured bat collected from Calico Jack's bath and body company in Manassas, Virginia, tested positive for rabies and may have infected anyone who handled the bat before officers arrived, according to the Manassas City Police Department. On the afternoon of [Sat 6 Jul 2019], an animal control officer with Manassas police responded to a call at 9115 Center St. -- Calico Jack's -- for an injured bat, police said in a press release. After the bat was retrieved from the store, it was found to be rabies-positive.

Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system and can be deadly if left untreated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. It can be spread to people and their pets if they are bitten or scratched by an animal with the disease, which is transmitted through the saliva of the infected animal.

Manassas police believe unknown people physically handled the infected bat before the animal control officer arrived and are warning the public that anyone in contact with the animal is at high risk for rabies and serious health-related issues.

The 1st symptoms of rabies can feel like the flu and include general weakness or discomfort, fever, or a headache, CDC says. The bite from the infected animal may also itch or prickle.

According to CDC, the treatment for rabies, known as postexposure prophylaxis, or PEP, should be administered as soon as possible after exposure to the disease, so it is vital anyone who handled the bat seek medical attention immediately.

Manassas police are asking anyone who came in contact with the bat to immediately contact the Prince William Health District at 703-792-7329, as well as senior animal control officer Daigle at 703-257-8102.

Four Cedar Bluff children have been exposed to rabies through a bat. It happened in a Cedar Bluff neighborhood on Quail Run Drive. Animal control officers say [the children] were playing with the animal in a yard. Cherokee County Animal Control say they got the call about the bat on Monday [8 Jul 2019].

Neighbors say this isn't the 1st spotting of the animal. One neighbor told ABC 33/40 that he saw 2 bats in his yard last week [week of Mon 1 Jul 2019]. He says he thought it was strange because they were out during the daytime. "I could tell there was something wrong with them because they usually don't hang on stuff like that," the neighbor said. "They're usually up in trees and stuff like that. It's kind of weird." [This is confusing because we do not know what the bats were hanging on? A bush? The rafters of a barn? It is confusing and unclear what "stuff like that" really is. - Mod.TG]

Animal control officers say people should report animals displaying strange behavior like that [Being in a yard in the daytime would qualify as strange behavior "like that". - Mod.TG] It's also important to not handle any wildlife. Dr Robert Jeremy Deaton, Cherokee County veterinarian, says it's a good idea to vaccinate your pets. "They can pick up the disease and then transmit it to humans if they're not vaccinated," Dr Deaton said.

ABC 33/40 spoke with the grandfather of 2 of the children who were exposed. He says he doesn't believe his grandchildren were bitten by the bat. However, they are receiving the rabies post-exposure vaccine as a precaution. The Alabama Department of Public Health released information on the dangers of handling bats and more information on rabies. [It should be noted there are no health risks to the general public, only to those who came into contact with the bat. However, everyone should be alert for bats and other animals acting strangely. - Mod.TG]

The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported Monday [15 Jul 2019] that one person has been referred to their healthcare provider after being potentially exposed to rabies by a fox testing positive for the disease. Officials say the potential exposures occurred [Thu 11 Jul 2019] when the victim was attacked by a fox near Varnville, SC. The fox was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 12 Jul 2019 and confirmed to have rabies on 15 Jul 2019.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite, which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal; however, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

Officials say it's important to keep pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against this the disease.

[Without appropriate treatment in a very timely fashion, rabies is almost always a fatal disease in human beings.

Animals exposed to rabies essentially receive a death sentence. A live animal without a record of rabies vaccination will be euthanized and tested for the virus. Please vaccinate your pets. Please keep records of these vaccination and keep the tags on your animals. It may save their lives.

Rabies vaccination for most pets is required on an annual or 3-year basis based on the age at vaccination, the number of rabies vaccinations, and the rabies burden in the area. But vaccination of your pets is a measure of protecting both your pets and you. Rabies is fatal in almost all individuals without proper post-exposure prophylaxis. Unfortunately, animals without a rabies-prevention vaccination are destined for death because there is no treatment for rabies.

Humans need to have the wound cleaned and dressed. An individual will likely need to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine. The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment. PEP is quite expensive, generally in the thousands of dollars in the USA, but the alternative is death. People who have been previously vaccinated or who are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have the shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).

However, animals who have been vaccinated will need their wounds cleaned and cared for. They will be re-vaccinated and, depending upon the specific state, are likely to be quarantined for a period of time. If the bitten animal has not been vaccinated, the animal is likely to be euthanized, as it presents a risk of rabies to its owners.

The lesson is to keep your animals vaccinated. This includes your pets as well as livestock. Cattle, horses, and other animals can acquire rabies and can become very aggressive, possibly injuring or killing a human being. Check with your veterinarian regarding your state and county law on frequency of vaccination for your pets. Do not take chances with your life, the lives of your family members, or the lives of your pets or livestock. - Mod.TG]
