An MSP has called for a fatal accident inquiry to be held into the
death of a Borders man last year [2006] from anthrax. He was the 1st
person to die in the UK from the disease in the past 30 years. The
man, of Stobs, near Hawick, died in July last year. Tests later
confirmed anthrax as the most likely cause of death. South of
Scotland MSP Christine Grahame said an investigation into the case
had taken too long and that an inquiry would be in the public
interest. NHS Borders is to report on the case in December 2007 with
a decision on whether to hold an inquiry due after that.

Ms Grahame has raised concerns with the solicitor general about how
the incident was handled. She is particularly concerned about the
length of time it took to confirm the cause of death. "The Crown
Office is still to decide whether to bring a prosecution or proceed
with an FAI, but from the evidence I have seen so far, I think the
public interest would be best served by the latter," she said. "I
understand further that Mr Norris did not contract the anthrax spores
from a contaminated badger pelt, as has been reported, or from a drum
that he had made himself." She said it appeared the anthrax came from
an imported drum, which released the spores when it was being played
and which were then directly inhaled by Mr Norris.

"I believe the authorities are confident that they have taken all
necessary steps to trace all those who may have come into contact
with that source and no other individuals have been contaminated," she added.

[The Scottish MSP is correct in being concerned at the delays in
diagnosing this case. I have long argued that it is largely a matter
of chance whether human anthrax-systemic infections are correctly
diagnosed. The cutaneous lesions shout out their identity even when
the true cause might be a staphylococcal infection. Little harm is
done by this error, as a false positive results in various
confirmatory actions. A false negative is buried and forgotten. - Mod.MHJ]
