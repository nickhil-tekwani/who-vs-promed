The Arizona Department of Agriculture is investigating the 1st potential cases of bird flu in the state.

4 properties in the state where the birds and eggs were shipped are under quarantine, state agriculture department officials say. The properties are in Pinal, Mohave, Santa Cruz and Yavapai Counties.

The cases stem from 13 quail and chickens and about 40 quail and partridge eggs that were imported to Arizona from a facility in Iowa, Arizona officials say.

After the birds became sick a short time after arriving, tests were conducted and the initial results, which came back Monday, were positive for H5 Avian Influenza. Further testing could take up to 6 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk for infection of people to be low. To date, the H5 Avian Influenza strain has not caused any human illness. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, including meat and eggs, according to government health experts.

"Bird enthusiasts and breeders who are shopping on the internet need to take care when ordering,"state veterinarian Dr. Perry Durham said in a news release.

"These birds and eggs came from a state where Avian Influenza is rampant, responsible for the loss of millions of turkeys and hens."

State officials advise checking the list of states with bird flu and not importing birds or eggs from those states.

The facility in Iowa shipped birds and eggs to almost 75 percent of the country in the weeks before the initial testing, according to Arizona health officials.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease of chickens, turkeys, pheasants, ducks, quail, geese and many wild birds.

Direct contact with infected birds, contaminated objects/equipment, and droplets in the air can spread the virus.

All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard flock owners, are advised to continue to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds.

People should avoid contact with sick/dead poultry or wildlife. If contact occurs, wash your hands with soap and water and change clothing before having any contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds, government authorities advise.

All bird owners can do their part to protect Arizona poultry by immediately reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the Arizona state Veterinarian's Office at 602-542-4293 or the USDA sick bird hotline at 1-866-536-7593.

Another outbreak of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in the US state of Iowa.

The latest case to be confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's Animal .and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is:
Iowa, Sioux county -- 2500 backyard mixed game fowl.

This outbreak brings the number of detections in the US as a whole to 222, with 47 091 293 birds affected. Iowa's total is 74 detections, with 30 723 300 birds affected.

The USDA recently decided to reinstate The Netherlands as an exporter of pasteurized egg products to the US, to ease the shortage of eggs after millions of birds had to be destroyed due to avian flu.

The American Bakers Association (ABA) has announced that they applaud the decision.

"We are very happy with the response from the USDA to expedite the approval of egg products from the Netherlands," said Robb MacKie, ABA President & CEO.

"This swift response is a direct result of ABA members taking action to ensure that USDA and Congress react appropriately to this crisis."

With diminishing egg supplies due to the avian influenza outbreak, the US egg market is struggling to fulfil demand needs for bakers and other food producers. ABA and its membership quickly weighed in with close to 1000 e-mails and phone calls to USDA and Members of Congress asking for additional import opportunities.

"We are now at 35 per cent of the egg product supply being taken offline due to the avian influenza. Opening imports from the Netherlands is a big step in the right direction, but more is needed," said Cory Martin, ABA Director, Government Relations.

"We are facing a true crisis, and without additional actions to increase supply, bakers and many other food manufacturers face dire situations in the coming weeks and months," added Mr Martin.

This outbreak brings the number of detections in the US as a whole to 222, with 47 091 293 birds affected. Iowa's total is 74 detections, with 30 723 300 birds affected.

[The long arm of Iowa Avian Influenza H5N2 has reached out to Arizona. How sad that this disease has spread this far.

It appears these birds were shipped recently? So with the virus raging one has to ask, why was this shipment allowed? And would a vaccine have stopped it? Would this be an indication of the virus continuing to spread?

From a consumer aspect the reinstatement of the Netherlands is bound to be good news. - Mod.TG
