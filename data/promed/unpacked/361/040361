Red squirrel pox victim sparks fears
------------------------------------
A red squirrel found dead near Lockerbie was killed by squirrel pox, the
1st case in Scotland according to Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). The
virus is carried and spread by non-native grey squirrels. The animal was
found near Lockerbie last Tuesday [15 May 2007] and was examined at the
South of Scotland Wildlife Hospital in Dumfries. Veterinarians at the
Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, confirmed it was a victim of
squirrel pox.
Stuart Brooks, head of conservation at the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT),
said: "Over the last 80 years, red squirrel populations have declined at an
alarming rate. News that the deadly squirrel pox virus has been found for
the 1st time in a red squirrel in Scotland is potentially devastating for
the future of our only native squirrel.
"It is now time," he continued, "to step up activities to prevent this
virus from penetrating red squirrel strongholds and SWT will do all it can
to help implement the Red Squirrel Action Plan produced by SNH and the
Forestry Commission. We also urge the new Scottish government to take this
issue seriously and invest the necessary resources to conserve what is one
of our most iconic species."
The disease was 1st detected in Scotland in grey squirrels in May 2005.
Positive squirrel pox blood samples in grey squirrel have been found in 53
cases in Dumfries and Galloway and 27 in the Scottish Borders. Greys are
not affected by the virus, though it kills red squirrels within 15 days of
infection.
Local red squirrel conservation officer Ann-Marie MacMaster urged the
public to report red or grey squirrels which appeared to be ill. She said,
"Once red squirrels develop lesions, they are extremely infectious. We
would also ask people in the Lockerbie area especially not to encourage the
2 species of squirrel together through the use of feeders as this may
facilitate the spread of the disease."
The red squirrel is one of the most threatened species of mammal in the UK.
In February this year [2007], the Scottish Executive awarded a 2-year
contract to investigate the development of a vaccine against squirrel pox.

[The source of this article provides photos of what the affected squirrels
look like when this disease affects them.
Squirrel pox, or squirrel fibroma, is a viral disease which produces
multiple tumors on the skin of gray and fox squirrels. It belongs to the
pox group of viruses which produce rabbit fibromatosis, rabbit myxomatosis,
hare fibromatosis, and some deer fibromas.
These tumors are presumably all caused by a virus. Although the natural
history of the virus is not known, both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Anopheles
quadrimaculatus_ mosquitoes have transmitted it from squirrel to squirrel
in the laboratory. It is probably transmitted by insects in nature as
well.The tumors develop at the site where the insects feed on the animal.
The tumors may be scattered over all the body and range in size from a few
mm to 25mm in diameter. Metastasis to the lungs, liver, kidney, and lymph
nodes has been reported. In general, there are no obvious signs of illness
in naturally infected squirrels except for the presence of the tumors over
the skin. In severe cases, when vision is obstructed or the skin becomes
secondarily infected, the animal may be less active, weak, and eventually
die. The microscopic lesions of squirrel pox virus in the gray squirrel are
similar to those reported from Shope's rabbit fibroma virus in the cottontail.
Confirmation of the disease is either by histologic examination of tissues
for intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies or by virus isolation.
There is no known treatment; presumably a vaccine could be developed. But
it would not be logistically or economically feasible to treat free-living
wild animals. In cases where the disease is not severe, the lesions
probably regress and the animal recovers completely.
