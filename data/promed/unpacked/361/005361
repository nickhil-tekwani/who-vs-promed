Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Kokh Bashovan, Baneh, Kordestan
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 May 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 35 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: Native dairy cattle

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals; vectors

Epidemiological comments:
The affected cow was detected during routine FMD vaccination. The vaccination team reported abnormal skin problems in a native dairy cow. Following this report, the affected epidemiological unit was visited by state veterinarians, and skin tissue samples were collected and submitted to RAZI Vaccine & Serum Research Institute (OIE Reference Laboratory for sheep pox and goat pox). The diagnostic test used was restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR (RFLP-PCR). Following the laboratory confirmation, all affected animals were destroyed. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Since this is the 1st time that lumpy skin disease has been identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country, but the event is, in fact, circumscribed to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; modified stamping out; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
RAZI Vaccine & Serum Research Institute (OIE Reference Laboratory for sheep pox and goat pox) (National laboratory) / Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 4 Jun 2014 / Positive

[Since this outbreak is located close to the border with Iraq [where an outbreak has been reported this year -- see ProMED archive list below], it should not be unexpected that lumpy skin disease (LSD) has now been reported in Iran.

According to the FAO's "Emergence of lumpy skin disease in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin countries," EMPRES WATCH, Vol. 29, Nov 2013: "Uncontrolled livestock movements heighten the risk that LSD may move into additional areas of Turkey or LSD-free countries within the region. Examples include the documented, large, seasonal Kurdish transhumance movements in the southeast Anatolia region. In addition, riverine agriculture and related activities at the deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq have a potential to be hot spots for vector transmission. There is an immediate risk of LSD incursion into the Islamic Republic of Iran and the trans-caucasus countries." See complete document at http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/aq706e/aq706e.pdf.
