[1] Cholera, earthquake-affected area - Pakistan (Kashmir)

2 children with cholera were brought to a Japanese Red Cross medical
tent in this mountain town today, 3 Nov 2005, doctors said, raising
fears that the grim conditions among the homeless and injured
survivors of the 8 Oct 2005 earthquake were deteriorating further as
winter sets in.

The scene across the steep terraced mountains of Pakistani Kashmir
remains one of devastation and dislocation. Blue canvas tents now dot
the hillsides, where families are camping next to their damaged
homes. Lines of people can be seen hiking along roads and narrow
paths over the landslides, and long lines of survivors can be seen
waiting for relief supplies in the towns. Not far from Chinari, a
whole mountainside has collapsed into the river valley below,
sweeping houses and terraced fields away, and creating a new mountain
of rock and mud hundreds of feet high that has changed the course of the river.

In the American military mobile hospital set up in the regional
capital, Muzaffarabad, a 55-year-old secondary school teacher from
the Neelam Valley, nursing a broken ankle, had an urgent plea. "Just
clear the roads of landslides," he said. "There are a lot of people
suffering still in Neelam. People will definitely start dying."

The most difficult job facing the military relief effort here is how
to clear the roads enough to bring in the thousands of tons of food
and other supplies needed before the winter weather sets in. Up to 3
million people are estimated to be homeless as a result of the
quake. About 4000 people in 20 villages in remote valleys blocked by
landslides have not yet received any aid at all, nor been reached by
Pakistani military survey teams, Lt. Col. Tariq Jawed, the helicopter
operations officer at Chaklala air base, said.

"Along 50 kilometers there are multiple landslides on one road," said
Lt. Col. Jeff Kilian, of the 74th Naval Marine Construction
Battalion, which has started clearing operations in Muzaffarabad and
has surveyed the blocked mountain roads from the air. The landslides
were so massive that they could not be cleared by machines but had to
be blasted with explosives, he said. The only choice for much of the
region remains bringing in supplies by air, he said.

[2] Cholera - India (Tamil Nadu)

The Communicable and Diseases Hospital (CDH) in the city continued to
receive fresh cases of diarrhea patients, even as the fear of
outbreak of cholera among the people of North Chennai persisted. CDH
sources told UNI that 26 fresh cases were admitted to the hospital
today, 4 Nov 2005, following diarrhea and vomiting.

With this the total number of people admitted to the hospital since
28 Oct 2005 has gone up to 168. Of the 168 patients, 8 people have
been tested positive over the last 2 days, the sources
added. Describing it as "too small a figure," the sources said that
there was no outbreak of cholera.

Most of the affected were children, who were prone to infectious
diseases due to water contamination following rains. A majority of
the cases were reported from the rain-battered areas like
Pulianthope, Korukkupet and Vysarpadi, which were under water for 3 to 4 days.

[Chennai, also known as Madras, is the capital of the state of Tamil
Nadu and is India's 4th largest city. It is located on the Coromandel
Coast of the Bay of Bengal. More cases of cholera and diarrhea from
other causes are likely. - Mod.LL]

[3] Cholera - China (Zhejiang)

The cholera outbreak in the cities of Jiaxing and Huzhou in east
China's Zhejiang Province has been basically brought under control,
sources with the provincial health authorities said Sat, 29 Oct
2005. From 25 to 28 Oct 2005, no new cholera case was spotted in the
2 cities for 4 consecutive days, and the last cholera-bacteria
carrier left hospital Fri, 28 Oct 2005, noted the sources. Jiangxi
reported its 1st cholera case on 2 Sep 2005 and its last case on 17
Oct 2005. During this 6-week period, the city recorded a total of 184
cholera cases and 60 cholera bacterial carriers, with no deaths
reported. Since 18 Oct 2005, Jiangxi has had no new cholera cases for
10 days in a row, and its last cholera patient recovered well and
left hospital on 23 Oct 2005.

On 13 Oct 2005, sporadic cholera outbreaks were reported among
migrant workers at a brick mill in the Nanxun District of Huzhou. The
city has since recorded 19 cases of cholera, and another 34 cholera
bacterial carriers. The city provided free medical care for the
patients, and carried out physical examinations on 200-plus migrant
workers inside and around the mill. No more cholera cases have been
reported in the city for the past 4 consecutive days, and the last
bacterial carrier left hospital on Fri, 28 Oct 2005.

Provincial health authorities attributed the outbreak of the
waterborne disease this year largely to drinking unsanitary water,
eating unclean food, and paying little attention to locals' personal hygiene.

[4] Cholera - Sao Tome and Principe (Sao Tome)

4 people have died as a result of a cholera outbreak in Sao Tome and
Principe since Oct 2005, the Lusa news agency reported on Wed, 2 Nov
2005 citing health officials in the West African island nation. There
were 165 registered cases in October 2005.

The epidemic is limited to Sao Tome, the archipelago's main island,
and appears to have resulted from the use of untreated river water,
they said. It is the 2nd cholera outbreak in the former Portuguese
colony, a remote pair of volcanic islands that lie on the equator, in
the past 5 months.

In April 2005, a cholera outbreak in the nation of just over 180 000
affected nearly 200 people, killing 3.
