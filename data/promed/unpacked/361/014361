FMD suspected in Las Piedras
-----------------------------
Cattlemen of La Chontalpa reported that the presence of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) has begun to affect their animals. They have officially
requested the intervention of SAGARPA to avoid the death of at least
5000 cattle that are currently being kept in flooded pastures. The
problem is not only in Las Piedras, as it has a report that
neighboring communities have also been sick cattle and have the same
symptoms, and even the hulls are rotting.

Subject: Clarification on false alarm regarding FMD in Tabasco
--------------------------------------------------------------
You have probably heard of a recent report in the Tabasco Newspaper of
a case of foot and mouth disease (FMD), and I wanted to let you know
that it sometimes happens that since there is continuous promotion for
report of FMD-like lesions as part of the passive surveillance system.
When we have cases of vesicular stomatitis people confuse it with FMD,
even though Tabasco is a zone where seasonally we have outbreaks of
vesicular stomatitis specially during rainy season.

I have contacted the CPA personnel there and they reported that they
have had some cases of vesicular stomatitis in past few weeks, and
these have already been diagnosed at the CPA laboratory with the
respective negative test for FMD and other vesicular disease
differential diagnosis.

Regardless, investigation of these cases is being done and we will
submit a formal letter with more data. Just wanted to clarify this for
the moment.

[Many thanks to Terry Conger for forwarding this communication to me,
from the top in Mexico.

This clarification is being posted because such misinformation can
cause a lot of expensive problems. Those of us who have worked with
FMD and vesicular stomatitis are only too aware of the confusions that
can arise even when the epidemiologies of these 2 viruses are very
different. Plus VS affects horses. See:
