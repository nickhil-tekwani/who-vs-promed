Health department places hold on all elective knee surgery
----------------------------------------------------------
All Minnesota hospitals and surgery centers have been asked to refrain from
doing any elective knee operations for a one-week period, while state
health officials investigate 3 deaths that occurred recently in surgical
patients.
Officials at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) are also now
reporting, on the basis of preliminary lab results, that one of the 3
patients may have been infected with bacteria from the _Clostridium_ family
[sic].
All of the deaths involved patients who had recently had knee surgery. The
patients included a 23-year-old man and a 78-year-old man, both of whom
died on 11 Nov 2001, and a 60-year-old man who died on 16 Nov 2001. The
first 2 patients had surgery on 7 Nov 2001 and 9 Nov 2001 at St. Cloud
Hospital. The third patient had surgery on 13 Nov 2001 at Douglas County
Hospital in Alexandria. All of the patients had previously been healthy.
The _Clostridium_ bacteria were found in clinical specimens taken from the
23-year-old patient who first became ill. Clostridium bacteria produce a
potent toxin, and a _Clostridium_ infection can be life-threatening.
The one-week moratorium on elective knee surgery is precautionary in
nature, MDH officials emphasized. While the moratorium is in effect, MDH
investigators will continue their efforts to determine what the 3 cases
might have in common -- and what might have caused the deaths.
While all of the patients who died had some form of knee surgery, they
didn't all have the same type of procedure. There are important
differences, as well as similarities, between the 3 cases, officials noted.
All 3 patients became ill up to several days after having surgery, and
deteriorated rapidly after their first symptoms appeared. In all 3 cases,
symptoms of the illness strongly suggested some type of infection.
Clinical specimens from all 3 patients, as well as drugs used in treating
the 2 St. Cloud patients, are being analyzed by MDH and the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More lab results are expected
next week, and officials hope they will provide additional clues about what
may have caused the deaths.
MDH has also asked health care providers throughout the state to report any
deaths or illnesses that appear to be similar to the three currently being
investigated.

Minnesota Knee Surgery Deaths Probed
------------------------------------
State health officials are investigating the sudden deaths of three men
after elective knee surgery and have asked all hospitals and surgery
centers to suspend such operations for one week. A 23-year-old male, and a
78 year old male, died Nov 2001 after having surgery at St. Cloud Hospital,
local officials said. A man in his mid-60s died on Friday at Douglas County
Hospital, 3 days after surgery.
Preliminary tests show that the bacterium _Clostridium_ may have been
identified in the blood of one of the men, state epidemiologist Harry Hull
said on Sunday. A small [number] of the bacteria can cause major illness.
Final test results would not be available until later this week, he said.
Drugs used in treating the 2 patients at St. Cloud Hospital also were being
tested by the Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, Hull said. "We are doing a very intensive
investigation and working with the CDC to find out the source of these
deaths," Hull said.
He said the request Sunday for the surgery halt was "a precaution" and that
public health officials in bordering states had been advised. Health
officials limited their request to elective knee surgeries since that is
the only common link in the deaths, Hull said.
All men were in good physical health before their surgeries and became ill
one to 4 days after going home. Their conditions rapidly deteriorated and
included a sudden drop in blood pressure, health officials said. Blood
samples were taken from 2 of the bodies, but the body of one of the men was
embalmed before it could be tested, complicating the investigation, Hull
said. "If we do not find additional cases we just may run into a dead end.
But we would rather run into a dead end than have additional patients," he
said.
Two of the men had knee-replacement surgery; the other had what Hull called
a cartilage graft.
