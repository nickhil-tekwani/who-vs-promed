[In the prior posting, the following sentence caused me to make the

explanation that follows. - Mod.ES

My impression from the posting is that the _L. monocytogenes_ isolated from
unopened packages of meats has yet to be matched by PFGE or other genetic
fingerprinting techniques to _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from the infected
patients. Although this step could be considered a formality by some,
without it the manufacturer could always claim that the customer developed
listeriosis elsewhere, and got the bacteria onto their food product after
they opened it. A PFGE match between bacteria from an unsold deli meat
product sampled in a sterile manner, and bacteria from an ill person who
consumed meat from the same lot, is strong evidence of a link between the
meat and illness. This fairly new genetic fingerprinting procedure is an
under appreciated but powerful new tool in the epidemiology of foodborne
disease.

[Here are excerpts from three prior postings cited above.
>From (02): In some cases, some of the patients still had open containers
of the
suspect hot dogs in their refrigerators, and the specific strain of
_Listeria_ turned up in one package of Sara Lee-manufactured franks.
Ostroff was quoted as saying, "That's another very strong piece of
information," because "the strain that is actually causing this outbreak is
not very commonly seen."
>From (03): All LM isolates from these cases are serotype 4b and share an
unusual pattern when subtyped either by pulsed field gel electrophoresis or
by ribotyping methods. Historically, this pattern is rare among LM isolates
from humans.
>From (04): Dr. Elizabeth Koch, acting state epidemiologist in Ohio, was
cited as saying the DNA of the bacteria involved in the outbreak showed "a
very rare pattern," called Pattern E.
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, was cited as saying that
on Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators isolated
this strain of _Listeria_ on an open package of hot dogs that a month
earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill. It is not known how
or where this package was contaminated.

I thought this sounded pretty convincing, but it would be helpful if a more
direct and definitive comment summarizing all of the available information
were forthcoming. - Mod.ES
