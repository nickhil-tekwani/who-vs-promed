Re: PRO/AH> Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds (24); UK -
tests could miss bird flu in migratory birds
------------------
In response to the suggestion that the UK could be missing bird flu
in migratory birds I wish to make the following comments and observations:
UK programmes for the detection of H5N1 HPAI are highly optimised based upon
i) targeting dead birds
ii) examination of tissues not swabs (tissues have been shown to be
superior for detection of this virus).
Data at EU level during the last 18 months has unequivocally shown
this to be the most sensitive and reliable approach for detecting
early incursion of H5N1 HPAI in wild birds. The study cited (PLoS
Pathogens, DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.0030061) failed to detect H5N1
HPAI in healthy birds (as we have in the UK) but this is not
unexpected based upon the results of the European programme as a
whole. Dead birds represent one strand of our surveillance with
others examining live healthy birds.
There is no evidence of any difference in the sensitivity of the
methods used by ourselves and those in the study quoted to explain
the difference in the apparent crude prevalences in the UK, Sweden
and The Netherlands combined. One does not expect a similar
prevalence or presence of infection in all countries nor a constant
presence or prevalence of infection over time. It is therefore
misleading to say that "on average 6 percent of ducks in Europe are
infected with influenza A viruses." The study was restricted to
Sweden and The Netherlands and there are a number of species of ducks
for which the apparent prevalence varied considerably. Direct
comparisons between different surveillance programmes are unsafe
since they do not take account of the factors and variation that may
influence the presence and detection of influenza A viruses such as
the sampled population, temporal and geographic factors.
The UK has taken the lead in implementing a targeted programme of
surveillance in wild birds aimed at detecting the 1st incursion of
H5N1 HPAI in areas if there may be intimate contact with poultry. The
design has taken account of a number of factors including higher risk
species of migratory bird for introduction of virus, population
density of these species in relation to that of poultry production
where poultry holdings are ranked according to risk of incursion.
These factors provide a map of where virus incursion into poultry is
thought most likely to occur and surveillance efforts are enhanced in
these areas.

RE: Reaction from VLA re your article
------------------------------------
The full text of the New Scientist article reporting research
recently published in EID, which included comments from Dr. Brown,
was not posted on ProMed. It is pasted below [see part [3] below]
The studies under consideration were of live wild birds. It is
certainly true as Dr. Brown points out that testing dead wild birds
(not to mention watching for sick turkeys) has shown itself to be a
more sensitive means of detecting H5N1 incursions into Europe than
testing healthy wild birds. This however is not relevant to the
research under consideration here. Neither is the fact, welcome as it
is, that none of these programmes testing wild birds for influenza A
has found any HPAI H5N1.
The observation is that Swedish and Dutch research in which large
numbers of wild-caught birds were tested individually for any avian
influenza, recently reported in EID, found an annual average of 6
percent in dabbling ducks, ranging from low values in spring to
monthly averages up to 25 percent of dabblers in autumn. Meanwhile
the British programme, in tests not far removed in time or space,
found less than one percent in dabbling ducks in autumn and winter.
(In order to compare like with like, the numbers refer only to
dabbling ducks, the major carriers of influenza A in the wild, not to
the full range of species tested in the different studies.) As this
difference coincides with a sampling technique several researchers
have told us might allow degradation of viral RNA, we felt it was
appropriate to wonder, in the spirit of responsible journalism,
whether the British sampling could be missing flu in general, and
with it possibly any H5N1 there may be in the wild population. We
reported in the article Dr. Brown's communication to us, that efforts
to compare sampling techniques have so far found no difference in
persistence of viral RNA that would explain this.
We did not say "on average 6 percent of ducks in Europe are infected
with influenza A." We reported the Dutch and Swedish observations
published in EID, as noted above. Indeed, as Dr. Brown notes, and as
our article quoted him as saying, the difference between this study
and the British results might be due to different times and places of
sampling. As we further quoted a lead investigator in the Dutch study
as saying, the only way to resolve this is to compare techniques. We
understand such efforts are underway as part of the EU-funded FluBird
programme.
The British monitoring programme for influenza in wild birds of the
past 2 years certainly is second in Europe only to the Dutch and
Swedish programmes of the past 8 years in numbers tested. But
scientists we have spoken to say there is no particular reason to
expect that the geographic spread of the British sample would explain
the very much lower prevalences than seen in the Dutch and Swedish
samples, as influenza A is widespread in wild ducks and the countries
share essentially the same migrant populations. All these programmes
test large numbers of healthy wild birds individually for any
influenza A present, thus the stated British focus on detecting H5N1,
versus the other programmes' stated goal of measuring influenza
prevalence as well as detecting H5N1, does not result in differences
in design that should necessarily explain the different results.

"UK tests could miss bird flu in migratory birds," 21 May 2007.
------------------
Discrepancies between levels of flu recorded in British birds and
those elsewhere in Europe have surfaced yet again, following
publication of the biggest study so far of bird flu in Europe. The
findings raise concerns about whether British tests would pick up
H5N1 bird flu if migratory wild birds carried it into the country.
Researchers in the Netherlands and Sweden analysed influenza A
samples taken from 37 000 water birds in northern Europe over 8
years. They confirmed that dabbling ducks, especially mallards, are
the main carriers of flu viruses, although other birds, including
geese, are occasional carriers. On average 6 percent of ducks are
infected, falling to a few percent in spring and peaking at up to 20
percent or more in autumn (PLoS Pathogens, DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030061).
In contrast, UK measurements of flu incidence in ducks remain low. In
2005 the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in Addlestone, Surrey,
found flu in 0.1 percent of birds tested (New Scientist, 15 April
2006, p 12). In late 2006 it found flu in only 0.7 percent of 1800
dabbling ducks. It did not test wildfowl wintering near the first
British outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in East Anglia this spring,
although some had migrated from Siberia, where the virus is known to circulate.
The main purpose of the European sampling programme is to map the
prevalence of ordinary influenza A viruses in wild birds - usually
benign gut infections in water fowl. The H5N1 variant, which has now
killed at least 172 people, is a highly pathogenic mutant that is
mainly spread in poultry but has also passed back into wild birds.
If H5N1 has managed to persist in wild populations, it is at a low
level. It was not detected in the latest study, which included 13 000
dabbling ducks either migrating across Sweden after breeding in
Siberia or on their Dutch wintering grounds. The new study confirms
that ducks mainly catch flu while breeding and clear it afterwards.
"The farther you get from the breeding grounds, the fewer have flu,"
says Ab Osterhaus of Erasmus University Rotterdam, who led the Dutch team.
Even so, a third of Dutch wintering ducks -- which are at a similar
point in the migration path to British ducks -- were infected, in
contrast with the low UK findings. Similarly, a recent large-scale
study of flu in wild African birds found flu in 6.6 percent of
dabbling ducks that had migrated from Eurasia, in spring, when flu is
lowest (Emerging Infectious Diseases, vol 13, p 626).
One possible reason for the discrepancy is that in the UK faecal
samples are stored dry, unlike elsewhere. This can allow viral RNA to
decompose. However, Ian Brown of the VLA says his lab has found the
virus has similar viability in wet and dry samples. He attributes the
UK differences to variation in the place and time of sampling.
"The only way to tell is for everyone to work together, collect
samples and compare techniques," says Osterhaus. (From issue 2604 of
New Scientist magazine, 21 May 2007, page 12)

[Part of the problem is that as ProMED does not have a subscription
to The New Scientist we could just quote that publicly available part
of Deb MacKenzie's article which they posted on their website; the
full reference was given however for those who needed to read the
complete article. For this we can only apologise but it will be a
constant problem until we get significantly more funding than we have
already. In the meanwhile maybe we need to take Albert Osterhaus's
comment to heart. - Mod.MHJ]
