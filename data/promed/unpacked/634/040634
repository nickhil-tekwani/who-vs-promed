The head public health physician of the Russian Federation has
provided information about 6 fatal cases of West Nile virus this year
[2010]. 5 of these cases were in Volgograd oblast [region] and one in
Rostov oblast. The doctor mentioned the abnormally hot weather as a
cause of the high number of cases this year. The heat facilitated the
growth of the mosquito population, which are the vectors of this
infection [virus].

There have been 160 West Nile virus confirmed cases this year [2010]
over all Russia. The majority of infections happened in Volgograd
oblast, 107 out of 160. He also mentioned that the cases tend to be
individuals of older ages who get the infection during trips to their
dachas [cottage houses] outside of the cities. Anti mosquito measures
are being carried out.
