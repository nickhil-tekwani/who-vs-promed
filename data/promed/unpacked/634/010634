A total of 7 more deer shot by hunters in Montana have turned up positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal disease of the nervous system that's reduced deer herds in other states by as much as 40%. All were mule deer bucks.

Three of the deer were shot in Valley and Daniels counties where deer had yet to test positive for CWD. Those counties are located on the Hi-line along the state's northern border with Canada. In Valley County, a positive deer was harvested 18 mi [approx. 29 km] west of Opheim. In Daniels County, a positive deer was shot 15 mi [approx. 24 km] northwest of Scobey near the Canadian border, and another just inside the Fort Peck Reservation.

"This is our biggest batch of positives we've had in the last 2 years, so it's significant in that regard," said Greg Lemon, a Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP] spokesman. "What we don't know from this is what the prevalence is within the population of where the positives were found."

The other 4 positive deer were shot in Blaine County, also on the Hi-line, and Carbon County in south central Montana. Deer had previously tested positive for CWD in those areas.

CWD is a relatively rare disease that affects the nervous system of deer, elk and moose. It is similar to a group of nervous system diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie in sheep. Infected animals can appear healthy for many years before showing symptoms such as walking repetitive courses, inability to coordinate voluntary muscular movements, wide-based stance and subtle head tremors.

"My understanding is none of them were symptomatic," Lemon said of the 7 Montana deer that tested positive for CWD. Animals with CWD often are not symptomatic until they are close to death, Lemon added.

No convincing evidence exists that the agent of CWD affects humans, according to FWP. However, FWP advises hunters not to shoot animals that appear sick or eat meat from suspect animals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that deer shot in CWD-positive areas be tested before the meat is consumed. FWP also has rules in place in these areas that restrict the transportation of spinal columns and brain tissue of CWD-positive animals.

"We're not surprised to find it," Lemon said. "It's probably been here for a little while." From 1998 to 2016, Montana tested more than 17 000 wild deer, elk and moose for CWD. There were no positive tests until the fall of 2017. A total of 10 deer harvested on the Hi-Line have now tested positive for CWD, Lemon said.

This year [2018], FWP conducted CWD surveillance across the HI-line during the general big game hunting season, which ended [25 Nov 2018]. Hunters brought animals to check stations where lymph nodes were taken out for testing. The purpose of the surveillance is to better understand where the disease is and how widespread, Lemon said. "CWD has the capability to have long-term impacts to deer herds," Lemon said. "We need all the information we can get so we can be as informed as we can with management efforts."

Other states have seen 40% declines in deer numbers as a result of CWD, Lemon said.

Management efforts to slow the spread in Montana could include adjusting regulations to thin the deer population in areas where deer congregate such as around alfalfa fields or center irrigation pivots that spray crops with water. "Those are a couple of ways we could manage it but it's not an eradication situation," Lemon said. "So we're not trying to eliminate herds of deer, but we are going to be active in how we manage it." Samples from the surveillance efforts are coming in weekly, and more test results are expected by the middle of next week, Lemon said.

Once the CWD sample results are collected, FWP will decide what to do next, Lemon said. That may include expanding current CWD-positive areas and CWD transportation restriction zones.

[2] Effect of humic acid soil on prions
Date: Fri 30 Nov 2018, 6.00 AM

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/acid-found-soil-may-make-disease-killing-deer-less-infectious


An acid found in rich humus soil breaks down the misfolded brain proteins -- called prions -- that cause chronic wasting disease.

When concentrations of humic acid similar to those found in soils were applied to diseased elk brain tissue, chemical signatures of the infectious prions were nearly erased, researchers report online [29 Nov 2018] in PLOS Pathogens. [https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007414] That suggests that the acid somehow degrades the warped protein, making it less infectious, says Judd Aiken, a prion disease researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

Chronic wasting disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease, has devastated populations of deer, elk and moose across parts of North America, South Korea, Sweden and Norway. We know "that environmental sources of infectivity play a role in transmission of these diseases," Aiken says. The twisted proteins lurk in the rotting carcasses, feces or saliva of infected animals, and eventually seep into soils. The infection spreads when deer graze in prion-contaminated areas.

Previous studies have shown that soil mineralogy can influence the spread of prions, says Bryan Richards, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., who was not involved in the study. For example, prions easily bind to microscopic minerals such as quartz, kaolinite and montmorillonite, and can -- as lab tests have revealed -- stay locked in soil for years.

Prions are a malformed version of proteins that cause nearby normal proteins of the same kind to take on this complex shape that is harmful to nerve cells. Infected animals become listless, disoriented and unable to chew their food or drink water for months until death.

Unlike mad cow disease, another fatal prion-related disorder, there is currently no evidence that chronic wasting disease can transfer to humans. Still, little is known about the transmission barrier between species, and scientists aren't ruling out the possibility. If chronic wasting disease continues to ravage deer and elk populations, more humans may come into contact with the tainted animals through hunting and farming.

But the discovery of how humic acid affects prions may provide a way to track or even prevent the disease from taking hold. Since levels of humic acid vary in nature, scientists exposed infected elk brain tissue to one, 2.5 and 25 gr/L [grams per liter] of commercially produced humic acid, and let it incubate overnight. In tissue samples with higher concentrations of humic acid, chemical signatures left by the infectious prions decreased by as much as 95%, signaling that the prions had likely broken down. The team also tested humic acid extracted from soil samples collected throughout western Canada and noted a similar decrease in prion signatures.

Next, researchers injected some mice with a mixture of humic acid and infected elk brain tissue. Others were given a noninfected mixture. The team then monitored the mice during a roughly yearlong incubation period. Higher doses of humic acid correlated to weaker prion signals in the infected mice. In roughly half the cases, the mice injected with the infected brain tissue and humic acid mixture didn't show any symptoms at all after a 280-day incubation period.

The results suggest that humic acid could be used in efforts to limit the disease's spread -- possibly as a soil decontaminant to disinfect farmland. Previously, high levels of a mineral called birnessite were also found to degrade prions, therefore limiting transmission of the disease.

Alternatively, scientists could use this information to map which geographic areas elevate or inhibit prion transmission based on the levels of humic acid in the soil, says Shannon Bartelt-Hunt, an environmental engineer at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who was not involved in the research. The next step, Bartelt-Hunt says, might be to test the effects of humic acid on prion-contaminated soil samples to see if prions can be eradicated in the environment.

[The deer hunting season is not yet over so we will continue to see the results of state wildlife surveillance programmes, adding more detail to existing maps of CWD cervid prevalence.

The Science News article is to get you, the reader, thinking. If this initial research on mice is correct and has wider valid implications, CWD infected deer will be less prevalent on acid soils, e.g., east of the Mississippi, and thrive on the alkaline soils on the west side. Therefore it may be possible to be niche modeled and mapped. And this would have the ability of improving the targeting and efficiency of CWD surveillance & control programmes. - Mod.MHJ
