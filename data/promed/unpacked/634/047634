Southern Vietnam: childhood death toll rises to 19
--------------------------------------------------
At least 7 more children have died from an unknown virus in Ho Chi Minh and
other places in southern Vietnam, bringing to 19 the number of children who
have died from this disease since February 2003.
An official said that all 7 children were one year olds who had died after
admission to the An Giang General Hospital. The latest death was on Tue 22
Apr 2003. Symptoms were high fever and diarrhea, aggravated by respiratory
and cardiac problems. Enterovirus infection is suspected, of the type that
killed 30 children in Malaysia in 1997 and 50 in Taiwan the following year,
with similar symptoms. Health authorities discounted the idea that these
cases could be related to SARS, which has caused 5 deaths in Vietnam.

[The suspected enterovirus may be human enterovirus 71. The results of
continuing collaborative studies to confirm this suspicion are awaited with
interest. Sarawak has been experiencing a large outbreak of human
enterovirus 71 that began in February 2003. Most cases have uncomplicated
hand, foot and mouth disease, but a small number include neurological
disease. Phylogenetic analysis of recent isolates of human enterovirus 71
by Jane Cardosa and colleagues in Sarawak indicate that several genogroups
of the virus have been circulating in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997.
Their results show that 80 per cent of current strains belong to genogroup
C1, and it has been suggested that the next big outbreak of human
enterovirus 71 in the region will probably be due to strains from this
genogroup. The remaining strains belong to a distinct cluster within the B
genogroup and may represent an emerging new sub-genogroup. - Mod.CP]
