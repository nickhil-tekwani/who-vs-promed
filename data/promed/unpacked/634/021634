Ebola virus disease -- Democratic Republic of the Congo
-------------------------------------------------------
The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at a critical juncture. WHO faces a precarious situation given recent increases in insecurity, incidents of community mistrust, and increased geographical spread.

The period of mourning and general strike ("ville morte") in Beni, Butembo and Mabalako has officially ended; the ville morte was organized by civil society leaders following an attack in Beni on 22 Sep 2018, in which 21 people were killed. Activities that had slowed during the ville morte period included health workers being unable to reach and monitor the health of Ebola patient contacts, social mobilization and community engagement efforts significantly slowed or suspended, risk communications seriously constrained or suspended in areas highly impacted by EVD, and severe limitations on field teams' ability to investigate alerts of suspected cases and carry out safe and dignified burials. WHO operations are currently back to full scale; however, WHO remains vigilant given ongoing security constraints.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to work closely with people in the affected areas. Most communities support the response efforts and are open to vaccination and treatment; collaboration between communities and local authorities is ongoing to overcome the reluctance and mistrust which has developed in some places. Faced with rumours and misinformation, some families have chosen to care for sick relatives at home, increasing the risk of transmission to caregivers, family and children. Some patients have also left health facilities to seek alternative care, or actively avoid follow-up from health workers. Despite concerted efforts by local community leaders to ensure safe and dignified burials, in some cases these are rejected in favour of traditional practices. Avoiding contact with health workers, home care and unsafe burials all increase the risk to patients themselves, caregivers, children and other family members, and to health/frontline workers, and have contributed to the spread of the outbreak.

The affected areas now cover hundreds of kilometres, including a confirmed case who has moved into a 'red zone' -- a highly insecure and challenging environment where implementing response activities is extremely difficult. The geographic expansion further strains frontline resources, as an effective Ebola response requires hubs established in multiple locations, as close as possible to the affected population.

Where they have access, response teams continue to enhance activities to prevent new clusters and the potential spread to new areas. WHO continues to work in the affected areas, side-by-side with national and international partners, to support the response led by the MoH. The outbreak's spread into new, insecure areas in Tchomia Health Zone (with close proximity to the Ugandan border), as well as ongoing security concerns, continues to challenge the overall response. In light of these conditions, WHO revised its risk assessment and elevated the national and regional levels from 'high risk' to 'very high risk'; globally, the risk remains low.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (such as cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. On 28 Sep 2018, based on the worsening security situation, WHO revised its risk assessment for the outbreak, elevating the risk at national and regional levels from high to very high. The risk remains low globally. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

[3] MOH: vaccine warehouse inaugurated near Kinshasa
Date: Wed 10 Oct 2018

Bruno Tshibala Nzenze, Prime Minister and Head of Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), inaugurated today [10 Oct 2018] in Kinshasa, the new warehouse for the preservation of vaccines and health products. The Prime Minister inaugurated the site in the presence of the Minister of Public Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, Ms Anuradha Gupta, and the Deputy Representative of UNICEF in DRC, Dr Tajudeen Oyewale.

Located in Kinkole, 40 kilometers [25 mi] from downtown Kinshasa, this modern warehouse is the largest ever built in Central Africa and the largest ever built in a Gavi-supported country. It will facilitate the storage of vaccines and strengthen the cold chain to make vaccines available throughout the country, particularly in the most remote and inaccessible health areas.

"Immunization is one of the best ways to save the lives of millions of children and allows the state and families to save on health costs. The modern Kinkole warehouse will enable the Democratic Republic of Congo to conduct quality immunization activities to control, eliminate and eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases, "said the Minister of Public Health Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga.

The construction of this warehouse was fully funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. It is part of a strategic partnership between the Government of the DRC, Gavi and UNICEF.

Ms Anuradha Gupta, Deputy Executive Director of Gavi, emphasized that "Immunization is the best investment we can make for children's health. It is also the keystone of access to primary health care. It is fundamental that all steps in the delivery of vaccines are respected so that all children, wherever they live, benefit."

This modern warehouse, whose work began in February 2016 is fully integrated in the innovative device of the supply chain of the health system implemented by the country for the distribution of vaccines, medicines, health products and will also facilitate the introduction of new vaccines.

"The construction of this new warehouse will make it possible to stock better quantities of vaccines under the best conditions, thanks to the introduction of new vaccines, the continuous increase of the population and the need to reach all children and pregnant women living in the DRC, without exception," said UNICEF Deputy Representative in the DRC, Dr Tajudeen Oyewale.

This warehouse is composed of 3 parts; a part housing 12 cold rooms with a capacity of 5760 m3 for the storage of vaccines and thermolabile products; an administrative part with an area of 1300 m2 with more than 10 offices, 2 meeting rooms and dormitories; it also has a warehouse for dry inputs and medicines with a volume of 12 000 m3 on an area of 3600 m2.

The Minister of Health thanked during the opening session of the warehouse, Gavi and UNICEF for the invaluable support given to the health system in general and to vaccination in particular. Strengthening the supply chain of the Expanded Program of Immunization as part of Gavi's funding also includes the construction of warehouses, the provision of trucks, vehicles, motorcycles, outboards, solar refrigerators and freezers.

In addition to the Kinkole warehouse, 2 more are under construction in Lubumbashi and Kisangani.

[Photographs of this impressive warehouse may be seen at the URL cited above. This facility will undoubtedly improve the country's capacity to conduct large-scale campaigns against vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, that kill far greater numbers than Ebola. However, the rate-limiting factor for vaccine delivery to "the most remote and inaccessible health areas" is not central warehouse capacity but rather the limited transportation infrastructure in this vast country. Some sense of the transportation time and distances required for 2 DRC provinces can be seen in appendix 2 of "Exploring New Distribution Models for Vaccines and other Health Commodities Adapted to the on the Ground Realities of the Equateur and Tshuapa Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo," report by Village Reach, October 2015 (http://www.villagereach.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DRC-Supply-Chain-Assessment-FINAL-English-version.pdf). This study included Equateur province, and it would be interesting to compare the estimated time versus the actual time for distribution of the rVSVDG-ZEBOV vaccine deployed in the Equateur Ebola outbreak earlier this year (2018). - Mod.LXL]
