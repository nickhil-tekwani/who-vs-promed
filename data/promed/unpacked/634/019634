The number of confirmed cases of viral meningitis in the last 2 months in Georgia has jumped to 306. According to Georgia's National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), 169 of the cases were in Tbilisi, 51 in Kutaisi, 18 in Adjara, 11 in Rustavi, and one isolated case in each of a number of cities and towns all over Georgia.

[Over the weekend (24-25 May 2014)], 7 new cases were registered in Kutaisi. 38 patients are receiving medical treatment at the hospital in that 2nd largest Georgian city.

The minister of health has repeatedly said that there is no cause for alarm about the viral meningitis outbreak. Also NCDC representatives have said that this kind of thing happens every four years. The last two times viral meningitis peaked was in 2010 and 2006.

Nonetheless, authorities view the situation serious enough that kindergartens and schools up to 6th grade were closed until [27 May 2014] to, as they say, implement additional sanitary measures. TV news showed schools buildings being decontaminated.

The ministry also called on the parents themselves and schools staff to take additional hygiene measures to protect children, most importantly, by providing for a strict personal hygiene, and washing hands frequently. Dining areas should be thoroughly cleaned with disinfectants.

It further said that in schools, pupils should not share utensils like plates and forks. If the 1st symptoms of meningitis are noted, immediately see the doctor. Parents should monitor that their children are following all the hygiene rules.

Schools that have had cases of meningitis must be [?de]contaminated.

[The number of cases of viral meningitis in Georgia has more than doubled -- from 142 cases when last reported on 21 May (ProMED-mail post Viral meningitis - Georgia 20140524.2496603) to now 306 cases on 26 May. The age range of cases is 2 to 34 years and none were said to be severely ill in the prior ProMED-mail post. The cases seem to be occurring throughout Georgia. Apparently the specific virus causing this outbreak has not been identified as yet, even though there were said to be similar outbreaks of viral meningitis in Georgia in 2006 and 2010 (ProMED-mail post Viral meningitis - Georgia 20140524.2496603). However, there were no ProMED-mail posts of viral meningitis outbreaks in Georgia in prior years.
