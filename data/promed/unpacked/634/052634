Rust diseases like damp conditions; it is often said that "good
cropping years are good rust years." Conditions during the summer
preceding a cropping period can also be important in determining the
potential for a rusty year.
The 2005 cropping season began with dry conditions in most of eastern
Australia and wetter conditions in the west. The expectation could
therefore be for rust in the west and little rust in the east. Oddly,
several recordings of stripe rust and leaf rust have already been
made in the east, but there have been no reports of rust in Western
Australia to date.
Wheat stripe rust in Eastern Australia:
The 1st confirmed sample of wheat stripe rust [WSR] in 2005 was
collected from a Whistler crop at Tarcutta (60 km east of Wagga Wagga
in the southwestern slopes of NSW) in the last week of May 2005. This
represents a very early report of WSR rust for the 2005 winter crop
season. In comparison, the 1st confirmed report in 2004 was collected
from a Diamondbird crop in early August 2005. This crop was
considered to have become infected from a nearby Whistler field that
was sown much earlier in 2004. The Tarcutta field of Whistler was
sown on February 2005 rain, and was intended for early grazing. The
extent of early sowings of Whistler is unclear, but we presume that
those that were established in February and have survived the dry
autumn period may be potential sources of inoculum for main season plantings.
2 further reports of stripe rust from eastern Australia were received
in late June 2005, the 1st of which came from Grenfell (southern New
South Wales) on cv. Wylah. Infection hot spots were evident in the
field. The crop was sown on "a fluke storm" in late April 2005. The
2nd report, yet to be confirmed, was from a trial site at Cowra on
cv. EGA Gregory, sown in early April 2005. Although early crops are
relatively rare in the east in 2005, these sightings should give
cause to monitor carefully those crops that have established well.
Late plantings will likely predominate in the east and, depending on
the levels of WSR development in early planted fields, may come under
pressure in late winter or early spring. However, with just 2
confirmed WSR samples to date, it is far too early to predict
epidemic development.
Wheat leaf rust in Eastern Australia:
Leaf rust samples were received from Cooma (Monaro region of southern
NSW) on 18 May 2005 on cvs. Tennant and Mackellar, which are both
long-season winter wheats suitable for grazing and grain recovery. In
contrast, the 1st leaf rust samples in 2004 were received in early
August 2005. The pathotype of rust responsible was 1st detected from
Mackellar wheat in October 2004, and appears to be new. Work is under
way to characterize this pathotype in more detail.
Rust samples:
This alert should serve to remind cooperators to be aware of the
possibility of rust infections in commercial fields, and to be
actively looking for signs of infection. Cereal rust samples should
be collected when leaves are dry and showing evidence of rust
infection. Several leaves can be posted in a paper envelope (no
plastic wrapping), including variety details (if known), location of
the sample and contact details for correspondence.
Samples can be posted to: Australian Cereal Rust Survey Plant
Breeding Institute Private Bag 11 Camden NSW 2570.

[In 2004, wheat stripe rust [WSR] (caused by _Puccinia striiformis_)
reduced yields and grain quality of wheat crops in northern New South
Wales and necessitated widespread application of foliar fungicides.
Although WSR was detected in Queensland in late September, it was
much less severe than in New South Wales. The "WA pathotype"
(134E16A+) was the dominant strain in 2004. 1st detected in Western
Australia in 2002, this pathotype is now dominant across Australia
and is more virulent on most northern wheat cultivars than its predecessors.
The widespread occurrence of stripe rust in 2004 and its probable
survival in the region over summer indicate the disease is likely to
develop again during the 2005 season. And it could be more severe in
Queensland this year, especially if the epidemic begins early.
