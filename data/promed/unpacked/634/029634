"There is bird flu virus in the countries bordering with Turkey. However,
these countries don't announce it," Turkish Agriculture Minister Mehdi Akar
claims.
As APA reports, the Deputy Chairman of the State Veterinary Service at the
Azerbaijani Agriculture Ministry, Emin Shahbazov, doesn't agree with the
Turkish Minister's statement. Shahbazov said that Akar's statement about
the bird flu threat in countries bordering Turkey don't concern Azerbaijan.
Noting that Azerbaijan has the shortest border with Turkey, Shahbazov
stressed that 7 searches for bird flu have been held in the country so far,
and no virus has been found: "The poultry farms and private farms are
monitored now."
Shahbazov added that US experts will arrive in Azerbaijan tomorrow [23 Jan
2006] to study the bird flu situation in the country. According to him, the
World Health Organization suggested that Azerbaijan would benefit from the
assistance of Turkish experts to implement better precautions. Azerbaijan
has accepted the offer.

Georgian and Russian scientists to work together to battle bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Georgian and Russian scientists will cooperate in the fight against avian
flu. The resolution was passed at a meeting between Vladimder Chipashvili,
Health Care Minister of Georgia, and Oleg Kiselev, director of the
Scientific-Research Flu Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical
Sciences, RIA NOVOSTI reports. "We are sure that Georgia will find a way
out independently, but scientific cooperation is better," Kiselev declared.
The Georgian party expressed dissatisfaction with a recent statement made
in Peking by Yevgeni Nepoklonov, Deputy Head of Russia's Federal Service
for Veterinary and Sanitary Control, who declared that avian virus was
spread to Turkey from the territory of Georgia.
Kiselev apologized for the statement and stressed that avian flu was a
global problem.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has installed a team in Van [eastern
Turkey] that works out of a suite at the governor's office, and a team of
US experts arrived late Saturday [21 Jan 2006] as part of a tour to
Turkey's flu-stricken areas and 3 neighboring countries.
They met local officials Sunday [22 Jan 2006] and visited the crisis center
here and were scheduled to tour the hospital later in the day.
"The cooperation among the ministries involved, and with international
agencies on the ground here, and the 24-hour nature of the operations that
allow rapid response are very important," Anne Derse, a State Department
communications expert with the US team, said after Sunday's [22 Jan 2006]
meetings.
The WHO's Thomas Grein agreed, praising the "excellent cooperation (which
has) proven very fruitful."
The US team, comprising experts in human and animal epidemiology, is
scheduled to fly out late Sunday [22 Jan 2006] for Baku, the 1st leg of a
3-country tour of the Caucasus.
No cases of bird flu have been reported in the countries that the team will
visit -- Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia -- but they all border the
worst-hit regions of eastern Turkey.
Turkish Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker on Friday [20 Jan 2006] accused
unspecified "neighbors of Turkey" of concealing the fact that they too have
been struck by the bird flu.

FAO: Bird Flu May Have Already Penetrated into Armenia, Iran and Syria
-----------------------------------------------
[On 16 Jan 2006], the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated
that "there are no reasons for not believing the avian influenza virus has
not crossed the eastern limits of Turkey." Organization specialist Dr. Juan
Labroth, who recently returned from Turkey, said the only confirmed case of
infection with H5N1 virus in Turkey that had led to death was registered in
Arlik village, bordering Armenia. Having confirmed the FAO statement that
it has not been ruled out that the bird flu virus has penetrated into
countries adjacent to Turkey -- Armenia, Iran, Syria -- Labroth stated that
"the FAO has to get reliable and transparent information from countries
neighboring Turkey, which will ensure [the] absence of avian influenza in
those countries."
Answering the question of whether Armenia has gotten in touch with the FAO
about the bird flu issue, the UN specialist said, "Armenia kept in touch
with the organization within the framework of other programs; however, no
specific report on the state of [the] health of birds was received from the
Armenian Government."
"Within [the] past few months, we [have] received reports [of a] high level
of bird death[s] in countries neighboring with Turkey, owing to poisoning
or other diseases. However, the diagnoses are to be confirmed by FAO
laboratories and the World Organization for Animal Health," Lubroth said.
Cases of bird deaths are registered in a number of Armenian villages. Local
authorities and high ranking officials of the staff for fighting bird flu
assure the public that the dead birds were examined in laboratories and
bird flu was not found.
"Words are not enough. It should be proved," Lubroth stated. "We would like
to closely cooperate with Armenian authorities [and] help them make sure
the virus is absent," the UN specialist remarked. The FAO will send its
specialists to Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine to check on whether their
laboratories are able to provide accurate diagnostics, he said.
