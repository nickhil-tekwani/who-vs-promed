2000/181 Black sigatoka in the Torres Strait islands (Australia)
---------------------------------------------------
In RS 2000/120, it was reported that _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ (causing
black sigatoka disease of banana) has pest status "transient: actionable,
under eradication" in Queensland (Australia) and is absent from the rest of
the country.
This statement is essentially correct but it should be added that the
disease is established on Murray Island in the Torres Strait. The border of
Australia nearly reaches Papua New Guinea (PNG) so that almost all the
Torres Strait islands are in Australia. Murray Island and several others
lie on the PNG side of the Strait, and black sigatoka is tolerated if it
occurs there (it is established in PNG). Another group of islands lies on
the Australian side, off Cape York, and black sigatoka is subject to
eradication there as it is in mainland Queensland.
