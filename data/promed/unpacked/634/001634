[Comment from the sender: I know you don't usually post measles stories,
but this one has unusual merit. The public health community must find a way
to get proper information to parents, and investigate how trust is lost,
and how it can be rebuilt. How can public health officials fight emerging
diseases effectively, when this (below) is the public reaction to
well-known diseases with well-tested remedies? TJA]
Parents in Wales who have organised "measles parties" to help their
children fight the disease have been criticised as "irresponsible". The
parents have refused to let their children have the MMR [mumps, measles,
rubella] vaccine due to worries about its side-effects. They believe the
best immunisation is to deliberately expose them to childhood diseases.
But the action has been criticised by Dr Meirion Evans, consultant in
communicable diseases for the Bro Taf health authority. He said the
parents were acting irresponsibly. "It defeats the whole point of having a
vaccination which is to build up immunity and prevent the disease," he
said. "What's more there are far more potential complications from having
the disease than having the vaccination."
"Wales is at a critical point with MMR vaccinations- we have gone from a
high of 95% down to an average of 86/87%. "But in certain parts of west
Wales in particular it is 80% - so we are on the threshold of the disease
coming back if we are not careful.
"It's one thing to refuse to have your children immunised - but it's quite
another to deliberately expose them to harmful diseases," said Dr Evans. He
recommended that children be vaccinated as soon as possible, saying the
vaccine was effective and safe.

[This is a prime example of going backwards but this is not a Welsh
problem, it is a worldwide problem. The efficacy of the measles vaccine is
95% and the attack rate in an unimmunized population is 100%. Propaganda
against vaccinating children includes "vaccines cause the diseases they are
supposed to prevent", "vaccines suppress the immune system", additives in
vaccines are toxic", "vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome",
"certain vaccines may cause Mad Cow disease", etc. It's revolting.
The Australian Government has produced two excellent pamphlets,
"Immunization: myths and realities; responding to arguments against
immunisation" and "Understanding childhood immunizations". They MAY BE
available from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, GPO Box
