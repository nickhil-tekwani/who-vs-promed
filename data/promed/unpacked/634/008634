Heroin contaminated with anthrax could kill 50 addicts in Scotland
------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials fear that a deadly anthrax outbreak could kill up to
50 heroin addicts across Scotland after the epidemic claimed its 6th
victim. The outbreak began in Glasgow but doctors now believe
contaminated heroin is circulating all over Scotland. They fear the
death toll could match that of a similar case among Scottish heroin
addicts in 2000 that claimed 43 lives.

It was confirmed yesterday [7 Jan 2010] that the 6th person to die was
a 49-year-old man whose body was found in Stirling city centre. He is
the 1st fatality in the NHS Forth Valley area. There has also been a
single death in Tayside, another in Lanarkshire, and 4 fatalities in
Glasgow.

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland, which is leading a major inquiry to establish the source of
the anthrax in the heroin, said contaminated drugs now appeared to be
spreading all over the country. Dr Ramsay said: "The death of this
patient in NHS Forth Valley indicates further geographical spread of
the cases, meaning that heroin users all across Scotland need to be
aware of the risks of a potentially contaminated supply."

Dozens more people could be killed by the anthrax-contaminated heroin,
drug experts warned last night. Andrew Horne, director of operations
at drug and alcohol charity Addaction, said: "It is very worrying and
I suppose it shows that we have no clear understanding of how the drug
market works in terms of supply routes." Heroin contaminated with the
flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis killed 43 addicts in Scotland
in 2000.

Mr Horne said the number of deaths caused by the anthrax-infected
heroin could reach these numbers. He said: "The outbreak in 2000
lasted about 6 weeks and then we never heard of it again, but because
it is all illegal there is no way of knowing."

Gordon Meldrum, Director General of the Scottish Crime and Drug
Enforcement Agency, who leads on drugs for the Association of Chief
Police Officers in Scotland, said: "The deaths associated with anthrax
are disturbing and are being treated very seriously by all the
relevant authorities. The Scottish Police Service is now coordinating
the investigation into a number of drug related deaths across the
country in order to gather as much information as possible about
possible links and causes."

[We are getting notices of successful Scottish drug raids and highway
recoveries. I will only list the news links as they are not strictly
disease outbreaks:

The authorities believe that they are intercepting about 1 percent of
the heroin.

The 28 Oct 2009 arrest involved 3 men from Liverpool; 29 Oct 2009, 2
men from Aberdeenshire aged 36, 21; 10 Jan 2010, 4 people -- a
27-year-old woman from Dundee, a 35-year-old man and a 35-year-old
woman from Liverpool, and a 41-year-old man from Forfar. I think you
can appreciate why this Scots situation casts a long shadow across the
UK.

Apropos contamination, there is an anecdote from a London drug worker
about anthrax contaminated Iranian heroin in the 1960s from the
dealers carrying the heroin around in animal skins. Has anyone any
memories of this? That it is logical does not mean it is either
correct or accurate. - Mod.MHJ]
