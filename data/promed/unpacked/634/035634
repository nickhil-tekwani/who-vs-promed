In New Delhi, 14 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis put the
health officials in the national capital on overdrive, prompting
large-scale testing of humans and animals alike. Over 140 people have
died due to encephalitis at a government hospital in Indore [Madhya
Pradesh] in the last 8 months, but the Madhya Pradesh health officers
are neither aware of the deaths, nor are in a position to negate
possibilities of Japanese [encephalitis] virus spread in the city.

The fears about spread of a Japanese encephalitis epidemic in Indore
gains ground after test reports of laboratories in New Delhi claimed
that 17 pigs were found infected with Japanese encephalitis virus.
Delhi health minister AK Wadia had confirmed that several of the pigs
were supplied from Indore.

Japanese encephalitis [JE virus] can easily spread from pigs to human
beings [not directly. JE virus is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes
that may have acquired the virus from pigs, which are amplifying
hosts, and subsequently transmit it to humans. Wild birds are
reservoir hosts. - Mod.TY]

As per the official records, an average of 17 deaths have occurred in
the MY Hospital [in Indore] every month over the last 8 months. In
April and May each, 20 persons died due to encephalitis. "The majority
of the deceased includes children. Though the data is yet to be
analysed for the month of November 2011, 2 children have died this
month [December 2011] also due to encephalitis," said a hospital
official on condition of anonymity.

The health department officials tried to shy away from the issue by
claiming that the MY Hospital -- an auxiliary medical facility of the
MGM Medical College that comes under the medical education department
-- had failed to inform them about the developments. State director of
health services JN Kansotiya said, "We have not been informed. MY
Hospital comes under directorate of medical education. If so many
deaths have occurred due to a particular disease then it's an issue of
serious concern," he added.

Medical College community medicine department head Dr Sanjay Dixit
claimed that encephalitis may be of different kinds which leads to
inflammation of brain cells, but both the Japanese [encephalitis virus
infections] and cerebral encephalitis due to bacteria could break into
an epidemic.

The office of joint director health services had decided to put a
check on vector-borne diseases, but no particular drive for containing
encephalitis has been initiated yet. No blood sample testing of pigs
has been carried out in the entire division.

Joint director health services Dr Sharad Pandit claimed that the
magnitude of deaths due to encephalitis is alarming and that
appropriate measures would be taken.

[There have been scattered reported JE virus infections around India
and repeated reports of Japanese encephalitis cases along with even
more undiagnosed "acute encephalitis syndrome" cases in northern and
northeastern India this year (2011). These are the 1st JE virus cases
reported from Madhya Pradesh this year, although the report above
implies that cases have been occurring since April 2011. The report
mentions only JE virus infections as the etiological agent in these
cases.
