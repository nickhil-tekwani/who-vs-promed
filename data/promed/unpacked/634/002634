Dominican agricultural producers warned of the rapid expansion in the
country of huanglongbing (HLB), a pest known as "the AIDS" of the
crop, which can devastate plantations within 3 to 5 years. A major
corporation warned that some 130 orange trees in 8 provinces tested
positive for the disease; the only remedy is to spray to kill the
vector [the Asian citrus psyllid]. Environmental pollution plus
skyrocketing costs of production are the 2 main drawbacks of the
spraying that can halt the infection.

All indications are that the disease entered through the ports with
imported materials and tourists. The pest has been present in greater
quantities in plantations in the province of Hato Mayor (East), known
as the citrus capital of the country, Azua, Puerto Plata, Santiago de
los Caballeros (North), Montecristi, Santiago Rodriguez, Valverde
(northwest) and Maria Trinidad Sanchez (northeast). 5000 people have
lost their jobs in the province of Hato Mayor, said the company,
Barcelo, which has requested immediate assistance from the authorities.

The disease was 1st detected in 2008 [ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034],
and so far, no drastic prophylactic measures have been taken, although
experts agree that if the pest gains strength, citrus orchards in the
Dominican Republic will disappear in just half a decade. HLB is a
plague that drastically reduces plant productivity and turns the sweet
fruit sour.

As part of the actions applied by the "Prevention campaign against the
introduction of citrus quarantine pests" in the State of Yucatan,
huanglongbing was detected in samples collected from backyard trees
located in the municipalities of Tizimin, Rio Lagartos, Mococha and
Chemax, State of Yucatan [ProMED-mail post 20090720.2570] and Lazaro
Cardenas in the State of Quintana Roo.

The National Service for Plant Health (SENASICA) in collaboration with
the states have initiated actions for the "Emergency protocol for the
detection of huanglongbing": intensive search for symptoms to detect
contaminated plants; delimiting the outbreak in order to begin or
apply actions to eliminate positive plants; and the intensive and
systematic control of the vector. They are also organizing training
events and outreach activities targeted to growers, technical staff
and the general public.

According to International Plant Protection Convention standards, it
is considered that huanglongbing in Mexico is a pest that is present
only in some areas of the states of Yucatan and Quintana Roo and
subject to official control to avoid its spread.

A feared citrus pest has finally made an appearance in Arizona, with
the discovery of a single Asian citrus psyllid in a sticky trap in a
residential area of San Luis, Arizona. The find was confirmed by John
Caravetta, Arizona Department of Agriculture. He said the insect was
found about 800 meters from the Mexican border and approximately 2 km
from where the pest was found in 2008 in Mexico.

The psyllid is of grave concern because it can carry the disease
huanglongbing [HLB], which is considered a serious threat in the US.
The disease has spread throughout the state of Florida, and [the
psyllid vector] has been found in Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia,
Southern California and Mexico. Last summer [July 2008], HLB was
detected on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula [see ProMED archives below].

Arizona agriculture officials have been looking for the psyllid for
several years, Caravetta said. Efforts were stepped up in Yuma County
with the finding of the psyllid near the border in 2008. "We want to
determine where the infestation might be, then target that area for
treatment and put a buffer around it," he said.

Caravetta said the finding of the insect is the 1st in Arizona. "We're
the last citrus-producing state in the USA to detect it." The insect
has been sent to USDA [US Department of Agriculture] for confirmation
and to determine whether it carried the citrus greening disease,
Caravetta said.

Fortunately, he said, there is a good buffer of several miles of
desert and vegetable fields between where the pest was found and the
nearest commercial citrus grove. As for homeowners, he said they
should be regularly inspecting their trees.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In
northern and central America, it is caused by the fastidious
phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus. Its
vector is the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is
also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The
vector is specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives, and thus the
disease is confined to these crops. Two other species of _Ca._ L.
(africanus and americanus) can cause HLB in different areas. For more
information on HLB, see links and previous posts listed below.
