The rabies epidemic has taken another life after calming down for a while.
This time a 57 year old pemangku [temple priest] died on Sat 12 Jun 2010
after receiving treatment at Nusa Indah Ward, Sanglah Hospital.

The victim, from Desa Sumberkimia, Gerokgak, Buleleng, was rushed to
Sanglah hospital in the evening of Fri 11 Jun 2010, with clinical symptoms
of rabies virus infection. After receiving treatment for less than a day,
however, the patient died.

The victim's son, when interviewed yesterday [12 Jun 2010] in Sanglah
Hospital Forensic Department, stated that his father had been bitten on his
right hand 2 months ago. Due to shortage of rabies vaccine in the Puskesmas
[local health centre], however, the victim didn't receive treatment for his
wound. Also, according to his son, the victim was bitten when a group of
stray dogs attacked his puppy. Immediately he chased away the dogs, which
had bitten his puppy, but unfortunately he was been bitten on his hand by
one of the stray dogs.

His father looked healthy after being bitten by the dog. However, in the
past week, he experienced respiratory problems and excess salivation from
his mouth. Finally, the victim was taken to Singaraja's Kerta Husada
Hospital with rabies clinical symptoms. After 3 days treatment, he was
discharged. However, his condition again deteriorated and he was taken to
Singaraja hospital. After receiving treatment there, the victim was
transferred to Sanglah hospital.

The son admitted that many stray dogs in his village had not been vaccinated.

According to Nusa Bali records, 49 patients have died as a result of rabies
virus infection in Sanglah hospital. Dr Ken Wirasandhi, MARS, secretary of
Sanglah Hospital Rabies Control Team confirmed that a patient had symptoms
of rabies. According to him, laboratory testing is required to confirm that
the death of the patient was a consequence of rabies virus infection.

[In the most recent previous report from Bali (dated 24 May 2010) it was
stated that the rabies death toll had risen to 57. Therefore the human
fatality reported above will raise the death toll to at lest 58. Professor
Wilde believes that in fact the toll has now reached over 60 since the
outbreak began 2 years ago. It is clear from this report that the outbreak
is still far from contained, and that control of canine rabies has not been
achieved.
