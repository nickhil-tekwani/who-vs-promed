Data from the newest epidemiological bulletin from the Ministry of Health indicate that the country has had 3558 registered cases of influenza, with 608 recorded deaths -- more than twice as many as during the same period in 2017. The document totals registrations of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome from the beginning of the year through [23 Jun 2018].

Of these cases, nearly 60 percent were attributed to H1N1, the strain of the virus most likely to result in complications.

During the same period in 2017, 1459 cases of the flu were recorded resulting in 237 deaths -- which represent an increase of 143 percent. At the time, the predominant virus was H3N2, a subtype that also causes serious complications, especially among the elderly.

As of the beginning of this month [June 2018], the country had registered 2315 cases of the flu resulting in 274 deaths -- 74 percent in patients with at least one high risk factor, like the elderly (236 deaths), people with cardiovascular disease (143 deaths) and those with diabetes (109 cases). Until last week [week ending 1 Jul 2018], 46 children under 5 years of age had been fatal victims, 3 times as many as were registered during the same period in 2017.

This total is still lower than what was recorded in 2016, when 12 174 cases of the flu resulting in 2220 deaths were registered during the year -- the highest number recorded since the pandemic of 2009.

The national vaccination campaign ended on [Fri 22 Jun 2018] without having reached the goal set for it by the Ministry of Health.

As of [Mon 25 Jun 2018], only 86 percent of the target population (pregnant women and those having recently given birth, the elderly, infants and children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, health-care workers, teachers and professors, indigenous people, and the incarcerated) had been vaccinated, leaving 6.8 million people unvaccinated.

Abstract
--------
Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols and droplets, in which viruses must remain stable and infectious across a wide range of environmental conditions. Using humidity-controlled chambers, we studied the impact of relative humidity on the stability of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus in suspended aerosols and stationary droplets. Contrary to the prevailing paradigm that humidity modulates the stability of respiratory viruses in aerosols, we found that viruses supplemented with material from the apical surface of differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells remained equally infectious for 1 hour at all relative humidities tested. This sustained infectivity was observed in both fine aerosols and stationary droplets. Our data suggest, for the first time, that influenza viruses remain highly stable and infectious in aerosols across a wide range of relative humidities. These results have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of transmission of influenza and its seasonality.
