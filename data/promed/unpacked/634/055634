In response to the RFI (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION) sent to EpiCore members in Qatar, we received the following information:

A 22-year-old Bangladeshi male patient was admitted to a hospital with a 4-day history of cough and fever. He had a positive travel history to Saudi Arabia and contact with camels. He is stable and currently under observation. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for the MERS-CoV.

[We are very grateful to the EpiCore member who provided this information. Given the sporadic case reports in Saudi Arabia during the past 2 months, where the majority of cases were considered primary cases with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, we hope there will be further information on the location(s) within Saudi Arabia to which this case travelled, as well as the region where the patient had contact with camels.

In addition, a recent letter to the editor of the Journal of Emerging Diseases documented the presence of MERS-CoV in Alpacas in Qatar in areas where known infected camels resided (see Reusken CBEM, Schilp C, Raj VS, De Bruin E, Kohl RHG, Farag EABA, et al. MERS-CoV infection of alpaca in a region where MERS-CoV is endemic [letter].
