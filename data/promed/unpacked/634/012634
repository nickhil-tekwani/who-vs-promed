[The UK Department of Health web-site has been revised, and the
monthly new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now
appended to the table "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK by
Calendar Year (since 1990)" which can be accessed at
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/27/72/04102772.pdf>.
The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and, the case definitions can be found by accessing the

The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, abbreviated CJD
(new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail, in the UK appears to have
plateaued, or perhaps to be in decline. Therefore, since many of the
reports appearing in the update are only peripherally related to the
situation in the UK, the opportunity is being taken to drop the
designation UK from the title of this thread. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics as of Mon 10 Jan 2005
---------------------------------------------------
The UK Department of Health is today [Mon 7 Feb 2005] issuing the
latest information about the numbers of known cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This includes cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form of the disease thought to
be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 106
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 41
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 148
Summary of vCJD cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
------
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 154
(The next update will be published on Mon 7 Mar 2005)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 11 Jan
2004, the number of deaths from definite vCJD is unchanged at 106,
and the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD is
unchanged and remains 148. The number of probable vCJD cases still
alive has increased from 5 to 6. Therefore the overall total number
of definite or probable vCJD cases has increased by one since 11 Jan
2004 to 154.
As of 4 Feb 2005, so far this year in the UK there have been 8
referrals of suspected CJD; and there have been 4 deaths from
sporadic CJD, one from GSS, and none from Familial, iatrogenic or
variant CJD. - Mod.CP]

"vCJD Timebomb" Fears Discounted
-------------------------------
High numbers of future deaths in the UK from the human form [variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy)] are unlikely, researchers have said. The Imperial
College team [now] calculate there will be around 70 future deaths.
They say the worst-case scenario could see another 600 deaths, but
that this is unlikely. The research, which appears in the Journal of
the Royal Society, said thousands of people could carry vCJD, but
show no symptoms.
The higher forecast is based on the possibility that people from
different genetic subgroups could be affected by vCJD. So far, people
of only one genetic subgroup, which accounts for 40 percent of the
population, have been affected. There have been 148 deaths from
new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) since the condition was
first seen in 1995. Research pointed to eating meat contaminated with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) as the cause. Over the last
decade, scientists have been working to evaluate what the full extent
of the vCJD epidemic will be. Deaths have been declining from their
peak of 28 in 2000 to 9 in 2004.
But researchers who tested 12 674 appendix and tonsil samples found
that 3 showed signs of apparent vCJD, indicating around 3800 people
could ultimately be affected. However, only one of the 3 positive
samples actually matched those taken from people who had been
diagnosed with the clinical disease. Interpretation of the other 2
samples was less certain because they did not look [precisely] as
scientists expected. The Imperial College team suggest this could
mean that some people could be infected with vCJD, but not develop
symptoms. If this was the case, looking at the population who would
have eaten infected meat, computer programmes were used to estimate
there could be a total of around 70 deaths from vCJD.
In addition, the Imperial team considered research into the genetics
of those who could be affected. Until 2004, all of those affected had
been from one genetic subgroup. But it was then revealed that someone
with a different genetic make-up had probably become infected with
vCJD after a blood transfusion. The researchers say that in this
worst-case scenario -- if people of other genotypes are equally as
susceptible as those in the original subgroup, but have a longer
incubation period for vCJD -- there could be a total of around 600
deaths from vCJD.
Dr Azra Ghani, from Imperial College, said: "Since 2000 there has
been a decline in the number of clinical cases reported. One reason
for the discrepancy between the high estimated number of positive
tests and low number of actual recorded clinical cases could be that
infected individuals do not go on to develop clinical disease in
their lifetime." However, the researchers say they have been unable
to calculate how many vCJD cases could result in the future from
blood transfusions from people who do not know they are carriers of
the disease.
Dr Ghani said: "Although our results indicate there is little chance
of large numbers of vCJD infections from primary transmission, we
have not taken into account the possibility of additional cases
infected by blood transfusion. This could result in more clinical
cases emerging at a later date."
The CJD Surveillance Unit said predicting the extent of vCJD was very
difficult, but said the more research was carried out, the more
accurate predictions could be.

Chronic Lymphocytic Inflammation Specifies the Organ Tropism of Prions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The following is the summary of a paper by Mathias Heikenwalder and
8 others, published in Science online, 10.1126/science.1106460, Thu
20 Jan 2005
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1106460v1>.
This paper describes work that illustrates that chronic inflammatory
conditions may affect and expand the natural and iatrogenic
transmission of prions - Mod.CP]
Prions typically accumulate in nervous and lymphoid tissues. Because
proinflammatory cytokines and immune cells are required for lymphoid
prion replication, we tested whether inflammatory conditions affect
prion pathogenesis. We administered prions to mice with 5
inflammatory diseases of kidney, pancreas or liver. In all cases,
chronic lymphocytic inflammation enabled prion accumulation in
otherwise prion-free organs. Inflammatory foci consistently
correlated with lymphotoxin upregulation and ectopic induction of
PrPC-expressing FDC-M1+ cells, whereas inflamed organs of mice
lacking lymphotoxin-alpha or its receptor accumulate neither PrPSc
nor infectivity upon prion inoculation. By expanding the tissue
distribution of prions, chronic inflammatory conditions may act as
modifiers of natural and iatrogenic prion transmission.

Study Finds that Illness May Promote Spread of Mad Cow Prion
------------------------------------------------------------
The agent that transmits mad cow disease and related diseases may
spread further in the body of an animal suffering from certain
illnesses, scientists said on Thu 20 Jan 2005. Their finding raises
the question of whether measures aimed at curbing the spread of mad
cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), are adequate,
the researchers said.
Tests on mice showed that prions, the protein-like fragments that
transmit BSE and related diseases [e.g. variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in humans], can show up in organs they are not supposed to if
the mouse has an inflammatory condition. Scientists have believed
that BSE-causing prions are limited to the brain, spleen, spinal cord
and lymph tissue, although some tests have suggested blood and muscle
tissue may also harbor the prions. The latest study, published in the
journal Science, suggests prions may also sometimes be found in the
kidney, pancreas and liver. "We administered prions to mice with 5
inflammatory diseases of kidney, pancreas or liver," wrote the
researchers, led by top prion expert Dr. Adriano Aguzzi of the
University Hospital of Zurich in Switzerland.
Aguzzi and colleagues in Britain and the United States inoculated
specially bred mice with prions and checked to see if the prions
spread in their bodies when the mice had an inflammatory condition.
This is because other studies had suggested that prions might be
attracted to immune system inflammatory cells. "In all cases, chronic
lymphocytic inflammation enabled prion accumulation in otherwise
prion-free organs," the researchers wrote.
BSE peaked in British cattle herds in the mid-1990s, and a few cases
have been reported in other countries. Canada reported its 3rd case
this month. People who eat BSE-infected beef products can develop a
related human brain disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
or vCJD. There is no treatment or cure. [As of 4 Feb 2005, so far in
the UK for the year 2005 there have 8 referrals of suspected CJD; and
there have been 8 deaths from sporadic CJC, one from GSS and none
from familial, iatrogenic or variant CJD. - Mod.CP]. It has killed
148 Britons, and 5 [now 6] Britons are alive with the disease,
according to the British Department of Health's monthly report on the
disease. The World Health Organization says it has reports of 6 cases
in France, one in Ireland, one in Italy, one in Canada and one in the
United States [and one in Japan: see; ProMED-mail post "CJD (new
var.) - Japan: death 20050204.0381" - Mod.CP]
Experts believed BSE first appeared when cattle were fed improperly
rendered remains of sheep infected with scrapie, a related disease.
In 1997, the United States and Canada imposed animal feed bans, and
have mandated the removal of materials believed to carry infectious
prions. These include the skull, brain, nerves attached to the brain,
eyes, tonsils, spinal cord and attached nerves, plus a portion of the
small intestine. The study suggests that even symptom-free animals
may also have prions in their liver, kidney, and pancreas.

Study Finds Broader Reach for Mad Cow Proteins
----------------------------------------------
Mad cow disease has long been thought to occur in just the brains and
nervous systems of infected animals. But scientists are reporting
today that the proteins thought to cause the disease can travel to
other organs as well. The research is based on experiments with mice,
but if it is borne out in other species, it may suggest that no part
of an infected animal is safe to eat. The disease leads to a fatal
brain disease in humans [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease].
In the mouse experiments, reported in the journal Science [see [3]
above], researchers in Switzerland found that prions, proteins that
are the infectious agent in mad cow disease, follow immune cells,
called lymphocytes, in the body. When mice were given chronic
infectious diseases of the liver, kidney and pancreas and then
inoculated with prions, the prions made their way to the infected
organs. Dr. Adriano Aguzzi, a neuropathologist at the University
Hospital in Zurich, who led the experiments, said this meant that
cows and sheep infected with prions could harbor the disease in any
inflamed organ.
But Dr. David R. Smith, a veterinarian at the University of Nebraska,
said the research did not raise alarms about American beef. For one
thing, he said, livestock with obvious signs of systemic infection,
like a fever, are not allowed into the food supply. And most American
cattle are slaughtered while they are young and at reduced risk of
infection.
Many countries, including the United States, require the removal of
skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords and other nervous tissues from
slaughtered animals because prions are known to accumulate in those
tissues. Even in countries with mad cow disease, mainly in Europe,
meat is considered safe if those tissues are removed, Dr. Aguzzi
said. But the disease could spread more readily if infections are not
obvious or if inspections are sloppily done, he said.

Paper, January 2005 [edited]

Position Statement: Maternal Transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
-----------------------------------------------
Issue:
1. The Chief Medical Officer for England asked SEAC to consider
current evidence and comment on the potential transmission of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) from mother to child via human
breast milk. In utero transmission was also considered. The committee
also commented on the scientific basis of a risk reduction measure
for possible transmission of vCJD via banked breast milk.
Background:
2. No diagnostic test is currently available for the detection of
abnormal PrP in milk. Research is under way to develop tests to
screen for the possible presence of abnormal prion protein (PrP) in
milk samples from cattle experimentally infected with BSE [A joint
FSA/SEAC milk working group is monitoring and providing advice on
this research carried out at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.]
These modified tests may also be applicable to human milk. However,
it is not yet clear when/if a reliable test will be available.
3. A small number of breast milk banks in the UK supply highly
vulnerable premature babies for whom no milk may be available from
the mother. A model developed by the Department of Health to assess
the effect of pooling breast milk from multiple donors on the
possible risks of transmission of vCJD via breast milk banks was
considered.
4. There is some, albeit limited, published epidemiological and
experimental research on maternal transmission of prion diseases.
There are also unpublished surveillance data of children born to vCJD
cases from the National CJD Surveillance Unit and UK surveillance of
neurological illness in children which might inform on potential
risks of maternal transmission.
Breast milk banks:
5. There is no evidence that vCJD infectivity has ever been
transmitted through breast milk. However, a theoretical risk exists.
Modelling studies clearly show that the practice of pooling breast
milk increases the number of donors to which a recipient is exposed
and thereby increases the potential risk of an infant receiving milk
contaminated with vCJD infectivity. The theoretical risk of infection
can be minimised by not pooling the milk, by the use of individual
hand operated breast milk pumps for single donors, and by the use of
single-use sterilised bottles for collection. In addition, available
evidence suggests that infection/inflammation of the breast results
in increased lymphocytes in milk and therefore increased risk of
infectivity. This risk would be minimised if milk from donors showing
signs of infection were not used.
6. The committee suggested that, if practicable, milk could be stored
for an appropriate period of time to allow the health status of
donors to be monitored, before it is released. However, information
was not available to the committee on whether long-term storage of
human milk is detrimental to its nutritional quality. Maternal
transmission
7. There is evidence from animal studies for low-level maternal
transmission of prions in cattle and sheep. This transmission may
occur in utero, via milk and/or perinatally. However, the possibility
that this putative maternal transmission might have been due to
another mode of transmission, for example through a contaminated
environment or feed, cannot be ruled out.
8. In contrast, in humans there is no evidence for maternal
transmission in cases of familial prion disease, other than the
transfer of a mutant form of the PrP gene, and there is no evidence
of maternal transmission of Kuru [a chronic, progressive, uniformly
fatal nervous system disorder caused by prions, associated with
cannibalism among the Fore tribe and neighboring peoples in New
Guinea. - CopyEd.PG]. However, compared with other human prion
diseases vCJD may pose a greater risk because of the greater
involvement of the lymphoreticular system in vCJD pathogenesis.
Although, breast tissue (and placenta) from a single vCJD case tested
negative for PrPvCJD, transfer of infectivity to breast milk may
depend on the physiological status of the mammary gland. Similar
tests or infectivity bioassays have not been conducted on breast
tissue from lactating patients with vCJD.
9. A published study suggesting transmission of sCJD in colostrum
(ref. 1) was considered unreliable because tissues not normally
associated with high levels of infectivity (blood and placenta)
showed equivalent infectivity to that of the brain in this study.
10. Analysis of prospective surveillance data of UK children born to
mothers with, or that had subsequently developed clinical vCJD,
provide no evidence for maternal transmission of vCJD. However, the
number of cases is very small and the incubation period of vCJD, if
transmitted from mother to child, is unknown and so the children may
yet be too young to have developed symptoms.
11. The phenotype of BSE infection in humans expressing PrP genotypes
other than M/M at codon 129 is not known. Given recently published
studies in mice expressing the human PrP gene (ref. 2), which suggest
that the human PrP genotype may affect disease phenotype, the
committee considered it very important that undiagnosed neurological
diseases be carefully monitored. In this respect, amongst others, it
is recommended that the careful monitoring of neurological illnesses
through the PIND surveillance of children (ref. 3) continue.
Conclusions
12. In summary, there is currently no epidemiological evidence for
maternal transmission of vCJD, including transmission via breast
milk. However, there is a hypothetical risk. Although available
evidence is limited and mostly indirect rather than direct, this
risk, if any, appears to be low. As a risk cannot be excluded, a
watching brief should be maintained.

Removing prions that cause mad cow in humans from blood
-------------------------------------------------------
Assessing the risk of potential exposure to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD), the human form of 'mad cow disease', from blood
transfusion was the focus of the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) Advisory Committee
in Silver Spring, Maryland today. In response to the Committee's
encouragement that new technologies should be considered that might
lead to greater reduction of risk while not deferring many donors
unnecessarily, Pall Corporation presented the latest scientific data
on its new prion reduction technology.
The Leukotrap Affinity Prion Reduction Filter, expected to be
launched commercially in Europe this spring, removes infectious
prions from red cells, the most widely transfused blood component.
Prions are associated with causing vCJD and other fatal
neurodegenerative diseases, known as TSEs.
Sam Coker PhD, Principal Scientist and Technical Director of Pall
Medical, acknowledged the public health community's heightened
concern about the possibility of a 2nd wave of mad cow disease in
humans of unknown magnitude globally, including North America. Japan
is the latest nation to confirm a human case of mad cow disease.
The Pall Leukotrap Affinity Prion Reduction Filter was developed in
response to these problems as part of the Company's mission to help
ensure safety of the blood supply. It can remove leukocytes and all
types of prions -- both cell and non cell-associated -- from blood
prior to transfusion in a single step. Dr. Coker presented an
overview of the key study results that show that the novel technology
concurrently reduces leukocytes and prions with a 99 percent
reduction of the infectious agent. He concluded that the new filter
could be used to remove different strains of infectious prions,
including those that cause vCJD.
He reviewed a study that found that the new filter reduces the human
form of vCJD prions from red cells below the limit of detection of
the western blot assay, the gold standard of prion detection. He also
discussed a study with the infectious scrapie prion that causes
disease in sheep, which showed that the new filter removed all the
infectious prions below the limit of detection of the western blot
assay.
Dr. Coker described in detail an animal infectivity study comparing
filtered and unfiltered blood infected with scrapie prion. After the
300-day study, 3 of the 18 control hamsters that received the
unfiltered blood developed scrapie. Only 2 of these animals had
displayed clinical signs of the disease. None of the hamsters
receiving filtered blood developed scrapie.
