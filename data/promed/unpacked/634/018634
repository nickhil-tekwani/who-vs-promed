Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics; as of Mon 3 Nov 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 3 Nov 2003 the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This
includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought
to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as
follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK: Referrals of suspect CJD/ Deaths
of definite and probable CJD

Total / 1774 / 681 / 44 / 39 / 20 / 137 / 921
(*Provisional as of Mon 3 Nov 2003)
Summary of vCJD cases
Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 101
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 34
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 2
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 137
Alive:
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 143
The precise definitions of the terms: referrals, deaths, definite cases,
probable vCJD cases, sporadic, probable sporadic, iatrogenic, familial,
GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail
post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693].
The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 1 Dec 2003.

[Since the last monthly statistics released by the Department of Health on
Mon 6 Oct 2003, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead
and alive) and the number of deaths have not changed. The number of
probable vCJD cases still alive is also unchanged.
In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice
reported by Asante et al (MRC Prion Unit, University College, London: EMBO
Journal 2002; 21(23): 6358-68
<http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>), that:
"Some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a
disease arising from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with BSE
20021129.5921), the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added
significance in relation to the course of the vCJD outbreak and will
continued to be presented here.
vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for
methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al reported that transgenic
mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with either bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions, may develop the
neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD, consistent with these
diseases being caused by the same prion strain. However, BSE transmission
to these transgenic mice, in addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype,
also resulted in a distinct molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable
from that of sporadic CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more
than one BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore
possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD
may have a disease arising from BSE exposure.
Since Mon 6 Oct 2003 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has
increased by 4. - Mod.CP]

CJD-like disease in mice can be prevented and reversed
-------------------------------------------------------
All Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD)-like illnesses occur when normal nerve cell
proteins -- prions -- convert into an abnormal form, causing dementia and
death. Mutant mice that lacked normal prions did not get sick, researchers
found, even if abnormal prions were present. This suggests that the disease
is caused by the conversion process -- not the abnormal prions. When a
prion becomes abnormal or "rogue", scientists believe it changes all the
surrounding prions into an abnormal form as well. The result of this
process is a crippling disease which, in humans, causes a slow descent into
a vegetative state and, ultimately, death.
It has been the natural assumption that these symptoms are due to the
build-up of abnormal prions. It was thought something about them -- their
odd shape perhaps -- caused [neural cells] to degenerate. For this reason,
most research has focused on finding ways to prevent the accumulation of
abnormal prions in nerve tissue. But, when tried out on laboratory animals,
these therapies were disappointing.
Now researchers, led by John Collinge and Giovanna Mallucci of the MRC
Prion Unit, University College London [Medical Research Council Prion Unit
and Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, Queen
Square, London WC1, UK], believe previous experiments focused on the wrong
step of the process. The researchers bred a strain of mutant mice which,
after 12 weeks of age, lost their normal prions. When these mice and
ordinary mice were both infected with abnormal prions they all began to
develop a CJD-like disease. But after 12 weeks, when the mutant mice lost
their normal prions, the disease reversed -- but continued to progress in
the ordinary mice. Although abnormal prions carried on building up in their
brains, the mutant mice remained healthy, whereas the control mice all died
within 2 weeks. These results suggest that abnormal prions themselves are
not the problem -- the problem is something to do with the conversion
process between a normal prion and an abnormal prion.
Dr Mallucci and her colleagues conclude that there is a toxic intermediate
stage that is the ultimate cause of CJD-like illnesses. "The conversion
process might produce a toxic intermediate stage, or it might somehow cause
the nerve tissue to break down -- but at the moment we just don't know," Dr
Mallucci told BBC News Online. They suggest that, in the future, CJD might
be treated by therapies that target normal prions within the brain. Dr
Mallucci said: "A therapeutic strategy could involve developing a drug that
binds to normal prions, causing their depletion."

[These results are published in the 31 Oct 2003 issue of Science (Mallucci
G, Dickinson A, Linehan J, Klohn PC, Brandner S and Collinge J. Depleting
neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.
Science 2003 Oct 31; 302(5646): 871-4). The abstract of the paper reads as
follows:
The mechanisms involved in prion neurotoxicity are unclear, and therapies
preventing accumulation of PrPSc, the disease-associated form of prion
protein (PrP), do not significantly prolong survival in mice with central
nervous system prion infection. We found that depleting endogenous neuronal
PrPc in mice with established neuroinvasive prion infection reversed early
spongiform change and prevented neuronal loss and progression to clinical
disease. This occurred despite the accumulation of extraneuronal PrPSc to
levels seen in terminally ill wild-type animals. Thus, the propagation of
non-neuronal PrPSc is not pathogenic, but arresting the continued
conversion of PrPc to PrPSc within neurons during scrapie infection
prevents prion neurotoxicity. - Mod.CP]
