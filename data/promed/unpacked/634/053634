Union rebels defy 'killing for killing's sake'
---------------------------------------------
Members of the National Farmers' Union won a reprieve for tens of thousands
of their animals yesterday after defying their national leaders and
refusing to cooperate with the Government's "safety-first" cull of healthy
sheep, pigs and goats in Cumbria.
The cull is aimed at stopping the spread of the foot and mouth epidemic. The
revolt, by 1000 members of the Carlisle branch of the union, was backed by
local private vets. It plunged Ben Gill, the union's president, who had
reluctantly agreed to the cull, into an internal crisis over union policy.
The normally moderate farmers effectively joined ranks with the militant
Farmers for Action pressure group, who proclaimed that the cull meant
"all-out war" with the Government. The respected National Sheep
Association had earlier condemned the cull as "killing for killing's sake".
In a move to calm the revolt, Mr Gill urged Nick Brown, Minister of
Agriculture, to send Jim Scudamore, the Government's chief vet, on a mission
to explain the reasoning behind the precautionary cull strategy. The extra
cull was later put "on hold" until Mr Scudamore appeals to farmers' leaders
personally in Carlisle on Monday. Mr Brown said he would also visit Cumbria.
The Carlisle branch was already angered by a blunder by Mr Brown the
previous day, when he gave the impression that healthy cattle on farms
within 3 kilometres of holdings with outbreaks would also be killed. Mr
Brown publicly apologised for his gaffe yesterday. It piled pressure on Mr
Gill after he had spent more than 3 weeks persuading his members to
accept unpalatable decisions.
Yesterday, he admitted it was not under control, and criticised the blunders
by Mr Brown and the Ministry of Agriculture for adding to the "torture" of
his members. He demanded, and got, extra efforts by the ministry to
explain to farmers why it was so important to carry out the precautionary
cull. He also went out of his way to avoid condemning or approving militant
action by farmers in Cumbria to defy the extra slaughter.
Harold Armstrong, former chairman of the Cumbria branch, said: "I am not in
favour of the extra cull, although I am less opposed to it now that cattle
have been excluded." Ministry vets want to carry out the precautionary cull
of sheep that could be harbouring the foot and mouth virus but not showing
clinical signs. There are fears that the disease may have been in Britain
for longer than vets first supposed.

[Disease control programs in animal populations must always rely on the
support of farmers. If they do not accept the policy, then it will be
difficult to implement effectively. While a slaughter policy can sometimes
be instituted over the objections of farmers, it is much better to
convince farmer to cooperate. It appears as if agriculture officials in the
UK are trying to do just that. It is important the explanation is science
based and transparent. Moreover, it would be best if support for the
reasonableness of the policy extends to veterinarians in the field as well
as technical and academic positions.
The conflict between farmers views and optimal animal disease control
tactics is hardly new. Slaughter of herds was touch on by Plato, who
suggests something to the effect that we should "bear the knife quickly,
else the herd be lost". Cal Schwabe tells the story of how the
implementation of the bovine tuberculosis slaughter campaign in Iowa, over
60 years ago, was resisted until the head of a farmer's group changed his
stance 180 degrees when his young daughter was diagnosed with tuberculosis,
most probably contracted from their own TB infected herd.
Some people have estimated that killing of some 30 percent of "in contact"
herds/flocks is to be expected in FMD epidemics if the disease is to be
stopped quickly. This does not help a shepherd faced with the imminent
death of his flock.
The key decision for a successful depopulation policy is to kill enough
animals to control the disease but not to slaughter animals unnecessarily.
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is usually only truly known by
hindsight. This must be a time full of difficult decisions. Much is at
stake,the information available is often imperfect and time is of the
essence. We can only encourage everyone to support the people on the ground
actually dealing with the outbreak and reiterate the importance of obtaining
the support of the farmers by explaining the rationale for disease control
actions. Unfortunately, right now that support appears to require some
shoring up. Again, we see that disease control is never devoid of politics,
economics and social values. - Mod.PC.
