Pet rats transmit cowpox to humans
----------------------------------
Keepers of pet rats are at risk of infection with cowpox virus in
parts of Germany --North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Bavaria -- and in
northern France infections of humans with cowpox virus have recently
been confirmed. The virus is thought to be transmitted through direct
contact with rats, kept as pets. Infected humans show flu-like
symptoms and rash. If an infection in humans occurs the typical signs
are flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and itchy rashes and
blisters of the skin. The rashes heal after several weeks, leaving
crusts and scars. Often the virus causes conjunctivitis. Especially
when these signs of an infection are seen patients are advised to see
their doctor, the National Office for Nature, Environment and
Consumer Protection, North Rhine-Westphalia (LANUV) says.

If the infection is confirmed any further spread of the virus is to
be avoided. In particular, existing blisters should be covered, until
the scab has fallen off. Cowpox virus transmission between humans has
not been proven and is considered unusual. The LANUV recommends not
buying pet rats at present. If animals have been bought recently the
owners should have them examined by a veterinarian, especially when
the animals show lesions on their feet, ears, or tail. Pet rat owners
are advised to wear protective gloves when handling the animals to
protect against infection.

According to findings of the competent health authorities of North
Rhine-Westphalia there is a link between the disease of people from
North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, and northern France. The authorities
report that all pet shops from where the infected animals have been
bought, apparently acquired the rats from the same wholesaler in the
Czech Republic. For more information [in German], see the websites of
LANUV NRW <http://www.lanuv.nrw.de/> and the National Institute for
Health and Work NRW (<http://www.liga.nrw.de/>).

[Sabine Zentis supplied the following additional information:

"According to the RKI (Robert Koch Institut) so far 8 human cases
have been confirmed
<http://www.fli.bund.de/253.html?&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=688&cHash=713bec3ad6>.
Since the beginning of 2008 an increasing number of humans have been
infected with cowpox virus in the Rhineland region of North
Rhine-Westphalia. Investigations revealed that all these patients had
acquired pet rats prior to becoming ill. Recently various [states]
(Bundeslaender) (Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia) reported human
infections with cowpox virus through contact with infected pet rats.
For a long time such infections occurred only sporadically in single
cases, however, at present an increase in numbers of infection
associated with infected pet rats is noted. Cowpox in animals is a
notifiable disease in Germany. Cowpox virus and similar pathogens
such as monkey pox or the smallpox virus of humans (variola virus)
belong to the Genus _Orthopoxvirus_, _family of _Poxviridae_).
Monkeypox and cowpox viruses can pass from animals to humans and are
zoonoses. Cowpox virus can occur in a number of host animals,
although small rodents are regarded a natural virus reservoir. From
this reservoir the virus can spread to numerous other species such as
cattle, cats, and zoo animals (such as, large cats, elephants,
rhinoceros). In certain regions in up to 5 percent of domesticated
cats have antibodies to cowpox virus.

The infection of humans is acquired through even the smallest skin
lesions or mucous membranes during intensive contact with an infected
animal (such as in cattle over milking). Therefore, contact with
infected animals or animals suspected of being infected should be
performed with great care, taking appropriate protective measures.
The severity of infection varies with the animal species involved and
the immune status and ranges from subclinical disease to minor skin
lesions to systemic infection with involvement of numerous organ
systems. After an incubation period of about 3-7 days, in some cases
even up to 14 days, the clinical symptoms seen are the typical
lesions of the skin (rashes, blisters), fatigue, raised temperature,
and conjunctivitis. In severe cases an infection of the lungs
resulting in virus-associated pneumonia can be seen. Secondary
bacterial infections can have an additional negative impact and can
lead to complications.

Very little is known about the course of infection in rats. Rashes
and blisters can be observed (see article in the Deutsches
Tieraerzteblatt 03/2009, at
<http://www.bundestieraerztekammer.de/download/dtb0309_kuhpocken.pdf>
[in German]), but also serious disease leading to the death of the
animal can occur. It should be noted that even animals without
obvious symptoms can excrete the virus and thus can infect other
animals or humans."

[Cowpox virus and monkeypox virus are misnomers, rodents being the
predominant host of both viruses. As indicated by the information
above human cowpox is a rare zoonotic infection, evoking a
self-limiting disease, except in the case of immunocompromised and
eczematous patients, particularly children, where it can become
severe. Cowpox virus, is distributed in Europe, western parts of the
former Soviet Union, and adjacent areas of Northern and Central Asia,
with an increasing number of reports in Europe. Sequencing data have
revealed considerable diversity among isolates of cowpox virus. -
