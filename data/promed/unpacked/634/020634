We don't know enough from the reports of this outbreak to blame the maker
of the punch. Before we do that, review the following:
Shih RD, Marcus SM, Genese CA, et al. "Methemoglobinemia Attributable to
Nitrite Contamination of Potable Water Through Boiler Fluid Additives-New
Jersey, 1992 and 1996." MMWR (1997) 46(09):207-204.

[The previous posting said, "Toxic levels of a common color additive or
preservative used in meat and fish were found in punch served at a weekend
wedding in Ankeny at which dozens became ill, state health department
officials said Monday."
However, the MMWR report observes that certain city potable water may be at
fault. This reader suggests the investigators should consider contaminated
potable city water as a possible source of the nitrite.
Extracted from the referenced MMWR:
The 2 episodes described in this report resulted from ingestion of water
originating from potable municipal sources but that had become
cross-contaminated with boiler fluid because of defective backflow valves.
This potential mechanism for nitrite exposure has not been widely
recognized. The boiler fluids probably refluxed when the boilers were
started, thereby generating high pressure and fluid reflux into the
buildings' water systems. Although most municipalities have regulations
requiring backflow valves on boilers to prevent such incidents in large
buildings (7), there are no provisions for routine inspection and
replacement of these valves. Building managers and personnel who service
boilers should be informed about the potential problem and the need to turn
off boilers during servicing to ensure a reverse pressure gradient is not
produced. In addition, backflow valves should be inspected routinely to
ensure proper operation, and conditioner fluid containers should include
warning labels with specific instructions for replacing fluid and for
proper operation of the safety valve backflow mechanism. - Mod.TG]
