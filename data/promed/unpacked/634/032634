Shareholders in Petro Matad Limited, the explorer targeting frontier
lands on the Mongolian-Chinese border, must be wondering what next
will come between them and the company's 1st well on the Davsan
Tolgoi prospect. First, it was an unusually long and severe winter
that forced a suspension of operations on Block XX in Mongolia; now
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has led to a blanket
vehicle and personnel movement ban in the Dornod Aimag province, site
of the DT-1 well site.

[Obtaining FMD-related information from an oil-and-gas producers'
web-site is not commonplace; this is another demonstration of the
possible economic implications related to outbreaks caused by this
extremely infectious virus which can also be transmitted on fomites
including clothing, footwear, vehicles etc.

Mongolia's Veterinary Services have a longstanding reputation of
effectively controlling epizootics. The official Mongolian policy
regarding FMD allows vaccination when necessary. Hence, observed FMD
cases in wildlife in 2009 were followed by selective (probably
regional) vaccination of domestic animals. According to OIE's data,
81 622 camels (29.67 percent of their total national number), 273 678
cattle (10.61 percent), 668 858 goats (3.44 percent) and 660 021
sheep (3.45 percent) were vaccinated during 2009.

When the current FMD epizootic was discovered in Dornod at the end of
April 2010, severe quarantine measures, as are also apparent from the
above newswire, were immediately applied. They were combined with
ring vaccinations or revaccinations around the infected farms. In OIE
terminology: "vaccination in response to the outbreak."

For comparison: in Japan, where the official policy is "Vaccination
prohibited," the decision to apply "vaccination in response to the
outbreak" was taken a month after the discovery of the disease. -
