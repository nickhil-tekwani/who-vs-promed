The mysterious disease of the fishermen has reappeared in Thiaroye
----------------------------------------
In the suburbs of Dakar, the "mysterious disease of the fishermen of Thiaroye" has reappeared. Last year [2020], in the same period, several hundred fishermen returning from the sea noticed strange symptoms: pimples [pustules?], fever, itching, among other symptoms. These symptoms have reappeared in the middle of the 1st week of November [2021].

Like last year [2020], Mamadou Diallo, a fisherman from Thiaroye, had to stop working when he noticed the symptoms of the mysterious disease.

"The 1st signs were small pimples on my arms, then on my nails, then pus started oozing... It was also on my private parts! That's when I stopped working," he says. "I'm still scared, because we're not used to seeing this type of disease: all my private parts are infected."

More than 80 fishermen are affected by the disease, according to Moustapha Diop, a coordinator of the local artisanal fishing council of Pikine: "What we can do is take them to the hospital and treat them and alert the authorities. What we expect from the State is financial support. If the disease continues it will deplete all of us as we will run out of money."

Investigations are underway, conducted by several institutes, including the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer), the anti-poison center of Dakar and the oceanographic research center in Dakar-Thiaroye. Patrice Brehmer, a researcher at the Institute of Research Development (IRD), based at the sub-regional fisheries commission, points out some projections: "Some bio-toxins have been identified. They are not the types of bio-toxins that produce the symptoms observed, but we cannot exclude that a combination of the 2 bio-toxins found could lead to these kinds of symptoms."

Additional samples will be taken on [8 Nov 2021] to try to identify the species of toxic microalgae in question.

[Apparently, the fishermen were suffering the same skin lesions as they did last year (2020, see Undiagnosed skin disease - Senegal (04): chickenpox susp. comment, RFI 20201207.8000233). Last year (2020), chickenpox and monkeypox were suspected based on the appearance of the skin lesions. The possibility of a marine toxin was also raised, and ProMED received the following response to a request for information: "The report of skin lesions, conjunctival swelling, and headaches in the affected fishermen could be caused by exposure to _Pfiesteria_ toxin. _Pfiesteria_ is a genus of heterotrophic dinoflagellates that has been associated with harmful algal blooms and fish kills. _Pfiesteria_ has a worldwide distribution.

_Pfiesteria_-human illness syndrome is characterized by skin lesions, headache, myalgias, conjunctival irritation, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, secretory diarrhea, recent memory loss, and difficulties with number sequencing.

The above report also suspects marine bio-toxins. ProMED would appreciate learning of any results of further investigations. - Mod.TY
