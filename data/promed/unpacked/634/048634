Germany detects H5N1 bird flu in 2 dead ducks
------------------
Two ducks found dead near Munich in southern Germany tested positive
for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus and a 3rd was contaminated with a
milder strain, a state laboratory said.
The 3 ducks were found dead near Speichersee, a lake to the northeast
of Munich, Elke Reinking, spokeswoman for the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, said on Friday. The surrounding area
would be searched for any other dead birds.
Last year, some 13 European Union member states had confirmed cases
of bird flu -- Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Britain, the
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, France and Hungary.
More than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year, in
most cases involving wild birds.
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed nearly 200 people out of over 300
known cases, according to the World Health Organisation. None of the
victims were from Europe.
