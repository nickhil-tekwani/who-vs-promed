Health officials fight outbreak of pertussis
-------------------------------------
Whooping cough cases are on the rise in Texas, and health officials in
Comal County are trying to stem an outbreak in which 5 children have
recently come down with the disease and 5 others may have it.
"We've taken a real aggressive stance to try to keep it from getting out of
control," said Comal County health nurse Karon Preiss. She said
information has been sent home with schoolchildren, and doctors have been
asked to be on the lookout for symptoms.
Since January 2001, 9 children in Texas have died of the disease. A total
of 615 cases were reported in Texas that year, the most since 1968. This
year, 766 cases already have been reported.
The number of reported cases is unusually high, according to David Bastis,
a program director in the immunization division of the Texas Department of
Health. "Usually we see no deaths or one death," he said.

[The number of cases and deaths in this continuing outbreak of pertussis is
quite noteworthy. It would be very informative to know the age and
immunization status of pertussis cases, particularly of the fatalities, as
well as the entire cohort of cases. Generally, 2 different circumstances
are noted: children who were never adequately immunized against pertussis
and those (often older children or adolescents) in whom the immunity of the
primary series they had received has waned. In both circumstances, it is
common that adults with more atypical pertussis represent the reservoir to
infect the children. In addition to reaching 100 percent childhood
immunization, immunization of adults with the acellular pertussis vaccine,
reasonably well tolerated in this group (unlike the old killed whole cell
product), may be the answer.
This reference with abstract is an example of one study from Australia that
demonstrated the utility of the product in adults:
Turnbull FM, Heath TC, Jalaludin BB, et al:A randomized trial of two
acellular pertussis vaccines (dTpa and pa) and a licensed
diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (Td) in adults. Vaccine 2000; 19:628-36
Abstract: A single blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the
reactogenicity and immunogenicity of adult formulated dTpa and monovalent
pa vaccines with a licensed Td vaccine. 548 healthy adults aged 19-70 years
received a single injection of dTpa or separate injections of pa or Td
(with the alternate vaccine 1 month later). Local and systemic reactions
were monitored for 15 days after each vaccination. Serum antibody levels
were measured immediately prior to and 1 month after vaccination. Antibody
levels were measured 12 months after vaccination in 100 subjects. There was
no difference in the total frequency of symptoms and signs between subjects
receiving any of the three vaccines. There was a significantly lower
incidence of local reactions following pa (60 percent) than dTpa (80
percent, P=0.002) or Td (93 percent, P=0.0008). The incidence of clinically
significant (Grade 2 or 3) swelling (> or =20 mm) was higher for Td (20
percent, P=0.002) than for dTpa (11 percent) or for pa (2 percent),
however, there were no other significant differences in the incidence of
Grade 2 or 3 reactions between the vaccines. A high anti-pertussis
seroconversion rate (>97 percent) against all the studied pertussis
antigens was seen 1 month after vaccination with dTpa and pa. A total of 96
and 99 percent of subjects receiving dTpa and Td, respectively, had
anti-diphtheria titres > or =0.01 IU/ml, and all but one subject had
anti-tetanus titres > or =0.1 IU/ml after 1 month. Twelve months after
vaccination the majority (90-100 percent) of the subjects were still
seropositive for each antigen and although GMTs had decreased they were
substantially higher than pre-vaccination levels. The dTpa vaccine was well
tolerated and capable of eliciting an immune response against all the
antigens in a broad spectrum of the adult population and could potentially
replace Td for routine boosters in adults. - Mod.LL]
[Information on the age distribution and vaccination histories of the
reported cases of pertussis in Texas was not available on the Texas State
Department of Health webpages on
pertussis. <http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/immunize/pertussis.htm> There is
mention that 30 percent of the reported cases in 2002 were in children less
than 1 year of age. There was a report available online that suggested
that several of the fatal cases were below one month of age and that the
index case in these households was probably an adult. More information on
the epidemiology of this increase in pertussis cases in Texas would be
appreciated from official sources. One does wonder if the shortage of
vaccine experienced in the earlier part of this year may have contributed
to this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
