Hundreds have flooded hospital in Andhra Pradesh since Saturday night [5 Dec 2020] following the outbreak of a mysterious disease in Eluru city. While the mystery disease has baffled health experts, a preliminary analysis of test reports has established the role of chemical substances found in pesticides in the illness leaving 1 dead.

Multiple teams of experts from premier scientific institutions of the country who are on to the job to determine the exact cause of the illnesses in Eluru city of Andhra Pradesh are probing the role of organochlorine substances in the illness in Eluru, news agency PTI reported.

Organochlorine pesticides are chlorinated hydrocarbons used in agriculture and mosquito control. The compounds include DDT which is widely used in anti-mosquito fogging [in this particular area].

On the role of organochlorine in being the illness-triggering agent, an official told PTI, "Mostly yes, but we are waiting for the laboratory report (for confirmation).

With water contamination ruled out as the cause of the disease spread, and also other tests turned out normal, the medical teams are now focusing on other chemical agents possibly leading to the outbreak.

Water and milk samples were sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad for analysis of heavy metal content, sources in the Medical and Health Department had said.

Vice President Secretariat said on Monday [7 Dec 2020] the Centre is rushing a 3-member team of medical experts to Eluru in Andhra Pradesh.

A Vice President Secretariat statement said the Union Health Ministry was informed Dr Jamshed Nayar, an associate professor (emergency medicine) from AIIMS; Dr Avinash Deoshtawar, a virologist from the National Institute of Virology, Pune; and Dr Sanket Kulkarni, the deputy director and a public health expert from the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi, are being sent to Eluru.

A team from the Indian Council of Medical Research is also expected.

Andhra Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday [7 Dec 2020] visited the Government General Hospital in Eluru and spoke to the affected persons, assuring them all help.

Addressing a high-level review meeting later, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the officials to be on alert and be prepared to handle any situation.

So far, 263 people have been discharged from hospital after treatment while another 171 have been admitted as in-patients. Another 17 patients were referred to hospitals in Vijayawada and Guntur for better medicare, according to official data.

The disease, which first surfaced in the One-Town area in Eluru city, later spread to the adjoining rural parts of Eluru and Denduluru, though the number of affected there was far less.

Earlier, the mystery disease saw people suddenly falling unconscious after suffering from fits [seizures] and nausea. The symptoms, according to GGH doctors, included a bout of epilepsy for 3-5 minutes, memory loss for a few minutes, anxiety, vomiting, headache and back pain. The disease claimed the life of a 45-year-old on Sunday [6 Dec 2020].

As per a report presented by West Godavari district Collector R Mutyalaraju, the precise cause of the disease could not be established yet as blood tests and CT (brain) scans showed everything as normal.

A mystery disease affecting 450 persons in Andhra Pradesh's Eluru town till now, was likely caused by chemical substances found in pesticides and widely used in anti-mosquito fogging, preliminary analysis of various test reports indicate.

The mystery disease symptoms of which included nausea, fainting, and fits [seizures] baffled health experts and the government alike and took at least 1 life while landing as many as 450 people in hospitals.

Multiple teams of experts from premier scientific institutions of the country are on to the job to determine the exact cause of the disease.

Preliminary analysis of various test reports have almost established the role of organochlorine substances in the [disease].

Organochlorine pesticides are chlorinated hydrocarbons used in agriculture and mosquito control. The compounds include DDT which is widely used in anti-mosquito fogging [in India].

"Mostly yes, but we are waiting for the laboratory report (for confirmation)," a top official of the Medical and Health Department told PTI here on Monday [7 Dec 2020], when asked about organochlorine being the disease-triggering agent.

With water contamination ruled out as the cause of the disease spread, and also other tests turning out normal, the medical teams are now focusing on other chemical agents which could have led to the outbreak.

Teams of experts from the National Institute of Nutrition and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad reached Eluru on Monday [7 Dec 2020] and collected various samples for analysis.

Water and milk samples were also sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad for analysis of heavy metal content, sources in the Medical and Health Department said.

With all the incoming patients turning negative for coronavirus, the authorities have heaved a sigh of relief.

BJP MP [Bharatiya Janata Party member of parliament] GVL Narasimha Rao, after talking to experts at the AIIMS, New Delhi, was the first to suspect that poisonous organochlorine substances could be the most likely cause of the mysterious disease.

WHO expert team in Eluru
------------------------
On the request of the state government, a team of experts from the World Health Organisation in New Delhi, as well as another team drafted by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will be arriving in Eluru on Tuesday [8 Dec 2020] "on an urgent visit" for a study and possibly determine the cause of the mysterious disease.

India is rushing a team of medical experts to southern Andhra Pradesh state after a 'mystery' illness killed one and sent hundreds to hospital.

An MP from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said preliminary blood tests have revealed high amounts of lead and nickel.

Patients showed a wide range of symptoms from nausea to fits [seizures] and fainting, doctors said.

This comes as India battles a pandemic, with a high coronavirus caseload.

Andhra Pradesh has been one of the worst-affected states -- at more than 800 000, it has the country's 3rd-highest case count.

But COVID-19 doesn't appear to be the cause of the hospitalisations over the weekend [5-6 Dec 2020]. The state Health Minister, Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, said all the patients had tested negative for coronavirus.

Mr Srinivas said the patients' blood samples did not reveal any evidence of a viral infection.

"We ruled out water contamination or air pollution as the cause after officials visited the areas where people fell sick," he said. "It is some mystery illness and only lab analysis will reveal what it is."

However, BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao sent a text message to local journalists saying preliminary blood tests, conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Aiims) in Delhi, had showed most of the samples contained lead, nickel, and other heavy metals.

A statement released by the Indian health ministry said that Vice President Venkaiah Naidu spoke to the director of Aiims, India's leading public hospital, and was informed experts in poison control were in touch with doctors in Eluru town, where most of the illnesses occurred.

Officials said so far 500 cases were recorded -- 300 of them had been discharged and 19 were moved to other hospitals in the state for better treatment.

Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy visited the Eluru Government Hospital and met patients undergoing treatment.

Experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) are also expected to arrive in Eluru for further investigations, medical officials have told media.

The opposition Telugu Desam Party has demanded an inquiry into the incident, insisting that contamination was the cause of the mystery illness.

[While the number of affected individuals seems to be fluctuating, it also appears many have been discharged, and hopefully are improving.

It seems organochlorine may be the culprit. While many articles have mentioned this chemical, there have not been any indicating what tests were performed or the levels of the chemical found within the affected individuals. What is interesting is organochlorine can accumulate over time, so why are all of these individuals just now being affected? Or did they recently get a very high exposure? Information from knowledgeable sources in the area will be appreciated.

Extracted from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/organochlorine:
"Organochlorines (OCs) are organic compounds that contain at least one covalently bonded chlorine atom. Synthetic OCs include a number of EDCs [Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals?] such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) along with its metabolites (especially dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene or DDE). Although the use of many OCs has been outlawed or restricted in most countries for several decades, OCs are generally stable molecules that bioaccumulate within organisms and biomagnify through food webs. They are therefore classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and can still be detected at appreciable concentrations both in the environment and in organisms, especially at high latitudes and high elevations (due to the grasshopper effect, discussed above). The number of chlorine atoms in an OC molecule is positively correlated to its half-life and thus inversely correlated to its rate of metabolism or degradation, such that highly chlorinated compounds are more likely to persist in the environment than OCs with fewer chlorines. Conversely, less chlorinated compounds are selectively depleted as OCs travel toward the poles and through food webs." - Mod.TG]

[Andhra Pradesh is a state in the southeastern coastal region of India. Eluru is a city and the district headquarters of West Godavari district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluru).
