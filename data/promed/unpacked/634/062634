Rabies was confirmed at autopsy in an elderly Houston (Texas) man who died
on October 17, 1997. The man had a history of contact with a bat in
northeast Texas on August 3, 1997, but he did not seek medical care then.
The onset of symptoms occurred October 3rd with left-sided facial and neck
pain. Subtle behavioral changes began October 5th. He was examined by
medical personnel as an outpatient on October 6th and 7th, before being
admitted to a hospital on October 8th. After becoming comatose on October
11th, he was supported by a respirator until his death.
The CDC has sequenced the specimen and it differs by only 1% from viruses
found in human cases associated with the silver-haired bat. Of the five
cases of human rabies in Texas since 1990, this is the third case
associated with a bat strain of rabies viruses.
One of the other two cases was also attributed to the silver-haired bat
rabies virus strain. This case was from northeast Texas and had no history
of a bat exposure. The other case was from south Texas, involving a known
bat bite and the Mexican free-tailed bat strain of rabies virus.
Forty-one individuals from the case's community, family, and medical care
staff have been offered post exposure rabies prophylaxis. Another 135
persons have been interviewed and were determined not to have been exposed.

[Thanks for this excellent report. We have several postings on human
exposure to rabies, lately. A concurrent posting containing data from the
GIDEON software indicates that 15 of 17 indigenous acquired cases in the
United States come from bat exposures, with only one being from a bite.
Yet, the general public thinks that exposure comes from a bite, usually a
dog or wildlife. What public health message should we put out concerning
bat exposure? - Mod.PC
