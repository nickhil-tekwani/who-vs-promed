FAIRFIELD HOSPITAL (MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA) CLOSURE (3)
=====================================================
Re: Closure of Fairfield Hospital:
Thanks for putting this news item on the ProMED network.
Closing Fairfield Hospital could either advance infectious disease
care and research, or be a disaster for those disciplines, depending
on how the State Government manages the closure. The closure impacts
on Macfarlane Burnet Centre, because although the Centre is a private
organization, it will need to move also, to be close to patients with
infectious diseases.
Letters to the Health Minister, Hon. Marie Tehan, will probably be
useful. They should stress the international reputation and
contributions of Fairfield Hospital and Macfarlane Burnet Centre, the
importance of keeping the critical mass of clinicians,
epidemiologists, diagnostic laboratorians, and basic researchers
together, and the importance of having first-rate infectious disease
facilities available to deal with outbreaks of new and old infectious
diseases.
To be most effective, letters should be short and on institutional
letterhead. In view of the very rapid rate at which events are
occurring, faxes to the Health Minister are preferable to letters.

I'm happy to answer questions.
