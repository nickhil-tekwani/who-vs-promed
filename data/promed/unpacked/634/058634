During the period from 1987 to 1998, 13 cases of human sporotrichosis were
recorded at the Research Center Evandro Chagas Hospital (CPqHEC) in Rio de
Janeiro. Two of these patients related scratch by a sick cat. During the
subsequent period from July 1998 to July 2000, 66 human, 117 cats and 7
dogs with sporotrichosis were diagnosed at the CPqHEC. Fifty-two humans
(78.8 percent) reported contact with cats with sporotrichosis, and 31 (47
percent) of them reporting a history of a scratch or bite. This epidemic,
unprecedented in the literature, involving cats, dogs and human beings may
have started insidiously before 1998.
Sporotrichosis is a mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus _Sporothrix
schenckii_, which can infect many different animal species, including
humans. The most frequent clinical presentation of the disease in humans
and animals is the cutaneous form with or without regional lymphatic
involvement. Following traumatic implantation in the skin this organism can
cause cutaneous or subcutaneous infection which commonly shows lymphatic
spread. Occasionally, however, the fungus may be inhaled causing infection
in the lungs and, in predisposed individuals, may disseminate to other
organs, mainly joints, bones and central nervous system.
_S. schenckii_ occurs worldwide growing saprophytically as a mold in
association with dead or decaying plant material. So far the fungus has
been isolated as a saprophyte from decomposing organic matter, decaying
vegetation, such as thorns, straw, hay, wood and soil. For this reason,
sporotrichosis is considered to be acquired during outdoor leisure
activities or as an occupational hazard for many kind of workers such as:
farmers, florists, gardeners, etc. whose occupation brings them into
frequent and sometimes traumatic contact with plant material or soil.
Occasionally, transmission of feline sporotrichosis to humans has been
reported and, veterinarians, technicians, and cat owners or caregivers are
currently considered to be new categories at risk to acquire the mycosis.
Although sporotrichosis may be suggested by the presence of fungal
structures in tissues or exudates by direct examination, the definitive
diagnosis of _Sporothrix_ infection requires isolation of the organism in
culture at 25oC and its conversion to yeast-like form at 37oC.
Sporotrichosis is the most common subcutaneous mycosis in Latin America. In
Brazil, sporotrichosis has been reported since 1907 by Lutz and Splendore,
especially in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.

[In the USA we often think of cutaneous sporotrichosis as a gardener's
disease, especially when the patient has been working among rose bushes or
other thorny plants. This is an interesting article that reminds us of
potential exposures involving cats, and suggests that this may be a more
common exposure that previously recognized in some locations.
The interested reader is also directed to the Spanish language literature
in which exposure to armadillos has been shown to be quite common in
patients with sporotrichosis in Uruguay (Conti Diaz, I. 1987.
Esporotricosis. Rev Med Uruguay. 3:135-47). The organism, which is widely
distributed in nature, has at the case report level caused human infections
following rodent bites (Saravanakumar PS, Eslami P, Zar FA. 1996.
Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis associated with a squirrel bite: case report
and review. Clin Infect Dis. 23:647-8; Frean JA, Isaacson M, Miller GB,
Mistry BD, Heney C. 1991. Sporotrichosis following a rodent bite. A case
report. Mycopathologia. 116:5-8; Fischman O, Alchorne MM, Portugal MA.
1973. Human sporotrichosis following rat bite. Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo.
15:99-102).
We would be interested to know if there are additional documented animals
that have transmitted this infection to humans. - Mods.ES/DS]
