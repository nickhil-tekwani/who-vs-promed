Saskatchewan: Province Leads Nation in Number of Human Cases
------------------------------------------------------------
Experts say there is no easy explanation behind a sudden jump [in the
number of] probable human cases of West Nile virus infection in
Saskatchewan this summer, and point instead to the unpredictable nature of
the virus. "I don't think it is really easy to say," said deputy medical
health officer Dr. Eric Young. "We've been looking at our mosquito
populations. The counts are generally low in the province -- lower than
they usually are."
His comments come after health officials announced on Mon 18 Aug 2003 that
they are looking into 6 more probable cases of West Nile virus infection in
the human population and are conducting several investigations. That means
there are now 2 confirmed and 7 probable cases as well as 4 more needing
further investigation, for a total of 13. There have been only 3 other
confirmed or probable cases of the virus across the country -- one in
Alberta and 2 in the Ottawa area.
The medical community says it has no concrete explanation as to why
Saskatchewan appears to lead the nation in infection rates. Experts are
still trying to get a handle on the [problem]. Dr. Harvey Artsob, the chief
of zoonotic diseases at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg,
said a number of factors could be at play -- the types of mosquitoes
found on the prairies, their life cycles, and the amount of time the virus
has had to build up.
There were 416 probable or confirmed human cases of West Nile virus
infection in Canada in 2002 and 20 deaths attributed to the virus. All
deaths occurred in Ontario and Quebec. It could be that more people in
those areas are heeding West Nile virus warnings where they hadn't before,
Artsob said. He also suggested that birds may be building up immunity to
the virus in areas where it has been around for longer.
Once the mosquito season is over, surveys can be done in different areas to
take into account all factors, including ecology and the methods used by
local officials to control bug populations. For now, experts point to the way
the virus has progressed in the USA for some sort of explanation. Colorado,
for example, had only 14 cases of human West Nile virus infection in 2002.
In 2003 thus far, that state is one of the hardest hit, with local officials
reporting close to 400 human cases and 7 deaths. Yet states that have been
hit hard by the virus in the past, such as Michigan and Illinois, have shown
lower numbers in 2003.
Birds play a pivotal role in the build-up of the virus in an area. Early in
the season, mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected birds. The
mosquitoes then transmit the infection to other birds, building up a
critical mass of virus in an area. Mosquitoes also transmit the virus to
humans, although in most cases an infected person's symptoms are so mild as
to be undetectable.

[It may be relevant that Saskatchewan is due north of Colorado, the area of
the USA hit hardest this year with human cases, whereas in 2002 it was
Ontario, due north of Illinois and Louisiana, the areas in the USA hardest
hit in 2002. - Mod.MPP]
