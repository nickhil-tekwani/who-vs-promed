From: "Dr. Oscar Pedro Larghi" <oplarghi@pinos.com>

Three days ago, "Diario El Bolson" published declarations of a member of
the "IV Area Sanitaria" in Argentina, concerning the isolation of rabies
virus from a _Tadarida brasiliensis_ [free-tail bat. According to the
newspaper, this person had [said that rabies in insectivorous bats is not
of much concern because [these bats do not attack humans. Reports from
other countries indicate differently (J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996,
209:2031-2044; Epidemiol Infect 1994. 113:501-511).
El Bolson is a town in Patagonia where many cases of [infection with a
hantavirus have been identified. Furthermore, person-to-person
transmission [of hantavirus infection is suspected in cases originating in
this area.
Now rabies virus has been isolated from a bat found in the Pediatric Ward
of "Hospital El Bolson". [Apparently public health officials are trying
to [minimize the [significance of the [rabies case.
This is the first confirmed case of [bat rabies in Patagonia. Rabies
virus in the brain of the bat was identified by direct FA, mouse
inoculation, virus-neutralization at the Pasteur Institute, Buenos Aires.
The antigenicity, tested by a set of monoclonal antibodies provided by
[Jean Smith, CDC, differs slightly from [that of isolates previously
reported from Argentina and Chile (J Vet Med B, 41: 153-160, 1994 and June
1997).
[Not many diseases inspire the panic rabies does. Even well-meaning people
sometimes make unscientific choices when informing the public about rabies.
It is when such people attempt to obfuscate the situation by not fully
informing the public that confusion arises. However, this simply leads to
further questions and red faces. Before I edited the message from Oscar
Larghi (apologies if I have changed the meaning) I had to remove some
statements that might have been interpreted as indicating that Argentine
Government officials were withholding information. We are certain that
those officials, given time to confer with knowledgeable scientists such as
Oscar Larghi, will provide the people of Argentina and the scientific
community as a whole a full and proper explanation of the significance of
the occurrence of this rabies virus isolate in Patagonia. In all, the
Government of Argentina will need to "come clean" with respect not only to
rabies in Argentina but to hantavirus infections as well. It may not only
be the free-tail bat itself that is a problem but the bats with which they
cohabit, including vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_), if I recall
correctly. Perhaps someone expert in this field would be kind enough to
comment? Oscar? Jean? --Mod CHC
