Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been diagnosed in
306 patients (including 9 children) since the beginning of 2006. This
is 26 per cent more than for the same period of 2005, according to
Leonid Korobov of the Bashkortostan Centre for Hygiene and
Epidemiology. All affected persons had contracted infection during
visits to the countryside involving forest walks or fishing trips in
[unsupervised] locations.
The patients are predominantly inhabitants of the cities of Ufa,
Ufimskiy, Iglinskiy, Blagoveshchenskiy, Birskiy and Nurimanivskiy in
the Gafurijskiy district located along the course of the rivers
Belaya and Ufa. All affected individuals have been admitted to
hospital for appropriate treatment.
According to Leonid Korobov, an increase in HFRS cases in the
Republic had occurred at the end of June [2006] as predicted from the
increased density of the red field vole population (the vector of the
disease) in comparison with the same period in the preceding year.
Korobov observed that early initiation of rodent control measures
around dwellings and adjacent land had contained the vole population
to some extent, and 2 million roubles (USD 7400) had been allocated
for this purpose. However, natural and climatic conditions in 2006,
including the absence of spring floods, had reduced the effectiveness
of rodent control measures in reducing the vole population. Deciduous
woods occupy 37 per cent of the territory of Bashkortostan and act as
natural foci of HFRS infection.
Infection occurs by exposure to rodent detritus, contaminated
vegetation and even dust, and not by direct transmission from person
to person. There is no preventive vaccine for HFRS. The peak of the
disease outbreak is expected to be September and October.
The most dangerous complication of HFRS is acute renal insufficiency.
Accordingly, special facilities are being arranged for patients
requiring kidney dialysis in all hospitals in the Republic.
Over the past 52 years, the peak of HFRS infection occurred in 1997
when 9500 cases were diagnosed and treated; there were 30 fatalities
that year. In 2005 more than 2300 persons were infected and 5 patients died.

[The total area of the Republic of Bashkortostan is 143 000 sq. km
(0.8 percent of the total area of Russia) and its capital is
Ufa. Bashkortostan occupies a large part of the Southern Urals, and
adjoining it are plains. In the north, Bashkortostan borders on the
Perm and Sverdlovsk regions; in the east the Chelyabinsk region; in
the southeast, the south and southwest, the Orenburg region; in the
west the Republic of Tatarstan; and in the northwest, the Udmurt
Republic. - Mod.NP]
[The genus _Hantavirus_ is one of the 5 genera comprising the family
_Bunyaviridae_, a group of negative-stranded RNA viruses with
tripartite genomes. The hosts of hantaviruses are primarily rodents,
and each genetically distinct hantavirus is usually associated with a
single rodent species. Hantaviruses cause persistent non-pathogenic
infections of their rodent hosts. Human infection is incidental to
viral survival and is almost always a dead end in the infection
chain. Unlike viruses of the other genera of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, the hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods.
The virus responsible for these outbreaks of HFRS in the
Bashkortostan Republic is likely to belong to the species Puumala
virus, which is a member of the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. A general description of hantaviruses can be accessed at
