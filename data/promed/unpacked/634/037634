[2] Diagnostic testing
Date: Fri 14 Jun 2019

Sharp TM, Fischer M, Munoz-Jordan JL, et al. Dengue and Zika Virus Diagnostic Testing for Patients with a Clinically Compatible Illness and Risk for Infection with Both Viruses.

Dengue and Zika viruses are closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses with similar transmission cycles, distribution throughout the tropics and subtropics, and disease manifestations including fever, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. For patients with suspected dengue or Zika virus disease, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred method of diagnosis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody testing can identify additional infections and remains an important tool for the diagnosis of these diseases, but interpreting the results is complicated by cross-reactivity, and determining the specific timing of infection can be difficult. These limitations are a particular challenge for pregnant women in determining whether Zika virus infection occurred during or before the pregnancy.

This report summarizes existing and new guidance on dengue and Zika virus diagnostic testing for patients with a clinically compatible illness who live in or recently traveled to an area where there is risk for infection with both viruses. CDC recommendations for screening of asymptomatic pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure are unchanged. For symptomatic nonpregnant persons, dengue and Zika virus NAATs should be performed on serum collected 7 days or sooner after symptom onset. Dengue and Zika virus IgM antibody testing should be performed on NAAT-negative serum specimens or serum collected over 7 days after onset of symptoms. For symptomatic pregnant women, serum and urine specimens should be collected as soon as possible within 12 weeks of symptom onset for concurrent dengue and Zika virus NAATs and IgM antibody testing. Positive IgM antibody test results with negative NAAT results should be confirmed by neutralizing antibody tests when clinically or epidemiologically indicated, including for all pregnant women. Data on the epidemiology of viruses known to be circulating at the location of exposure and clinical findings should be considered when deciding which tests to perform and for interpreting results.

Patients with clinically suspected dengue should receive appropriate management to monitor and treat shock and hemorrhage. Women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy and their infants should be evaluated and managed for possible adverse outcomes. Dengue and Zika virus disease are nationally notifiable conditions, and cases should be reported to public health authorities.

[3] _Wolbachia_ for dengue control

Dengue fever stopped spreading in the Australian city of Townsville after an army of mosquitoes infected with the _Wolbachia_ bacterium was released. Indeed, when a natural bacterium called _Wolbachia_ infects the dengue-carrying mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_, it stops viral replication inside the mosquito and thus breaks the cycle of transmission.

The million-dollar question is, will these viruses or mosquitoes eventually become resistant to _Wolbachia_ or not? If resistance emerges, the whole _Wolbachia_ exercise becomes pointless.

A new study aims to provide a preliminary answer to this question. The researchers used a dengue virus strain to infect 2 categories of mosquito cell, one infected with _Wolbachia_ and the other uninfected. The _Wolbachia_ bacterium naturally infects half of all insect species but is not naturally found in many mosquito vector species. The study entitled "Sustained _Wolbachia_-mediated blocking of dengue virus isolates following serial passage in _Aedes aegypti_ cell culture," was published in the journal Virus Evolution on 8 Jun 2019.

After 5 days, the replicated viruses were introduced to fresh cells, beginning the next cycle of infection; 9 cycles were completed in this manner. At the end, the number of virus [particles] was counted in each of the 2 types of cell cultures. They also tested the viruses from each culture for their replicative capability using fresh cells of each type.

Normally, the dengue virus, like most viruses, hijacks the mosquito cell's machinery to replicate itself, making millions of viral particles. Finally, it destroys the host cell or buds out of it, to release the new viruses.

_Wolbachia_-infected mosquito cells showed an exponential drop in the numbers of dengue virus. In some cases, the virus died out altogether. However, _Wolbachia_-free cells showed a stable high number of viruses.

Viruses collected from _Wolbachia_-infected cells were unable to successfully replicate even in _Wolbachia_-free cells. Thus _Wolbachia_ acts rather like a vaccine, stopping viral multiplication inside the mosquito host. This is called the "pathogen-blocking effect." The mechanism of blocking remains unclear.

Researcher Beth McGraw explains, "We think it might have to do with competition between _Wolbachia_ and the virus for physical space (inside the cell) or for nutrition they both need from the mosquito. Or it could be that _Wolbachia_ is increasing the immune capacity of the mosquito."

The dengue virus causes millions of dengue fever cases in the tropics. Beginning with fever, body ache and nausea, it may lead to life-threatening complications like dengue hemorrhagic fever, with widespread internal bleeding and organ failure.

Many traditional methods of dengue control have failed for a variety of reasons. For one thing, _Aedes aegypti_ feeds in the daytime, so using bed screens at night doesn't prevent dengue. It breeds in stagnant water, which is abundantly present in urban settings that present multiple challenges to insecticide spraying and to the removal of standing water.

This is why virus biocontrol using _Wolbachia_ holds great appeal. One, it can control multiple types of dangerous mosquito-borne viruses. Secondly, uninfected female mosquitoes cannot breed with male infected mosquitoes, reducing breeding rates. Instead, _Wolbachia_ is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes to their progeny, producing more and more infected mosquitoes with each generation.

Thirdly, as the current study shows, neither the mosquito nor the virus was able to develop resistance to the bacterium after 9 cycles of replication.

"I am continually surprised by _Wolbachia_," said McGraw. "I thought we would get dengue variants that would evolve resistance. _Wolbachia_ is doing a better job than I expected at controlling virus replication in cells."

While the study holds immense promise for the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, more work remains to be done. For one thing, this was an in vitro study, using mosquito cells rather than the whole insect, which may react quite differently. Secondly, the huge mosquito populations in the real world offer far greater opportunities for acquired resistance than the limited laboratory cell populations.

Scientists are now releasing Wolbachia in larger volumes into the mosquito population in tropical and subtropical countries, to test its effects on human dengue fever rates. This could allow resistance to occur, especially when the virus finds human or uninfected mosquito hosts.

"I think our study suggests that the evolution of resistance to _Wolbachia_ in the virus is challenging," said McGraw. "I don't think it's a guarantee that the virus is not going to evolve under field conditions because the natural system is much more complex. The real experiment is being done in the field right now, because _Wolbachia_ has been released into communities in Australia, Indonesia and Brazil, among others. Monitoring in release areas will be needed to test for the emergence of resistance in the virus."
