TRICHINOSIS, HUMAN - SLOVAKIA

For over a hundred years, the central Slovak village of Valaska has,
according to this story, celebrated carnival by eating sausages made of dog
meat.
This year, this peculiar home-made delicatesse has poisoned close to 200
people in the community of 3,900. Almost half were eventually hospitalized,
suffering from the parasite trichinella, whose larvae eat the muscles of
those who consumed infected meat.
Valaska's local doctor Alfonz Fasko was quoted as saying, "No one who has
eaten the sausages this year will ever dare to touch them again."

[Trichinosis is rarely if ever reported in dogs. However, I am told on good
authority (= a parasitologist colleague half-way down the corridor) that in
Italy and Ireland they eat sausages made from foxes, a proportion of which
may be expected to have trichinella infections. Maybe, one of our colleagues
in Asia can tell us whether they have seen human cases in relation to the
consumption of dog meat. - Mod.MHJ]
