More cases of _E. coli_ are being confirmed at a hospital nursery,
with 27 children and an adult now affected. 4 suspected cases of the
potentially lethal _E. coli_ O157 bacterium, among those attending
Playdays day nursery, on the site of James Cook University Hospital in
Middlesbrough, have now been confirmed, after 5 children tested
positive for _E. coli_ O157 last week [week of 15 Aug 2011].

3 of the children were admitted to hospital with the potentially
lethal bug, which can lead to kidney failure. 1 child is still being
treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Today, 26 Aug
2011, a further 2 suspected cases of the infection are under
investigation, and a member of nursery staff has tested positive,
despite showing no symptoms.

Simon Pleydell, chief executive of South Tees NHS Foundation Trust,
said it is "perfectly possible" more cases will come to light due to
the 14-day incubation period of the organism, despite 15 children so
far testing negative. However, he added he was still "hopeful" the
nursery, for children of hospital staff, would reopen on 30 Aug 2011.

"We still don't know where it emanated from, but what I've been at
pains to stress is that clearly, the nursery, although it's on this
site, is completely separate in its functioning from the rest of the
hospital."

[Outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are not uncommon in day care
centers as, especially with young children, there is ample opportunity
for child-to-child transmission related to less than ideal hygiene.
With 27 cases reported, it is more likely that the origin of the
outbreak could be a food vehicle at the day care center than a child
introducing the strain into the center after acquiring it at home.
Secondary spread in the center is also likely occurring as as noted by
Mod.DK in a previous posting, toddlers are marvelous sharers of toys
as well as fecally contaminated hands. - Mod.LL]
