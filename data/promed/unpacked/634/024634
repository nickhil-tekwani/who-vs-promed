Los Angeles County health officials have temporarily closed a campground in
Angeles National Forest after several squirrels tested positive for
sylvatic plague.

The Switzer Falls picnic area above Altadena was closed yesterday. The
closure is effective for at least 10 days.
Sylvatic plague is the form of the disease which occurs in animals not
humans, and is endemic among ground squirrels in the San Gabriel Mountains.
It is a bacterial infection [_Yersenia pestis_ which can be transmitted to
a human through the bite of an infected flea. Such transmission causes
bubonic plague, with symptoms including enlargement of lymph glands near
the flea bite and rapid onset of fever.
All forms of the disease can be fatal if not treated - however most
patients respond well to antibiotic therapy.

route. It is important to establish treatment early. - Mod.TG
