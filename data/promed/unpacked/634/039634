Situation report for acute watery diarrhea/cholera, epidemiological week 48 (26 Nov-2 Dec 2018)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights:
- There was an increase in the number of AWD/Cholera cases reported from 18 in week 47 to 32 in week 48.
- No new deaths were reported in week 48.
- A cumulative total of 6637 cases including 45 deaths have been reported since December 2017.
- The cholera outbreak has been contained in 4 regions, but active transmission is still reported in Banadir region.
- A total of 5579 received oral cholera vaccination between [17 and 21 Nov 2018] in 5 villages of Hudur by using the stock balance there from SCI OCV campaign.
- 38% of the new cases were female.
- 69% of the cases were 5 years and below.
- Cases reported in week 48 did not receive cholera vaccine in 2017.
- 23 districts in 4 regions have reported new AWD case since December 2017.

AWD/cholera situation in Somalia
--------------------------------
Generally, the AWD/cholera cases have been on the decline since weeks 29 (fig 1 [for figures and table, see original URL - Mod.LL]). In week 48, only Banadir regions reported new cases. The cholera outbreak that started in December 2017 in Beletweyne along river Shabelle has spread to Jowhar, Kismayo, Afgoye Merka and Banadir.

Over the past 17 weeks, there has been decline in the number of AWD/Cholera cases reported. In week ending 2 Dec 2018, active transmission of AWD/cholera was reported 9 districts of Banadir region (Darkenly, Daynile, Hodan, Madina, Howlwadag, Hamarjabjab, Hamarweyn, Wardigley Abdiaziz districts) (fig 2). As shown in table 1, there was increase in the number of cases reported from 18 in week 47 to 32 in week 48. The oral cholera vaccination that was implemented in 11 high risk districts in 2017 of the central region has greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of new AWD/cholera cases compared to the same time in 2017 (fig 1).

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland East Province)
Date: Wed 19 Dec 2018

There are reports of suspected cholera cases in Mukwa Village Ward 10 in Murewa Rural District Council after 2 people are reported to have died at a Johane Marange Shrine known as Chitsidzo. After receiving a tip off from a member of the public, the Ministry of Health and Child Care dispatched a team to the shrine, but was denied access by the sect members who do not believe in seeking medication.

Mashonaland East epidemiologist Dr Paul Matsvimbo confirmed the incident saying they have since activated their response team to monitor the situation.

The Murewa District Civil Protection Unit has held an emergency meeting and assembled a team to manage cases while a cholera treatment camp has been established at Murewa hospital. Murewa district administrator Ms Gumburayi Wadzvanya said they are sending a team to the shrine to engage the church leaders so that health teams have access to the area to monitor and contain any outbreak.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
