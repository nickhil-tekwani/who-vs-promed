On 14 Oct 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development activated measures prescribed by the protocol following the detection of bluetongue, caused by BTV serotype 4, in a sheep farm in the municipality of Ciudad Rodrigo, in Salamanca. Until now, the area was considered to have the status of a free zone for this disease. After sampling, followed by confirmation of the disease, the farm and the cattle and sheep within a 50 km [31 mi] radius of the outbreak have been put under movement restrictions according to the guidelines of the health protocol.

The protocol also indicates that compulsory vaccination should be carried out in this perimeter along with voluntary vaccination within a radius of 100 km [62 mi] around the positive focus. In addition, the transport of cattle to the slaughterhouse is allowed for all the herds; the movements of animals for other purposes are allowed for PCR-negative animals.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, there are 260 000 cattle susceptible to vaccination and 110 000 sheep, making a total of 370 000 livestock. The vaccination teams of the official veterinary service of the Ministry are prepared to start vaccinating the animals next week, as indicated by the said department. It is planned to allocate 4 teams for the vaccination of sheep and another 24 teams for cattle within 50 days, covering 5 affected veterinary units: Ciudad Rodrigo, Sequeros, Tamames, La Fuente de San Esteban, and Lumbrales. In addition, throughout the restriction zone, visits, census, and verification of clinical symptoms are being carried out. Farmers have been advised to take extreme biosecurity measures. Sources from the Ministry recalled that the potential for transmission of this virus to man is zero.

[Ciudad Rodrigo is a city near Spain's border with Portugal (map at https://tinyurl.com/4sfj3tku). It is situated in the province Salamanca, in the western part of the autonomous community of Castilla y León (Castile and Leon). Salamanca borders the Spanish provinces of Zamora, Valladolid, Ávila, and Cáceres and, on the west, Portugal. While Castile & Leon has, so far, been considered a BT-free zone according to EC protocols, the autonomous community of Extremadura, on its south, is regarded infected by BTV-4, a zone with an approved eradication programme for infection with BTV, as can be seen in EC's bluetongue map at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.pdf (last updated September 2022).

Portugal's adjoining territories, on the west, are affected in the centre by BTV-4, and in the south by both BTV-4 and BTV-1.

Bluetongue (BT) is a WOAH-listed, infectious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants. The BT orbivirus, of which at least 27 serotypes are known, is primarily transmitted by certain species of _Culicoides_ midges. The global distribution of the disease is largely determined by the distribution of competent vectors. Infection with BTV is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in susceptible breeds of sheep. Infection of cattle is usually subclinical, with the exception of BTV-8 infection. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to their prolonged viraemia following infection, leading to cattle becoming a potential introducer of the virus into free areas with highly susceptible local sheep. - Mod.AS
