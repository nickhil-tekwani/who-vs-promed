Wildlife experts and rescuers are fearful that more ducks and
migratory birds will fall victim to botulism after several duck
carcasses found in south county lakes tested positive for the deadly
toxin.

Three dead duck bodies analyzed by a state laboratory have tested
positive for botulism, said Dr David Kieltyka staff veterinarian at OC
Animal Care [Orange County], who is coordinating communication and a
protocol for the appropriate treatment of the duck die-off.

The 3 mallards -- one found in Lake Forest and 2 found at the Moulton
Niguel Water District -- were tested in San Bernardino at the
California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory. The tests follow
a large die-off of nearly 100 dead and dying mallards since 1 Sep
[2011] at the Village Pond Park in Lake Forest and in nearby lakes of
the Lake Forest Community Association. An earlier test performed by
the Orange County Vector Control District at the same test was
inconclusive on botulism but ruled out vector borne illnesses, Jared
Dever, a spokesman with the district said in early October [2011].

In addition to the nearly 100 ducks in Lake Forest, more dead and
dying waterfowl have been fished out of the lake at the Laguna Niguel
Regional Park and found in the surrounding bushes and vegetation.
Reports of dead ducks also came in from decorative ponds at the
Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna Niguel.

Kristi Jolliffe, who 2 years ago [2009] helped fish out at least 130
ducks killed by botulism at the regional park, has rescued dead and
dying birds out of ponds at Moulton Niguel Water District also in
Laguna Niguel as recently as Tuesday [8 Nov 2011]. "I saw a sick male
mallard and I asked someone to go out on the boat and catch it," she
said about a rescue effort last week [week of 7 Nov 2011]. "I went on
the boat to help. While trying to catch the mallard I found 13 dead
waterfowl all in different stages of decomposition. Some just bones,
some with maggots and some dead less than 24 hours."

Jolliffe has found 29 ducks at the water district since last week
[week of 7 Nov 2011], she said. 4 are recovering at the Wetlands and
Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach. OC Parks spokeswoman Marisa
O'Neill confirmed there have been 16 dead ducks at the regional park.
Sick birds from Lake Forest and Laguna Niguel have been taken to the
Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach.

Now, duck rescuers are gearing up for possible migratory birds that
might get sick. American Widgeons, redhead, and ruddy ducks and Canada
Geese are expected to come into the area over the next several months
peaking in December [2011] and January [2012].

Since September [2011], city officials, OC Animal Care officials, and
representatives from Orange County Vector Control District have
received reports of the dead and dying water fowl. OC Animal Care
officers have picked up dead birds and Vector Control performed a test
on one duck that in early October [2011] came back as inconclusive on
botulism. The mass die-off left wildlife, rescuers and officials
frustrated and looking for answers.

Questions -- such as what agency should be contacted, what are
rescuers supposed to do with the sick and/or dead, who is responsible
for transporting the birds and who arranges for testing deemed
necessary -- have been raised.

Since late October [2011] Kieltyka, the OC Animal Care vet, has become
the point person. He is working to coordinate communication and
develop an appropriate protocol. "We want to reach out and have better
communication," he said. "Rather than getting reports of dead ducks
here and there, I want to spot things earlier and oversee the
protocol."

Debbie McGuire, director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center,
worries about the effects of botulism on the expected hundreds of
migratory birds. "I'm concerned that we break the cycle of botulism
and that we do this by disposing of the carcasses correctly," she said
referring to information that dead ducks were being dumped into trash
containers at Laguna Niguel Regional Park. "One way we do this is by
not dumping them into the trash. What they need to do is incinerate
them or bury them 6 feet [2 m] deep in the ground. We can break the
cycle if the carcasses are removed and the sick birds are treated
immediately."

O'Neill said dumping the birds in bundles into the trash is a normal
disposal method at the park unless rangers are directed to do
something else. Now, she said, officials at OC Animal Care have asked
for the dead birds to be sent to them.

McGuire and technicians at the Huntington Beach center are preparing
for possibly more birds but need help from the affected cities and
agencies. Each bird treated costs about USD 125.

McGuire points to a massive pelican die-off in early 2000 at the
Salton Sea where botulism affected hundreds of brown pelicans. The
bodies there were burned in huge pyres to break the cycle of the
toxin. She is also hopeful that cold weather helps stem the botulism
outbreak.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin
produced by a bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_. The bacteria are
found in soil as spores and require warm temperatures, a protein
source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become
active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates
combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the
botulism bacteria to proliferate and produce toxin.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (such
as maggots) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by
the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism
outbreak when fly larvae (maggots), feed on animal carcasses and
ingest toxin. The toxin causes paralysis because it affects the
nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles, which
eventually results in death.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning
(in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in
removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. However, it
should be taken into account that outbreaks of botulism in wild
aquatic birds are a natural phenomenon in North America. Yearly, the
risk of an outbreak is high from September to November, and then drops
and remains low during the winter. If possible, avoid altering water
depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather.
This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for
the bacteria. For more information see ProMED-mail post 20111009.3031.
