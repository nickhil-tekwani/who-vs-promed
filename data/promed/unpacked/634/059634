Plague found in deer, precautions advised for hunters
--------------------------------------------------
A deer found near the Big Hole River in southwestern Montana was diagnosed
with plague, state officials said Wednesday. The infected mule deer was
found by 2 veterinarians 31 Jul 2003. The animal was congested, breathing
rapidly, and in very poor condition. It was killed and tissue samples were
sent for testing.
While the discovery means hunters should take precautions, it should not
alter their hunting plans this fall, officials said. The state's big game
archery season opened Saturday, and the general rifle season starts 26 Oct
2003. "This is not some new disease that has befallen us and is spreading,"
said Dr. Todd Damrow, state epidemiologist. "This is something we've been
living with for years."
Plague[, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_,] long has been
widespread in wildlife, particularly in rodents and animals that eat
rodents, Damrow said. The bacterial disease can be passed from animals to
humans through direct contact with infected blood or tissue.
Human-to-human spread of the disease is extremely uncommon.
The plague usually infects 10 to 15 people each year in the United States
and can be fatal if not treated, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. A Montana hunter contracted the disease in 1987
from an infected antelope killed in Wheatland County. The hunter eventually
recovered. In 1992, a Wyoming man died after skinning a bobcat in
south-central Montana.
Health officials said hunters can protect themselves by wearing gloves when
butchering their game, making sure the meat is cooked thoroughly to kill
any bacteria, and washing hands after handling wild game. Symptoms of the
plague are similar to the flu -- fever, nausea, muscle aches, and swollen
lymph glands -- and usually appear about a week after contact with an
infected animal.

[As you will see from the previous postings referenced below, _Y. pestis_
is most usually recovered from ground rodents and cats. With the fall
hunting season upon us, it is hopefully not too late to remind hunters not
to shoot non-alert game; such animals may well be ill, if not from plague,
then from a wide variety of other equally unpleasant conditions, all
capable of qualifying the hunter for a Darwin Award. - Mod.MHJ]
