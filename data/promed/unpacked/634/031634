Some of those responding to what I intended to be an innocuous posting (Q
Fever Vaccine, Availability, ProMED 970218180712) seem to have
misinterpreted my comments. I think we're all in agreement here, and I'm
sorry if my original comments were carelessly written and open to
misinterpretation. I intended only to inform ProMED readers where Q Fever
vaccine could be obtained in the US and to share my own (frustrating)
experience .
I know that new drugs must be rigorously tested and I am aware of the
reasons for each of the "hoops" through which study participants jump (e.g.,
pregnancy tests, HIV tests, screening); I also hope this vaccine will "pass
muster" and be more readily accessible when the clinical trial is concluded
in 1998. I am well aware of the need for pre-vaccination skin testing,
especially when dealing with people who have been working for years in a
high-risk situation, many of whom will already have been infected with _C.
burnetii_.
In response to the initial request for vaccination of its employees, I spent
a good deal of time and effort arranging to provide vaccine through the
experimental protocol (provided our consulting physician would be approved
as an associate investigator) to the USDA sheep experiment station, which is
in a rural area with limited medical infrastructure and personnel. Now, over
a year later, they (or their higher-ups) still have not decided whether to
proceed. I think this is unfortunate; whether the delay has to do with the
"hoops" necessitated by the experimental protocol or internal bureaucratic
"hoops" I don't know.
I would be happy to receive _constructive_ comments/suggestions sent to my
direct address.
