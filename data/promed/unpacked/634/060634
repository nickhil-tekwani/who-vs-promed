In February 2016, '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus' (associated with huanglongbing - EPPO A1 List) was detected for the 1st time in Panama. The disease was found on citrus [in] areas of province of Bocas del Toro.

The Ministry of Agriculture has declared a state of phytosanitary emergency and a national contingency plan has been elaborated to contain the disease and its vector, _Diaphorina citri_ (Hemiptera: Liviidae - EPPO A1 List). In July 2016, 101 citrus plants at the sites where the disease was found were burnt. In addition to plant destruction and surveys, the development of a national certification scheme for the production of healthy planting material of citrus has been undertaken.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (Asian greening; huanglongbing, HLB), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening), or americanus (South American greening). The pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Alternative management approaches, such as detection of infected trees by sniffer dogs and cultural control by interplanting with non-host crops, are being trialed. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

In the neighbouring Caribbean region, HLB has also recently been reported for the 1st time from Trinidad and Tobago (ProMED-mail post 20170614.5104395).
