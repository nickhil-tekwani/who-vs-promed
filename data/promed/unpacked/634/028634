2 fatal hantavirus cases have been confirmed in the state in the past
6 weeks, one in Maricopa County. The Arizona Department of Health
Services is not releasing detailed information about either victim.
One of them, a man in his 60s, lived along the rural fringe of
northwest Maricopa County. He may have been exposed while sweeping
mice droppings out of his garage. The 2nd victim was a Navajo County woman.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 1st created a scare in the Southwest in
1993 when a series of previously healthy young adults suddenly
developed acute respiratory symptoms, about half of them died,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The number of cases have ebbed and flowed since then, but the disease
is still considered rare with a total of 416 cases nationally since
the 1993 outbreak. Arizona has had 46 of those cases; 7 of those
cases have been in the past 13 months.
There is no specific treatment, cure or prevention for the virus.
However, those who are infected with hantavirus are closely monitored
in a hospital and given oxygen therapy because of difficulty
breathing, according to the CDC.
The virus is contracted after direct contact with the urine,
droppings and/or saliva of wild rodents. Common house mice and roof
rats are not known to carry the disease.
Hantavirus usually begins with flu-like symptoms, which become
progressively worse as the lungs fill with fluid.
The state health department is advising caution, not panic.
"Hantavirus is alive and well, and people still need to take
precautions. In fact, we have seen an increase in cases in Arizona,"
state epidemiologist David Engelthaler, said. "This is still a highly
fatal, very serious illness."
One reason for the increased number of cases is the increased number
of wild mice born after last year's early rains. Now, with a drought,
some of those same rodents are moving into people's homes looking for
food and water.

New Mexico's 1st case of hantavirus for 2006 has been confirmed in a
McKinley County woman.
The woman, whose name was not released, was hospitalized Tuesday [7
Feb 2006] in critical condition at University of New Mexico Hospital
in Albuquerque. She has been diagnosed with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, the state Department of Health said.
There is no specific treatment, but health officials said the chances
for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.
Early symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include fever and
muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain and a cough. The symptoms develop within one
to 6 weeks after exposure.
The disease is transmitted through particles of dried urine,
droppings or saliva of infected rodents, particularly deer mice.
"We want everyone to be aware that hantavirus is present in our state
and that precautions need to be taken to avoid rodents and their
droppings," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, state public health veterinarian
at the department.
"Though we tend to see more cases of hantavirus during the summer
months, we have had cases every month of the year, including winter
months when mice try to get inside our homes for food and shelter," he said.
New Mexico had one case reported in 2005, in a Los Alamos County man.
In 2004, New Mexico had 4 cases, one each in McKinley, Bernalillo,
Sandoval and Santa Fe counties.
Hantavirus was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners area
where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah meet. Since then, New
Mexico has reported 66 cases, 27 of them fatal.
Nationwide, 416 cases have been reported in 30 states, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. About 36
percent of all reported cases have been fatal.
The Health Department is warning people to avoid contact with
rodents. Authorities suggest such preventive measures as airing out
closed-up buildings before entering; sealing homes so mice can't
enter; trapping rodents until they're all gone; using a disinfectant
to clean up rodent nests and droppings; putting hay, wood and compost
piles as far as possible from the home; getting rid of trash and junk
piles that attract rodents; and not leaving pet food and water where
mice can get to them.
