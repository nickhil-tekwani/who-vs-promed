[1] Shigellosis, milk - Russia (Yakutia)

According to RIA Novosti, the Office of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal
Service for Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare] in Yakutia has
suspended for 5 days the activity of the Yakutsk dairy factory, due
to production of contaminated milk, which poisoned 155 people,
including 108 children. (According to other media reports, the number
of affected is almost double - BN).

According to the representative of Rospotrebnadzor, 33 individuals
had a bacteriologically confirmed diagnosis of dysentery caused by
_Shigella flexneri_.

"We have conducted a sanitary-epidemiological investigation in the
dairy plant, taken samples of raw materials, finished goods, and
water, and surveyed employees to determine whether they have
bacterial intestinal infections. The audit identified a number of
violations of sanitary legislation for water treatment," said the
agency. The representative of the city of Yakutsk creamery declined
to comment, but the findings of the Rospotrebnadzor audit were confirmed.

[It is unclear if the milk was unpasteurized, poorly pasteurized, or
contaminated after pasteurization. Some cases that are identified may
be secondary family cases as shigellosis spreads quite easily in the
home. Yakutia (also called Sakha) is a large Russian republic in
northeastern Siberia and can be found on a map at

[2] Cholera - Cambodia
Date: Wed 10 Feb 2010

Health experts are at odds over the possibility of a cholera epidemic
breaking out in the Kingdom, with Ministry of Health officials
downplaying the threat and doctors from a Phnom Penh pediatric
hospital saying cases could triple by March 2010 if the government
does not intervene to stop the disease from spreading.

Dr Beat Richner, director of the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital in
Phnom Penh, said Tuesday [9 Feb 2010] that the disease had been
spreading for months, beginning with 2 confirmed cases in November
2009, followed by 10 in December 2009, 53 in January 2010, and 19 so
far in February 2010 at his hospital alone.

He said his hospital had treated 120 suspected cholera patients in
January 2010, and that all cases had been reported to the Ministry of
Health. But Ly Sovann, deputy director of the Communicable Diseases
Control Department at Ministry of Health, declined to say whether
cholera cases had been confirmed, and argued that the distinction
between diarrhea and cholera was unimportant.

He added that cholera can kill very quickly, and called for a state
of emergency to be declared in areas where a high number of diarrhoea
and suspected cholera cases had been reported, including Kandal, Prey
Veng and Takeo provinces, as well as the capital.

[3] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik, Morobe, Madang provinces)
Date: Mon 8 Feb 2010

Papua New Guinea's cholera outbreak has spread to 2000 people, a
World Health Organization official said on Monday [8 Feb 2010] as he
warned that poor water sanitation was making the disease hard to
contain. The country's 1st cholera outbreak in 50 years emerged in
northern Morobe province last July [2009] and within months had
spread along the north coast to Madang and East Sepik, WHO
representative Eigil Sorensen said.

"We have seen the ongoing transmission in all these 3 provinces at
the moment so it is gradually spreading," Mr Sorensen told AFP. "We
have now more than 2000 confirmed cases of cholera." Mr Sorensen said
the number of deaths so far remained modest at fewer than 50, but the
disease continued to spread due to poor water supplies and as
infected people, including those with no symptoms of the sickness,
travelled around.

"The problem is that it's spreading to new areas and so we cannot say
there has been any containment of the disease, primarily because in a
large part of the country there is poor water sanitation," he said.
Mr Sorensen said many areas of Papua New Guinea, particularly crowded
settlements on the outskirts of cities with no proper sewage systems,
provided the ideal conditions for the spread of cholera.

[4] Diarrhea - Fiji (Viti Levu)
Date: Sat 6 Feb 2010

<http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=139280>


Dirty water appears to be the main cause of diarrhea cases at the
Colonial War Memorial Hospital, as cases of infected people continue
to rise. Over 200 people have been seen at the hospital in the last
few days, and about 70 percent were admitted.

Ministry of Health spokesman Iliesa Tora said they were trying to
determine the cause of the problem, and this would involve collecting
water samples. He urged members of the public to take their advice
and boil all drinking water.

Mr Tora said no cases have been reported as yet at the Lautoka and
Labasa hospitals. He said parents should carefully monitor their
children, what they eat, and how they live at home.
