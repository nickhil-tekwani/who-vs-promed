The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials in several states are investigating multiple multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections with serotypes Agona, Anatum, Braenderup, Infantis, Montevideo, and Newport linked to contact with backyard poultry.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _Salmonella_ from ill people in this outbreak showed that they are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 7 Jun 2019, a total of 279 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 41 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is on the map of reported cases page.

-------------------
Total / 279

Illnesses started on dates from 1 Jan 2019 to 24 May 2019. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 92 years, with a median age of 25 years; 57% are female. Of 152 people with information available, 40 (26%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis of 24 isolates from ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, fosfomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. An additional 35 isolates from ill people did not show evidence of antimicrobial resistance. Testing of 5 outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results (fosfomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method). This resistance may affect the choice of antibiotic used to treat some people.

One of the outbreak strains making people sick was identified in samples collected from backyard poultry in Ohio. Additional testing in several states is being conducted.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 153 people interviewed, 118 (77%) reported contact with backyard poultry before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying poultry from various sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries.

Backyard poultry from multiple hatcheries are the likely source of these outbreaks. Regardless of where poultry are purchased, they can carry _Salmonella_ germs that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their poultry.

This investigation is ongoing, and the CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
