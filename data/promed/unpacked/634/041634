Following the recent Hajj annual pilgrimage to Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), UK clinicians have been reminded to be vigilant for suspect Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases among returning travellers presenting to hospital with acute respiratory symptoms so as to ensure early detection, respiratory isolation and testing with the aim of limiting onward spread [1].

The Hajj festival, a mass gathering that draws more than 2 million pilgrims from around the world, is well recognised as an amplifying event for respiratory pathogens [2]. Respiratory illness is common amongst travellers returning from the Hajj, with increased rates of acute respiratory illness and infection observed in previous studies [2,3,4].

Since the 1st recognition of MERS in September 2012, there have been concerns about transmission of this infection linked to this mass gathering event, and of associated exportations as pilgrims return home. No Hajj-related MERS cases have been reported over the seasons since [5]. Taking account of recent reports of MERS transmission in Riyadh, however, the UK has raised awareness of the potential of MERS acquisition [1].

The UK has an established enhanced surveillance system for suspect MERS cases in travellers returning from the Middle East and hospitalised with an acute respiratory illness [6]. In the period 1 Sep 2015 to 7 Oct 2015, there have been a total of 19 possible MERS cases reported in travellers returning from KSA who required admission to hospital with acute respiratory illness. All cases were tested and were negative for MERS-CoV. To date, 9 (47 percent) have been diagnosed as influenza A positive (including one co-infection with RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], one with paraflu-3 [parainfluenza virus type 3], and one with rhinovirus), 4 (21 percent) as rhinovirus positive (single infection), and one (5 percent) adenovirus positive.

The picture in 2015 is very similar to that seen in the 2 previous Hajj/Umrah periods during which MERS surveillance has been operational in the UK. In 2013, from 1 Sep until 1 Nov 2013, a total of 24 possible cases were reported and investigated. All were negative for MERS-CoV on laboratory investigation, but 11 (46 percent) were positive for influenza A and 7 (29 percent) for rhinovirus (although 6 of these were co-infections with influenza). Similarly in 2014, in the period from 1 Sep until 1 Nov 2014, a total of 7 MERS-CoV cases were investigated. All were negative for MERS-CoV, but 3 (43 percent) were positive for rhinovirus, 3 (42 percent) for influenza. All cases were hospitalised, including admissions to critical care units. Information on influenza vaccine status and antiviral treatment of these cases is not known.

Clinicians should remain vigilant for MERS-CoV in travellers returning from the Middle East and who present with a recent acute respiratory illness that has resulted in hospitalisation. It is important that strict respiratory infection control measures are put in place and MERS-CoV testing is expedited [7]. However, particularly for Hajj returnees, clinicians should be aware that influenza may be a more likely explanation for the patient's symptoms, and they should not hesitate to start empirical antiviral treatment for influenza on admission if indicated, pending the results of laboratory investigations for influenza, MERS-CoV, and other respiratory pathogens. In addition, these findings reinforce the MOH-KSA recommendation that pilgrims be vaccinated against seasonal influenza, especially those at increased risk of severe disease.

[Previously, individual physicians in Canada and Germany had reported 2 individual cases of influenza virus infection in Hajj returnees to Canada and one case in a Hajj returnee to Germany, posted by ProMED-mail (see below). In fact, the publication in the current issue of Health Protection Report above verifies the occurrence of 9 cases of influenza A virus infection in addition to cases due to a number of other common respiratory pathogens in Hajj returnees to the UK. It is unlikely that the Hajj celebrations will be the source of some novel influenza virus pathogen. - Mod.CP
