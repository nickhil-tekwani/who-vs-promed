Two cows die of anthrax on farm
----------------------------
Two cows have died of anthrax on a beef farm in south Wales, it has
been confirmed by the assembly government. Tests were carried out on
the unnamed farm in Rhondda Cynon Taf after the sudden death of 5
cows in April. The assembly government said all 5 carcasses had been
burnt on site to ensure there was no risk to the public.
The anthrax was discovered through routine testing. It is the 1st
case in Britain since 2002, when a cow died at a farm in Wrexham.
An assembly government spokeswoman confirmed the farm in the latest
cases had once tested positive for anthrax 35 years ago. Anthrax
spores can persist in the environment, notably soil, for years. The
small farm has been sealed off, with the remaining herd of suckler
cows confined to their field while tests continue.
Chief veterinary officer for Wales Dr Christianne Glossop said: "The
assembly government and state veterinary service have worked quickly
to ensure that there is no threat from anthrax to the public, farmers
or any other livestock in Rhondda Cynon Taff. Officials are liaising
with the Environment Agency and medical authorities to ensure that
all necessary precautions are being taken. Anthrax is very rare - it
last occurred in Wales in 2002. We are working to trace the source of
the current outbreak."
In a statement, the assembly government said no cattle from the farm
had been sent for food for almost 12 months.
The Food Standards Agency has been informed of the outbreak.
The 2002 outbreak in Wrexham was considered to be a sporadic incident
on a farm which had 3 anthrax cases in the previous 2 decades. There
was also a case in cattle in Clwyd in 1992 and pigs were confirmed
with the disease at a farm in Wrexham in 1989.
Alan Morris, a spokesman for the Farmers' Union of Wales, said there
was no need for the public to be anxious. He said: "We are satisfied
that the contingency plans put in place are working very, very
effectively. We are pleased that the disease was identified quickly."

[A number of comments: Firstly, while the major tenor of the
government response is to calm fears, there is a suspicion of a
present lack of experience. For example: "The small farm has been
sealed off, with the remaining herd of suckler cows confined to their
field while tests continue." Quarantine is routine for a limited
period after vaccination, usually 14 to 21 days, but why not mention
vaccination and exactly what tests on the suckler cows? Or are they
attempting soil sampling? If the latter, I wish them good luck as it
is much harder than many realise even with modern techniques. And I
do hope that they vaccinated those cows.
Secondly, the pattern of UK anthrax outbreaks in the past 25 years is
essentially no longer from contaminated livestock feed --- the
Wrexham pigs were a notable exception --- but usually occur following
an environmental disturbance, such as trenching, bulldozing, or river
dredging, disturbing buried spores at cattle grave sites or occur in
relation to mills & tanneries that handled contaminated imported hair
& hides. This is a common epidemiologic pattern once an area is
considered to be in a true sporadic state epidemiologically.
Thirdly: About 18 months ago, with Peter Durr's help & assistance, I
attempted a file review of the past 100 outbreaks in the UK. We got
about 25 replies and then it dried up as the regional Defra chiefs
refused to recall the files from their archives. Two dozen survey
docs do not an hypothesis challenge. If Defra would like me to
continue and participate, please contact me.
Lastly: by the nature of this disease it is frankly hard to find a
farm that has not had an outbreak in the past 100 years. Thus the
observation that it has "recurred" proves nothing. If one could plot
where recurrences are truly probable, one might then come up with
some soil parameters favouring spore survival, other than the usual
high calcium levels combined with high pH and presence of organic
matter in the soil.
At one time the UK had some 425 outbreaks each year over the course
of decades thanks to contaminated feed. Once this was cleaned up, the
rate dropped precipitously to the present situation when years go by
without cases. It is now frankly a rare event subject to specific
trigger events and as time goes by, it will potentially become even
rarer, as spores are not immortal and can also lose their plasmids
over time. Otherwise we would be vaccinating cattle annually in
Europe & North America. We don't. And we have a situation where
livestock veterinarians are ignorant of the disease (not having seen
much of it during their careers), which delays recognition. This is
further exaggerated in the UK where far too many farmers are now too
poor to regularly employ a veterinarian. This Welsh outbreak is a
good example as 5 cows had to die before it was diagnosed.
I am mildly puzzled at the timing. April is early for this disease in
the UK for it to be due to environmental exposure; theoretically
dirty feed is available year round. But without details one can only
muse about possible sources. And before anyone comes up with claims
of Lazarus spores, my colleague & good friend Peter Turnbull once
investigated an outbreak in Dorset, southern England, where some 5-6
steers were affected from a cow buried some 60 plus years previously;
Peter located the grave in the pasture and showed the presence of
viable spores in the surface soil. - Mod.MHJ]
