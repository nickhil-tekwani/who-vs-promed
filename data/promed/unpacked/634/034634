Detection of Infectivity in Blood of Persons with Variant and Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. (By: Jean Yves Douet, Saima Zafar, Armand Perret-Liaudet, Caroline Lacroux, Saverine Lugan, Naima Aron, Herve Cassard, Claudia Ponto, Fabien Corbiare, Juan Maria Torres, Inga Zerr, and Olivier Andreoletti).

Abstract
-----------
We report the presence of infectivity in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and plasma of one person with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and in the plasma of 2 in 4 persons whose tests were positive for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The measured infectivity levels were comparable to those reported in various animals with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

Introduction
----------
Among humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a low incidence disease (approximately one case per million per year) that occurs as either a sporadic (sCJD) or a familial/genetic (fCJD) form. Whereas familial disease forms are linked to a mutation in the prion protein gene (Prnp), no clear epidemiologic risk factors have been identified for sporadic disease forms. sCJD is not a uniform disorder in terms of clinical and neuropathological phenotype. sCJD cases are classified as type 1 or 2 according to the polymorphism at codon 129 of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrP) sequence (methionine/valine) and to the electromobility of the proteinase K-resistant core of the abnormal PrP (PrPres). Type 1 and type 2 isoforms in sCJD are believed to correspond to different transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents.

Despite their relative rarity, several hundred iatrogenically transmitted CJD cases were identified during the past 60 years. Some data supporting the presence of infectivity in the blood of sCJD-affected patients were reported following the intracerebral inoculation of blood fractions from affected patients into rodents. These observations remain ambiguous because other studies did not confirm them.

In 1996, a new form of CJD, named variant CJD (vCJD), was identified in humans. Variant CJD was demonstrated to be caused by the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. In the United Kingdom, 4 vCJD transmissions (3 clinical cases and one asymptomatic infection) were probably caused by the transfusion of non-leuco-depleted erythrocyte concentrates prepared from donors who later had positive test results for vCJD. More recently, a presumed additional case of vCJD infection was reported in the United Kingdom in a hemophilic patient who had received fractionated plasma products, including some units linked to a donor who later was diagnosed with vCJD. Despite the epidemiologic evidence of bloodborne transmission in vCJD, bioassays performed on conventional rodent models failed to demonstrate the presence of infectivity in the blood. The lack of TSE transmission in conventional rodent models could be a consequence of a low infectivity level in blood from vCJD- and sCJD-affected patients (as described in sheep and rodent TSE models) or of the existence of the species barrier phenomenon that limits the transmission of human prions to these animal models. The development during the last decade of transgenic mice models expressing PrP from other species that abrogate the species barrier now offers the potential to detect low levels of infectivity.

In this study, we used 2 transgenic mouse models that displayed a high sensitivity to the vCJD or sCJD TSE agents to estimate the infectious titer in certain blood fractions from vCJD- and sCJD-affected patients. According to legislation of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, the experimental protocol, including the use of human samples, was approved by the UK National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit tissue bank.

Conclusions
----------
The data reported here confirm the presence of infectivity in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and plasma from vCJD-affected patients and demonstrate unambiguously the presence of infectivity in the plasma of some, but not all, sCJD-affected patients. The infectivity levels that we measured in the tested vCJD and sCJD blood components were comparable to those reported in various TSE animal models. The number of cases included in our study was limited; a new experiment that would include a larger number of cases and different blood fractions from sCJD cases will be necessary to refine the data. However, these results represent a substantial input for assessing the risk for inter-individual bloodborne transmission of sCJD and vCJD.

[In this study, the authors found infectivity in the red and white blood cells and plasma of a vCJD patient and in the plasma of 2 of 4 sporadic CJD patients tested. These findings indicate the need to continue assessing the possible risk for CJD transmission via transfusion of blood products. - Mod.CP]
