Farmers go bankrupt...as swine fever kills thousands of pigs
------------------------------------------------------------
African swine fever has reportedly killed more than 4000 pigs at Dwene in
the Jaman South district of Brong Ahafo, forcing most of the owners to
withdraw their children from schools for lack of funds. Mr Emmanuel Boakye
Antwi, leader of the Pig Farmers Association of Dwenem, who has lost 123
pigs, explained to the Ghana News Agency that the rearing of the animals
was their main source of income, and they could no longer afford their
children's school fees or the needed educational materials.

The pig farmers, numbering about 45, staged a peaceful demonstration, after
which they held a crisis meeting and decided to send their grievances to
the appropriate quarters. Mr Boakye appealed to the government to help them
to resuscitate their businesses. Mr Kwaku Gyan Taylor, whose 145 animals
were killed, said the group would petition the district chief executive,
the MP for Jaman South, Mrs Anna Nyamekye, and NADMO (National Disaster
Management Organisation) to help them.

When contacted, Dr Kwaku Sindim, district veterinary officer, said tests
conducted confirmed the presence of the disease in the area, adding that
the 1st case was detected on 2 Jan 2005. Blood samples indicate the
epidemic is spreading to surrounding villages, including Nyame Asuogya and
others, he said.

Mr FX Appumbora, deputy district director of Agriculture, noted that the
outbreak was of serious epidemiological concern and urged pig farmers in
Wenchi, Berekum and Dormaa to report all cases.

[African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of domestic and wild
pigs that affects animals of all breeds and ages, and which is caused by a
virus that produces a range of syndromes. Acute disease is characterized by
high fever, hemorrhages in the reticuloendothelial system, and a high
mortality rate, which, when highly virulent strains are involved, may reach
100 per cent. Infectious virus can survive for several months in fresh and
salted dried-meat products. This virus is currently classified as the only
member of a family called Asfarviridae; it does not infect humans.

ASF is endemic in Ghana; during the period January-November 2004, 20
outbreaks in Central Region, Ashanti, Northern Region and Upper East were
reported to the OIE. The current outbreak, in the South, seems to represent
a further spread of the disease. - Mod.AS]
