slides)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the said presentation, virus recirculation has recently
started in Spain, with, so far, 5 recorded outbreaks of BTV-1 (1st on 20
Sep 2010) and 2 outbreaks of BTV-4 (1st on 04 Oct 2010).

Slide 7 addresses the current compulsory vaccination scheme in Spain, with
relevant "restricted areas" for vaccination, applying vaccines against 3
BTV serotypes (1, 4 and 8), as shown on a map. The vaccination is applied
by authorised veterinarians in bovines/ovines over 3 months of age.

Spain's southern neighbour, Morocco, has been experiencing the spread of
BTV 1 (18 outbreaks) and BTV 4 (242 outbreaks) since July 2010; follow-up
reports No 9, for each of the 2 serotypes, were submitted on 14 Oct 2010.

On the other eastern side of the Mediterranean, another BTV serotype,
BTV16, is also threatening Europe. This was notified by Turkey on 15 Oct
2010; see immediate notification and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9834>.

Seasonal clinical cases of BT in sheep of susceptible breeds have been
recently observed in Israel; serotyping is not available. - Mod.AS
