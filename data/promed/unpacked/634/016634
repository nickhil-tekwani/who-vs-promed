West Nile-like virus - USA (New York): UPDATE 991023235838

From: Vincent Deubel <vdeubel@pasteur.fr>

This is written in response to a previous posting [991023235838 regarding
West Nile virus [WNV infection in horses, particularly the lack of WNV
transmission from horse to horse. [That posting said, in part, "Horses that
contract the virus cannot pass the virus to other horses, or to people or
pets, the Commissioner said. The West Nile-like virus is spread by
mosquitoes that acquire the virus from wild birds."
West Nile virus transmission by aerosol has not been demonstrated in the
natural cycle but WNV infection has been proven in a laboratory worker
and in rodents; Nir, Am. J. Trop. Med. [1959 8: 537-539. The virus can be
transmitted from a sick [and viremic horse to a healthy one. The mosquito
taking viremic blood will require 6 or 10 days before being able to shed
the virus in its saliva.
To answer the question from Dr. James Britt, I agree with Dr. Calisher that
IgM antibodies are detectable before the death of the horses.
>From our experience in recovering West Nile virus from dead horses during
French and Italian epidemics, I would suggest analysis of samples from the
cerebellum and from the spinal cord (in particular in the lumbar section),
which seem to contain more virus than the brain.

If I understand both messages, the posting was indicating that direct
horse-to-horse transmission does not occur, and Vincent is saying that
horse-to-horse transmission can occur via a mosquito that becomes infected
by feeding on a viremic horse. In either event, there is the possibility
of vertebrate to vertebrate transmission of WNV. Direct transmissions of
flaviviruses are rare events. - Mod.CHC
