For the current influenza A(H1N1) virus, WHO Collaborating Centres
for influenza (WHO CCs), Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) and
other institutions are developing candidate vaccine viruses under the
coordination of WHO (1). Once a vaccine virus is available, WHO will
announce the availability on its public website (2). For general
queries, please email to <GISN@who.int>.

Candidate vaccine viruses using reverse genetics technology are being
developed by:

- WHO CC in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta USA, from A/California/4/2009(H1N1)swl. Expected availability
end of May 2009. Email queries to: <rdonis@cdc.gov>.

- ERL in the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control
(NIBSC), UK, from A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl and A/England/195/2009
(H1N1)swl. Expected availability end of May 2009. Email queries to:
<enquiries@nibsc.ac.uk>.

- ERL in the Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER),
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) USA, from
A/California/4/2009(H1N1)swl and A/Texas/5/2009(H1N1)swl. Expected
availability not yet known. Email queries to: <zhiping.ye@fda.hhs.gov>.

- WHO CC at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis USA,
from A/California/4/2009(H1N1)swl, A/New York/20/2009(H1N1)swl and
A/Ohio/7/2009 (H1N1)swl. Expected availability not yet known. Email
queries to: <richard.webby@stjude.org>.

- WHO CC at National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan,
from A/California/4/2009(H1N1)swl and A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl.
Expected availability not yet known. Email queries: <mtashiro@nih.go.jp>.

- CSL Limited, Australia, from A/California/4/2009(H1N1)swl and
A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl. Expected availability not yet known.
Email queries:<Peter.Schoofs@csl.com.au>.

Candidate vaccine viruses using classical reassortment technology are
being developed by:

- ERL NIBSC, UK, from A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl, an egg virus
isolate. Expected availability not yet known. Email queries:
<enquiries@nibsc.ac.uk>.

- New York Medical College, USA, from A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl.
Expected availability not yet known. Email queries: <doris.bucher@nymc.edu>.

- CSL Limited, Australia, from A/California/7/2009(H1N1)swl. Expected
availability not yet known. Email queries: <Peter.Schoofs@csl.com.au>.

Development of vaccine potency reagents for inactivated vaccines
against influenza A(H1N1) is planned in:

- ERL NIBSC, UK. Email queries to: <enquiries@nibsc.ac.uk>

- ERL CBER FDA, USA. Email queries to: <zhiping.ye@fda.hhs.gov>

- ERL, Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia. Email
queries: <gary.grohmann@health.gov.au>

- ERL NIID, Japan. Email queries: <mtashiro@nih.go.jp>

Wild type viruses have been/ are being sent to vaccine manufacturers
on request including: Baxter, CSL Limited, GlaxoSmithKline
Biologicals, MedImmune, Microgen, Nobilon International, Novartis,
Omninvest Vaccines, Pasteur, Solvay and Vivaldi.

This network is monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses, both
seasonal and those with potential to cause a pandemic, including the
current influenza A(H1N1). The network also provides recommendations
and updates on diagnostics, monitors the susceptibility of emerging
influenza viruses to antiviral drugs, and selects, develops and
distributes vaccine viruses.
