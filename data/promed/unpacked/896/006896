The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has issued a ban
on the eating, gathering or harvesting, transporting, and marketing of
shellfish from 7 towns and one city along the coastal waters of Bataan
due to red tide which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) that
killed an old woman.

"Based on the results of red tide monitoring activities of BFAR and
the red tide monitoring center in Bataan, shellfish collected from
Bataan coastal waters in Balanga City and the towns of Mariveles,
Limay, Orion, Pilar, Abucay, Samal, and Orani are now positive for the
red tide toxin," the BFAR advisory said.

Red tide toxin level in shellfish samples collected from these areas
is from 70 to 5617 grams Saxi-Toxin (STX) g/100g of shellfish meat,"
according to the BFAR advisory.
