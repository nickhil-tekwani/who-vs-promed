During the recent weeks, Statens Serum Institut [State Serum
Institute] has been investigating a salmonellosis outbreak of a rare
serotype, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Strathcona. This serotype
has not previously been detected in Denmark, and it has never before
been recognized as the source of an outbreak.

The outbreak included a total of 40 culture confirmed cases registered
in the Danish National Laboratory Surveillance System. The cases, 24
females and 16 males, comprised children and grown-ups from all over
the country. The 1st patient became ill on 4 Sep 2011, and the last on
14 Oct 2011. During the same period, 14 cases in Germany and one in
Austria were reported.

Small, elongated tomatoes of the type datterino have been found to be
the source of the infections. The tomatoes, deriving from a producer
in southern Italy, have primarily been sold from the supermarket
chain, "Rema 1000". The tomatoes are no longer available from the
supermarket chain, and the outbreak has most likely now stopped.

Further investigations are still ongoing, including looking into if
the tomatoes have been delivered to other distributors.

Tomatoes have not before been recognised as the source of salmonella
outbreaks in Denmark, however, the USA has seen several food borne
outbreaks associated with contaminated tomatoes.

To detect the source of the outbreak, Statens Serum Institut carried
out detailed patient interviews and collected data from electronic
purchase records from "Rema 1000". These showed that the majority of
affected families had bought a specific brand of tomatoes. Based on
these data a case-control study was then carried out; which found that
eating small, elongated tomatoes sold in "Rema 1000", was strongly
associated with illness. The overall conclusion of the investigations
was that the datterino tomatoes with a high probability were the
source of the outbreak.
