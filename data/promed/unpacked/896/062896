Cassava farmers and processors in Lango [sub-region within Northern Region] are suffering due to adverse weather and disease infestation. They say an upsurge in the cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) during the prolonged dry season has had serious impact. The population of whiteflies that transmit the Cassava Brown Streak Virus (CBSV) has increased tremendously. Farmers in Lango and Nakasongola, where CBSD is also widespread, say they have limited access to NASE 14, which is the recommended CBSD-tolerant variety in the 2 regions.

The Virus Resistant Cassava for Africa (VIRCA) project is working on ways to control CBSD and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD). There are 4 viruses that cause CBSD and CMD in East Africa, including Uganda: East African Cassava Mosaic-Uganda Virus (EACMV-UG), African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMV), Uganda Cassava Brown Streak Virus (UCBSV) and CBSV.

CMD continues to threaten cassava production in the Lake Victoria and Lake Kyoga sub-regions, reducing yields by as much as 80 per cent. Each year, it is estimated that at least 30 per cent of the cassava harvest in sub-Saharan Africa is lost to CMD alone. However, CBSD is considered a more immediate threat than CMD in East Africa because of both its recent rapid increase in distribution and the dramatic effects on yield and quality of cassava storage roots.

CBSD is poised to threaten production of the crop throughout the continent. An estimated 75 per cent of Ugandan farmers grow cassava, [and] CBSD is the main cause of yield losses. CBSD was present in 51 out of 54 districts surveyed in 2014.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_. It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 per cent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 per cent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting and vector control. However, these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

Recent outbreaks of CBSD appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). CBSV is a particular threat to new crop varieties developed with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed which are geared towards local viral populations.
