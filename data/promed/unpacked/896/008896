Movements of fish in and out of a North Yorkshire fishery have been
restricted following the confirmation of the serious viral fish
disease, Koi Herpesvirus (KHV) disease.
Defra has issued a Designated Area Order prohibiting the movement of
fish to and from Redwood Park Lake, Tollerton, York, North Yorkshire.

Samples were taken from the affected fishery following reported deaths of fish.
KHV Disease affects common carp and carp varieties such as Koi. It
can result in high rates of fish mortalities.
There are no implications for human health.
It became a legal obligation to notify suspicion of KHV Disease on 6
Apr 2007. The measures developed in partnership between government
and industry to help combat outbreaks were announced on 21 May 2007.
Suspicion of the presence of the disease should be immediately
reported to: the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science (Cefas) in Weymouth. Tel: 01305-206673/206674; Email:
<fish.health.inspectorate@cefas.co.uk>.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.
KHV was 1st isolated in the UK in 2000 during a disease outbreak in
northern England. Outbreaks of clinical disease with signs similar to
KHV disease had been reported in 1998 and 1999. More KHV outbreaks
were confirmed in each of the years 2001-2003 using PCR and cell
culture-based assays. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples
taken in 1996 during an unexplained mass-mortality of koi and common
carp in the UK.
