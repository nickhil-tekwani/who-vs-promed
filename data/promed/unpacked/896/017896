In Ukraine one man was diagnosed with anthrax over the weekend, and 5 other
people were hospitalized after showing symptoms of having contracted the
disease, the Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday.
The man worked as a butcher at a farm in the Kherson region. Veterinarians
later found that 11 cows at the farm were suffering from the disease, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
