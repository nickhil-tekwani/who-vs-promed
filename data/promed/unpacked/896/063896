E. COLI, FOODBORNE OUTBREAK - USA (INDIANA)

In May, the Indiana State Department of Health, in collaboration with the
Johnson and Marion County (IN) Health Departments investigated an outbreak
of E. coli O157:H7. Twenty-seven confirmed cases were eventually
identified. None developed HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome], and none died.
A case control study identified one particular franchise of a restaurant
chain as the source (Odds ratio undefined, p = 0.014) and implicated cole
slaw (OR undefined, p = 0.027) as the food vehicle responsible. All cases
visited this restaurant on May 4-6, 1998. A consumer sample of cole slaw
yielded E. coli O157:H7 which shared the same PFGE [pulsed field gel
electrophoresis] pattern as the cases.
A phenotypic variant of E. coli O157:H7 was recovered from several
patient's fecal specimens and the single cole slaw sample. This strain does
not ferment sorbitol in 24 hours, produces cytotoxins (Shiga-like toxins,
SLT), glucuronidase and urease. Urease production occurred after 48 hours.
To our knowledge, this is the first documented outbreak in United States
involving E. coli O157:H7 with these phenotypic characteristics. Hayes
reported (Journal Clinical Microbiology (JCM) Vol 33, No 12, Dec. 1995, p
3347-3348) this variant from a single case involving a 20-year-old female
with bloody diarrhea living in the State of Washington, USA. During the
course of our investigation in Indiana, two additional cases were
identified with these characteristics but with PFGE patterns different from
the outbreak pattern.
A review of cole slaw preparation procedures at the restaurant revealed
that food service workers at the implicated restaurant were removing the
outer leaves but were not washing cabbage heads prior to shredding. This
was not consistent with the restaurant chain's standard operating
procedures, which requires the washing of cabbage prior to shredding. The
CDC and FDA are collaborating on the cabbage traceback investigation and
environmental sampling.
