Re: ProMED-mail Anthrax, bison - Canada (15): (NT) MS, conf. 20100901.3127
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak in the Mackenzie herd appears to be over -- no new cases
detected beyond the 10 previously reported. All of the cases were
found in one general area, with no cases detected elsewhere in the
Mackenzie bison range during the surveillance flights. All of the
mortalities were mature bulls.

This fall [2010] we will be reviewing the data from both the
Mackenzie and Slave River Lowland outbreaks in 2010, and comparing to
previous outbreaks to see what else can be learned from these cases.

[Our thanks to Brett for this good news. Their searches are thorough
so it can be safely assumed that this outbreak is finished. The 1st
frost will be in a week or 10 days and these have always marked the
end of any northern anthrax season. - Mod.MHJ]
