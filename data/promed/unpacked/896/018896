First report of WNV from Indiana
--------------------------------
The Marion County Health Department brought a dead crow found on the south
east side of Indianapolis to the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH)
for testing on 16 Aug 2001. The Molecular Virology Laboratory at ISDH found
the crow to be positive on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) to be positive for West Nile virus RNA on 20 Aug. The test was
repeated on 21 Aug with the same results. Samples have been sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for independent confirmation.
Citizens in the area have been alerted through news media to take standard
precautions regarding mosquito biting and elimination of containers in
which vector mosquitoes can breed. The Marion County health department is
increasing mosquito control activities in the vicinity of the city where
the crow was found. ISDH and Marion County personnel will be working during
the next several weeks to try to delineate the extent and intensity of
transmission in the area. This will be done through increasing surveillance
for dead crows and blue jays, trapping mosquitoes for virus detection, and
capturing and [testing blood from wild birds in the area.
At this time there are no reports of human cases. We will keep you informed
of further developments.

[Infected birds are apparently moving west, both north and south of the
Great Lakes, and being preyed on by crows and blue jays which, if they have
not already been infected by mosquito bite will get infected through the
gut. - Mod.JW
