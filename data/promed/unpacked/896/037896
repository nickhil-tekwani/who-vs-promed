[In 2012, Bhutan reported 14 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1. The event was resolved 17 Apr 2013. The event summary and map are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=11465.

For this current outbreak, the source of infection has not been determined. According to comments made in the epidemiologic section of the report, "none of the mentioned sources of infection could be ascertained." However, one should note that for the event reported in 2012, the introduction of new animals and the illegal movement of animals were identified as the source of infection. For this outbreak reported in Thimphu, these sources as well as the role of wildlife should not be completely discounted, especially given the occurrence of HPAI in the area.

Bhutan, officially the Kingdom of Bhutan, is a landlocked country in South Asia at the eastern end of the Himalayas. It is bordered to the north by China and to the south, east and west by India. To the west, it is separated from Nepal by the Indian state of Sikkim, while farther south it is separated from Bangladesh by the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan).
