The spread of anthrax in Dohuk province in the Kurdistan region has resulted in the death of dozens of cattle, according to a Rudaw report. The sudden spread of the disease has put fear in the heart of local farmers and authorities, as they are worried that the disease may spread to other parts of the region.

Anthrax is a bacterial pathogen in livestock and wild animals. Ruminants such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible, and horses can also be infected. Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected.

When conditions become favorable, the spores germinate into colonies of bacteria. An example would be a grazing cow that ingests spores that in the cow, germinate, grow spread, and eventually kill the animal. Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. This spore-forming bacteria can survive in the environment for decades because of its ability to resist heat, cold, drying, etc. This is usually the infectious stage of anthrax.

There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of anthrax. People get anthrax by handling contaminated animal or animal products, consuming undercooked meat of infected animals, and more recently, intentional release of spores. There are 3 types of human anthrax with differing degrees of seriousness: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation.

[This is a problematic report, lacking details other than there is a livestock emergence. Hopefully, the government will report this latest series of deaths (and cases) to OIE in Paris and we may see better what happened. This province is enzootic for anthrax for many years and the veterinary service is failing to control the situation. While the livestock vaccine, Sterne, is one of the cheapest vaccines in the world, if you lack the funds to either make or buy it in sufficient volumes to protect your cattle in the at-risk region, you are in deep trouble. Regular annual vaccination of livestock throughout an at-risk area will cause the disease to disappear and eventually, in spite of claims of decadal spore survival, the pathogen can be eradicated and has been by an increasing number of countries once cursed with this disease.

It is winter in Iraq and not the normal season for anthrax outbreaks and nor for biting fly activity. The deaths are described as "sudden" in large numbers. This suggests that there might be a possibility that the cattle were being fed contaminated feed. Multiple deaths over an extended area would persuade folk not to butcher carcasses as they will do with sporadic cattle deaths, which might explain why there are no reports (yet) of human cases and deaths. Let's keep our fingers crossed.

Dohuk is the capital of the Kurdish regional government's Dohuk governorate. Dohuk province in the north of the country can be located on the map at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/iraq.pdf. When I visited Erzurum in eastern Turkey in 2006, it was made clear to me that their southern border with Iraq was porous to livestock movements and therefore to the anthrax situations in the adjoining 2 countries. Put another way, the disease was enzootic in the Kurdish areas. Dohuk (also spelled Dahuk) forms about 3 quarters of the Iraq/Turkey border. Elsewhere, the disease situation is currently unknown, as the veterinary services are less than rudimentary. - Mod.MHJ
