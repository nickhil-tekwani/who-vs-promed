Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of
Agriculture, said that based on shipping and delivery dates, illness
onset dates and other traceback information investigators have
determined that iceberg lettuce from California is believed to be the
source of the outbreak [of _E. coli_ O157].

Holton said on 14 Oct 2008 that the food and drug branch of the
California Department of Public Health has started its own
investigation in that state. A spokesman for the California health
department could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Michigan Department of Community Health linked the outbreak to
bagged, industrial-size packages of iceberg lettuce on 26 Sep 2008
and named Detroit processor Aunt Mid's as the distributor. However,
Aunt Mid's was sourcing from multiple growers in multiple states,
including California, when the outbreak started, and it was unclear
at that time where the tainted product was sourced.

Holton said on 14 Oct 2008 that it remained unclear where in the
supply chain the product was contaminated.

Dominic Riggio, Aunt Mid's president, said the company resumed
processing iceberg lettuce 9 Oct 2008.

Holton said that Aunt Mid's will test each lot of the product for 30
days and report the findings to the state department of agriculture,
which also will perform random tests during that period.

There have been 38 reported illnesses in Michigan and 21
hospitalizations. There also have been 9 illnesses reported in
Illinois and 3 in Ontario. No deaths have been associated with the outbreak.

[Another outbreak associated with bagged produce. Like ground beef,
bagged produce may be from multiple plants (or animals) and increases
the risk of transmission of infection. - Mod.LL]
