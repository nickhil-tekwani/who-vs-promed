A 43 year old woman suspected of contracting bird flu died on Saturday
morning [17 Jan 2009], only hours after being admitted to Tangerang General
Hospital in Banten. But the family of the deceased was uncertain about the
cause of death. "A doctor at the hospital told me she died of bird flu,"
the mother of the woman said on Saturday. The hospital has not yet
confirmed the cause of death. The hospital's director could not be reached.

According to the mother, her daughter came down with a high fever,
breathing difficulties, and a severe cough on Tuesday [12 Jan 2009]. She
was taken to a health center in Cengkareng, but she did not get better, the
mother said. Early Saturday [17 Jan 2009] morning, the family decided to
take her to the hospital. She was immediately taken to a bird flu isolation
unit. She was pronounced dead at around 9:00 a.m.
