A 7-year-old girl, a resident of Archuleta County, CO, presented to a small community emergency room (ER) with a fever of 107 F and seizures on the evening of 24 Aug 2012. She was transported to a pediatric ICU in Denver, where she deteriorated into severe septic shock. Further history revealed that she was playing with a dead skunk near her home some days before the onset of fever, and that she received multiple flea bites from fleas on the skunk carcass. Blood cultures have confirmed _Yersinia pestis_ and clinically she has septicemic plague. She remains in critical condition.
