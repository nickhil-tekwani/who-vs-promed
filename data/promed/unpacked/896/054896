No more Canadian health workers to Africa, until...
---------------------------------------------------
Health minister Rona Ambrose says no more Canadian health workers will be going to West Africa to help in the fight against Ebola until "medical evacuation is guaranteed". She said the countries most affected by Ebola don't have the necessary equipment to deal with an influx of health care workers who could become infected with the virus. Canada has an agreement with a US charter, but other countries have similar arrangements with the same company. "It's one thing to have an arrangement, but if there was more than a few people sick, a number of countries would be in a very difficult position," Ambrose said on Monday [20 Oct 2014]...

Meanwhile, drills held on the weekend to ensure medical experts can quickly respond to a 1st Ebola case in Canada have been declared a success. On Sunday [19 Oct 2014] in Halifax, members of the Ebola rapid response team from Ottawa practised how they would help local and provincial health officials. A smaller drill in Ottawa on Friday [17 Oct 2014] looked at how quickly the team could get together with the proper gear and equipment in one of 4 designated aircraft. Gregory Taylor, the chief public health officer of Canada, announced on Monday that organizers were "delighted and said (the Halifax trial) went extremely well. We have other provinces put up their hands to say that we would like to try this as well," he said. As part of the response, vials of Canada's experimental Ebola vaccine go to the affected hospital as an added precaution. Taylor said previous experience with SARS, H1N1 and H5N1 has "strengthened Canada's preparedness for public health risks or outbreaks..." -- more

[2] China, Taiwan: prevention, aid

China working to prevent Ebola at home, providing aid to Africa
---------------------------------------------------------------
It remains to be seen how China's health care system and tightly scripted state media, will respond if and when the country registers an Ebola case within its borders. Last week [12-18 Oct 2014], a Nigerian man with Ebola symptoms was quarantined after flying to the Chinese city Ningbo, following a stopover in Taiwan. The man's temperature later returned to normal and authorities determined he was not carrying the disease. But that information was relayed to the public [not by Beijing but] by health officials in neighboring Taiwan, who said they had spoken to their counterparts in China.

China has not yet confirmed any cases of Ebola within its borders, but the country is taking steps to help fight the disease in West Africa, and prevent it from entering its borders. Beijing invested heavily in Africa over the last decade, and Chinese state media estimate there are more than 20 000 Chinese citizens living in the 3 countries worst hit by Ebola: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. State media also estimate that the country's southern Guangdong province is home to hundreds of thousands of Africans, with some 40 000 visitors arriving from Africa every month.

"With international travel and the high number of cases that there currently are in West Africa, and we've seen in the last few weeks the cases reported in the US and Spain, I wouldn't say it's a matter of time, but there is the need to remain vigilant," said Martin Taylor, who leads the World Health Organization's work in preventing Ebola from spreading to China.

He said China increased screening at all ports of entry and provided guidance for health care workers throughout the country on monitoring Ebola. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said Beijing has been in close communication with the US and African countries to fight Ebola, and China has sent medical experts to Africa and delivered emergency assistance in cash and food.

Drug development
----------------
A Chinese pharmaceutical company with close links to the military requested quick approval from the Chinese government for an experimental drug to treat Ebola. The Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd hopes to file for approval from China's Food and Drug Administration for the drug. So far the company has only tested the treatment on mice, but wants to stage clinical trials of the medicine before the end of this year.

Food aid
--------
The UN announced on Monday [20 Oct 2014] that China so far has donated USD 6 million to the World Food Program to help alleviate food shortages in the 3 African countries worst affected by the Ebola virus. "I am asking where are the Chinese billionaires and their potential impact?" said Brett Rierson, the World Food Program's representative in China. "Because this is the time that they could really have such a huge impact. I think you can ask the same thing of the corporate sector, being the largest investors in West Africa right now, this would be the time that the corporates could really step up and have a massive impact, a life-saving impact."

[3] France: rapid bedside diagnostic test

French researchers develop quick Ebola diagnosis device
-------------------------------------------------------
The new tool, developed by France's Atomic Energy Commission, could allow doctors to diagnose a patient with suspected Ebola in under 15 minutes.

France's Atomic Energy Commission said that the device, which has undergone trials at a high-security institute for validating the technique and prototype, would be available in Ebola-hit countries by the end of October [2014] for a clinical trial. It further added that the tool, not yet approved by regulators, works by monoclonal antibodies reacting to the presence of virus in a tiny sample, which can be a drop of blood, plasma or urine.

French pharmaceutical company Vedalab is turning the process into a user-friendly kit called Ebola eZYSCREEN. Similar to a DIY pregnancy test, a positive result sees a small stripe showing up in a results window on the hand-held device. The kit is simple to use in the field without any additional equipment, said the CEA, which also does non-nuclear research with a possible military or security application. "Current tests, which are based on genetic detection of the virus, are highly sensitive but need special equipment, take between 2 and a quarter and 2 and a half hours and can only be carried out in a lab," the commission explained...

Other pharmaceutical teams are also working on fast diagnostic tools for Ebola. They include Primerdesign, a spinoff company of Britain's University of Southampton, and Corgenix Medical Corp of the United States. The test is for the so-called Zaire ebolavirus, the strain now circulating in West Africa.

[4] UK: more airports beginning Ebola screening
Date: Tue 21 Oct 2014

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/gatwick-begins-ebola-screening


Passengers from West Africa will be questioned and have temperatures checked
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Screening for Ebola has begun at Gatwick airport as of Tuesday [21 Oct 2014], Public Health England (PHE) has announced. It will start in the north terminal, followed by the south terminal from Wednesday [22 Oct 2014], then the St Pancras Eurostar train station later in the week. "This expands the screening initiated at Heathrow last week, which is going well," a PHE spokesman said. "Manchester and Birmingham airports will follow in the coming weeks." The screening is taking place for passengers identified by Border Force officers as having travelled from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Passengers have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients. Based on the information provided and their temperature, passengers will
- either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey
- or undergo a clinical assessment by PHE staff and if necessary be transferred to hospital for further tests.

"Screening is being undertaken to help ensure individuals arriving from high-risk areas know what to do if they start feeling ill, and can receive expert advice immediately," said the PHE spokesman. "We are also providing all general practices, emergency departments, and pharmacies in England with awareness posters from this week. Public Health England will continue to consider other appropriate additional measures."

Canadian researchers have argued that screening on exit is the best way to stop Ebola-infected people boarding flights out of Africa. The team from St Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada, said only 3 people a month with Ebola were likely to try and fly out of west Africa -- and that restricting air travel was harmful to the economies of the countries fighting the epidemic, while doing little to protect the west.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has announced a new program to monitor the health of anyone returning to the USA from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa. The program will begin Monday [27 Oct 2014], Thomas Frieden, director of CDC, said on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014]. Passengers will be monitored for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola.

The program goes beyond the screening at airports that passengers arriving from Ebola-affected countries have been getting since [11 Oct 2014]. It will be done in the 6 states where 70 percent of travelers from Ebola-affected countries arrive: New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey, Frieden said." ...

Ohio Department of Health [ODH]: no confirmed cases of Ebola in Ohio

The list consists of people who came into some kind of contact with the nurse who contracted Ebola from her [caring for] an infected man at a Dallas hospital. That man later died from the disease...

It is anticipated that the contacts on ODH's list will be removed from the list between [31 Oct and 4 Nov 2014].

Of the 3 people that are being quarantined, one is Vinson's stepfather. The other 2 newly quarantined people reside in Cuyahoga County and Summit County, according to authorities...

Tier No. 1 is the group that is in quarantine. According to the ODH, this tier has enforced restrictions on movement and travel, their temperature is taken twice daily, they're in communication with a public health contact and they are not allowed to do any commercial traveling. This group had direct skin contact with an Ebola patient... -- more

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014] will begin limiting flights carrying passengers from 3 West African countries affected by Ebola to arrival at 5 US airports. The move represents only a slight change to flight traffic from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea because most passengers from these countries already arrive in the US at the 5 designated airports, where extra Ebola screening measures are in place... -- more
