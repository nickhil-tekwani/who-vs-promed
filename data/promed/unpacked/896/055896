The UN Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] has collected a virus sample from a cow infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in North Korea, a US radio report said.

The Washington-based Radio Free Asia reported Tuesday [29 Apr 2014] that the UN body is taking steps to send the sample to a lab of the World Organization for Animal Health in China for analysis.

In February [2014], the North's state media reported that the country had culled 2900 pigs as a preventive measure to stop the spread of FMD and buried about 360 others that have died from the disease.

The disease has continued to spread, however, due to a lack of vaccines, diagnostic means, and disinfectants.

Still, North Korea remained [silent] for over 2 months on South Korea's offer of assistance to help contain the viral disease.

FMD is an infectious and sometimes fatal disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs, cattle, deer, and sheep.

FAO mission to assist with response to outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Democratic People's Republic of Korea
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 18 Feb 2014 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) reported a significant outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in 17 pig farms in the Pyongyang area. As a result hundreds of pigs had to be sacrificed, and thousands were affected. The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) of DPRK requested emergency assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to increase the national ability for disease diagnosis and control.

In mid-March [2014], another outbreak in the Cholwen area affected draught cattle. On 14 Mar 2014 a team from the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES-AH) at FAO led a week-long mission to DPRK to support the Government's response to FMD outbreaks. The team firstly assessed the FMD outbreaks and reviewed the control measures and diagnostic procedures taken by DPRK authorities in order to provide advice on how to improve these measures and laboratory procedures. With regard to policy, FAO advised on preparedness, response, and contingency plans including awareness, early detection, diagnostic capabilities, and appropriate risk reduction measures to better control the disease. In view of a more sustainable approach to FMD outbreaks in the future, FAO will assist the Government of DPRK to develop an action plan for managing short- and medium-term control measures.

This last objective will provide the DPRK Government with the necessary tools to control such outbreaks autonomously in the future. The cause of the outbreak remains unclear although low biosecurity levels may have contributed to the resurgence of the disease since the last outbreak in 2011. Furthermore, limited means, including inadequate equipment (that is, boots, soap, tap water, and disposable clothing) and a lack of active surveillance data since 2011 delayed the potential of a rapid and efficient response to the outbreak.

While it was possible to ascertain the clinical diagnosis, the national reference laboratories are not equipped for a laboratory diagnosis of the disease. The virus typing needs to be done in an international reference laboratory, for which FAO provided sample collection and shipping materials. Further study of the virus strain is also necessary to support efficient vaccination because the vaccine is strain specific. While the country currently lacks available vaccine to prevent the disease, OIE will provide some from its vaccine bank. The FAO team advised to use the limited stock in Cholwen for the recent outbreak in draught cattle. Goats, which are an important source of protein in rural areas, can also be affected by FMD and need to be monitored for the disease.

The FAO team discussed an action plan with the DPRK CVO and his staff, advising on the need to: i) implement control and surveillance guidelines detailed in 2011 to isolate farms and stop all traffic of animals and animal products in larger areas; ii) continue to raise awareness and promote early detection; iii) maintain isolation measures in pig farms for 2 to 4 months after the last FMD signs have been observed; iv) collect more samples and dispatch as soon as possible for test and analysis; and v) implement strategic vaccination in the event of more vaccine becoming available in the future.

In the immediate future, the FAO team recommended that the Government of DPRK protect those parts of the country that are still FMD-free and "freeze" the FMD situation within clusters for at least 3 months. This can be done through prohibiting the movement of live animals, except for those destined for direct slaughter, and raising awareness of FMD and basic biosecurity amongst farm workers. Obtaining more epidemiological information and keeping records of all events with possible epidemiological significance on industrial pig farms are also key to increasing knowledge on how to combat the disease more effectively during a potential future outbreak.

In the mid- to long-term, FAO recommended that if more vaccine becomes available, the Government of DPRK develop a strategic vaccination plan targeting the most vulnerable and valuable sub-sectors, particularly draught animals. In order to gain information on regional diseases and the control measures implemented by neighbouring countries FAO also recommended that the Government of DPRK participate as observer in the Southeast Asia and China FMD campaign. As a result of this mission, FAO is considering a new emergency Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) to enhance laboratory, biosecurity and epidemiological capacities in DPRK.

[Since the start of the event on 8 Jan 2014, North Korea reported to the OIE 24 FMD outbreaks; the most recent follow-up report was submitted on 2 Apr 2014. For the full reports and an interactive map showing the location of the outbreaks, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14807.

An update with official information on the further spread of the disease since late March 2014, is long due. The exhaustive and highly informative FAO report (item [2] above) provides insight about the severity of the situation. It also includes pictures of clinical cases in cattle (see source URL for [2] above).

According to the 3 reports submitted by N Korea to the OIE, the causative agent is FMDV serotype O. ProMED-mail commented on 8 Apr 2014: "The continuous circulation of the virus, affecting both swine and cattle, underlines the need for early submission of samples to an international FMD reference laboratory for confirmation of the serotyping and for genotyping" (see 20140408.2390501). According to the recent information (item [1] above) the samples are eventually to reach an international laboratory in China. OIE's reference FMD laboratory in China is the National Foot and Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Gansu province. For the selection of the right vaccine strain, accurate serotyping is crucial; genotyping is needed as well.

The invaluable involvement of FMD reference laboratories in the efforts of countries to control FMD epizootics has been recently demonstrated again in the Mongolian experience (see 20140429.2438236). - Mod.AS
