Asian tiger mosquitoes (_Aedes albopictus_) were identified last week
in the 11 000 block of Dodson St. in the city of El Monte. This
aggressive day-biting mosquito is not native to California and has not
been seen in the San Gabriel Valley since 2001, when it was
accidentally imported in shipments of _Dracena_ spp. or "Lucky Bamboo"
plants from Southeast Asia.

The San Gabriel Valley Mosquito & Vector Control District is working
with the California Department of Public Health, Vector-Borne Disease
Section and the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District to
evaluate the extent of the infestation and will aggressively target
problem areas to prevent its spread. "Our goal is to eradicate this
population‚" said Kenn Fujioka, the district's assistant manager.
"We definitely do not want this mosquito to become established in our
communities."

The district will expand the search this week and go door-to-door in
surrounding neighborhoods to undertake control measures including
education, source reduction, larval control, and local ground-based
adulticiding (fogging) as necessary to target adult mosquitoes.
Fogging will begin as early as Fri 16 Sep 2011 in the immediate
infestation area. Residents in these areas will receive a minimum of
24 hour notice prior to any adult mosquito control operations.

Unlike our most common species in the San Gabriel Valley, this tiny
(approx. 6 mm) distinctive black and white mosquito is a very
aggressive "day-biter." While they may be active around dusk and dawn,
it is their daytime biting habits that are most characteristic.

Residents experiencing mosquito bites during the day are urged to
report them to the district. "We need the public's help on this
one‚" urged Fujioka, "Anything holding even the smallest amount of
water must be overturned and stored upside down. Please survey your
property and discard any unneeded containers, cans, buckets, and
tires, or move them into the garage/shed." This mosquito is even known
to lay eggs in water-filled holes in asphalt and concrete.

Native to Southeast Asia, this mosquito has invaded other countries
through international transport of goods and travel. It was 1st found
in the United States in 1985 and has since spread throughout the
southeast and eastern US.

_Aedes albopictus_ is an efficient vector (transmitter) of dengue,
yellow fever, chikungunya, and several viruses that can cause
encephalitis. This species is responsible for recent outbreaks of
dengue virus in south Florida, Texas, and Hawaii, a virus not seen in
the continental United States since 1946 [more accurately, since 1946
until it appeared and was locally transmitted in Florida in 2009 and
2010, as reported in ProMED-mail archive no. 20100915.3345. -
Mod.TY].

Pictures of this mosquito and information about control measures can
be found on the district's website at http://www.SGVmosquito.org.

Residents are urged to call or use the "Report a Problem" link to
report possible sightings.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Gurfield for sending in the above report.

The University of California, Riverside's Center for Invasive Species
Research reported, "...isolated introductions of this mosquito were
detected and eradicated in California in 1971 and 1987. In 2001, the
Asian tiger mosquito was found in 2 northern and 4 southern counties
of California. This mosquito did not spread to California from the
ongoing invasion in eastern and central U.S. but was introduced into
the state in shipments of ornamental bamboo ("Lucky Bamboo") from
South China. Rapid detection of introduction and control efforts
prohibited the spread of this species throughout California."

_Ae. albopictus_ was also found in southern California in 2004 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20040920.2598) but was eliminated.

As indicated above, _Ae. albopictus_ is very versatile in its breeding
sites, so eradication will be a significant challenge. ProMED will be
interested in the progress of the control program as it goes forward.
