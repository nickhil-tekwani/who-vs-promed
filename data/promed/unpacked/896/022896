Gardeners warned of deadly potting mix
-----------------------------------------
Gardeners are being warned to handle potting mix with great care, after 3
deaths in Victoria were linked to a bacteria found in the mix. Victorian
Health Minister Bronwyn Pike said 3 Victorians died in 2004 from
_Legionella longbeachae_, a bacterium commonly found in potting mix.
In at least 2 of the cases, the victims had been exposed to potting mix
before their deaths, and 24 other cases of related illness were reported,
she said. In a 3rd fatal case, potting mix was the likely cause of death,
but this is yet to be fully confirmed, a spokesman for Ms. Pike said.
Acting chief health officer John Carnie said different types of legionella
bacteria all caused a rare form of pneumonia, and early symptoms included
fever, chills, headaches, shortness of breath, dry cough and muscle aches
and pain.
Ms. Pike said gardeners using potting mix should wear a mask to avoid
breathing in dust, wear eye protection and wash hands and work clothes
afterwards.
Gardeners should not shake a potting mix bag, and should moisten the
contents of a bag before opening it at arm's length. Potting mix should be
stored in a cool location and cleaned up while the product is damp.

[_L. longbeachae_, originally described in 1981 (1), has been associated
with lower respiratory infection in normal and immunocompromised
individuals. The organism, especially in Australia, appears to be unique in
being associated with pneumonia after exposure to soil. The organism has
been found in soil and potting mixes from Australia but not from potting
mix made in Europe.
Importantly, the legionellae from the soil and patients appear to be
closely related (2,3). However, cases of _L. longbeachae_ (see ProMED-mail
posting: Legionellosis, potting soil - USA: May-Jun 2000 (20000904.1503))
associated with potting soil have been described in the USA and Japan (4,5)
as well.
