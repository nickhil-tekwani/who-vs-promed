E. coli confirmed in five local kids
------------------------------------
At least five cases of a potentially deadly strain of the _E. coli_
bacteria have been confirmed in the Columbus area. The Franklin County
Health Department says a fifth case of _E. coli_ [infection is being
examined along with more than two dozen cases from the southwestern portion
of the state.

Parents of several children in two separate daycare centers on the west
side of Columbus were told Wednesday to collect stool samples from their
children after it was confirmed that four kids from those centers have the
dangerous strain of _E. coli_ poisoning.
Three kids from one daycare center and one from a neighboring center have
been infected, possibly through dirty diapers. A fifth case was confirmed
Thursday in a 3 year old. That case was not related to those at the daycare
centers.
The Ohio Department of Health is concerned about a doubling of the usual
cases of the bacteria in the Cincinnati area and says it may just be the
tip of the iceberg, the beginning signs of a food poisoning outbreak whose
source health officials are completely unaware of.
The state health lab has about 20 samples from people who are sick with _E.
coli_ and is expecting more. Most of them are people from the Cincinnati
area but officials are trying to determine of there is any connection with
the local cases. Eight cases in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and
six more in Butler County have been reported.
The Centers for Disease Control is also looking at three reported cases in
Kentucky and Indiana.
Dr. Bill Becker of the Ohio Department of Health says theyre asking where
people have been, what they've been doing, and what they've been eating,
trying to track the source of the bacteria.
Dr. Becker says the ODH participated in a conference call with the Centers
for Disease Control Tuesday to discuss the possible associations. He says
the organizations are putting together a questionnaire to see if the cases
in the Columbus and Cincinnati areas are related.
The first step is to fingerprint all of the samples from all of the people,
which is done with a DNA screening. So far, two of the samples from
southwest Ohio match.
Samples from the five sick kids in central Ohio haven't been tested yet and
there are several more samples to fingerprint from the area around
Cincinnati before it can be determined if this is an outbreak.
Doctors and other health professionals are being warned to keep their eyes
open for more cases and re-evaluate recent cases of patients with bloody
diarrhea, the hallmark sign of this deadly strain of _E. coli_ known as
O157.H7.
Young children and older people are particularly susceptible to serious
problems with this strain of _E. coli_. Five to seven percent of the people
infected with this strain suffer kidney failure. Some of those die.
Washing hands thoroughly and avoiding undercooked foods and unpasteurized
drinks can reduce a persons risk of becoming infected.
People who have [toxigenic _E. coli_ [infections may suffer from severe
diarrhea, abdominal cramps
and nausea. There is generally no fever associated with it.

[This report expands the outbreak to include 5 cases in the Columbus area.
It is as yet unclear whether all of the Ohio cases have a common source.
It is noteworthy that there has been a recall of beef patties issued by a
nationwide distributor from New England because of _E. coli_ contamination,
but there is no indication that these products are related to the Ohio
outbreak as yet. - Mods.ES/MPP
