A 5-year-old boy died Wednesday after being infected with a strain of the
_E. coli_ bacteria and 8 of his classmates at the same pre-school in
western Japan were ill, an official said. Hiroshi Inoue, a health official
with the Nara state government, said a public health center determined
Sunday that the boy was infected with the 0157:H7 strain. The official said
the boy, whose name was not released, suffered loose bowels and a stomach
ache last Thursday and was taken to a hospital the next day.
Inoue said that the state health center examined all children and staff
members at the preschool Monday and that the bacterium was also found in 2
of the other 8 children. Takeshi Hayakawa, another prefectural health
official, said one of those 2, a 5-year-old boy, was hospitalized, but his
condition was not serious. A total of 184 children attend the school, which
has 48 staff members, he said.
Inoue and Hayakawa declined to provide further details, such as how the
children became infected. The name of the school was also not released but
Inoue said it was in the city of Ikoma. Nara, the capital, is 236 miles
west of Tokyo. In 1996, more than 7400 people, most of them school
children, were sickened nationwide, many by a virulent strain of [_E.
coli_ 0157:H7. Hundreds were hospitalized and 4 died.
