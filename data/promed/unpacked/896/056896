Cambodian health officials have been sent to a northeastern district where 10 people died and more than 100 were sickened in 2 separate incidents linked to the consumption of dog meat and rice wine, a medical officer said Friday [11 Dec 2015].

Kratie provincial health department chief Chhneang Sivutha said experts from the U.N.'s World Health Organization were also investigating the incidents, both in Snuol district [Kratie province]. He said people in the province have been warned not to eat the meat of animals that have died from illness or poisoning and not to drink any wine that has not been properly inspected.

Six people died last Sunday [6 Dec 2015] after eating the barbequed carcass of a dog that had died for unknown reasons The 4 others died after drinking rice wine on Tuesday [8 Dec 2015?].

Chhneang Sivutha said samples of the dog meat and wine had been collected and sent to the Health Ministry in the capital, Phnom Penh, for laboratory testing. He said in a telephone interview that poisoning cases were not unusual, but it was rare to have so many victims at the same time.

Food safety is not a priority in Cambodia, one of Asia's poorest countries. The country has had to grapple with bird flu, with 56 confirmed cases of human infections since 2003, 37 of them fatal.

Rice wine is particularly popular in rural areas, where it is cheap and usually infused with fruits or plants that are believed to have medicinal value.

[This appears to be perhaps 2 separate events. Six people died after association with the cooked dog meat. Wine was associated with the death of 4 other individuals.

Regarding the dog, it is possible the dog died of a toxin which may have survived cooking to kill the individuals. It is unlikely it is bacterial or viral, but we do not know the temperature of the cooking or how thoroughly it was cooked. The wine may have had a mold in it or perhaps some other chemical.

How the other 90 or 100 people are involved is not entirely clear from this article. There are not time frames or clinical signs and symptoms reported, so it becomes difficult to speculate. - Mod.TG

It is difficult to imagine up to 100 people feeding on one dead dog, more likely that number resulted from a batch of bad rice wine at the Cambodian equivalent of a rave? - Mod.JW
