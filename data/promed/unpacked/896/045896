Campaigners and a former official overseeing Asia's largest tuberculosis [TB] hospital in Mumbai say staff deaths there are being under-reported, highlighting India's growing struggle to contain multi-drug resistant [MDR] forms of the contagious, airborne disease [TB].

Many of India's toughest TB cases end up in the metal cots of the state-run Sewri Hospital, where on a recent Reuters visit open wards were lined with emaciated patients, many left alone by families scared by the disease and its stigma. Medical Superintendent Rajendra Nanavare, Sewri's top doctor, says an average of 6 patients a day die at the 1200-bed hospital.

Nanavare says a dozen hospital workers had also died from TB in the last 5 years. But others say the real number of staff deaths is higher -- although they could not give a precise figure -- pointing to a public health crisis at the heart of one of the world's most densely populated cities.

"A lot of class 4 workers like the sweepers and the cleaners at the hospital leave work after they get the infection," said Prakash Devdas, president of the local workers' union. "We don't know if they're alive with the infection or dead. Nobody tracks them. That's why I said the actual number would be much higher." Campaigners blame weak infection controls, poor oversight and infrequent checks on workers in a country where the shame of TB alone drives people to suicide.

"There is so much interaction between the patients and staff. They become more vulnerable... especially if they have weak immunity," said former TB officer Mini Khetarpal, who supervised the hospital for Mumbai authorities until earlier this year [2015].

Nanavare said 69 employees has been diagnosed with TB since 2011, of whom 12 had died while 28 had been cured. A lot of staff continue to work at the hospital long after being infected.

India has the world's largest number of TB patients -- an estimated 2.6 million Indians live with the bacterial lung disease, which is spread through coughs and sneezes.

The country is second only to China in the number of patients with drug-resistant TB, a major threat to TB control with repercussions well beyond India.

In July this year [2015], a Mumbai woman who flew to Chicago was found to have the extremely drug resistant TB (XDR TB). She has since been quarantined and is under treatment there.

"Globally, XDR TB presents the greatest threat to TB control," said Brian Katzowitz, a spokesman at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the leading national public health institute in the United States.

Nerges Mistry, director of the Mumbai-based Foundation for Medical Research, investigated conditions at the Sewri hospital at the behest of city authorities in 2011. That report -- seen by Reuters but not released publicly -- found about 65 hospital staff died between 2007 and 2011, many of them cooks.

It also highlighted serious problems including inadequate record-keeping, sanitation and hygiene problems. Doctors failed to wear N-95 disposable masks, it said, a basic form of infection control recommended by the World Health Organisation [WHO]. Mistry said it was unclear if any of the proposals made were implemented. "It's a last ditch thing. You go there and you never come out," she said. Nanavare says the hospital has brought in changes to ensure better staff protection, though masks remain an "individual decision."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's manifesto ahead of last year's [2014] election accorded "high priority" to the health sector, and promised a universal health assurance plan. But he has been forced to tightly control healthcare spending as India battles to spend its way out of slow-moving recovery.

In the latest high profile case at the Sewri hospital, a nurse died in September [2015] from drug-resistant TB, prompting staff protests to demand better working conditions. High profile campaigners such Leena Menghaney, an HIV and TB activist, say still not enough is being done. "Despite increased investment in prevention and treatment of drug-resistant TB over the last decade, local authorities, the National TB Programme and policymakers in India are not directing sufficient attention to infection control," she said.

Mumbai city officials in charge of overseeing the hospital say sub-standard private care before patients are sent to Sewri must share the blame for its travails. A Reuters reporter found cats wandering around wards and few visible instructions to keep visiting relatives safe. None of the nurses wore masks and 2 said they were encouraged not to, on the grounds that they were already exposed to TB bacteria.

A 12-year-old patient wore a light green muslin mask, untied at one end. "I just removed it because I was coughing too much," she said.

A group of about 60 health experts and activists including the US-based Treatment Action Group, wrote a letter in August [2015] to the state, federal, and city authorities highlighting what they described as "dismal" conditions at the hospital. They have yet to receive a response. Sunil Khaparde, a health ministry official in New Delhi who oversees India's TB control programme, said the hospital had been asked to tighten procedures and more training was planned.

"The Sewri Hospital is in urgent need for a facelift," said Zarir Udwadia, a chest physician at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai and one of India's best-known TB experts. "More funds, more staff and more commitment are needed."

[India has a disproportionately large proportion of the world's tuberculosis cases. For a country of over 1.25 billion people, India has 17 per cent of the global population of 7.1 billion, but is estimated by WHO in 2013 (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr14_main_text.pdf) to have 24 per cent of the global TB burden. India is estimated to have the highest number of active TB cases of all countries -- 2.6 million of the 11 million cases globally. India is estimated also to have an incidence of 2.1 million cases of TB out of a global incidence of 9 million; 0.12 million of the 2.1 new cases in India were HIV-positive.

WHO estimated that 2. 2 percent of new TB cases in India (20 000 cases) and 15 percent of relapsed cases (41 000 cases) have multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr14_main_text.pdf) and about 40 percent (0.5 billion) of the Indian population is infected with TB bacteria, the vast majority of whom have latent rather than active TB (http://www.tbfacts.org/tb-india/). Poverty, crowded unsanitary living conditions, malnutrition, and other nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, and AIDS are factors that contribute to India's TB epidemic, in addition to poor quality and shortages in supply of anti-TB drugs and lack of laboratory facilities to diagnose TB and do susceptibility testing. Also, many TB patients are said to seek care with private practitioners, who are poorly trained to manage TB treatment, which contributes to the frequency of multi-drug resistance (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23008922, http://www.wired.com/2012/01/invincible-tb-india/).

Sewri Hospital is a 1200-bedded public TB hospital with a 200-bed unit for care of MDR TB patients in the Sewri section of South Mumbai. A January 2012 news article reported that a BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) team comprising "top officials" visited the TB hospital and made an evaluation of its infrastructure and infection control practices and cleanliness (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Sewri-TB-hospital-is-in-for-upgrade/articleshow/11657419.cms). This article goes on to say, employees requested "better working conditions, masks, better hygiene, nutrition, risk allowance, and employment of next of kin on compassionate grounds. But municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar said the employees need not worry about catching an infection. "We test all staff members every quarter. They do not have anything to worry about."

Despite concerns about infection control at Sewri Hospital, a group of patients with what was described at the time as "totally drug resistant" TB was transferred in Jan 2012 to Sewri Hospital. A news article at the time (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/print/1978) noted, "The Sewri TB hospital, however, has for years been something of a grisly joke among health professionals in Mumbai; its crumbling edifice and stained walls are regarded as an outward sign of its neglect by city health authorities and the inadequate training provided to its non-medical staff. To take just one example, in 2006 the hospital's operating theatres were found to be in such disrepair and staffed by so few doctors that it was decided they should stop performing surgeries altogether -- an odd decision for a tuberculosis hospital in a city riddled with tuberculosis; the operating theatres lay idle for six years, though they re-opened earlier in 2012.

"To make matters worse, members of the hospital's own staff publicly threatened to quit in protest over the decision to shift the patients to Sewri. Lower-rung workers at the hospital had long complained that they were not given protective items like masks and gloves while working in an obviously contagious environment. According to newspaper reports from January, roughly 30 employees at the hospital had died of tuberculosis in the previous five years; in January [2012] when the increased drug-resistance patients were being shifted to Sewri, two resident doctors and another 17 hospital staffers were undergoing their own treatment for tuberculosis. It was not hard to see why the arrival of 12 patients with an apparently untreatable strain of the disease sowed panic among the staff, especially for those who would be in closest contact with them.

"Nerges Mistry, a director at the Foundation for Medical Research in Mumbai, told me that poor conditions at a facility like Sewri carried considerable risk for its staff. "For the doctor it's still relatively okay -- they come in and see a patient for ten or 15 minutes while on their rounds," she said. "Their interaction is limited. But what about the ward boys? Or the nurses? This is how TB spreads, from sustained exposure to people with active TB. So you work in that environment, and then go home, usually to a low-income community, where people already live in tightly packed conditions. To keep costs down, the authorities are putting their own workers at risk. But they're putting whole communities at risk too."

In February 2015, another news article said that nothing much had changed and 50 percent of positions at the hospital went unfilled because people feared the risk of acquiring TB (http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/this-budget-bmc-vows-to-improve-sewri-tb-hospital/). A news article reported in July 2015, "since 1999, 190 employees have been infected with TB at the hospital, of which 82 have died [including 2 physicians]. On an average 12 employees in Sewri TB Hospital contract TB every year" (http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bmc-doctor-dies-of-extremely-drug-resistant-tb-on-monday-2106856).
