Corvallis School District has announced 2 new laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis at Corvallis High School. Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, has broken out at local schools several times this school year [2014-15]. A Benton County Health Department official said there have been close to 40 confirmed cases in the county between October 2014 and March 2015.

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable illness that is particularly dangerous to infants. It is marked by coughing so vigorous that the afflicted person must struggle for breath, causing a whooping sound. Health officials emphasize that all people coming into contact with infants have a pertussis vaccination to reduce the risk of infecting the child.

Parents in the Radnor Township School District are on the lookout for whooping cough symptoms in the wake of 8 confirmed cases at 2 schools. "There have now been a total of 7 confirmed cases of pertussis at Radnor High School since [20 Mar 2015], in addition to one confirmed case at Radnor Middle School," the district said in Friday [10 Apr 2015] statement.

According to school officials, 6 of the 7 high school students stricken with the highly contagious respiratory disease had been vaccinated, "Out of the entire Radnor High School student body, 7 students are currently exempt from vaccinations for medical or religious reasons," the statement said. "Radnor High School's nurse has called the parents of all of these students in order to discuss the importance of vaccination. Ultimately it's going to be their choice," said district spokesman Michael Petitti.

Before pertussis vaccines became widely available in the 1940s, about 200 000 children got sick with it each year in the USA and about 9000 died as a result of the infection, according to the CDC website. Today, roughly 10 000 to 40 000 cases are reported each year that result in 10 to 20 deaths.

Though there is no federal requirement, all 50 states have laws requiring certain vaccines for students, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures through 3 Mar 2015. Every state except West Virginia and Mississippi grants religious exemptions for people who do not believe in immunizations, and 20 states, including Pennsylvania, allow philosophical exemptions for objections on personal, moral, or other grounds.

Unofficial figures from the Pennsylvania Department of Health have Delaware County ranked 5th, behind Philadelphia, Allegheny, Bucks, and Montgomery counties, with 102 confirmed pertussis cases since 2013. The numbers from the state did not appear to account for the Radnor cases. Unlike Bucks, Chester, and Montgomery counties, Delaware County does not have its own health department.

Health officials in York said Fri 27 Mar 2015, 3 students at a city school came down with whooping cough, and they are awaiting test results for several others who may have the illness, also called pertussis. The students attend St Patrick Catholic School.

The York City Bureau of Health said, "Children with a cough thought to be pertussis should not go to school or other public activities until being evaluated by their doctor. A laboratory test can be ordered by the doctor and a prescription for an appropriate antibiotic given in order to clear the infection. In many cases, family members may also need to be treated since secondary infections within households are common."

Children are typically vaccinated against pertussis through 5 doses of a vaccine known as DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] in early childhood, and a booster shot at age 11 or 12. The vaccination is required to attend school in Pennsylvania.

Here are the number of cases logged by the Pennsylvania Department of Health in recent years:

2010: 979 cases
2011: 742 cases
2012: 1945 cases
2013: 633
2014: 691 confirmed or probable cases as of late December [2014].

As many as 63 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, in children have been reported recently by Utah's Summit County Health Department. Pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory disease, has a 21-day incubation period.

"We will be seeing cases for a while longer," Summit County Health Department nursing director Carolyn Rose said in a telephone interview with Vaccine News Daily. "We have 62 to 63 cases, but that changes daily." To combat the spread of pertussis in its elementary schools, Park City School District officials and the health department have mandated that children who have not been vaccinated for pertussis stay home from school for 21 days or complete a course of antibiotics.

"A lot of the cases are in that 3- to 5-year range, right before kids get boosters before they go into kindergarten," Rose said.

The CDC says the best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated.

Health authorities on the Pacific Island of Guam say the pertussis, or whooping cough outbreak has reached 11 cases to date. This comes after the Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) received 3 additional laboratory confirmed cases of the vaccine-preventable disease in a 9 month old child, 3 year old child, and 41 year old adult. Investigation into the newest cases show no epidemiological linkage with each other or previous reported cases.

[Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean. A map of the island can be found at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/guam.gif.

There are likely a number of reasons for the upswing of pertussis in the USA and elsewhere, which include the well-recognized normal swings in incidence, the increase in the number of unvaccinated individuals whose parents chose not to vaccinate them, and waning immunity which has caused public health officials to advise boosters for all adults and especially pregnant women. However, research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) have been previously highlighted in ProMED-mail, reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_ which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. These changes may result in a need for modifications of the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines. - Mod.LL]
