Lettuce was the likely source of an _E. coli_ outbreak that has now
sickened 18 people, the Huntsville-Madison County Health Department's
assistant director said Tue 10 Jul 2007. Dr. Debra Williams said all
signs point to shredded lettuce served by 'Little Rosie's Taqueria'
as the probable culprit. Of the 15 people who have tested positive
for _E. coli_ O157:H7, 14 ate at the Whitesburg Drive restaurant
during 28-29 Jun 2007, she said. The other victim did not eat there.
Health officials are awaiting test results on 3 other 'Little
Rosie's' customers who have symptoms.
"We think it was a cross-contamination handling issue" by a
restaurant employee, Williams said.
Fred Grady, chief of the state health department's epidemiology
division, said it's "a little premature" to call lettuce the source
of the outbreak because his agency is still reviewing information
collected from victims and the restaurant. "There are so many things
we can't say yet because we haven't looked at the data," Grady said.
"Statistically, we ought to be able to make some pretty strong
assumptions, but (the investigation) is not nearly complete."
Alabama restaurants are required to toss fresh produce after 4 days,
so any tainted lettuce served by 'Little Rosie's' in late June 2007,
is probably long gone, Grady said. "It's safe to eat there," he said.
Health officials considered closing the popular Mexican eatery, but
Williams said the contamination was apparently just a "2-day event."
'Little Rosie's' scored a 94 out of 100 on its most recent Health
Department inspection on 29 Jun 2007.

[Salad greens have been a significant vehicle for _E. coli_ O157 in
recent years. The observation that, basically, only one restaurant
has been affected indeed suggests local contamination.
Madison County, Alabama, where Huntsville is located, is in the
northern part of the state as can be seen at
