The Georgia Department of Agriculture [GDA] announced last weekend [28 Feb-1 Mar 2015] that 2 fecal swabs taken from pigs at the Georgia Junior National Livestock Show had been found to be positive for the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv).

This is the 1st known positive to be found in Georgia. Results from 2 samples from pigs at the Georgia Junior National Livestock Show held 18-21 Feb 2015 tested positive for PEDv on 27 Feb 2015. GDA immediately responded with biosecurity measures to prevent further spread of the disease. The locations of where the positive samples came from have been visited and animal movement has been controlled.

PEDv is a highly contagious virus that has spread across the US swine industry. PEDv is not a food safety or public health risk. The Georgia Department of Agriculture is working closely with other animal industry partners to provide information about bio-security, disease prevention and control.

The incubation period for PEDv is 36 hours. Signs can emerge 4 to 5 days after exposure and vary widely depending on the age of the pig affected. Signs include off-feed, vomiting, diarrhea, and increased mortality. Pigs can also be asymptomatic carriers of the virus.

Biosecurity is the key to preventing spread of the disease. It is important to limit travel and commingling with other swine associated events or personnel. The disease can be spread by pig to pig contact and by contaminated equipment, chutes, trailers, vehicles, clothing, and personnel. All equipment should be cleaned and disinfected and all sick animals isolated. It is important to regularly observe your herd for evidence of disease.

For more information about the investigation and PEDv, please visit the Georgia Department of Agriculture website at http://www.agr.georgia.gov.

[This is interesting because the article does not elaborate on what the officials did to secure the area, or institute biosecurity measures. The first paragraph makes it sound as though the samples were taken while the pigs were at the fair, but came back positive after the animals left the exhibit. The question is how many production sites (including these show animals and other backyard production) are under quarantine as the pigs in question may well have been incubating the disease while at the show.
