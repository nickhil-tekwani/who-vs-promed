Cocoa farmers have been advised to cooperate with the division of
Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) of the Ghana Cocoa Board to
eradicate the disease that is threatening the cocoa industry. Dr.
George Opoku, Ashanti Regional Manager of the CSSVD division, who
made the call, expressed worry that some cocoa farmers were strongly
opposed to the cutting down of cocoa trees affected by the disease.
He was speaking at a day's sensitisation rally, organized by the
CSSVD division to sensitise cocoa farmers on the disease, at Badabour
near Mpasatia in the Atwima-Nwabiagya District of Ashanti Region. Dr.
Opoku said the success of the exercise depended largely on the
support of farmers whose farms had been infested with the disease. He
said government would pay a compensation of GHS 4000 (about USD 4300)
in phases of 40 percent initially and 60 percent as replanting money
to farmers who would be affected by the exercise. Dr. Opoku gave the
assurance that affected farmers would be assisted with technical
advice and hybrid cocoa seedlings for replanting. He said the hybrid
cocoa seedlings bear fruits within 2 and 3 years.
Mr. Isaac Yamoah, Nkawie District Manager of CSSVD division, said a
survey conducted showed that the disease was rampant in the area and
called on farmers to help to fight it. Opanin Kwame Ndwam, Nkawie
District Chief Farmer, pledged that all cocoa farmers in the area
would support the CSSVD division to fight the disease

[CSSVD is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV; genus
_Badnavirus_) which was 1st recorded in Ghana in 1938. Symptoms on
cocoa (_Theobroma cacao_) vary with different viral strains and may
be interveinal chlorosis, swollen stems and roots, root swelling
only, and no symptoms at all. The virus can also infect some species
in the families _Bombacaceae_, _Sterculiaceae_ (including cola nut),
and _Tiliaceae_ (including jute). CSSV is spread by several species
of mealybugs in a semi-persistent manner (retained when the vector
moults, not replicating in the insect, not transmitted congenitally).
It may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation,
but is not transmitted by contact between host plants, seed, or
pollen. The virus occurs in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Sierra Leone,
Sri Lanka, Togo, and possibly Trinidad and Cote d'Ivoire.
CSSV is indigenous to West Africa, present in forest trees and
appears to have transferred to cocoa following the introduction of
the crop. The virus causes crop losses (an estimated total of 50 000
tonnes annually in Africa), which have affected the economies of the
respective countries. It has forced migration of farmers resulting in
environmental damage due to increased clearing of forests. Disease
management has been based on a "zero tolerance" philosophy, which
required that all infected trees and neighbouring plants be removed.
In Ghana, this has resulted in the destruction of millions of cocoa
trees during the last 50 years, and many millions more are awaiting
removal. It is estimated that over 160 million trees have either died
from CSSV or have been eradicated in the whole of West Africa. With
new farms getting rapidly infected, breeding for virus or vector
resistance has become imperative.
The CSSVD division (CSSVD Control Unit) is responsible for the survey
and control of CCSV in all 6 cocoa growing regions of Ghana.
Activities include removal and destruction of CSSV infected cocoa
trees, supply of farmers with disease resistant hybrids for
replanting, and training of extension workers.
