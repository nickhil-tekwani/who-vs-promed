Farmers from Banda district of Uttar Pradesh put on record the destruction of their entire paddy crop due to a disease, which broke out after Diwali [19 Oct 2017]. Many of them were small and marginal farmers. [They] demanded that the additional district magistrate (ADM) take cognisance of this and give compensation.

The farmers claim that the paddy crop was attacked by what is locally known as the papaha disease, which has been a destructive element in the area for decades. The ADM, S.L. Sonkar, said that there will be an investigation into the cause of crop failure and the disease.

["Papaha" appears to be a local name for a tip burn and leaf drying condition of rice. It had been noted in India and elsewhere in the region since as early as 1914. There is disagreement on its possible cause which has been reported as either fungi of genus _Bipolaris_ or environmental stress factors at various times. The initial leaf tip necrosis progresses to lead to wilting and death of the whole plant. The condition is said to spread rapidly and thought to be favoured by water remaining stagnant in the fields for more than two weeks.

A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region, some of which may lead to symptoms resembling tip burn. However, some physiological disorders (such as nutrient deficiencies or toxicities) may lead to similar symptoms, so that tip burn due to different causes may occur in different areas.

In the case above, the sudden onset and fast progression of the symptoms, followed by total loss of the harvest, would suggest an infectious disease, rather than a physiological disorder which likely would have led to a less drastic effect within the given time frame. Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems above is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
