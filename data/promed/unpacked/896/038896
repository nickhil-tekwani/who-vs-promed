The Department of Rural affairs reports that a brucellosis outbreak detected in a cattle farm based in Pacios, in the municipality of Castro de Rei, is termed as "a solitary case". The incidence of this disease is very low in Galicia, compared with other parts of Spain. The Rural Department is currently investigating the cause of the outbreak. Slaughter of the affected cattle has already been ordered; the facilities will be emptied and disinfected.

[The identity of the causative pathogen -- _Brucella abortus_ or _Brucella melitensis_ -- is not given in the above report. Both zoonotic bacteriae are endemic in Spain. According to Spain's annual OIE report for 2011, 159 new outbreaks of _B. abortus_ and 362 of _B. melitensis_ were recorded during that year. Though _B.abortus_ mainly affects cattle and _B. melitensis_ is mainly an infection of sheep and goats, cattle can readily be infected by _B. melitensis_. - Mod.AS
