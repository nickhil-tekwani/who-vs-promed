Viet Nam: avian influenza situation - WHO update 14
-----------------------------------------------
As of 4 Apr 2005, the Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed 5
additional cases of human infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza
virus (see previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_03_29b/en/>).
All 5 cases are in a family from the northern port city of Haiphong. The
cluster includes the 35-year-old father, the 33-year-old mother, and their
3 daughters, aged 13 years, 10 years, and 4 months. All cases in this
family were hospitalized on 22 Mar 2005 and remain under care.
Since mid-December 2004, Viet Nam has reported 33 cases of H5N1 avian
influenza. Of these cases, 15 have been fatal. The cumulative number of
confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) since 28 Jan 2004 can be
accessed at

Viet Nam: consumption of duck blood and avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A 27-year-old Vietnamese woman who drank duck blood has contracted avian
influenza virus, which has killed 49 people in Asia. She is likely to
survive, the official Viet Nam News Agency reported on Mon 4 Apr 2005.
The woman tested positive for the H5N1 poultry virus after being admitted
to the hospital with high fever on Fri 1 Apr 2005 in the central province
of Ha Tinh, the agency's Tin Tuc (News) daily reported. Doctors were told
that the woman had drunk raw duck blood, a popular dish, in late March
2005, but she was stable and might be able to leave the hospital in a few
days, the report said.
Bird flu swept across much of Asia early last year [2004] and has killed 35
people in Viet Nam, 14 of them since the disease broke out anew in the
southern Mekong Delta in December 2004. The virus, which has also killed 12
Thais and 2 Cambodians, does not pass easily from birds to humans, and
eating infected fowl cooked properly is not dangerous.

[There have been several other reports linking the consumption of raw
poultry blood, by both adults and children, with avian influenza virus
infection. Local dietary and culinary factors may explain, in part, the
greater prevalence of human cases of avian influenza in Viet Nam than
elsewhere in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
