Officials hope quarantine will stop spread of plum pox
-----------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials admit that after testing tens of thousands of trees
for the plum pox virus, they still have no idea how the disease arrived in
the lush Niagara fruit belt. Worse, they have no idea how far afield it has
spread. Officials admit it's possible Niagara growers unwittingly shipped
virus-stricken fruit tree stock to the United States or Nova Scotia, and
sent infected ornamental trees to any of hundreds of retailers in urban
centres throughout eastern Canada.
But so far confirmed cases of the disease are limited to the Niagara
region. The latest figures from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
show the pox in 462 samples taken from 22 sites in Niagara-on-the-Lake,
Lincoln, and St. Catharines. Thirty-six growers, including 4 propagators of
tree stock, have been told that their plantings have been affected by plum
pox.
But Ken Marchant of the CFIA says extensive federal records show the 4
stricken tree stock producers have not sent any tree or grafts south of the
border in the past 2 to 4 years. Experts say that plum pox, which attacks
stone pit fruit trees and renders the fruit dry and inedible, will
typically infect a tree for 2 or 3 years before farmers notice disease
symptoms. At least 2 species of popular ornamental plants, the flowering
almond and the purple sandcherry are capable of harbouring the
virus-although no infections of ornamental plants have been uncovered in
Canada.
That hasn't stopped CFIA officials from deciding - over the protests of
several Niagara nurseries and their provincial association - to include the
popular plants in a quarantine which is expected to be imposed on
Niagara-on-the-Lake, St. Catharines, and Lincoln as early as next week.
The quarantine - which could last 3 to 7 years or even longer - is a key
element in the attempt to eradicate the virus before it can gain a foothold
in Canada.
"You only get one crack at eradication and this is it," Marchant said
yesterday. Strains of the virus have wreaked havoc on some fruit-producing
areas of Europe and the Middle East where they are now fully established,
but plum pox has only recently appeared in North America.
Plant safety officials, with the co-operation of the provincial and federal
governments and the tender fruit growers associations, plan to: quarantine
the stricken areas so no infected plant material moves outside of the
disease zone; test thoroughly to gauge the scope of the infestation; and
destroy all affected trees and all trees within a 15 metre radius of a
diseased tree. Marchant said that growers support the eradication program
even though it will cause hardship and an increase in the cost of fruit
production.
Tony DiGiovanni of Landscape Ontario said his membership - which includes
nurseries producing ornamental plants - is supportive, but just barely. He
said the quarantine could cost nurseries millions of dollars and his
members are not convinced of the scientific rationale for including the
ornamental plants in the quarantine. At a meeting with growers, government
officials and the CFIA yesterday morning, DiGiovanni asked that the
imposition of the quarantine be delayed long enough to seek out solid
evidence the ornamentals should be included in the ban. But Marchant said
that as far as he knew no delays were being planned.
