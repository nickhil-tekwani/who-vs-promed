2004/006 Occurrence of potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd) in tomato
plants in Germany
-------------------------------------------------------
The National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) of Germany recently
informed the EPPO Secretariat of the first occurrence of potato spindle
tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd - EPPO A2 list) in Germany (Nordrhein-Westfalen).
A group of about 15 tomato plants, within a stand of about 1.25 hectares,
showed typical symptoms, such as growth depression and leaf discoloration
starting from the edge. The disease was identified as PSTVd by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Measures were taken to eradicate the disease. It is
assumed that the disease was introduced in imports of infected tomato
transplants.
The declared status of PSTVd in Germany is: Single occurrence, eradicated.

[In tomatoes, PSTVd symptoms develop slowly, often not becoming apparent
until 4 or 5 weeks after infection. Infected plants become stunted and show
"bunchy top" symptoms (crowded foliage, due to shortening of internodes,
and occasional formation of spindly shoots). Leaf symptoms include
yellowing and purpling as well as considerable leaf distortion including
downward curling of the leaflets (epinasty), curling, and twisting
(rugosity). Severe necrosis along the veins develops later in the lower and
middle leaves, which eventually die. Younger leaves at the top of the plant
remain but are reduced in size. Flowers are often aborted, and fruit
ripening is erratic. Fruits becomes small and hard and can turn dark green.
Overall yields can be significantly reduced.
Disease management basically depends on planting viroid-free transplants.
Once PSTVd has been introduced onto a farm or nursery, it can be rapidly
spread from plant to plant through the use of contaminated cutting tools
and/or machinery, by handling, or simply by direct plant to plant contact.
PSTVd can also be transmitted via infected pollen. To prevent the spread
within growers' fields, good hygienic practices are necessary to prevent
contact with potentially infected plants, and, to avoid subsequent spread
of the viroid. Contaminated benches, tools, etc. should be disinfected.
2--3 per cent hypochlorite has been shown to be effective.
