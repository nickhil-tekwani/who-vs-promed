Influenza update No. 237
------------------------
[18 May 2015, based on data up to 2 May 2015]

Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity has been low. In the northern hemisphere influenza activity was nearing interseasonal levels and in the southern hemisphere influenza activity remained low. Countries in the tropical zones reported low influenza activity with the exception of some countries in tropical Asia and West Africa.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease and was near inter-seasonal levels. Continued but decreasing influenza B circulation resulted in a slow decline of the influenza season.

- In Europe, influenza activity mainly associated with influenza B virus continued to decline in most countries.

- In northern Africa, influenza activity decreased to almost inter-seasonal levels with mainly influenza B detections in the last weeks.

- In western Asia, influenza activity decreased further, with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in recent weeks, especially in Jordan.

- In the temperate countries of Asia, there was little to no activity throughout the region with only a few influenza B detections in the past weeks.

- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity remained low in most countries, with the exception of Guatemala which showed a slight increase in influenza A(H3N2) detections.

- In tropical Asia, influenza activity was low and in general continued to decrease in most countries. In West Africa, several countries reported increased influenza detections.

- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at low or inter-seasonal levels.

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 12 May 2015 14:05 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 86 countries, areas or territories reported data for the time period from 19 Apr 2015 to 2 May 2015. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 51 009 specimens. 4728 were positive for influenza viruses, 1234 of which (26.1 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 3494 (73.9 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 456 (53.8 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 391 (46.2 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 285 (94.7 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 16 (5.3 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone lineage
---------------------------------------

North America
-------------
In North America, influenza activity decreased overall with ongoing but decreasing detections of influenza B in recent weeks resulting in a slow decline in activity.

In Canada, influenza activity continued to decrease and influenza B activity continued to decline from the peak in week 12.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decrease while late season circulation of influenza type B continued.

In Mexico, both influenza A and influenza B detections continued to decrease. Acute respiratory infection (ARI)activity (333 ARI cases per 100 000 habitants) remained at a low level but was slightly increased compared to the last report (299 ARI cases per 100 000 habitants). Pneumonia activity (2.3 pneumonia cases per 100 000 habitants during the most recent week) continued to decrease but remained above the baseline.

Europe
------
In Europe, influenza activity continued to decrease in most reporting countries. The proportion of influenza positive samples decreased to 14 per cent from the last report (25 per cent) but remained above the seasonal threshold of 10 per cent. While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) continued to circulate at low levels, influenza B viruses predominated. Most countries ended their seasons with primarily influenza B detections among influenza positive samples, whereas Ukraine had primarily influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections late in the season.

Northern Africa and Middle East
-------------------------------
In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity decreased throughout most of the region.

Western Asia
------------
In western Asia, there was little to no influenza activity reported in most countries. Currently, Jordan has reported some continued but decreasing activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Central and eastern Asia
------------------------
In central and eastern Asia, there was little to no influenza activity reported throughout most of the region. Some countries reported low levels of influenza B detections.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------

Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and the Andean Sub-region was minimal. Most countries reported little to no influenza activity. Guatemala reported a slight increase of influenza A(H3N2) detections in the most recent week compared to previous weeks.

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
In Africa, low levels of influenza activity were reported except in west Africa. Cote d'Ivoire reported some influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses co-circulating in recent weeks. Ghana reported increasing influenza activity with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B detections.

Tropical Asia
-------------
In tropical Asia, the overall trend was a decrease in influenza activity. Bhutan reported detections of low levels of influenza A viruses while Sri Lanka reported ongoing detections of influenza A and B viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in most of the reporting countries. South Africa reported a slight increase in influenza virus detections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulating. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained below the seasonal threshold with only sporadic detections of influenza A A(H1N1)pdm09, (H3N2) and B viruses.
