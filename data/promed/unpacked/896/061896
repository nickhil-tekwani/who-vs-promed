Plum Organics of Emeryville, California, is recalling some of its
apple and carrot portable pouch baby food because of concerns over
possible botulism contamination.

The product was sold individually throughout the country at Toys-R-Us
and Babies-R-Us stores. The recalled product is sold in 4.22-ounce
pouches, with a "best by" date of 21 May 2010, and UPC 890180001221.

"The product did not meet the FDA guidelines for proper acidity
level," Paul Gerhardt, a member of the Plum Organics action team,
said in a statement.

The company is concerned that the baby food may be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_, which can cause botulism, a serious and
sometimes life-threatening condition. Consumers should not use these
products, even if they appear to be normal, because of the possible
health risk.

No illnesses have been reported in connection with the baby food, and
no other Plum Organics products are affected, the company said in a statement.

[2] Uneviscerated fish - USA ex Russia

The Food and Drug Administration announced the nationwide recall of
"Herring Salted," a product of Russia, due to improper processing.
The FDA said TGF Production LLC of New York initiated the recall
because the product was found to be improperly eviscerated.

The recalled herring was distributed nationwide in 2.86-pound round
plastic containers with the code numbers "24.08.09" and "13.07.09."
Uneviscerated fish is likely to be bacterially contaminated because
_Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in
the viscera than any other portion of the fish, officials said, and
uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism
poisoning, a serious and potentially fatal illness.

Consumers who have purchased the salted herring are advised not to
eat it and should return it to the place of purchase.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in
these cases) are related to defective preparation procedures, which
could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable
spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
