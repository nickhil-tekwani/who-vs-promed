Below is my translation of an article on anthrax in Mongolia. This article
appeared in Chinese in People's Daily on 23 Aug 2006. Note that the last
line of the article would commonly be interpreted as "martial law" rather
than "quarantine," but likely means the latter in this instance.
Ulaanbaatar, 22 Aug 2006:
<http://news.sohu.com/20060823/n244940773.shtml>
According to reports in the Mongolian press, human and livestock anthrax
have occurred in the 3 provinces of Arhangay, Bayanhongor, and Selenge over
recent days.
On 16 Aug 2006, a 61-year-old was hospitalized with anthrax in Ikh-Tamir in
Arhangay. Health authorities then declared travel restrictions in the
affected area, conducted tests on 24 people in 3 neighboring families, and
vaccinated more than 2000 head of livestock. In addition, one cow died of
anthrax in Yoroo in Selenge. In Jargalant in Bayanhongor, adjacent to
China's Xinjiang, 4 head of cattle died of anthrax over the past 2 days.
Relevant authorities have already declared quarantine in the
above-described region(s).

[Many thanks to Dan. The disease is enzootic in Mongolia and is routinely
reported. In 2004, it was reported from 12 provinces (14 counties): Khenti,
Hovsgol, Bulgan, Selenge, Uws, Gobi-Altai, Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan-Uul,
Ovorkhangai, Arkhangai, Drakhan-Uul (?), and Zavkhan, and involved cattle,
sheep, goats and horses, plus 22 human cases. Further information on this
season's outbreaks is being requested from Ulaanbaatar. - Mod.MHJ]
