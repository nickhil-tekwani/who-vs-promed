The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced that Nigeria has recorded a total of 2323 deaths in 69 925 suspected cases of cholera as of 5 Sep [2021]. The NCDC disclosed this on Tuesday [14 Sep 2021] morning in a situation report from 36 states and the FCT in Nigeria, for the period of 30 Aug to 5 Sep [2021], adding that 46 new related deaths were released during the period. They added that 1677 cholera infections were also recorded in 12 states during the period, citing that a total of 8 states accounted for the recent casualties.

The NCDC said, "In the reporting week, 12 states reported 1677 suspected cases: Bauchi (566), Katsina (282), Sokoto (258), Yobe (183), Borno (179), Niger (94), Kaduna (66), Adamawa (34), Gombe (8), Kano (4), Kebbi (2), and Nasarawa (1). There was a 58% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 35 (1667) compared with week 34 (3992). Of the cases reported, there were 46 deaths from Borno (13), Sokoto (12), Katsina (8), Bauchi (6), Niger (3), Kaduna (2), Adamawa (1), and Kano (1) states with a weekly case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.7%."

Nairametrics reported that the Federal Government had flagged off a national campaign on environmental response to combat the ongoing cholera outbreak in the country. Federal Ministry of Environment along with all relevant stakeholders including environmental health officers [EHOs] in the states and local government areas [LGAs] commenced the nationwide intervention response activities covering the following specific areas:

- Sanitary inspection of premises/environmental health surveillance of hotspot communities.
- Treatment of contaminated water sources/sites.
- Strengthening capacity of EHOs in the State Ministries of Environment and the affected LGAs.
- Sanitary inspection of food business premises of affected communities; advocacy, sensitization, and community town hall meetings on control of open defecation practices and its health impact.

At least 2 suspected cases of cholera have been detected in Ansongo in the Gao region of northern Mali, the Ministry of Health and Social Development said in a statement on Sat 11 Sep 2021.

"The 2 suspected cases were notified on 8 Sep 2021in the Ansongo health district, Gao region," the ministry said, adding that the 2 samples returned positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1. "Faced with this situation, the technical teams proceeded to isolate the cases and their treatment," said the statement from the Ministry of Health.

Recalling that "cholera is a very contagious disease which spreads quickly if the preventive measures are not respected," he called on the populations to "strictly respect" the rules of hygiene "during wedding ceremonies, baptism, gatherings due to deaths, and during travel."

The Ministry of Health also affirmed that epidemiological investigations are underway in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO, also inviting the population to be consulted in health establishments in the event of diarrhea and or vomiting.

On 3 Sep 2021, Niger bordering the Ansongo circle recorded 104 deaths linked to the cholera epidemic declared in the country on 9 Aug 2021, according to the Niger health authorities.

In 2011, Mali had experienced another cholera epidemic which had caused 65 deaths in the north of the country, according to official data.
