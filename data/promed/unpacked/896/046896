Over 10 000 goats have died of diarrhea in Kapchorwa district between
August and September this year 2008. Kapchorwa's veterinary officer
Dr. Nelson Yesho said the goats developed chronic diarrhea,
exhaustion and death.

"The ministry came and took blood samples last month [August 2008].
The goats present persistent diarrhea and exhaustion, leading to
death. The disease, scientifically called peste des petits ruminants
[PPR], has no treatment. It also affects sheep," Dr. Yesho disclosed
in an interview held at his office.

He identified the affected areas as Kaptanya, Ngenge, Binyiny,
Kaproron and Kwanyiy sub-counties.

The district has 68 000 goats and sheep, according to the veterinary
department.

The disease, also known as goat plague, is caused by a paramyxovirus
of the _Morbillivirus_ genus. It was 1st described in 1942 in Cote
d'Ivoire, West Africa.

[For the Kapchorwa district, bordering Kenya in the west of central
Uganda, see map at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.jpg>.

The attribution of the deaths of 10 000 goats in Kapchorwa (what is
the denominator?) to PPR deserves to be more convincingly stated. In
addition to diarrhea, PPR in goats and sheep is characterised by
buccal (stomatitis) and respiratory system involvement, hence its
synonym title, "stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex." The disease must
be differentiated from several other diseases, such as bluetongue,
FMD and other exanthemous conditions, pasteurellosis, CCPP, as well
as various gastroenteric conditions caused by bacteria and helminths.
See DD in FAO field manual "Recognising PPR" at
<http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X1703E/X1703E00.HTM>.

PPR was declared an endemic disease in Uganda since 10 Aug 2007. The
only way to protect the animals and reduce losses is vaccination.
However, no vaccination has, reportedly, been applied during 2007
among Uganda's 3 million goats and about 870 000 sheep. - Mod.AS]
