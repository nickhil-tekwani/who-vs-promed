Asian soybean rust has reached the state of Illinois for the 1st time ever,
found in Pope County in extreme southern Illinois. It's the 10th state with
rust in 2006.
On top of several rust finds in other states yesterday and today, the
discovery brings the United States total to 120 rust-positive counties and
parishes in 10 states, with 98 of those finds on soybeans. Pope County is
near the rust-infected counties in eastern Kentucky, and just a bit south
of the northernmost rust county, Union County, Kentucky.
In a news release about the find, Illinois officials said the discovery is
no cause for major alarm to growers in the state. "The arrival of rust so
late in the year will have no impact on the 2006 soybean crop," said plant
pathologist Suzanne Bissonnette, who serves as the soybean rust coordinator
for University of Illinois Extension. "The soybean harvest is already well
under way across much of the state. Those areas that have experienced a
hard frost will not be affected at all. No management actions should be
undertaken by growers or commercial applicators at this time."
According to the Illinois commentary on <http://www.sbrusa.net>: "Soybean
rust was detected for the 1st time in Illinois on a sample taken 11 Oct
2006. The find was in the extreme southern Illinois in Pope County on late
group V soybeans. A soybean sample was taken from soybeans adjacent to a
mature soybean plot at the University of Illinois Department of Crop
Sciences Dixon Springs Agricultural Center.
"University of Illinois Plant Clinic director Nancy Pataky and Dr Glen
Hartman USDA-ARS, soybean plant pathologist, observed the sample and sent
the sample to the National Mycologist USDA-ARS in Beltsville, Maryland, for
positive confirmation and species verification as indicated by the National
protocol for handling of first soybean rust samples in a state.
Confirmation of soybean rust was received 13 Oct 2006. Adjacent counties
are being sampled to determine the spread of the outbreak.
"The finding of soybean rust in southern Illinois was not unexpected," the
commentary said. "Kentucky has recently reported soybean rust in 8 counties
adjacent to southern Illinois, and our sentinel personnel were continuing
to observe the situation in Illinois. The finding of soybean rust in
Illinois at this time will have NO impact on the 2006 soybean crop.
"Soybean harvest is well under way across the state. All areas of Illinois
that have experienced a hard frost also will not be affected in any way.
However, information on the extent of this outbreak will greatly facilitate
research on soybean rust and aid in the refinement of predictive models for
soybean rust. NO management actions should be undertaken by growers or
commercial applicators at this time."

[Asian soybean rust (ASR ) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen, which
causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, also
known as Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the
pathogen in southern states of the USA.
This is the 1st report of ASR in Illinois. The article makes clear that the
report comes as no surprise, given the proximity to other detections of ASR
in the adjacent state of Kentucky. It also notes that at this late stage of
the soybean crop season the impact will be minimal. This report will be
added to a subsequent posting which will summarise all finds of ASR in USA
since the last summary (20060915.2611), which was posted on 15 Sep 2006.
