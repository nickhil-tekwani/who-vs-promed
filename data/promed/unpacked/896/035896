Abstract
--------
The role of exhibition swine in influenza A virus (IAVs) transmission was recently demonstrated by over 300 human infections of H3N2v viruses while attending agricultural fairs. Through active IAV surveillance in US exhibition swine and whole-genome sequencing of 380 isolates, we demonstrate that exhibition swine are actively involved in the evolution of IAVs, including zoonotic strains. First, frequent introduction of IAVs from commercial swine populations provides new genetic diversity in exhibition pigs each year locally. Second, genomic reassortment between viruses co-circulating in exhibition swine increases viral diversity. Third, viral migration between exhibition swine in neighboring states demonstrates that movements of exhibition pigs contributes to the spread of genetic diversity. The unexpected frequency of viral exchange between commercial and exhibition swine raises questions about the understudied interface between these populations. Overall, the complexity of viral evolution in exhibition swine indicates novel viruses are likely to continually re-emerge, presenting threats to humans.

[Extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant.htm:
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses occur in people with exposure to infected pigs (e.g. children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). There have been documented cases of multiple people becoming sick after exposure to one or more infected pigs.

See ProMED-mail posts Influenza, swine (02): USA (MN) novel strains, human infection 20150804.3556121 and Influenza, swine - USA: (MN) novel strains, human case H3N2v 20150726.3537522 for a study published in Clin Inf Dis by Choi MJ et al, and report of a recent case, respectively.

The comparative genomics study reported here examines the evolution of swine influenza virus in exhibition swine from 2009-2013, in order to make a determination of the public health risk it poses. The investigators demonstrated for the 1st time that frequent transmission of IAVs between commercial and exhibition swine is central to the evolution of IAV-exS (influenza A virus in exhibition swine), seeding diversity that has the opportunity to reassort and generate new genotypes.

See editorial in the same issue of JID: T Baranovich, J Bahl. Influenza A Virus diversity and transmission in exhibition swine.

Public health concern stems from pigs serving as mixing vessels allowing reassortment to occur during co-infection with more than one virus strain. As humans may infect pigs with influenza A strains, and pigs may infect pigs, there is ample opportunity for emergence of new hybrid strains with pandemic potential. The public health community is well advised to remain vigilant for new IAV strains. - Mod.LK
