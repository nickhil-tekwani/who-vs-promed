Driving compost around was what likely led to one man being declared the sickest person in New Zealand. [A 41-year-old man] had just started a new job at a gardening supplies company when he was struck down by legionnaires' disease.

The Christchurch man became unwell with cold and flu-like symptoms on 16 Sep 2018, but 4 days later, he was put into an induced coma in Christchurch Hospital intensive care unit (ICU). He was moved out of the ICU to a general ward on Friday [5 Oct 2018] after 12 days on life support.

The father of 2 boys spent 2.5 years unable to work due to a back injury and recovery from 2 major surgeries. He had re-trained and obtained truck-driving licenses in an effort to change careers. At the end of August 2018, he was thrilled to start a new job transporting compost and gardening soil, [his] sister said. But his new start came to an abrupt end 3 weeks later.

What started as a regular cough and cold accelerated into a life-threatening respiratory disease within hours, [his sister] said. "Because the symptoms are just like the flu, you don't know how sick you are until it's life or death." On 21 Sep 2018, staff put him into an induced coma when he was struggling to breathe. The father of 2 was treated with general antibiotics for the 1st few days until a diagnosis of legionnaires' [disease] was made on 25 Sep 2018. Treatment with legionnaires' [disease] specific antibiotics worked to attack the _Legionella_ bacteria. Over several days, he was brought out of a coma.

Doctors believed it was most likely he had contracted the disease from inhalation of the legionellosis bacteria in the compost and gardening mix he was transporting for his job, his sister said.

A Canterbury man spent about 2 weeks in intensive care after falling ill with legionnaires' disease.

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey said the man, aged under 45 [years], was diagnosed "a couple of weeks ago" due to compost exposure. The man was released from intensive care on Friday [5 Oct 2018], but further details on his condition were not available.

Humphrey said several others had been admitted to hospital with the disease this year [2018] but did not require intensive care. He did not know how many.

Last year [2017], 62 Cantabrians were hospitalised with legionnaires', and 13 required intensive care. One patient was admitted to intensive care for 42 days.

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey says gardeners have a higher risk of catching legionnaires' disease. In November last year [2017], 24 Cantabrians were diagnosed with the disease, the highest monthly number ever recorded. Humphrey said Cantabrians needed to take care with potting mix and compost to avoid repeating last year's spike.

"Legionnaires' tends to grow quite well in warm conditions. We've had a warm winter and are expecting a warm summer," he said. "Last year [2017], we had a record number, and this year we are expecting it to be warmer than last year."

Humphrey said there were 5 key actions gardeners could take to avoid the disease: opening potting mix carefully, wearing a safety mask when gardening, dampening down potting mix with compost or water, working with potting mix in a well-ventilated area, and washing hands thoroughly. Life-sized cutouts of Humphrey were in garden centres around the region with warning pamphlets, as had been done for the last few years. Humphrey said there were also warning signs on packets of gardening mix.

Legionnaires' is a type of pneumonia. The illness may be mild but can be fatal. It is more common in older people, especially if they smoke, have poor immunity, or have a chronic illness. Symptoms include dry coughing, high fever, chills, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

[Christchurch is the largest city, with a population of almost 400 000 residents, on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island and is the seat of the Canterbury Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch). For a map of this region, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Region. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of New Zealand can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/0muh.

This case of legionnaires' disease (LD) in Christchurch, New Zealand reported in the news articles above serves as a reminder that the epidemiology of LD in Australia and New Zealand is different from the epidemiology of LD elsewhere.

LD is an acute pneumonia caused by a Gram negative bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_; more than 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has been reported to account for only 45.7 per cent of cases of LD, and _Legionella longbeachae_ to account for 30.4 per cent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; http://legionellalaboratory.com/lp_distribution.pdf).

LD in Australia and New Zealand is associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix, compost, and soil; in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found in potting mix, compost, and soil, and cultured from the respiratory specimens of patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia. Cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also have been reported sporadically in Europe (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497).

The legionella urinary antigen test, which is commonly used to diagnose LD, is only valid for detection of _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, and, therefore, other samples must be collected from a patient suspected to be infected with _Legionella_ other than _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (such as sputum or bronchoalveolar wash obtained during bronchoscopy) for detection of _Legionella_ by culture using special media. - Mod.ML
