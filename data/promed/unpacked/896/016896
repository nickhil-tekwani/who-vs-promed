Specialists from the CDC of the United States have toured southern Chile
for the past two weeks to collect information on the incidence of
hantavirus infection in the rodent population. [The disease has been
confirmed in 20 cases of human infection in Chile with 12 deaths, a 60%
case-fatality rate. In the final report delivered to the Minister of
Health, they indicated the possibility that there may be two hantaviruses
in two mouse species.
This could explain how the virus might be transmitted among distinct
species of mice that share the same habitat. Dr. James N. Mills, one of
the CDC experts in charge of the work of trapping rodents in the area of
Cohiaique, Aisen, and Valdivia, indicated that the study of the reservoir
of disease was very successful, in that close to 2,000 traps placed in
various areas captured 316 rodents [about 16% trap success rate
representing 9 species.
Among them, 50% were _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ (the long tailed mouse),
35% were _Akodon olivaceous_ (the gray mouse), and a minor percentage were
_A. longipilis_ (the short furred mouse [?).
Preliminary analysis indicated that 13% of the _Oligoryzomys_ and 8% of the
_A. olivaceous_ had antibodies to a hantavirus [which virus is not
indicated.
"It could be that this occurrence is similar to that in the [1993 outbreak
in the southwest United States where, owing to the high concentration of
deer mice, other species of rodents were infected. We found various
species with antibodies but when we look for virus in species that are not
specific carriers, we don't find any," added the expert [Jim Mills.
He indicated that the other possibility is that "We found one virus in _O.
longicaudatus_ and another in _A. olivaceus_, similar to the situation that
occurred in Argentina in the south of Sante Fe Province, where they found
four viruses in four species, distinct reservoirs in a restricted area."
In any event, Mills said that they must wait for the sequence results,
studies that will take place at the CDC to determine if one or two viruses
are in Chile. The sequence studies will take less than two months to
establish the situations in Chile.
He also emphasized that many hantavirus have been discovered in North and
South America but only a small proportion of those are involved in human
disease.
Mills was cautious to indicate that if they find another virus in _A.
olivaceous_, they won't [immediately know whether it is connected with
disease in humans. He reaffirmed that the long tailed mouse is the same
species that carries Andes virus of Argentina.
The chief of the mission from the CDC, Ali Khan, pointed out that some of
the clinical properties of Chilean hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are
different from those seen in the United States--such as a renal disfunction
in the patient. At the same time, he highlighted that the study of
hantavirus cases in Chile showed that 20% were in children "something
unusual and not seen in the United States," he emphasized. The cases in
children presented at the start of the outbreak in last August [and are not
continuing to occur in children?.
Dr. Figueroa, at the same time, indicated that when the population of this
type of rodent [which, is not clear increases above normal levels, it is
due to climatic factors or the availability of food, and it is possible
that a species is able to invade the habitat of another. "And this
circumstance is clearly compatible with the idea of infection from one
species to another in a transitional fashion." [Not clear to me what this
means. The Secretary of State said that he was working with Chilean
scientists to determine the location of the reservoir [When they find it I
hope they will let us know! and they are still studying the level of
antibody titres against hantavirus strains in the rodents they have
captured.
Epidemiologists: The director of the Chilean Society of Epidemiology,
Catherine Ferrecio, called upon the Minister of Health to create an
institutional program to deal with surveillance and control of epidemics.
The request would be brought before the Third Chilean Congress of
Epidemiology that is to take place October 15-17 in Vina del Mar [Sorry we
are late with this posting, where they will deal with advances in facing
emerging diseases such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and studies on the
effects of various kinds of human infection.

[This report was just received by ProMED-mail but is no less valuable. I
have taken the extreme liberty of not only editing what we received by even
going so far as to changing some quotes attributed to Jim Mills, CDC. I do
not expect Jim will object and assume he simply was misquoted. He speaks
better than he was quoted in the article. Anyway, I have tried to not
change the meaning. - Mod.CHC
