Al-Wahdah Hospital in Derna announced the detection of 2 cases of infection by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Agona in 2 infants.

The Assistant Director General of the hospital, Dr. Adel Edwal, called on the Health Services Department in the city to publish a circular that stipulates which milk might become contaminated with _Salmonella_, stressing the need to increase awareness and strengthen the monitoring mechanisms in the city.

Earlier, The National Center for Disease Control in Libya warned citizens against buying baby milk sold in the Libyan market produced by Frence's Lactalis as a result of the possibility of contamination with _Salmonella_.
