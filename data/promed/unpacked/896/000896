Poliovirus weekly update, as of 19 Dec 2018, World Health Organization
---------------------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 29
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 1
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 98
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2017: 96

Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 6 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan - 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 acute flaccid paralysis (cVDPV2 AFP) case and 3 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples.

[Comments of the GPEI/WHO on approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps that must be filled to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial, and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (that is, due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high-risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritize technical assistance to those areas. Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus, be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 21.
- 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: 2 from Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province; 3 from Lashkargah district, Hilmand province; and 1 from Kandahar district, Kandahar province. Samples were collected between [5-25 Nov 2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 8.
- 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 2 from Killa Abdullah district and 2 from Quetta district in Balochistan province; 2 from Peshawar district and 1 from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Samples were collected between [15 Nov 2018-1 Dec 2018].
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 5 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. Twenty years ago, the entirel country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralysed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- 1 new cVDPV2 case was reported this week from Zango LGA, Katsina state, with date of onset of paralysis on [5 Nov 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is now 32.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- 3 cases of cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported: 1 from Tarauni LGA, Kano state and 2 from Maiduguri LGA, Borno state, collected on [10 Oct 2018, 16 Oct 2018, and 23 Oct 2018], respectively.
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. There are 8 total cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with AFP from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 7 Sep 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures, such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals, is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] [Has this round occurred? - Mod.MPP] as part of the ongoing outbreak response to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 is 26.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

[Well, WPV continues to be isolated from environmental samples in multiple locations in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and cVDPV continues to circulate in Nigeria, as evidenced by a newly confirmed AFP case and positive environmental samples. Overall, 2018 has not been a "good year" for polio, with higher numbers (marginally) of WPV-associated cases and cVDPV associated cases. Hopefully, 2019 will be a better year.

[2] Comment on social media and vaccination
Date: Thu 20 Dec 2018
From: TJ John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>

It is indeed disappointing and distressing to read about refusals to give oral polio vaccine [OPV] to children in Pakistan based on social media messages. The trigger event of a 2 month old child dying on day 3 after a dose of OPV cannot have been caused by the vaccine. Maternal antibodies protect infants from vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) during the 1st 4 months of life. Even in the most unlikely event of the mother not being immune, the child's illness could not have been VAPP, which has a minimum incubation period of 4 days. This information must be shared through social media.

However, when parents ask if OPV is safe, what do we answer? How can risk of VAPP, as small as it is, and of VDPV, as rare as it is, be communicated? That is a dilemma.

The benefit-risk ratio of OPV was excellent as the polio eradication drive began, with 350 000 wild virus polio and about 500 VAPP annually. Polio experts knew that the ratio would become unfavourable as the burden of wild virus polio declined to about 5000 per year, while VAPP would remain at [approximately] 500. At that point, inactivated polio vaccine [IPV] was the vaccine of choice to protect children from VAPP and from wild virus polio. IPV through EPI and OPV by campaigns should have been the ideal method until polio was eradicated, when OPV could have been withdrawn quite safely.

Now our best tactic is to ensure IPV through EPI; no child has developed polio after taking 3 doses. If the 1st dose is given at or after 14 weeks, and the 2nd dose after a gap of 4 or more months, 2 doses will suffice for assured immunity. Polio, in spite of multiple doses of OPV, is the reason why children have to be accessed again and again, seeding suspicion of various motives by the polio programme. As the eradication programme is managed by Global Polio Eradication Initiative and country governments and agencies, all of us have the moral duty to promote IPV in EPI, while GPEI struggles to ensure OPV coverage of as near 100% as possible, with multiple -- more than 5-10 -- doses per child. The cost may seem high, but the cost of failure of eradication is worse.

[As always, ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Prof T Jacob John for his very insightful comments. This unfortunate infant death referred to in the above comment was diagnosed as due to pneumonia and not related to the vaccine (see Poliomyelitis update (60): Pakistan, negative impact of social media 20181219.6214362). But Prof TJ John is correct when he raises the conundrum of the shift of the risk benefit ratio of administering OPV alone, without 1st protecting the infants/children with IPV. We are very much on the "same page" with respect to concerns re: the shifting of the risk benefit equation for the use of OPV alone. - Mod.MPP]
