*****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[Because West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in North America
and cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission
season, ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and
human cases in US states and Canadian provinces for the current
reporting period. Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus
detection in birds, mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines as well
as a breakdown of human disease cases can access that information on
the following sites:
Canada:
Public Health Agency of Canada
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/wnv-vwn/mon-hmnsurv-eng.php>
Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre
(The URL for the provincial maps of West Nile virus detection in
birds is not yet available)
USA:
CDC, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, West Nile virus
<http://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/index.html>
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, West Nile virus

[Jennifer Lehman of USA CDC <zjg3@cdc.gov> pointed out that the
ProMED-mail comment in the WNV Western Hemisphere 2008 update
(archive no. 20080604.1788) citing the 1st publicly available report
of WNV presence in Puerto Rico was incorrect. She pointed out that
CDC produces blood donor maps where PR is highlighted as having 3
donor cases (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/Mapsviremic/surv&control07Maps_Viremic.htm>).


ProMED-mail thanks her for sending in this correction. - Mod.TY]
