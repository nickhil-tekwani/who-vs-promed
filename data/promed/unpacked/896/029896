Two Israeli children have contracted a contagious virus that has sparked a health scare in the United States, where more than 1000 people [children] have been infected in recent months by human enterovirus-D68, which can cause respiratory difficulty and occasionally paralysis, Health Ministry officials said yesterday [Mon 17 Nov 2014].

The cases were identified last month [October 2014], and the children, both under 10, have since been discharged from Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer [in Tel Aviv district], where they were treated for breathing difficulties. No new cases have been reported in Israel since then.

"The presence of the virus in Israel is definitely insignificant, and in our estimation, it is abating in the United States as well because this is a virus that is active during the summer," said Dr. Itamar Grotto, director of public health services at the Health Ministry. "We are keeping track of what is going on in the U.S. and following the reports."

The 2 enterovirus cases were identified by the Health Ministry's Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory at Tel Hashomer, which examined 280 cases involving Sheba patients admitted for respiratory ailments in a bid to monitor whether this uncommon strain of a common family of viruses had reached Israel.

Health Ministry officials are monitoring the outbreak of the disease in the United States, which has afflicted 1116 people in 47 states, most of them children, since August 2014. Experts expect the enterovirus outbreak to subside, since it is active mainly during the summer. The virus, also known as EV-D68, has caused at least 12 deaths. 70 people who contracted it have suffered various levels of polio-like paralysis. But in most cases, people who come down with EV-68 recover quickly, without assistance. Most children recover in about a week.

There is no vaccine for the virus, which is transmitted by coughing and contact with infected people and objects. As with other viruses, common sense and good hygiene -- thorough hand-washing, avoiding physical contact with infected people (or, if you're the one feeling sick, minimizing contact with others) -- can help prevent infection.

Symptoms typically resemble those of a moderate cold. It may exacerbate asthma or other existing respiratory problems, causing coughing and respiratory difficulty. If a patient has serious difficulty breathing, doctors may recommend a respirator. The mortality level for EV-68 is far lower than influenza-related deaths during last year's [2013] flu season, when 109 children died, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC says more than 40 percent of the 2300 children suffering from respiratory problems in the United States over the last few months tested positive for EV-D68. The virus rarely affects adults.

Enteroviruses are widespread, but EV-D68, 1st identified in 1962, is [has been] uncommon.

[This report confirms that the D68 enterovirus is present in other parts of the world in addition to North America and Europe. As elsewhere, enterovirus D68 infection has not been associated with any distinctive disease pattern, other than that expected by enterovirus infection. It is clear that the Israeli epidemiologists do not rank enterovirus D68 a greater threat than any of the more common human enteroviruses, and moreover that any D68 outbreak is on the wane. There is no evidence in Israel to suggest that enterovirus D68 is associated with flaccid paralysis symptoms. - Mod.CP
