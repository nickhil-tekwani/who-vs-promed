Netherlands to evacuate 2 doctors who had contact with Ebola victims
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities in the Netherlands are preparing to evacuate 2 Dutch doctors who had unprotected contact in Sierra Leone with patients who later died of EVD, a Dutch public health official said on Friday [12 Sep 2014]. The 2 doctors have shown no symptoms of the virus but authorities believe there is cause for concern because they were not wearing full protective clothing when they came into contact with the patients, who had not yet been diagnosed with EVD.

"The 2 doctors' personal protection should be considered inadequate. They could potentially have been exposed," said Jaap van Dissel, director of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control. The 2 doctors will be evacuated on a special flight to minimise the risk of contagion to other passengers and monitored closely on arrival, according to media reports. "It's only contagious if they have a fever," van Dissel said, and added that if symptoms developed, the 2 would be placed in quarantine in a university hospital.

Dutch public television said the case was discovered when the doctors came to the Netherlands' nearest embassy in Ghana after the patients they had been in contact with at the Lion Heart Medical Centre in Yele town died of EVD. The clinic, which normally deals with cases of malaria, which has symptoms similar to Ebola, has since been shut down by authorities in Sierra Leone [because it is now EVD-infected - Mod.JW].

[3] Liberian president appeals to US President

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has appealed to US President Barack Obama for urgent aid in tackling the worst recorded outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus [disease], saying that without it her country would lose the fight against the disease.

The outbreak, which was 1st discovered in March [2014], has now killed more than 2400 people mostly in Liberia, neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, as understaffed and poorly resourced West African healthcare systems have been overrun. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the epidemic is spreading exponentially in Liberia, where more than half of the deaths have been recorded. It has said that thousands are at risk of contagion in the coming weeks. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has set up several treatment centers in the affected countries but has also repeatedly warned it has reached the limits of its capacity and appealed for foreign governments to intervene.

In a letter dated 9 Sep 2014 seen by Reuters, Johnson Sirleaf appealed to Obama to build and operate at least one EVD treatment unit in the capital Monrovia, saying that US civilian and military teams had experience in dealing with biological hazards. With the Liberian government due to open a 100-bed treatment center and MSF scaling up its EVD facility in Monrovia to 400 beds, Johnson Sirleaf said there was still a shortfall of 1000 beds in the capital as well as a need for 10 new centers in the rest of the country. "Without more direct help from your government, we will lose this battle against EVD," Johnson Sirleaf, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work on women's rights, wrote to Obama.

The US government has committed around USD 100 million to tackle the outbreak by providing protective equipment for healthcare workers, food, water, medical and hygiene equipment. The US military said this week it would build a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia to care for infected health workers but it would hand this to Liberians to run. [Other reports say this was to be reserved for international patients. - Mod.JW]

On Friday [12 Sep 2014], the US Ambassador to Liberia, Deborah Malac, said Washington would train security forces in isolation operations, after a boy was shot dead last month [August 2014] when Liberian soldiers opened fire on a crowd protesting a quarantine in a Monrovia neighborhood.

Worst threat since civil war
----------------------------
Liberian officials have called the outbreak the greatest threat to national stability since a 1989-2003 civil war, which killed nearly 250 000 people. Many ordinary people in Liberia, a nation founded by descendants of freed American slaves, look for help to the USA.

Cuba on Friday announced that it would deploy 165 medical personnel to Sierra Leone next month [October 2014], the largest contingent of foreign doctors and nurses committed so far.

[But with no firm date for arrival. As of 2 Sep 2014, roughly 100 US government personnel have been deployed and are working in the affected countries responding to the outbreak, this includes more than 70 CDC staff deployed in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone assisting with various vital response efforts such as surveillance, contact tracing, database management, and health education (but no clinicians). However, many American doctors and health workers are in those countries working with missions and NGOs -- not forgetting other foreign nationals, e.g., the 2 Dutch doctors mentioned in section [2] above and the British nurse who recently became ill with EVD, was repatriated and recovered. - Mod.JW]

Johnson Sirleaf said that EVD treatment centers were full and were being forced to turn away the sick. "We are sending them home where they are a risk to their families and the communities. I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us," she wrote. "Only governments like yours have the resources and assets to deploy at the pace required to arrest the spread," Johnson Sirleaf wrote to Obama, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

In a country with large numbers of unemployed former child soldiers, Johnson Sirleaf said the outbreak threatened civil order. With healthcare workers staying away from work, after dozens of their colleagues contracted the virus, citizens were also dying of other, treatable illnesses, she said.

Johnson Sirleaf asked the USA to assist in restoring services in at least 10 non-EVD hospitals. Liberia also asked for US help in establishing an air bridge to transport personnel and equipment after all but 2 private airlines have canceled their flights.

Ebola crisis in Liberia hits child health and well-being
--------------------------------------------------------
As efforts to halt the spread of the Ebola virus [disease] intensify, UNICEF warns of its far-reaching impact on children. In Liberia, EVD has severely disrupted health services for children, caused schools to close and left thousands of children without a parent. Children are dying from measles and other vaccine preventable diseases and pregnant women have few places to deliver their babies safely ... [more]

[6] Liberia: fake death certificates

Who's issuing fake death certificates?
--------------------------------------
Health authorities in Monrovia have embarked on inspection of health facilities, vowing to probe public concern that "fake death certificates" are being issued to the families of deceased EVD victims to allow them carry on burials. Since the outbreak across West Africa that is badly hit, governments in the subregion have been urging citizens against concealing sick or dead persons. In Liberia, families are ordered to get a non-EVD death certificate for deceased relatives before burial. But the head of the Medical and Dental Council of Liberia, Dr. George Mulbah, told UNMIL Radio's Coffee Break on Wednesday that "Some people are concerned that people are dying of EVD, but are getting certificate of non-EVD deaths." [UNIMIL is the UN Mission in Liberia.] "We are going to probe this," said Dr. Mulbah, who warned that the council will apply the code of ethics against those carrying on such practice.

Besides the issue of fake death certificates allegedly being issued here under this EVD crisis, he said the council was carrying on inspection of drug stores and health centers to know who were providing services there. He feared that in some health facilities, individuals who have not been authorized to render health services could be operating, especially in unauthorized health centers. As such, Dr. Mulbah said others who are not trained in handling cases could be infecting themselves and increasing the number of health workers infected with the Ebola virus, though they may not be legitimate health practitioners. The Ebola death toll in Liberia continues to rise above other infected West African countries, and the World Health Organization or WHO has not seen any decline yet in this outbreak ... [more]

Travellers told to produce EVD certificate
------------------------------------------
Some European and Middle East countries have placed a quiet 'ban' on people arriving from sub-Saharan and West Africa, requesting an EVD clearance certificate. According to documents seen by The Standard on Saturday [13 Sep 2014], individuals from these countries travelling to Germany, Netherlands and Dubai were asked for an EVD clearance certificate as a travel requirement. Sources at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) confirmed that individuals travelling to these destinations had gone seeking to get tested and be issued with the document but were turned away. "We only receive samples for testing, not the individuals themselves," a source at Kemri said.

However, Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia termed such a requirement a diplomatic breach, adding that they should refer the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "There is no such clearance. If they do not want travellers in their country they should clearly say so," the CS told The Standard on Sat [13 Sep 2014] by phone. Director of Medical Services Nicholas Muraguri said he was not aware of the travel restriction and denied that the ministry had received similar requests.

A delegation travelling to Germany in a fortnight [2 weeks] for a conference are among those urged to produce a clearance certificate indicating they are free from EVD. "We received a phone call from one of the organisers detailing that the health requirement should be adhered to otherwise we will not be allowed beyond the airport in Germany if we proceed with the trip," one of the travellers who requested not to be named said.

Others travelling to Dubai had an 'Ebola test' listed in red ink as one of the requirements. An invitation letter to a Kenyan invited to attend a conference in Dubai, which we have redacted due to the sensitivity of the matter, reads in part, "We would like to take this opportunity to inform you that the Dubai.... will be sponsoring you for this occasion.... please RSVP and send the following documents to arrange travel. 1. Passport size photo 2. Passport copy 3. Ebola test."

Another team travelling to the Netherlands were informed that their trip, scheduled for early next month, had been cancelled in what they termed "travel restrictions." "These are prevention measures to avoid contamination risks and also to limit problems in case of frontiers or airports sudden closure. We therefore deeply regret to inform you that the visit to the Netherlands cannot take place as scheduled until the travel embargo is lifted," read the letter.

One of the travel agents who spoke on condition of anonymity said a majority of companies are insisting on an EVD test especially for those seeking a working visa. "Most of the companies in Dubai are insisting on the EVD test. If you just want a visiting Visa then you are not likely to have that problem," she said ... [more]

[Besides being illegal, this is also meaningless. This is not like HIV/AIDS testing, because any test for ebolavirus would miss a person developing viremia between when they were tested and when the visa was issued. But it seems to be aimed only at applicants for work visas -- and countries should welcome workers with antibody, showing that they are not infectious. - Mod.JW]

Credit from World Bank?
-----------------------
It appears to me there may be an opportunity here to "rapidly" deploy field hospitals and, to offset a small portion of our national debt. Why not deploy 2/3rds of our Federal Medical Stations to the most needed locations and request "credit" from the World Bank or our creditors for providing international aid to this global disaster? How would one push this idea forward for vetting?

AfDB offers USD 150 million to help West Africa handle EVD fallout

The African Development Bank (AfDB) told West African countries hardest hit by an EVD epidemic they were willing to give USD 150 million to help balance their public finances, but they must 1st show they are doing everything possible to improve their health systems.

Economic growth in Liberia and Sierra Leone could decline by almost 3.5 percentage points and Guinea 1 percentage point, exposing financing gaps totaling USD 100 million to USD 130 million in each of the 3 countries, the IMF said on Thu [11 Aug 2014].... AfDB announced in August [2014] it would donate USD 60 million to help train medical workers and purchase supplies to fight the EVD outbreak ... [more]

Sierra Leone medical workers strike
-----------------------------------
http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Sierra-Leone-Medical-Workers-On-Strike-20140913-0022.html

13 Sep 2014: (TeleSur, Venezuela) Health Workers at Sierra Leone's Kenema Government hospital went on strike Fri [12 Sep 2014], citing overcrowding at the facility's EVD ward and lack of pay. Around 80 workers crowded around the entrance to the hospital and walked off the job, bringing the operations at the EVD treatment center to a standstill. Several other smaller job actions, with staff protesting poor working conditions and infection rates have led up to this one. Workers say their rates of pay do not add up to the risks they are taking in treating patients who have contracted EVD. The health professionals, who were recruited to boost staff numbers, operate inside high risk zones to treat the sick, decontaminate equipment, clean excrement, vomit and blood as well as remove the dead to bury them.

"I started working here one month ago and we have been paid nothing for the last 2 weeks," said Umaru, a hygienist. "We have stopped everybody from working until we receive our risk incentive." Staff are supposed to be paid USD 110 (500 000 SLL) per week but have been working for free the past 2 weeks. Many workers have left their posts because of the high risk of contracting EVD and lack of pay. Over 38 doctors and nurses have been infected and died since the outbreak [began].

The facility is already over capacity by some 80 patients with new cases arriving daily. Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) suggesting that the facility take no new admissions, 14 suspected patients were admitted to the high risk zone on Wed [10 Sep 2014] alone. "This illustrates the problem in this country," said Nyka Alexander, spokesperson for WHO in Sierra Leone. "We suggest no further admissions but if people are sick compassion will compel you to admit them. But there are not enough beds."

Support staff said they faced stigmatization for simply caring for infected patients. "They say we are infected, they provoke us in the street, they think we are the carriers of EVD," said 25-year-old nurse Donnell Tholley, who expects the government, the United Nations and the WHO to negotiate with the workers on Mon [15 Sep 2014].

[It has been suggested to me that an African would have most credibility in West Africa as global coordinator of the anti-EVD struggle, being more likely to understand the political and cultural constraints on the ground. Kofi Annan of Ghana, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and a skilled negotiator, was still active as the UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria until August 2012. He may already have been approached.
