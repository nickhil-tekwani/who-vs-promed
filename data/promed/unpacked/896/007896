Excerpt from the latest official press release:
Reports continue to indicate that weekly cases of dengue are declining
overall nationally. However, there are several areas where dengue appears
to be on the rise, and virtually every area of the country is still
reporting at least some dengue cases weekly. There have been 20,148
suspected cases presenting at Ministry of Health facilities since the
epidemic began in mid-December with 989 admissions, primarily for those
with dengue haemorrhagic fever. To date, nearly 2.5% of the population has
been affected, with nearly 5.5% affected in the Central Division. Western
and Northern Divisions remain at less than 1%, while Eastern Division has
climbed to 1.5% in recent weeks. The most recent death, a 41 year old man
from Nadi, occurred on 26 February, bringing the death toll to 11. This was
the first death reported outside the Suva area.
Despite the reported death, DMO Western reported an overall decline in
cases in the past two weeks, with no cases seen or admitted in Tavua for
the last week and a half. Other areas in the West reported similar declines
(see table below).
SDMO Cakaudrove reported that Savusavu Hospital has seen 360 suspected
cases since the 7th of January, and admitted at least 40 serious cases
since January 2. However, only 13 cases were reported last week. The DMO
Northern reports that two recent deaths from infectious disease, one in
Savusavu and one in Taveuni, were most likely due to other causes. Kadavu
Island also reported 131 cases in the past week, bringing the total to 302
cases since the epidemic began, with 40 admissions.
In Labasa Hospital, there were at least 9 suspected Dengue cases seen in
the last week, with 7 testing positive for Dengue, and 6 admissions. There
have been 232 suspected cases seen to date, with 27 admissions, and 42
dengue positives. There seems to be continuing transmission of the virus at
a low level in the Northern Division.
