----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to my Merck manual, 8th ed, p. 479, _Listeria_ is a ubiquitous saprophyte that lives in the plant-soil environment and has been isolated from more than 42 species of mammals and more than 22 species of birds, fish, and crustaceans. Just because ruminants seem to be more clinically susceptible doesn't mean that they are the primary source for people. Many monogastric animals can carry _Listeria_ in their GI tracts, too... dogs, cats, rabbits, and other small mammals.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Simunich for her comments. _Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the natural environment and a large variety of animal species (including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, horses, deer, rodents, domestic and wild birds, fish, and crustaceans) excrete _L. monocytogenes_ from their intestinal tracts into the environment. _L. monocytogenes_ has been recovered from raw vegetables and the soil they grow in. Most human _L. monocytogenes_ infections follow consumption of food contaminated with the bacterium. Many different types of food have been involved in outbreaks of listeriosis; these foods include deli meats, raw (unpasteurized) milk or milk products made from unpasteurized milk, such as soft cheeses or Mexican-style cheeses, pate or meat spreads, refrigerated smoked seafood and crustaceans, and raw fruit and vegetables.

However, the routes of transmission of _L. monocytogenes_ for listeriosis in human and other animals are complex and not completely understood (see Sauders BD, Wiedmann M: Ecology of _Listeria_ species and _L. monocytogenes_ in the natural environment. Chapter 2. (2007) In: Listeria, Listeriosis, and Food Safety. ET Ryser, EH Marth (eds). Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY). Human infections with _L. monocytogenes_ can result from consumption of contaminated unprocessed raw food, such as uncooked meats, unpasteurized milk or milk products, fruits, and vegetables, or consumption of ready-to-eat food that has been contaminated during processing of food such as deli meat (Gravani R: _Listeria_ in food-processing facilities, p 657-709. (1999) In: Listeria, Listeriosis, and Food Safety. ET Ryser, EH Marth (eds). Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY)

_L. monocytogenes_ survives extremely well in the food-processing facility environment. However, information on how these strains entered that environment is limited. They may be introduced into these facilities through a variety of routes, including raw materials, employees' shoes or clothes, and equipment. When _L. monocytogenes_ get into a food-processing factory (such as, factories processing smoked fish, poultry, meat, and dairy products), they persist there for years and can contaminate food after factory cooking, but before packaging. Particularly problematic is the fact that _L. monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigeration temperatures during storage, which is why even minimal contamination with this bacterium during the processing of subsequently refrigerated ready-to-eat food can cause severe food-borne infections.

The role of the dairy farm as a potential source for _L. monocytogenes_ has been investigated by comparison of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction enzyme digestion profiles of _L. monocytogenes_ dairy farm-associated strains (milk, environmental, and bovine) with that of human sporadic and epidemic disease strains (Borucki MK, et al: Dairy farm reservoir of _Listeria monocytogenes_ sporadic and epidemic strains. J Food Prot. 2004; 67(11): 2496-9; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15553633). 23 percent of human sporadic strains had PFGE patterns identical to that of dairy farm isolates and the PFGE of farm isolates were identical to that of a strain of _L. monocytogenes_ responsible for a 1985 California epidemic.

It is hoped that comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains involved in human disease with that of strains isolated from other animals, from food for human and other animal consumption, from food-processing facilities, and from the natural environment, will allow a better understanding of the routes of transmission. - Mod.ML
