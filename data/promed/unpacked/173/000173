Dengue Fever Outbreak in Macau Now in Decline
---------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of dengue fever in Macau this year has
reached nearly 1000, according to Macau health officials. A spokesman for
the former Portuguese enclave's health department said that 972 cases of
the disease had been confirmed between late August, when the outbreak was
first officially announced, and the middle of last week. The spokesman said
that only 29 of the patients were currently being treated in hospital.
Although there is no specific cure or vaccine for the disease, patients are
given general follow-up treatment to avoid complications, according to
doctors. The spokesman also said that the number of newly confirmed cases
had slowed down from an average of 25 a day to less than 20 cases so far
this month. He said that the youngest patient had been a one-year-old baby
and that the oldest patients had been in their late 80s. The Health
Services Bureau has said that all the dengue fever cases so far recorded in
Macau were a "less severe strain" of the disease.
The Macau Government has launched a public awareness and mosquito
eradication campaign to deal with the outbreak, the first officially
recorded in Macau. Residents and visitors have been advised to wear
long-sleeved shirts and long trousers. The Government has asked citizens to
get rid of pools of stagnant water on their private properties to stop the
mosquitoes from breeding.
Last month the Hong Kong Government stepped up its campaign against the
disease in response to the outbreak in Macau. Officials at the Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department said a mosquito-control programme was
still under way. The second phase of a territory-wide inter-departmental
anti-mosquito campaign was launched on 31 Aug 2001 and will be implemented
until 3 Nov 2001. Phase one of the programme ran from April 2001.
