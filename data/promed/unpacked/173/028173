For the first 4 months of 2022, Malaysian health officials have reported a total of 22 463 cases of hand, foot, and mouth diseases (HFMD) nationwide, an increase of 12.8 times compared to the same period in 2021, which saw only 1752 cases.

As many as 21 508 cases or 96% of the total are reported in children aged 0-6 years.

To date, a total of 767 outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia where the 3 highest states with recorded outbreaks are WP Kuala Lumpur & Putrajaya which is 259 outbreaks (33.7%), followed by Selangor with 100 outbreaks (13%), and Perak 98 outbreaks (12.8%). The majority of outbreak locations occurred in kindergartens, nurseries, and pre-schools with 600 outbreaks (72%) followed by private homes with 186 outbreaks (24%), and also childcare centers with 26 outbreaks (4%).

HFMD disease is caused by enterovirus with the majority of cases caused by Coxsackie Virus A16 and Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The virus is spread by contact with saliva, blisters, and feces. The infection is usually mild with symptoms of fever followed by a blistering rash on the hands, feet, mouth, and tongue. Almost all patients with HFMD recover without treatment within 7 to 10 days. However, EV71 infection can cause severe complications such as encephalitis, pulmonary edema, and myocarditis.

The MOH would like to advise the public, especially those with young children to take the following precautions to reduce their risk of infection:

- Wash hands with soap and clean water after using the toilet, before preparing food, after changing diapers, and washing children's stools;
- Cover mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing;
- Do not share personal items such as toothbrushes, handkerchiefs, towels, blankets, cups, forks, and spoons;
- Always maintain cleanliness in homes, childcare centers, kindergartens and schools, and their surroundings;
- Regularly wash all toys and surfaces of tables, chairs, and floors at least
twice a day;
- Take children to the nearest clinic or hospital if they have signs or symptoms of an infection;
- Parents are advised not to bring children with symptoms to crowded public places such as swimming pools, markets, shopping malls, bus stations, etc.;
and
- Parents of children who show signs or symptoms of infection, do not send the child to a childcare center, nursery, kindergarten, or school. Sick children should be taken to the clinic for treatment.

In this regard, the MOH would like to reemphasize the importance of implementing the 5 practices below to control and prevent HFMD infection. MOH in collaboration with all relevant Ministries and agencies will further enhance prevention and control measures and emphasize the importance of the following practices;
- Personal hygiene;
- Proper handwashing practices;
- Environmental hygiene care;
- Inspection/screening at the entrance (gatekeeping screening) of kindergartens, pre-schools and schools; and
- Disinfection or disinfection of contaminated surfaces.

The number of weekly cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Selangor has now exceeded the warning level, said Selangor Health director Datuk Dr. Sha'ari Ngadiman.

He said as of [27 Apr 2022], the disease, which infects children under age 7, had recorded 5346 cases with the number of weekly cases exceeding the alarming level.

"At the same time, 112 HFMD clusters have been reported involving 547 cases with 95% of them involving clusters in nurseries, kindergartens, and day-care centres but no deaths were reported," he said in a statement yesterday.

Dr. Sha'ari said the Selangor State Health Department (JKNS) urges the public, notably entrepreneurs and caregivers of children, to take precautions such as ensuring the cleanliness of the premises, floors, bathrooms, and equipment used by children.

"Besides that, the parties in charge must do screening at the entrance of a place, practice personal hygiene including washing hands when handling children, ensure disposable diapers are thrown into covered bins, and to report an HFMD cluster to the nearby district health office," he added.

He also advised parents of children with symptoms of HFMD infection not to bring their kids to public places, adopt a regime of washing hands with soap, and to clean children's toys regularly.

HFMD is a disease caused by viral infections, specifically the Coxsackie types A16 and Enterovirus 71 (E71) that are transmitted through direct contact with nasal fluid, saliva, blisters, and feces of the sufferer.

Abstract
Background: Outbreaks of hand foot mouth disease (HFMD) are endemic in Malaysia and cause outbreaks and deaths amongst young children. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and awareness of HFMD and its associated determinants among parents in Malaysia.

Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between January and March 2020 in Selangor state of Malaysia using a self-administered survey. The validated questionnaires were distributed to parents with children attending kindergartens in the 9 districts of Selangor through multistage sampling. Logistic regression was used to estimate the differences in knowledge and awareness between groups and to identify their associated variables.

Results: We received 690 participant responses of which 485 were included in the final analysis. We found that only 34.4% of parents had good knowledge and 78.1% had a good awareness of HFMD. The multivariate analysis found that those who were working in the private sectors had lower odds of having good knowledge compared to those who were working in the public sectors, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.59; 95%CI: 0.36-0.97. Compared to Malay, Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian had lower odds of having good awareness with aOR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.29-0.81 and aOR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.23-0.83, respectively.

Conclusion: Although parents' awareness was relatively high, they have poor knowledge of HFMD in particular to identify the symptoms of severe cases, basic treatment, and preventive measures of HFMD. HFMD information needs to be communicated in a simplified language including in online communications to improve parents' knowledge and awareness of HFMD.

The Ministry of Health (Minsa), through the National Center for Epidemiology, Disease Prevention and Control (CDC Peru) issues an epidemiological alert on the occurrence of outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the country due to high-risk extension of cases and increase in the magnitude of existing outbreaks.

The CDC Peru reported that since [30 Mar 2022] (epidemiological week 13), outbreaks related to hand-foot-and-mouth disease have been reported in 4 regions of Peru: Ucayali (120 reported cases), San Martin (15 reported cases), Hu√°nuco (9 reported cases) and Amazonas (21 reported cases).

HFMD is caused by a group of enteroviruses, of which coxsackie A16 and enterovirus-71 stand out, although coxsackie A6 and coxsackie A10 have recently been added.

The CDC Peru detailed that this hand, foot, and mouth disease is viral and contagious, mainly affects children under 5 to 7 years of age, and could occur exceptionally in adults. In addition, its name is descriptive for presenting fever, mouth ulcers, and exanthema (maculopapular and/or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and buttock folds). Even with flu-like symptoms such as malaise, sore throat, and nasal congestion, among others.

Likewise, CDC Peru added that hand, foot, and mouth disease is usually benign, but very contagious at the level of spread within schools and child care centers, and that the disease generally occurs in the form of outbreaks in the seasons of summer and autumn. These are, among others, Peru CDC recommendations:

- Isolate the cases identified in the home (from the date of onset of symptoms until their remission in 7 to 10 days).
- When a case is identified in the educational institution at the initial or lower level, the classroom involved must be quarantined and if contacts with relatives (siblings, cousins) are identified in other classrooms, the investigation must be expanded and the relevance evaluated. from quarantine.
- Classroom quarantine will be indicated for a period similar to isolation (up to 10 days) and in the absence of new probable cases.
- Faced with cases presented in closed populations, these must be immediately reported to the health establishment of the jurisdiction.

The DIRESAS, GERESAS and DIRIS, in coordination with health promotion and communications, must disseminate promotional preventive measures with emphasis on places with overcrowding such as educational institutions, and shelters, among others.
