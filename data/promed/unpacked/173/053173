After the Dordogne [see archive no 20151202.3834929], avian influenza has affected the [department of] Landes. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed Mon 7 Dec 2015, the detection of at least 2 new cases in this department. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was discovered in a farm breeding guinea fowl and rearing ducks, with high mortality. A 3rd, nearby farm is suspected.

The Landes prefect has undertaken measures to contain the outbreak, including disinfection and protection imposed on farms within a radius of 10 km[6 mi] around the infected foci. In addition, an export ban on live poultry and hatching eggs from the Landes department was announced.

Following the emergence of the virus, a first in France since 2006, 8 countries banned the import of French poultry products. These are China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.

The Officials in the poultry sector are assessing the consequences. The export of fresh poultry meat to 3rd countries, that is to say, outside the European Union, represents 353 million euros [about USD 386 million]. As for sales of hatching eggs and genetic material to 3rd countries, this is worth 120 million euros [about USD 131 million]. Finally, the sale of foie gras beyond the borders [of France] 107 million euros [about USD 117 million], for 4934 tons. The main concerns regarding export of foie gras relate to the Japanese market, and regarding genetic material, to the Chinese one.

The Ministry of Agriculture maintains discussions with each country to assess exactly the extent of the restrictions. The idea is to limit the export bans to certain categories of products from affected areas.

The Ministry of Agriculture has, from the start, said the strain of the virus which appeared in France was not Asian. Its sequencing is still ongoing. Among the reported cases, one was an H5N1 virus, another an H5N2 virus. The other 3 are still in the phase of identification. They are of type H5, but the "N" must be specified.

The Ministry repeats that avian influenza is not "transmitted to humans by the consumption of meat, eggs, foie gras, and more generally any food."

[An official notification on the new outbreaks in Landes (map at http://tinyurl.com/hlrkmqw), with more details and full serotype, is expected soon.

Subscribers are referred to the 7 Dec 2015 report "Avian flu strikes poultry in Europe, Africa, found in Oregon duck" at http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/12/avian-flu-strikes-poultry-europe-africa-found-oregon-duck.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published on 4 Dec 2015 a press release titled "Avian influenza of H5 subtypes found in domestic birds in France, new ECDC rapid risk assessment":

"Following the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the subtypes A(H5N1) and A(H5N2) in birds in a backyard farm and commercial farms, respectively, in France, ECDC has issued a new rapid risk assessment. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic human infections are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments.

However, the assessment concludes that the risk of transmission to the general public in EU/EEA countries is extremely low. In addition, although an introduction into other EU countries with contaminated goods cannot be ruled out, the risk of these viruses spreading is considered to be low.

On 25 Nov 2015, the French authorities notified the EU about an outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) in a backyard holding in Dordogne. Following abnormal mortality in the holding, the virus was confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES). On 30 Nov and 1 Dec 2015, French authorities also reported 2 poultry farms in Dordogne were affected by A(H5) viruses, an HPAI A(H5) with pending N typing results in a commercial duck farm and an HPAI A(H5N2) in a goose farm.

The A(H5N1) virus identified in the French backyard farm does not appear to be related to any of the currently circulating highly pathogenic viruses in Asia, but rather has evolved from previously circulating low pathogenic A(H5N1) viruses in Europe. There have been no human HPAI A(H5N1) cases identified in Europe although there have been detection amongst birds elsewhere in Europe. Furthermore, no bird-to-human infections have been reported from low pathogenic A(H5N1) viruses. No human cases related to HPAI A(H5N2) have been observed worldwide.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, especially in households and at live bird markets. Sustained human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) virus and its highly pathogenic reassortants have never been observed.

Animal and public health authorities should be prepared for a possible introduction of HPAI A(H5N1) or A(H5N2) into other European countries although the risk is considered low.

The risk of a foodborne transmission (e.g. eggs and meat) is considered extremely low according to EFSA."
