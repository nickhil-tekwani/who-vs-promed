San Diego County [California] health officials have reported another local university with a student confirmed positive for mumps. A San Diego State University (SDSU) student was recently confirmed positive for the viral infection after exposure to another student who had been ill and likely also had mumps.

The 2 students are housemates living off campus and were up-to-date with mumps vaccinations. The students were not hospitalized and have recovered.

It is not known where the 1st student who became ill was exposed to mumps, but there is no apparent connection to the recent mumps cases reported at California State University San Marcos or San Diego Christian College.

"SDSU is working closely with the County to inform the university community about the symptoms of mumps and vaccine recommendations," said Sayone Thihalolipavan, MD, MPH, County deputy public health officer. "These unrelated cases at campuses in the county mean that mumps may be present in the community, which is why we encourage that everyone be up-to-date with measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] immunizations."

So far this year [2016], 19 mumps cases have been reported in San Diego County. This compares to 3 or fewer mumps cases noted annually in recent years.

Through 15 Oct 2016, 2570 mumps cases have been reported nationwide in 45 states and the District of Columbia.

A mumps outbreak was discovered at the University of New Hampshire and state health officials urged the local community to be vigilant against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease.

According to state Epidemiologist Benjamin Chan, 3 people "with a link to the university" have been diagnosed with mumps. The ages and genders of the individuals were not released.

The student population is likely safe from contracting the disease, as a mumps vaccine is a condition of enrollment. But Chan said university workers and those who spend time on campus and are not vaccinated should be cautious.

Mumps is a viral infection easily transmitted through saliva and surface contact. Symptoms include swelling and tenderness of the cheeks, fever, headache, and muscle aches. In can cause more serious complications and in rare cases is deadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mumps cases are on the rise in New Hampshire and across the country, Chan said.

From 2011 to 2015, there were 5 mumps cases in New Hampshire. So far this year [2016], there have been 9 cases, Chan said.

[Not only students, but the entire campus community needs to be up-to-date on vaccination with MMR vaccine to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella virus infection, all of which can cause serious disease in adults. Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and occasionally, sterility. - Mod.LK

A student at Framingham State University in Framingham, Massachusetts, has tested positive for mumps, according to university officials.

Officials at the university said they were notified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health after the student was tested for the disease. As a precaution, the student was housed in an isolation room on campus immediately after being seen in the campus Health Center.

"The student has remained in isolation for 5 days in adherence with the Department of Public Health guidelines," university officials said in a statement.

The student, who has not been identified, was immunized with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, which are 88 percent effective in preventing mumps, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Although rare, someone can still can get the disease if they have been in very close contact with someone who is infected.

University officials are urging students who have had symptoms of jaw swelling, fever, headache, stiff neck, or loss of appetite to notify the health center or their doctor as soon as possible.

"We are checking the immunization records of all roommates and students in the affected student's classes to make sure they have submitted documentation of the required immunizations and will be contacting those who have not," school officials said.
