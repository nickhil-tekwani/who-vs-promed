OSLO - Poisonous algae off the south coast of Norway, which killed off
almost 1000 tons of farmed salmon in the past 2 weeks, now seem to be dying
out, a fisheries spokesman said on Friday.
Norway is the world's top producer of Atlantic salmon, farming about 400
000 tons a year. Olav Lekve at the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries
estimated [that] the algae, which kill fish by sticking to their gills, had
suffocated between 900 and 1000 tons of salmon in the past 2 weeks -- the
deadliest attack by the algae in Norway. The previous record was set in May
1998, when algae killed about 800 tons of fish.
Lekve said the directorate expected the algae, believed to be a Japanese
strain that first appeared off Norway in 1996, to continue dying out over
the next few days. The swathe of microscopic algae, stretching tens of
kilometres, had not moved in the last few days and so was not threatening
other fish farms. The organisms die out after using up nutrients in the sea
unless winds and currents help sweep them to new areas.
Norwegian officials think the so-called chattonella algae, which often
bloom in spring, could have come from a vessel that loaded water for
ballast off Japan and then flushed out its tanks off Norway. NRK public
radio said the Environment Ministry was considering how to prevent ships
spreading the algae further by taking aboard contaminated water. One option
could be to force vessels to mix water with chlorine, killing any algae.
