Here is all the additional information I have, from the Belgian papers (my
original note was Reuters). Two cows on the farm that has not been closed
died in December. Symptoms were bloody diarrhoea, refusal to feed, "fatigue
symptoms", then coma. The farmer stopped mixing sugar beet pulp into their
ration, and the sick ones "slowly" recovered. The second farm was hit in
January; two cows died, either four or six (sources differ) were
slaughtered, presumably because of advanced symptoms.
The earlier onset and the success of the "treatment" could be the reason
for the different treatment of the first farm. The second farm also used
beet pulp, but from a different source. Initial suspicion focused on formol
in the beet pulp, but tests came back negative, as did tests for
pesticides. Please note only Reuters has reported that the second herd will
be slaughtered, the Belgian papers say only that the second farm has been
shut down. The Ministry has released no press statements. I cannot find
anything on the size of the herds.

From the postings and comments of the moderator, it does not appear that a
rapid case-control study was launched to investigate the origin of the
mortality. In absence of any evidence on the type of etiology (infectious,
chemical, or else), the case-control approach could be very helpful. Even
if the results of analytical [I am assuming she refers to earlier comments
that standard microbiology, toxicology etc drew a blank - Mod.PC methods
are negative, statistical association with one or the other risk factor may
help to focus on the origin of disease.
Indeed, a precise definition of the case is necessary. What if some animals
have only one of the three symptoms?

[The point made here can be extended. Certainly one way to increase our
surveillance effort is intensive follow-up of outbreaks of disease or
anomalies in surveillance data. We should learn from these naturally
occurring experiments in disease patterns. As Suzanne hints, devoting more
resources to intensive follow-up is one strategy to identify emerging
diseases in a timely fashion. - Mod.PC
