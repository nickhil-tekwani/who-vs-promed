News of the response
Social mobilization
-------------------
- On Wed 29 Jun 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, went to the Provincial Assembly of North Kivu to present the evolution of the response to the Ebola epidemic and address the concerns members of the provincial government, provincial members of parliament, and civil society. During the question-and-answer session, 2 points crystallized the exchanges: the beginning of the school year and the payroll of health professionals. Regarding the start of the school year, the Minister advised maintaining the scheduled date while strengthening and systematizing the hygiene measures in each school. For health professionals, he explained the procedure for registering providers on the lists of personnel involved in the response.

Medical care
------------
- The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has donated a batch of 10 tons of medical and surgical equipment to the Beni General Referral Hospital to avoid cases of Ebola infection in maternity wards. This donation will cover the care of at least 30 000 people for 6 months and includes childbirth care, access to family planning and care for survivors of gender-based violence.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 4645 people have been vaccinated , including 2372 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1135 in Beni [North Kivu], 1017 in Mandima [Ituri province], and 121 in Oicha [North Kivu].

- The Minister of Health Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, launched the 1st phase of the polio vaccination campaign in Goma. Nearly 5 years without a new case of polio, the Democratic Republic of Congo recorded this year [2018], some 20 cases of [vaccine-derived poliovirus] which prompted the Government to launch a new vaccination campaign. The 1st phase of this campaign concerns 9 provinces: Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, Mongala, North and South Kivu, North and South Ubangi, Tshopo, and Ituri. Due to the current Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province, several risk areas have been temporarily excluded from the polio vaccination campaign. These areas include Beni, Butembo, Mabalako, Musienene, Katwa, Kalunguta, and Oicha. As soon as the Ebola outbreak is under control, polio vaccination in these areas can begin.

[The new polio cases are likely a consequence of the unrest and consequent inaccessibility of all people who need to be vaccinated. Rather than wait for the Ebola outbreak to end, it might help if it were possible to piggyback the polio vaccine on the Ebola vaccine so that healthcare workers don't need to make duplicate visits to certain communities. - Mod.LK]

News of the response
Social mobilization

Back to school
--------------
- Following the concerns of civil society regarding the start of the school year, a committee of experts met to assess whether it was necessary to postpone the start of the school year. After evaluating the situation, the committee concluded that it was preferable to maintain the return to school on [3 Sep 2018], as planned. The Government and partners are taking all necessary steps to ensure that children can learn and develop their potential safely. Children will be made aware of the hygiene and good behavior to adopt. Washbasins with chlorinated water will be placed at the entrances of the 250 schools identified in the affected areas. In addition, school principals and teachers in these areas will receive training on Ebola virus disease, prevention and response to suspected signs.

Vaccination
-----------

[Starting school will allow children to be taught personal protective measures which they can bring home to their families to follow. Teachers also will be trained in safety. These teachers can help dispel myths surrounding the transmission of Ebola, for example that it is sorcery. Furthermore, attending school will provide some stability to the students in this period of unrest. And the children can be followed for symptoms when they attend school. For all these reasons, the benefits of attending school seem to outweigh the risks and I feel it is a good idea to go forward with school. - Mod.LK]

No new cases of Ebola have been recorded in the Mambasa territory (Ituri province) for a week, said Ituri Governor Jefferson Abdallah Pene Mbaka.

He made the announcement Wed 29 Aug 2018 after a big meeting of the crisis committee of this disease held Tue 28 Aug 2018 in Bunia.

[...]

However, the governor urges the population to report to healthcare professionals any suspected case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

He is referring to the last suspected case recorded in Bunia last weekend [25-26 Aug 2018] which turned out to be negative after the samples were analyzed at the Beni Ebola Laboratory.

"As soon as there is a suspected case, it is necessary to alert the health technicians. It will be securely transferred from this location to another suitable [one]. Today, since we do not have a treatment center, we can decide to bring [the patient] to Mangina so that [they] can be treated in quarantine, " advised the governor.

He also insisted on strict hygiene rules to prevent this disease. "... we advise the change of behavior by washing hands for example. And here we will succeed in curbing this disease, " said Pene Mbaka.
