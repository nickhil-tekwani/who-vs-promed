Postal employee recovers from anthrax, leaves hospital
-------------------------------------------------------------------
MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. - A postal employee who left the hospital Monday after a
3-week bout with inhalation anthrax said she believes she probably
contracted the disease when a co-worker used compressed air to clean a
jammed mail-processing machine and sent dust flying. [The woman] said her
back was turned when a fellow employee blasted the machine's inner workings
with compressed air.
There have been 5 confirmed cases of skin or inhalation anthrax in New
Jersey. Officials said Monday that all can be traced to the Hamilton facility.

Latest developments
-------------------------
- A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll finds only 1 in 10 Americans are very
fearful that a member of their family will fall victim to anthrax. Almost
two-thirds are not at all worried that a family member would be exposed to
anthrax.
- Investigators are looking at a few mail routes in West Trenton, New
Jersey, where the 3 letters may have been mailed, a U.S. Postal Inspection
Service spokeswoman said Monday.
- The West Trenton postal facility was due to reopen Tuesday, but the
Hamilton Township processing center remained closed. A post office in
Princeton, New Jersey, resumed operations Monday.
- A State Department mail handler infected with inhalation anthrax is out
of intensive care and "improving steadily" but is still hospitalized,
department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.
- A civilian post office within the Pentagon complex was closed after the
discovery of anthrax traces over the weekend. As a precaution, 6 employees
who work at the branch are on Cipro [ciprofloxacin], an antibiotic used to
treat anthrax. Authorities are notifying those who rent post office boxes
at the site that there had been contamination. The facility does not
process mail for the Pentagon but did receive mail from the Brentwood
mail-processing center in Washington.
- Postal inspectors are expected early this week to begin going through
some of the thousands of letters that have been decontaminated to see if
any are similar to the 3 anthrax-tainted letters. Letters from the tainted
Brentwood facility are back in Washington after being sent to Lima, Ohio,
for decontamination.

Anthrax Investigation Update in New Jersey
-----------------------------------------------------
"Now that all DHSS, CDC and FBI environmental samples collected in the West
Trenton Post Office and areas outside the facility have come back negative
for anthrax, we are recommending that all West Trenton postal employees can
stop taking the 60-days of prophylactic antibiotics they had been
prescribed earlier in this outbreak," said Health and Senior Services
Acting Commissioner George T. DiFerdinando, Jr., MD.
"We are likewise recommending that those employees of the Princeton Main
Post Office who chose to take prophylactic antibiotics can now stop taking
them," he added. "Employees with continuing health concerns should contact
their personal health care provider, or the occupational health services
available to postal employees."
