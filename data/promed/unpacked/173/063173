[Confirmation of sporadic primary cases continues to occur at a steady pace. Since 1 Dec 2016, there have been 10 newly confirmed cases and 3 deaths. All 10 newly confirmed cases were classified as primary cases with only 3 of them classified as primary cases with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The remaining 7 were still under investigation for possible high risk exposures. Cases are being reported in a number of different places.

A question that begs attention is why is there an increase in confirmed cases over this period and what alternative high risk exposures have not as yet been defined that may explain this observed increase in confirmed cases. Of interest is an Arabic language media report yesterday mentioning that a recent survey of MERS-CoV infection among Saudi camels showed that 76% of samples taken from a camel market in Riyadh had the MERS-CoV. Dr. Abdullah Asiri, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health for Preventive Health was cited as stating this explains the recent increase in MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia. He further elaborated that contacts of these camels could carry the virus (asymptomatically) to their contacts who may be more vulnerable to the disease. He cautioned on appropriate avoidance behaviors such as washing hands after contact with camels, boiling camel milk before drinking and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth after touching camel products and before washing hands. (machine translation from http://alymaamh.com/1431509/, article originally reference by http://www.flutrackers.com).... a plausible hypothesis.
