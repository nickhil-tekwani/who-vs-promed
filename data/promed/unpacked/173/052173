[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Jordan can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/7f*Y. The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

In view of the reported circulation of the LSD virus in north eastern Israel and in Lebanon since mid 2012, its presence in northern Jordan (Irbid) was, in fact, long expected. Most probably, the virus has been circulating in adjacent Syria as well but no report has become available so far. LSD is known to have become endemic in Egypt for several decades, with mass vaccinations applied annually. Enhanced surveillance in other Eastern Mediterranean countries would be an appropriate measure.

The clinical signs observed in outbreak 2 (Amman area), a week after the performance of vaccination of the susceptible dairy cattle with the Jovac fortified (X10) live vaccine, is in need of further analysis. Could it be a (mild), post-vaccination reactive process (which is not exceptional) rather than a full-scale, pathogenic LSD disease manifestation? - Mod.AS]
