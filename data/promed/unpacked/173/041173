Barn 20 at Laurel Park has been placed under quarantine until 30 Jan 2018 by the Maryland Department of Agriculture after a horse stabled there tested positive for the equine herpesvirus (EHV1) on [Fri 19 Jan 2018].

The horse in question is a 4-year-old gelding. He has not been ill or displayed any of the neurological symptoms that can be associated with the herpesvirus, according to his trainer, Tony Aguirre. Since testing positive, he has been moved off track to a farm.

[The horse] was tested for equine herpes because he had recently been at the New Bolton Center in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, to be gelded. On 16 Jan 2018, another horse who had been at the New Bolton Center with colic, but who had been released 9 Jan 2018, tested positive for equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease caused by EHV-1.

After that positive test, the New Bolton Center tested all of the horses under its care, and a 2nd horse tested positive for EHV1. The center then reached out to the connections of all horses who had recently been at the clinic and recommended they be tested for the virus.

Many horses are latently infected with equine herpesvirus but show no signs of the disease. During times of stress, an apparently healthy horse who carries the virus may test positive for EVH1.

Signs of EVH1 include fever, nasal discharge, and lethargy. In serious cases, EHV1 can lead to EHM and neurological issues such as paralysis, seizures, and sometimes death.

[The horse] had been trained by King Leatherbury, but while the horse was at New Bolton his owner decided to transfer the horse to Aguirre, and vanned the horse to his stable.

None of the horses stabled in the barn will be allowed to train or race while the quarantine is in effect.

Aguirre, who has a string of 10 horses, said he "feels terrible" about the situation and has apologized to the other trainers in his barn.

"The horse was doing great," he said. "I walked him a day, shed-rowed him a few days, and had him in training. He was here for about 10 days. What a mess."

[The horse] is scheduled to be retested for the herpesvirus by state officials next [Tue 23 Jan 2018]. If the test comes back negative, the quarantine will be lifted, according to Sal Sinatra, president of the Maryland Jockey Club.

"There are no sick horses on the grounds," Sinatra said. "This is all precautionary. We want to be careful with this."

While the quarantine is in place, horses stabled at Parx Racing and Penn National who travel to Laurel will not be allowed to return.

Laurel has not allowed horses stabled at Belmont Park to ship in since a horse trained by Linda Rice tested positive for the herpesvirus at that track [9 Jan 2018].

[The long hand of EHV is continuing to reach out past New Bolton Center. It can spread easily and quickly and fever may be the only sign. We hope for negative tests, well horses, and races to be carried out. - Mod.TG
