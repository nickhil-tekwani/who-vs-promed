Confusion over mystery disease
-----------------------------------
Villagers from Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Bijnor, Ghaziabad
and Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh call it "the annual winter
fever." It has claimed about 326 lives since 2002.
Yet, the official strategy to check this "mystery virus in the west"
is to patiently wait until the temperature drops below 16 C and the
virus dies a natural death, since no one has a clue about its
identity.
"It is much easier to fight Japanese encephalitis in Purvanchal. At
least we can take necessary preventive measures. But here we are
absolutely at sea. After all, one can only cure a disease one
identifies," a hapless senior health official told TOI. Close to 100
children have succumbed to the disease in Saharanpur during the last
month-and-a-half [October-November 2005].
The confusion persists despite annual visits by public health
experts, epidemiologists, microbiologists and entomologists from the
National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the National Vector Born Disease
Control Programme to collect samples.
These are routinely followed by a visit from a high-powered team from
the state government. The achievements so far are contradictory
reports by NIV and NICD in 2003 and a spate of suspensions, including
that of CMO Saharanpur at the same time.
According to records, findings so far have varied from eco virus,
herpes simplex virus and JE in 2002-03 to a "cocktail virus" with
traces of JE, eco virus, malaria, and virus encephalitis.
Causing greater worry to health experts is expansion of the endemic
pocket. The virus, confined to Saharanpur for the last 10 years, has
now spread its tentacles into Ghaziabad and Baghpat too.
In fact, patients from Baghpat chose to go to Delhi, 24 km away, for
treatment. None visited the Baghpat primary health center last year
[2004], sources said.
They even hinted at the possibility of a similar strain traveling as
far as Karnal, where deaths of children, especially girls, were
reported recently.
What vexes experts is the government's insistence in sending samples
to Delhi or Pune when Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI),
Lucknow has all facilities for viral isolation.
Dr. TN Dhole, professor in microbiology at SGPGI admitted that the
institute had not received a single sample for examination in the
last 10 years. This, when NICD does not have a self-culture system,
he said.

If you thought that Japanese Encephalitis (JE) was the most dreaded
form of the killer encephalitis, then you are wrong, for a deadlier
version has been making the rounds now.
After claiming the lives of 97 children out of 140 cases in
Saharanpur in less than 2 months, the disease has spread panic in the
region.
It is now spreading to adjoining villages and the neighboring
district of Muzaffarnagar.
What sets alarm bells ringing is that, unlike JE, this suspected
encephalitis has an average death rate of 60 percent and an
incubation period as short as 6 hours. This means that saving lives
is a much bigger challenge.
These 2 characteristics have compelled officials at the epidemic
control cell (ECC) of the UP health directorate (UPHD) to sit up and
take note of the same.
Several expert groups visited the affected region this year [2005] to
understand the disease in depth. Enumerating some more of its
characteristics, a member of the group of experts said the virus
attacks a patient suddenly, and its effect could be seen in the form
of very high fever, stiffness of neck and limbs and convulsion
followed by death.
Interestingly, early medical intervention helped in saving lives, but
by the time the fever was taken seriously it was already too late.
Also, residual paralysis -- crippling of limbs due to inflammation of
the anterior part of the brain parenchyma, which is a characteristic
of JE -- is not present with this virus. Another feature which
appears unique to the disease is the target age group.
Until now, the maximum number of cases have been reported in the 3-5
years age group. Also, unlike JE, more females have been affected by
this virus: 13 males to 15 females.
Yet another noticeable feature is the time period, which is mid
September to the end of December. Compared to JE, it surfaces at a
time when JE is on the wane.

[Upon reading the above newswires, this moderator was reminded of the
types of descriptions of the newswires that accompanied the
henipavirus outbreaks in Bangladesh. (see references below). At that
time, there was mention that the outbreaks seemed to be caused by
Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, but the disease was more severe,
more rapid in evolution and was associated with a higher case
fatality rate than usually seen with JE. In the initial outbreak in
2001, cases occurred in all age groups; in subsequent outbreaks there
was a preponderance of cases in the childhood population. In the
January 2005 outbreak, illness was associated with drinking juice
made from local palm fruit. Speculations were that the juice was made
from fruit contaminated by fruit bat droppings or from fruit the bats
had half-eaten.
The above newswires mention that testing has been done for eco virus
[echovirus? -- an encephalitis-associated enterovirus]. In late
October 2005 an outbreak of Coxsackievirus infection, another
encephalitis-associated enterovirus, causing mortality in children
was reported from this region of India [see: Encephalitis,
coxsackievirus - India (Uttar Pradesh) 20051025.3115]. Other viruses
mentioned are herpes simplex viruses and Japanese encephalitis virus,
but there is no mention of testing for henipavirus is made. It is
also noteworthy to mention that henipavirus was associated with an
outbreak in North Bengal India in 2001 as well. It is noteworthy that
the article mentions this "new illness" has been reappearing annually
since 2002 and notes that JE has been ruled out. The fact that these
deaths are singled out as different from the others associated with
the JE outbreak this year (2005) is also noteworthy, as this has been
a major epidemic year for JE in Uttar Pradesh (see refs. below).
ProMED-mail had a thread on a similar occurrence in the same area and
same time of year last year. The etiology of that outbreak was never
resolved. At that time, we requested information from knowledgeable
sources, but did not receive any information. In addition to
henipavirus, Chandipura virus has been implicated in outbreaks
elsewhere in India, yet no mention of testing for Chandipura virus is
included in the above descriptions.
Rather than continue to speculate, ProMED-mail would like to request
further information from knowledgeable individuals in the region. -
