Smut now in all growing areas
-----------------------------
Sugarcane smut has now been confirmed in all regions in Queensland,
following its detection in the Burdekin yesterday [16 Oct 2008]. And
grower group Canegrowers says it is now only a matter of time before
smut is found on NSW [New South Wales] plants after spores were
identified in northern NSW earlier in the year [see ProMED-mail post
no. 20080421.1412. - Mod.DHA].

Sugarcane smut is an airborne disease found in most sugarcane
industries worldwide. Until 2 years ago [2006] the eastern seaboard
cane industry was free of the disease. "The only truly effective
measure against the impact of smut, which reduces productivity in a
cane plant until it finally kills it, is to replace susceptible
varieties with those with high levels of resistance to the fungal
strain," Canegrowers chief executive Ian Ballantyne said.

"Research into varieties suitable for Australian conditions has been
underway for 10 years, in anticipation of smut's eventual arrival in
Australia. So when it was identified 2 years ago, the industry moved
quickly to promote a replanting program of less smut susceptible
varieties. The BSES [Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations] plant
breeding program has proved its worth -- a number of replacement
varieties are looking promising. That said there are still gaps in
availability of suitable varieties for all climates and soil types."

Mr Ballantyne said the next 2 years would be critical for the
Australian industry as it races to access enough plant material to
plant out low susceptibility varieties across the majority of its
area. Cane growers, productivity services companies and BSES Limited
will continue to inspect cane crops for disease spread and management.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It
is highly contagious and can be spread by wind, on clothing and
machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure containing the
spores. Smut spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris.
Disease management may include cultural methods, burning, fungicides,
and resistant cane cultivars. For more information on the disease see
previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.

Australia was the last cane growing country worldwide considered to
be free of smut until the disease was found in 1998 in Western
Australia, a minor cane growing area, and in June 2006 in Queensland.
Despite efforts to contain the disease, its spread has been rapid.
