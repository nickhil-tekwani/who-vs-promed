Wheat streak mosaic virus has appeared in southern Alberta winter wheat, with potential to infect spring wheat.

"We've confirmed it in probably a dozen fields and people have seen symptoms in dozens more. And in a few of the fields, it's severe," said Alberta Agriculture's Mike Harding.

"We had maybe a dozen or so fields last year [2015] that were confirmed to have wheat streak mosaic but we've got many, many more than that this year [2016]. It has really a break-out year." Some farmers who identified the virus early were able to plant canola, which is not a host to the virus.

"If the wheat is for grain, you could take it as feed," Harding said. The remaining strategy is to remove any green plant tissue so the mites don't survive to carry the virus into the next year. For that reason, farmers may want to delay planting winter wheat. "Neither the virus nor the vector would normally survive our winters unless they have a green bridge," he said.

The virus is already causing severe crop loss in Montana and North Dakota [USA; see ProMED-mail post 20160114.3937362]. Mary Burrows, Montana State University, has seen 100 per cent winter wheat crop loss in some fields and estimates 55-85 per cent yield loss in spring wheat in some parts. Conditions last year [2015] combined to create ideal conditions for an outbreak.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) can infect wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses, as well as oats and barley in experimental inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in wheat. Symptoms usually appear in warmer weather and may include yellow blotches, streaks, and mottling on leaves, as well as severe stunting, excessive tillering, and possibly death of plants.

WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tosichella_ (taxonomic confusion with _A. tulipae_ has been addressed by molecular methods -- see link below). Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for approximately a week. Field distribution of symptoms is closely related to the dispersal of the vector; for example, margins of fields are often affected first. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted, as well as seed transmitted at a low level. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum from the previous season via a 'green bridge' (as mentioned above).

WSMV or _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) have also been reported as synergistic partners, in the Americas and Europe, to cause maize lethal necrosis (MLN) in co-infection with _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles).
