Chronic wasting disease test
----------------------------
For the first time, a live animal test has been developed for a disease
related to mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE). The
test has been used to detect chronic wasting disease (CWD) in live and
[dead? - Mod.SH deer. Currently, there is no test for BSE in the live
animal, and no cure for either BSE or CWD.
Chronic wasting disease is thought to be caused by infectious proteins
known as prions. It was first recognized as a clinical wasting syndrome in
1967 in mule deer in a wildlife research facility in northern Colorado. It
was identified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in 1978.
The disease attacks the brains of infected deer and elk, causing the
animals to become thin, display abnormal behavior, lose bodily functions,
and die.
A test for CWD that uses samples of tonsil tissue from live mule deer has
been developed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW), providing a new
tool to help prevent the spread and reduce the prevalence of the disease in
wild and captive deer herds. The Colorado DOW, working with Colorado State
University in Fort Collins and the University of Wyoming in Laramie, began
a research project earlier this year to determine if the live test would be
accurate and effective. "The availability of a reliable test for diagnosing
CWD in live mule deer offers us several opportunities for advancing both
the understanding and management of this important wildlife disease," said
DOW veterinarian Mike Miller, who led the study in collaboration with DOW
researcher Tom Hobbs. "Early detection and removal of CWD infected animals
appears to be the most effective method for managing CWD,"Miller said.
"Selective culling of positive animals and animals in contact with these
positive individuals should help reduce the prevalence rates in endemic
areas."
About 5 per cent of deer and less than 1 per cent of elk are infected with
CWD in the endemic areas of Colorado. The disease has never been found in
wild deer and elk in other parts of the state. Elizabeth Williams, a
professor of veterinary science at the University of Wyoming and a
pathologist at the state veterinary laboratory said the disease is also
present in captive herds in 5 states.
The first positive farmed herd in the United States was detected in 1997 in
South Dakota, said the US Agriculture Department's (USDA) Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Since then, 16 additional positive herds
have been found: 6 in South Dakota, 3 in Nebraska, 5 in Colorado, and 1
each in Oklahoma and Montana. As of October 2001, 6 of these 17 positive
herds remained under state quarantine. APHIS said that 0 of the herds have
been depopulated or have been slaughtered and tested, and the quarantine
has been lifted from 1 herd that underwent rigorous surveillance with no
further evidence of disease.
Miller cautioned that the new test will not work in all situations and
won't replace the current testing of animals after they have been killed by
hunters or wildlife managers. The new test on tonsil tissue is more
sensitive than examining the brain tissue of animals killed by the illness,
the current standard test for CWD because prions congregate in the tonsils
early in the disease's development. Testing of tonsil tissue is equally
effective in both live deer and deer who have been killed by hunters or
during culling efforts. But the test isn't effective for elk because the
disease develops differently in the 2 species. There still is no live test
for elk.
The new live test may allow wildlife managers to determine if the illegal
feeding of deer is a factor in spreading the disease. Feeding by humans
attracts many animals to small areas, increasing the chance CWD will
spread. Colorado and federal health officials say that it is unlikely CWD
is naturally transmissible to humans or to animals other than deer or elk.
They also note BSE has never been found in the United States.

[This is a significant breakthrough. According to some at United States
Department of Agriculture, this test shows great promise, despite its early
introduction into the market. It is unfortunate that it does not work on
elk. - Mod.TG
