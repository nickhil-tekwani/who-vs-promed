The results from a case-control study on avian influenza conducted in Hong
Kong showed that visiting a poultry stall in the week before becoming ill
was the strongest risk factor. The case-control study was aimed at
comparing different exposure risk factors between patients and controls. It
covered a number of areas including live poultry exposure, exposure when
preparing food, food eaten during the week before onset and human illness
exposure during the week before onset. The results supported earlier
findings that human-to-human transmission of the [virus] is inefficient.
The case-control study was jointly carried out by the Department of Health,
Hong Kong, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
(CDC). The results of the study were released by the Hong Kong Department
of Health and also were presented at a session of the International
Emerging Infectious Disease Conference held in Atlanta.
In all, 18 cases were confirmed [as having been caused by] influenza
A(H5N1) in Hong Kong. The day of onset of illness of the last case was 28
December 1998. A 24-year-old female patient is still under treatment and in
stable condition while 11 others have been discharged after recovery. Six
people died of the disease.
