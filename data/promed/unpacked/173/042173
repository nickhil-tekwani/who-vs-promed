Regarding the post on ProMED-mail dated 25 Nov 1999, Dr. Wilde stated "One
should again emphasize that Japan, many years ago, managed to get rid of JE
by vaccinating pigs, screening pig stalls and vaccinating the population
living close to pig farms."

I can assure you that JE has not been eliminated from Japan, most notably
the Okinawa Prefecture. Despite a high vaccination rate of the local
population & American service members, and the use of well placed controls,
the vector _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_and hosts (mainly pigs) are abundant
throughout the area.

Japanese encephalitis is and will continue to be a management issue
throughout SE Asia.

[Henry Wilde likely was referring to the main island group comprising
Japan. It is not a question of whether the vector, the vertebrate hosts or
even the virus is present, but whether JE disease occurs in Japan. Tarrant
is correct in that the threat remains. - Mod.CHC
