The death toll of the cholera epidemic in war-ravaged Yemen has risen to 2151 since it broke out in late April 2017, the WHO said Sat 7 Oct 2017. A total of 800 626 people from 22 provinces out of total 23 have been infected, WHO said in a statement distributed to the local media.

The death toll has increased by 24 comparing with the WHO report a week ago, while the suspected cases have risen by 33 102. Most of the deaths were reported from the northern province of Hajjah, while most of the infected cases were reported from the northwestern port province of Hodeidah on the coast of the Red Sea, both under control of Shiite Houthi rebels. Last week [29 Sep 2017], the International Committee of the Red Cross expected the epidemic to hit one million by the end of 2017.

The war in Yemen, which has lasted more than 2.5 years, has destroyed the bulk of the country's water and sanitation systems, with more than half of Yemen's health facilities out of service, and about 15 million people gaining no access to safe water and basic healthcare. The war has also pushed the country into the brink of famine, with an estimated 385 000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, thus putting them at heightened risk of acute watery diarrhea and cholera, according to the UN agencies.

In 2015 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
In 2016 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258910/1/WER9236.pdf, the total number of cases was 132 121 from 38 countries.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is barely 5 months old and is 6.06 times the total number of global cases of 2016 and 2.35 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.27 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. There are almost as many cases in less than 6 months than the entire 7 years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the authorities estimate that the total will likely break one million by 2017's end. However, one million cases could be reached by about 23 Nov 2017, poetically the day of the American Thanksgiving.

Interestingly, on 3 Oct 2017, WHO published "Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030" written by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. The summary can be seen at http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap-summary.pdf and the entire document at: http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap.pdf. - Mod.LL
