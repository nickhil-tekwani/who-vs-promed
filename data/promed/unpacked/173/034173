Schreiber Processing Corporation, a Maspeth, New York establishment,
is recalling an undetermined amount of broiled chicken liver products
that are linked to a cluster of salmonellosis illnesses in New Jersey
and New York, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 8 Nov 2011. FSIS is
continuing to work with states, the CDC and the FDA during this
ongoing investigation.

The illnesses are linked to the consumption of broiled chicken livers
which appear to be ready-to-eat, but are in fact partially cooked and
need to be fully cooked before consumption. Illnesses are also linked
to chopped liver made from this product at retail stores. The outbreak
strain of _Salmonella [_enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg was isolated by
the NY State Department of Agriculture and Market from samples of
broiled chicken livers from the establishment, and chopped chicken
livers produced at retail from these livers. These products would have
been repackaged and will not bear the original packaging information.

The outbreak strain PFGE [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis] pattern
does not match another strain of _S._ Heidelberg associated with
ground turkey recalled earlier in 2011 [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110812.2449]. It is not known at this time if this outbreak strain
has any drug resistance, but any finding of drug resistance will be
made public by FSIS once it becomes available.

The products are:
[labels can be seen at

Mod.LL]
- 10 lb boxes with 2, 5 lb bags of "Meal Mart Broiled Chicken Liver;
Made for Further Thermal Processing"
- 10 lb boxes of loose packed "Chicken Liver Broiled"

Each bag or box bears the establishment number "P-787" inside the USDA
mark of inspection. The product was distributed to retail stores and
institutional users in Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and
Pennsylvania. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be
posted on the FSIS website at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp.

NYC Health Department Warns MealMart Kosher Broiled Chicken Livers can
cause illness from _Salmonella_ bacteria
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Department has identified 56 cases of _Salmonella
[_enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg bacteria-related illness in New York
City that are linked to eating MealMart brand kosher broiled chicken
livers from the Schreiber Processing Corporation that were not cooked.
Even though they are labeled as "broiled" and may appear cooked,
chicken livers from this manufacturer are not thoroughly cooked and
should not be eaten unless they are cooked to an internal temperature
of 165 deg F [75 deg C]. _Salmonella_ illness has also been linked to
chopped liver made from this uncooked product. Chopped liver made by
the consumer after purchasing this product should also be fully cooked
before consuming or discarded. Cases of illness have also been
identified in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Minnesota.

MealMart has issued a recall of this product and is cooperating with
the Health Department's investigation. The New York State Departments
of Agriculture and Markets and Health, the US Centers for Disease
Control and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service have collaborated with the NYC Health Department to
identify cases of illness associated with this _Salmonella [_enterica_
serotype] Heidelberg strain, a common bacteria associated with food
poisoning in humans.

The Health Department recognized a pattern of people reporting that
they ate kosher broiled chicken livers or chopped liver before their
illness began and this past week confirmed that the cases of
_Salmonella [_enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg identified during the
period of February through November 2011 had a common DNA
"fingerprint." Of the 56 people who were diagnosed with infection from
this _Salmonella_ strain, 12 were hospitalized. This _Salmonella_
strain has been found in samples of kosher broiled chicken livers and
in samples of chopped liver made from the same broiled chicken liver
produced by MealMart Company in Maspeth, NY. Though consumers reported
that they believed the product to be fully cooked, it is not safe to
eat without additional cooking.

In stores, "broiled chicken livers" are often re-packaged and sold in
smaller quantities or are used to prepare chopped liver sold at
deli-style establishments. Retail stores and other establishments in
the following communities may have either re-packaged this product or
used it to prepare chopped liver that was sold to customers:
New York: Bronx, Brooklyn, Cedarhurst, Far Rockaway, Ferndale,
Flushing, Kew Gardens, Lawrence, Loch Sheldrake, Monsey, New York
(Manhattan), Ocean Side, Parksville, Roslyn Heights, Schenectady,
South Fallsberg, Suffern, Wesley Hills, Woodridge
New Jersey: Elizabeth, Englewood, Freehold, Highland Park, Howell,
Lakewood, Moonachie, Passaic, Paterson, Teaneck
Pennsylvania: Mckeesrocks, Philadelphia
Maryland: Baltimore
Minnesota: New Hope

For specific retailers that sell these products and other
establishments associated with this outbreak within these communities,
visit the _Salmonella_ outbreak link on the NYC Health Department's
website at
http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/public/press11/salm-kosher-chicken.pdf.
The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service has also posted
information about this recall on the USDA website
(http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/Recall_090_2011_Release/index.asp.


Symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain,
cramps, and fever. Symptoms usually begin 12 to 72 hours after
exposure, but can begin up to a week after exposure. _Salmonella_
infections usually resolve in 5-7 days, and most people recover
without treatment. In some persons, diarrhea may be so severe that
hospitalization is necessary. In rare cases, _Salmonella_ infection
can lead to death, particularly in the elderly or those with weakened
immune systems. Each year, 1200 to 1300 cases of _Salmonella_ are
diagnosed in New York City.

_Salmonella_ bacteria are frequently found in raw chicken or other
uncooked meats. Consumers should always follow safe food handling
practices to prevent transmission of _Salmonella_ bacteria to humans.
Avoid getting sick from _Salmonella_ illness and contaminating other
foods with _Salmonella_ by:
- Washing hands, utensils and cutting boards after they have been in
contact with raw meat and before they touch other food.
- Cooking meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [75
deg C] before consumption.
- Putting cooked meat on a clean platter rather than on the one that
was used to hold raw meat.

[The moral of the story here is and always was: READ THE LABEL.
Although it appears that the chicken livers seemed ready-to-eat, the
original label stated otherwise. If the livers were, in fact,
repackaged for sale without the original packaging information,
clearly a flaw in the system is present. - Mod.LL]
