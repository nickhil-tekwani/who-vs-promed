[Malaria is endemic in Angola and a sudden
increase in mortality indicates problems with
susceptibility to the drugs used for treatment.
The text does not indicate the drugs used, but it
could be chloroquine, which is cheap and widely
available. A recent study from Angola (Kryger T
et al. Assessment of clinical course and outcome
of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Angola
diagnosed by microscopic and molecular
methods.Int Marit Health. 2004;55(1-4):75-85)
found that 98 percent of the P. falciparum
isolates in Angola carried the pfcrt mutation
used as a marker of choloroquine resistance.
Further information will be appreciated. � Mod.EP]
