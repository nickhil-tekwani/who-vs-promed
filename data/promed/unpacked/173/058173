The Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has disclosed that the number of deaths in the Sinoe County unknown disease has increased to 10.

Speaking on a local radio station in Monrovia, the Chief Medical Officer of Liberia, Dr Francis Ketteh said 8 persons who are isolated [in hospital] are currently undergoing thorough medical check.

Dr Kateh speaking further said this unknown disease is not related to the deadly Ebola virus that took thousands of lives in the sub-region.

Since the outbreak of this unknown disease last week [week of 23 April 2017], Liberians and foreign residents are expressing fears and are calling on all stakeholders in the health sector to quickly move in to abort the spreading of this unknown illness.

[The number of deaths has increased by one to a total of 10. There is still no identification of the etiological agent responsible for these cases. Although concern in these reports mentions the need for measures to stop the spread of the disease, there is no evidence yet that a transmissible agent is involved. - Mod.TY
