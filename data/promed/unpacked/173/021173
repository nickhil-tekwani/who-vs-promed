Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: During active surveillance program, samples collected on [9 Sep 2019] from one duck farm in Kaohsiung City were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for analysis. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N5 subtype was confirmed by AHRI on [13 Sep 2019]. The farm has been placed under movement restriction. All animals in this infected farm have been culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms (2 duck farms, 2 native chicken farms and 1-layer chicken farm) within a 3-km [approx. 1.8 mi] radius of the infected farm are clinically healthy and test results of HPAI are all negative, and they are under intensified surveillance for 3 months to detect, if any, spreading of the virus. Chinese Taipei therefore considers that HPAI H5N5 subtype virus has not been spread.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; zoning; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / gene sequencing / 13 Sep 2019 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 12 Sep 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
