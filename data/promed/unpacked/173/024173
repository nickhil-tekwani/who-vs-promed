France: Suspected Imported Human Case of Avian Influenza Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NANCY: A 69-year-old man has been hospitalised in northeastern France with
suspected avian influenza virus infection, health officials said on Thu 2
Dec 2004. The man, who has not been named, had recently returned from a
trip to Viet Nam, they said. "We are applying the principle of precaution
because the patient had come back from Viet Nam and showed symptoms that
suggested avian influenza," said Bertrand Demangeon, a doctor at the main
hospital in Nancy. The man was being kept in isolation in the intensive
care unit.

Avian influenza A virus has been responsible for some 20 human deaths in
Vietnam in the last year, and there have been outbreaks in six other Asian
countries.

[There appears to be no direct evidence that the patient is suffering from
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, other than that he has returned
from Viet Nam. No human cases or deaths have been confirmed in Viet Nam
during the past two months, and all confirmed fatal and non-fatal cases
have involved Vietnamese citizens. The final sentence of the above report
is misleading. The outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in
six countries in the region refer to outbreaks in poultry; human case have
been confirmed only in Viet Nam (27 cases of whom 20 died) and Thailand (17
cases of whom 12 died). Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
