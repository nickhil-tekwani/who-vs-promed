Hepatitis C cases reach record level in the Lothians
----------------------------------------------------
The number of people diagnosed with hepatitis C in the Lothians has reached record levels. A total of 333 people were diagnosed with the condition last year [2011] -- more than twice as many as a decade ago. Cases have risen from 276 in 2010, and 202 in 2009. Health experts welcomed the news, however, and said it proved that efforts to increase awareness and testing for the illness were paying off.

The spread of hepatitis C has been called the Silent Epidemic, because sufferers can in some cases have virtually no symptoms for up to a decade. Early symptoms, which include depression, fatigue, skin problems, insomnia, pain and digestive disorders, are also often misattributed to other causes. 20 per cent of sufferers clear the virus from the body within 6 months of infection, but the rest develop a long-term condition which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer or end-stage liver disease.

In February [2012], patients in the Lothians were among the 1st to be offered the option of 2 new drugs which it is hoped will help cure more people. A scheme last summer also put up posters in pub and club toilets across the Capital [Edinburgh] warning of the dangers of hepatitis C, explaining how the disease can be caught, and advertising support groups.

There are more than 3700 people living in the Lothians who are known to have hepatitis C but the Scottish officer for the Hepatitis C Trust, Petra Wright, said the true figure for infections was probably double the official figures. She said the rise in reported cases was partly down to the introduction of testing at drug outreach projects in 2009, and the introduction last year of the Scottish Government's Sexual Health and Blood Borne Viruses Framework. "We welcome the increase, because it shows that the action plan is working," she said. "We can also see that they're diagnosing a lot of people in the younger age groups of 40 and under, and that shows the targeted testing is working, but more needs to be done to get the Baby Boomers, born between 1945 and 1965, who've been at risk in the past, tested."

The best-known risk factor for hepatitis C infection is intravenous drug use, but steroid users and those who have had tattoos done abroad or at unlicensed events are also at risk. Hepatitis C, along with HIV, is the subject of the public inquiry being carried out by Lord Penrose into patients who were infected by NHS blood products.

Dr Ewan Stewart, lead clinician for NHS Lothian-led Viral Hepatitis Managed Care Network (MCN), said: "These figures reflect the hard work going on across the Lothian to raise awareness of hepatitis C as well as making it easier for people to get tested. The Lothian Viral Hepatitis MCN works closely with GPs and other key health care workers to identify those at risk of the infection, promotes testing in community and prison settings and provides easy access testing clinics. We know that hepatitis C can have serious consequences if it is not diagnosed and treated. It is important to speak with a health care professional if you are worried about hepatitis C."

Number of people diagnosed in Lothian each year (rate per 100 000 of population) are as follows:
2001: 150 (19.3)
2009: 202 (24.7)
2010: 276 (33)
2011: 333 (39.8)
Scotland 2011: 2147 (41.1)

Increased awareness of hepatitis C has become increasingly relevant with the development of new treatment options. The determination of the specific genotype of the hepatitis C virus responsible for a patient's illness is also becoming more important for the prediction of response to antiviral treatment: e.g., genotype 1 is generally associated with a poor response to interferon alone, whereas genotypes 2 and 3 are associated with more favourable responses. The current gold standard of therapy -- pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin -- significantly improves response for all genotypes.

The combination of pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin has been the standard recommended treatment for hepatitis C. The protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by the US FDA in May 2011 for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. 3 phase-3 trials are available for telaprevir, which provided data that were the basis for FDA approval. Boceprevir demonstrated efficacy and safety in 2 pivotal phase-3 trials. Both agents demonstrated statistically significantly higher rates of virological response compared with the standard of care involving peginterferons and ribavirin. Telaprevir and boceprevir also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients who had previously failed dual therapy for hepatitis C. Safety concerns for both agents include anemia, drug interactions, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal adverse events.

Decision makers have many factors to consider in developing a strategy around hepatitis C. Increased drug costs, patient management, adherence, comparative safety and efficacy, and appropriate utilization management controls are important issues. (See: Tungol A, Rademacher K, Schafer JA. J Manag Care Pharm. 2011 Nov;17(9):685-94.).
