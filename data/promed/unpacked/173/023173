[A follow-up to PRO/EDR> Hand, foot & mouth disease - Asia (19): CDC
notice 20080704.2037]

We'd like to clarify the Moderator's comment on the apparent
disproportionate mortality rate of enterovirus infection between
Singapore and Taiwan. In Taiwan, only cases of enterovirus infection
with severe complications are required to be reported. We estimate
from sentinel surveillance data and national health insurance
database that there are at least 200 000 children in Taiwan infected
with enterovirus this year [2008]. Thus, there may be no significant
difference in mortality rate between Singapore and Taiwan.

As of Mon 7 Jul 2008, a total of 311 laboratory-confirmed enterovirus
infection with severe complications (including 10 deaths) among
infants and young children have been reported in Taiwan this year,
reflecting a sharp increase over the same period since 1998. Of the
311 cases confirmed so far this year, 291 (93.5 percent) were tested
positive for enterovirus 71 (EV71), which can cause severe
complications or even deaths. The predominant genogroup is B5. The
majority of the cases (270 cases) have been discharged, while 31
cases are still hospitalized (21 in intensive care).

The currently ongoing epidemic started in week 11, peaked in week 25
and is subsiding gradually. To enhance control of the epidemic,
Taiwan has activated its Central Epidemics Command Center for
Enterovirus to coordinate control measures at various levels of the
governments, and to enhance cases surveillance and transferring since
10 Jun 2008 (week 24).

The surveillance systems for enterovirus infections we adopted in
Taiwan include 4 parts:
a. National Notifiable Disease Surveillance: only the suspected
cases with severe complications are mandatory to be reported to
Taiwan CDC. ( This is where the case number shown in news media derived from. )
b. Sentinel Surveillance: any outpatient visits with hand, foot,
and mouth disease or herpangina will be counted for the calculation
of the consultation rate per week. There are around 600 clinics
consisting of this sentinel surveillance system. This system is
useful for tracking the trend of the epidemic.
c. Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS): this is a
syndromic surveillance system collecting ICD-9 data from over 150
major emergency departments automatically. We use specific ICD-9 code
sets to represent enterovirus infections. This system can help us to
track the trend of the epidemic in real time.
d. Laboratory Surveillance: there are 13 contract laboratories
collecting samples from parts of the sentinel surveillance practices
and the 13 participating medical centers. This system helps us to
know the circulating genotypes of the enterovirus infection.

[ProMED-mail appreciates this clarification of an apparent
discrepancy between the hand, foot and mouth disease mortality data
from Singapore and Taiwan. The detailed information relating to the
surveillance and control of enteroviral infection of children in
Taiwan will be useful for all those working in this field of health
care. - Mod.CP]
