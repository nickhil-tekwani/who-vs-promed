Staff at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's wildlife disease laboratory in Laramie confirmed the presence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a buck mule deer harvested on 2 Oct 2015 near Flat Top Mountain, in deer hunt area 100, which lies about 15 miles [24 km] northwest of Baggs. Deer hunt area 100 is bordered by CWD positive deer hunt areas 82 and 84 to the east and 98 to the northeast. [Since area 100 is boarded on the east and the northeast by positive areas it seems likely it was only a matter of time before area 100 became positive - Mod.TG]

"This is our 1st new positive hunt area this year [2015]. We again appreciate the help of hunters who help with the surveillance program. We do recommend people not eat deer, elk, or moose that test positive for CWD," Deputy Chief of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department [WGFD] Wildlife Division, Scott Edberg said.

Green River region personnel continue to collect samples of deer, elk, and moose through hunter field checks and at CWD sampling stations. WGFD personnel collect and analyze more than 1600 CWD samples annually throughout the state.

Hunters who wish to have their deer, elk or moose tested for CWD outside of the department's CWD surveillance program can to do so by contacting the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab at (307) 766-9925. Hunters should be aware that it may take a few weeks after their animal is sampled to get their test results.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a chronic, fatal disease of the central nervous system of mule deer, white-tailed deer, Rocky Mountain elk, and (rarely) moose. Chronic wasting disease belongs to the group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These disorders are thought to be caused by abnormal proteins called "prion proteins." Prion proteins are neither bacteria nor viruses. They are proteins devoid of nucleic acid, thus they are not living organisms.

Prion proteins have similar amino acid sequences as normal cellular proteins but in a different conformation. The functional role of the normal cellular proteins is unknown. Prion proteins cause a conformational change in the normal cellular protein and disease is induced when the normal cellular protein is converted into the prion protein, which apparently can no longer serve its normal role. This eventually causes brain cells to die. As more and more cells die, the disease can be observed to progress, ultimately ending in death.

The only animals known to get CWD are members of the Cervidae family (deer, elk, moose). Affected animals will have one or more of the following signs:
1. Emaciation, poor body condition, rough hair coat.
2. Behavioral changes (hyperactive when constrained; reluctance to move; ears droop).
3. Excessive salivation (sometimes).
4. Excessive drinking (or staying close to water source).
5. Lethargy (but will react when approached closely).
6. Death.

[Deer do not seem to know how to respect area line boundaries or state boundaries. Therefore when this disease is in an adjacent area, it is probable the disease will find its way across the line. Deer usually have about a 1-mile (2-km) radius range in their home territory.

While the prion protein theory has been listed as the cause of this interesting and somewhat baffling group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or TSE, I have always wondered why the scientific community really liked the prion theory when it does not stand up to Koch's postulates, a recognized standard to identify the causative agent of a particular disease. They include: the microorganism or other pathogen must be present in all cases of the disease. The pathogen must be isolated from the diseased host and grown in pure culture. The specific disease must be reproduced when a pure culture of the pathogen is inoculated into a healthy susceptible host. The pathogen must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host. - Mod.TG
