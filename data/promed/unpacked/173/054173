Cholera - Zimbabwe
------------------
On 6 Sep 2018, a cholera outbreak in Harare was declared by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) of Zimbabwe and notified to WHO on the same day. 25 patients were admitted to a hospital in Harare presenting with diarrhea and vomiting on 5 Sep 2018. The 1st case, a 25-year-old woman, presented to a hospital and died on 5 Sep 2018. A sample from the woman tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ serotype O1 Ogawa. All 25 patients had typical cholera symptoms including excessive vomiting and diarrhea with rice watery stools and dehydration. The MoHCC declared the outbreak after 11 cases were confirmed for cholera using rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits and the clinical presentation. 39 stool samples were collected for culture and sensitivity, 17 of which tested positive for _V. cholerae_ serotype O1 Ogawa.

There has been rapid increase in the number of suspected cases reported per day since 1 Sep 2018 there was a peak with 473 suspected cases notified on 9 Sep 2018. As of 15 Sep 2018, 3621 cumulative suspected cases, including 71 confirmed cases, and 32 deaths have been reported (case fatality ratio: 0.8%); of these, 98% (3564 cases) were reported from the densely populated capital Harare. The most affected suburbs in Harare are Glen View and Budiriro.

Cases with epidemiological links to cases from Harare have been recently reported from across the country, including in Mashonaland Central Province (Shamva district), Midlands province (Gokwe North district), Manicaland province (Buhera and Makoni districts), Masvingo province, and Chitungwiza city.

Public health response
----------------------
- The MoHCC [Ministry of Health and Child Care] declared the cholera outbreak in Harare city on 6 Sep 2018; the Government declared the outbreak an emergency and subsequently a disaster on 13 and 14 Sep 2018, respectively.
- Outbreak coordination committees at the national and district levels have been established.
- WHO and the WHO Country Office (WCO) are supporting the MoHCC with coordination, scaling up the response, strengthening surveillance, and mobilizing both national and international health experts to form a cholera surge team.
- WHO experts are providing technical support to laboratories, improving diagnostics and strengthening infection and prevention control (IPC) in communities and health clinics.
- The Government is assessing the potential benefits of conducting an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign; WHO is deploying an expert in OCV campaigns to Harare to support this assessment.
- A cholera treatment centre (CTC) was established by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Glen View, Harare; MSF has provided extra nurses to support the response.
- The recruitment of additional nurses to strengthen the response is ongoing.
- WHO is providing supplies which contain oral rehydration solution, intravenous fluids and antibiotics for the treatment of patients in CTCs set up by partners.
- Risk communication activities in affected and at-risk districts are being conducted by the Government and health partners.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The outbreak started on 5 Sep 2018 and the number of cases notified per day continues to rapidly increase, particularly in Glen View and Budiriro suburbs of Harare. Cases with epidemiological links to this outbreak have been reported from other provinces across the country. Glen View, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, is an active informal trading area where people come from across the city and the rest of the country to trade. Key risk factors for cholera in Zimbabwe include the deterioration of sanitary and health infrastructure and increasing rural-urban migration which further strains the water and sanitation infrastructure. In Harare, contaminated water from boreholes and wells is suspected to be the source of the outbreak. The water supply situation in Harare remains dire due to the high demand of water that is not being met by the city supply. The country's available response capacities are overstretched as authorities are already responding to a large typhoid outbreak which started in August 2018. WHO assessed the overall public health risk to be high at the national level and moderate at the regional and low at global levels.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends proper and timely case management in CTCs. Increasing access to potable water, improving sanitation infrastructure, and strengthening hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities are the most effective means to prevent and control cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the affected population.

WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or with Zimbabwe based on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Bulawayo)

The number of people who have been quarantined for cholera in Bulawayo has risen to 10 from 3 on Fri 14 Sep 2018, amid revelations that the city's infectious disease hospital -- Thorngrove -- can hold no more than 100 patients. One more suspected case was recorded in Umguza, Matabeleland North, bringing to 11 the number of feared cases in the region.

The water-borne disease, which broke out in Harare at the beginning of the month [September 2018], has claimed at least 30 lives. Bulawayo City Council director of health services Dr Edwin Sibanda yesterday, 16 Sep 2018, said half of the quarantined people were probable cases of cholera awaiting lab results confirmation.

Speaking during an emergency meeting organised by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Judith Ncube at Mhlahlandlela Government Complex yesterday, Dr Sibanda said the city last had a confirmed cholera case in 2008. "So far we have 10 suspected cases, all of whom are at Thorngrove Hospital in an isolated ward. There is a mix of ages and patients are aged from 18 to 63," he said. "5 of them are probable cases as they were in contact with affected areas and they have signs and symptoms that spell cholera."

[3] Cholera - Africa (Lake Chad region)
Date: Wed 19 Sep 2018 4:50 PM WAT

https://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/cholera-outbreak-in-lake-chad-region-kills-more-than-500-people-1.771926


More than 500 people died from cholera in the Lake Chad region since the start of 2018, making it the worst outbreak to hit the area in 4 years, the UN said on [Wed 19 Sep 2018]. "Over 27 000 cholera cases and 510 deaths have been reported as of week 35 [25-31 Aug 2018] in the Lake Chad Basin," the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report. "This is 10 times more than the average cholera caseload over the past 4 years," it said.

It said that without action to control the disease, more than 6 million people could be affected. "The region is facing floods and heavy rains, creating an ideal environment for the outbreak to spread," the OCHA warned. "The last 2 major outbreaks in the region were in 2010 and 2014. An outbreak in 2018 is consistent with the 4-year cycle."

The Lake Chad region straddles parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, which are also grappling with an extremist insurgency. The OCHA said Nigeria was the worst hit, with 24 000 cases.

Water-borne diseases are a constant threat in the Lake Chad region because of a lack of sanitation. Stagnant groundwater during the rainy season can also cause illnesses.

A cholera outbreak has claimed the lives of 61 people in the last 2 months in Nigeria, according to a local official. Muhammad Kawuwa, northeastern Yobe state's commissioner of health, said Fri 21 Sep 2018, the 61 people died of the outbreak in 6 local governments in the state. Kawuwa also said a total of 906 cholera cases were reported in the 2-month period, while 50 people are currently undergoing medical treatment.

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ which people get from drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacterium. Its symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting and the disease takes effect 6 to 48 hours after the bacterium enters the body.

The region is also hit by Boko Haram insurgency, which makes displaced persons' camps a center for disease.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al, (1) it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
