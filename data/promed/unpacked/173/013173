The city of Camaçari, in the metropolitan region of Salvador, recorded a 475 per cent increase in cases of sporotrichosis in humans from [2015 to 2017]. Mycosis caused by fungi of the species _Sporothrix_ can be transmitted to humans as well as to animals, especially cats. The Municipal Health Department has filed a petition for inclusion of the skin-affecting disease in the mandatory public network notification list for all suspected cases to be registered.

In [2017], 23 cases of the disease were confirmed. As early as [2016], there were 16 cases. In [2015], there were 4 confirmed cases. This year [2018] 2 cases have already been registered in 3 months. The city's director of health surveillance, Fatima Guirra, says that despite the increase in the number of cases, it is not considered an outbreak.

"It is not an outbreak because the outbreak occurred in felines in 2015. It was a concentration in the neighborhood of Camaçari de Dentro. The outbreak was resolved. We have cases distributed in several neighborhoods. There are 2 cases. But by 2017, the risk was at 5 per 100 000 inhabitants," Guirra says.

The disease is transmitted by soil and, therefore, known as "gardener's disease". A wounded hand or foot can be the gateway to the fungus. However, infected animals, especially felines, can also transmit the fungus to humans through direct contact with the animal's injured skin.

[The following information regarding sporotrichosis is from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/sporotrichosis/:

"Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by a fungus called _Sporothrix schenckii_. The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous (skin) infection is the most common form of infection, although pulmonary infection can occur if a person inhales the microscopic, airborne fungal spores. Most cases of sporotrichosis are sporadic and are associated with minor skin trauma like cuts and scrapes; however, outbreaks have been linked to activities that involve handling contaminated vegetation such as moss, hay, or wood.

"The 1st symptom is usually a small painless nodule (bump) resembling an insect bite. The 1st nodule may appear any time from 1-12 weeks after exposure to the fungus. The nodule can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm where the fungus has entered through a break in the skin. The nodule will eventually become larger and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional bumps or nodules may appear later near the original lesion. Most _sporothrix_ infections only involve the skin. However, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, joints, and the central nervous system. Usually, these types of disseminated infections only occur in people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, a pneumonia-like illness can occur after inhaling sporothrix spores, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

"Most cases of sporotrichosis only involve the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues and are non-life-threatening, but the infection requires treatment with prescription antifungal medication for several months. The most common treatment for this type of sporotrichosis is oral itraconazole for 3 to 6 months. Itraconazole may also be used to treat bone and joint infections, but treatment should continue for at least 12 months. For patients with severe disease, and/or an infection that has spread throughout the body, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B should be used. Itraconazole can be used for step-down therapy once the patient has stabilized. Supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI) is another treatment option for cutaneous or lymphocutaneous disease. SSKI and azole drugs like itraconazole should not be used during pregnancy. Treatment recommendations may differ for children."
