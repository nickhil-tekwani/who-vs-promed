Characterization of a unique influenza A (H5N1) virus isolated in Hong Kong
in 2003
-----------------------------------------------
[A paper to appear in the 1 Aug 2005 issue of the Journal of Virology
describes characterization of a unique influenza A (H5N1) virus thought to
have been contracted by a Hong Kong resident during a visit to Fujian
province in mainland China in 2003. The nucleotide sequence (and some of
the biological properties) of this virus differ from the avian influenza A
(H5N1) viruses isolated from infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and from
the various avian influenza viruses isolated more recently in East Asia,
where sequence heterogeneity is being related prematurely to biological
properties, such as pathogenicity and host range.
The authors of the Journal of Virology paper conclude that their data
challenges the view that adaptation to land-based poultry is a prerequisite
for the replication of aquatic avian influenza A viruses in humans. This is
a novel and significant conclusion that challenges current dogma.
The Abstract of the paper is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]
Title: Characterization of a human H5N1 influenza A virus isolated in 2003
Authors: K Shinya, M Hatta, S Yamada, A Takada, S Watanabe, P Halfmann, et al.
ABSTRACT: "In 2003, H5N1 avian influenza virus infections were diagnosed in
2 Hong Kong residents who had visited the Fujian province in mainland
China, affording us the opportunity to characterize one of the viral
isolates, A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213; H5N1). In contrast to H5N1 viruses
isolated from humans during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, HK213 retained
several features of aquatic bird viruses, including the lack of a deletion
in the neuraminidase stalk and the absence of additional oligosaccharide
chains at the globular head of the hemagglutinin molecule. It demonstrated
weak pathogenicity in mice and ferrets but caused lethal infection in
chickens. The original isolate failed to produce disease in ducks but
became more pathogenic after 5 passages. Taken together, these findings
portray the HK213 isolate as an aquatic avian influenza A virus without the
molecular changes associated with the replication of H5N1 avian viruses in
land-based poultry such as chickens. This case challenges the view that
adaptation to land-based poultry is a prerequisite for the replication of
aquatic avian influenza A viruses in humans."
