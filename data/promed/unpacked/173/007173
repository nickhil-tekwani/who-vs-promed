More than 250 of the 1400 flood victims at a relief camp set up in Bengali
Boys Sindhi Section School in Ibrahim Hyderi fell unconscious immediately
after consuming cooked food, sources said.

The victims started vomiting and the condition of around 59 of them started
worsening until they had to be taken to a nearby hospital. The medical
teams available at the camp rushed to the scene and efforts were initiated
to provide immediate medical assistance to them. A local philanthropist had
been providing cooked food to the flood victims after Mukhtiarkar Asadullah
Abbasi had encouraged him to do so.

A well-placed officer in the City District Government Karachi (CDGK)
Revenue Department told Daily Times that by the time the food carriage
arrived at the relief camp, the cooked rice had turned stale. However,
since the rice did not show any sign of rotting, it was served to the flood
victims. Subsequently, they started vomiting and majority of them fell
unconscious. The authorities concerned immediately rushed to the scene and,
according to them, the situation was under control and none of the victims
was in serious condition.

A well-placed officer in the CDGK Health Department told Daily Times that
the sanitary situation in and around the relief camps was very poor. A
similar incident had taken place 3 days ago at the Pak Swedish Technical
Institute in Quaidabad, Landhi Town where more than 80 flood affectees had
fallen victim to food poisoning and fallen unconscious after consuming
stale food. More than 10 victims whose condition had worsened were taken to
the Sindh Government Hospital, Korangi No 5.

[The association of a foodborne illness associated with rice that has not
been properly stored suggests that this outbreak is related to _Bacillus
cereus_.

_B. cereus_, a ubiquitous, spore-forming bacterium, causes 2 recognized
forms of foodborne gastroenteritis: an emetic syndrome resembling that
caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ and characterized by an incubation period
of 1-6 hours and a diarrheal illness characterized by an incubation period
of 6-24 hours. Fever is uncommon with either syndrome. The emetic syndrome
is mediated by a highly stable toxin that survives high temperatures and
exposure to trypsin, pepsin, and pH extremes; the diarrheal syndrome is
mediated by a heat- and acid-labile enterotoxin that is sensitive to
proteolytic enzymes.

The diagnosis of _B. cereus_ food poisoning can be confirmed by the
isolation of greater than 5 logs of _B. cereus_ organisms per gram from
epidemiologically implicated food. Underreporting of such outbreaks is
likely because illness associated with _B. cereus_ is usually self-limiting
and not severe.

Fried rice is a leading cause of _B. cereus_ emetic-type food poisoning in
the USA. _B. cereus_ is frequently present in uncooked rice, and
heat-resistant spores may survive cooking. If cooked rice is subsequently
held at room temperature, vegetative forms multiply, and heat-stable toxin
is produced that can survive brief heating, such as stir frying. - Mod.LL
