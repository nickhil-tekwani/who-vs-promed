Passengers on the cruise ship "Sea Princess" disembarked on Friday [2
Jun 2006] after their trip was cut short when 200 travellers fell ill
with gastroenteritis. The ship, operated by Princess Cruises, which
is owned by U.S. giant Carnival, docked at its home port of
Southampton, a day earlier than scheduled. Company spokesman Peter
Shanks said most passengers had recovered and only about 8 were still
ill. The ship, on a week-long cruise, missed out a visit to Lisbon to
allow extra time for the vessel to be disinfected.
Shanks told the BBC the illness had not originated on board, but had
been brought from onshore. Passengers have been offered a 30 percent
refund on the cost of the cruise and 150 pounds off any future trip.
Disembarking passengers said they were confined to their cabins in a
bid to stop the spread of the infection, which caused severe vomiting
and diarrhoea. The illness is thought to be the highly contagious
norovirus that affected 600 passengers on board P&O's Aurora liner in
2003. P&O Cruises is the sister line of Princess Cruises.

[This is the 2nd cruise ship to have terminated a cruise early and
docked at a port in the UK in the same week, though the 2 incidents
are unrelated. The first involved the Van Gogh on a cruise to north
Norway that was terminated at Harwich due to an outbreak of viral
gastroenteritis. The 2nd (described above) involved a Mediterranean
cruise ship, the Sea Princess, which returned to the port of
Southampton early, also as a result of an outbreak of viral
gastroenteritis. The viral gastroenteritis in each case was
attributed to an outbreak of norovirus infection, but so far there
has been no formal confirmation in either case. It is likely that the
infection in each ship was introduced by an incoming passenger and
the occurrence of these outbreaks reflects the prevalence of
norovirus infection in the general community rather than lapses in
hygiene aboard these particular ships. - Mod.CP]
