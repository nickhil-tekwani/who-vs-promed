Approximately 30 farmers of the Craig-Chudleigh community on the
Manchester/Trelawny border have lost their entire sweet yam cultivation to
what they have described as a mysterious disease.
The disease withers the plant leaves and stunts the growth of the tuber,
wiping out production, and the farmers, who are not familiar with the
disease, have blamed it on recent hurricanes.
"Over 10 acres of sweet yam are dead out in this area," lamented a yam
farmer. "We don't know what caused the disease, but we believe it was the
hurricanes. The RADA [Rural Agricultural Development Authority] people came
here and promised to come back, but [they didn't even give us a] little
fertiliser," he continued.
However, the Manchester RADA parish manager, Stanley Dodd, said, "This is
no mystery disease; it is long-standing and the Bodles Research Station is
aware of it." Mr. Dodd said the disease is called Anthracnose, a fungus
which thrives in damp conditions and affects sweet yams and other plants.
The RADA manager explained that if the tuber is developed before the crop
is infected, it could be saved, but pointed out that if the condition
occurs in the early stages of growth, the crop would be lost, as leaves
play a vital role in the plant's life.

[This is an example of a severe outbreak in a staple food crop of a disease
favored by climate -- in this case higher-than-usual rain in the rainy
season. Yam anthracnose is present in all yam-growing regions of the world
and is caused by the fungus _Glomerella cingulata_, also known as
_Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_. It is a limiting factor for yam
(_Dioscorea alata_) production worldwide through its ability to infect
leaves and vines, causing necrosis (death of plant tissue) and dieback of
the entire plant. Infection starts with rapidly expanding brown/black
lesions with yellow edges on leaves and stems. Reduced photosynthesis
leads to under-sized tubers. The fungus causes orange-brown tuber rots
known as 'dead skin'. The rots develop in the flesh of the tuber just under
the corky layer or skin. Small blisters appear on the surface of the yam
and the skin is easily removed from the layer beneath. Later, deeper rots
develop, and eventually all that is left is a wrinkled shell surrounding a
rotting core. In the Caribbean, infected planting material (tubers) is a
major means of disease spread. Tuber-borne inoculum is a primary source of
infection and can be prevented by cleaning the planting material using
micropropagation. Within a crop, the fungal spores are spread by
rain-splash. Chemical control is normally impractical and
expensive. Fungicides can delay the onset of epidemics, but cannot prevent
them developing during the rainy season. Pathogen resistance is known for
one fungicide, benomyl. Resistant varieties have also been found in the
Caribbean, e.g. Kinabayo, Plimbite, Belep, and Oriental, and use of these
along with clean planting materials are the main methods for control.
