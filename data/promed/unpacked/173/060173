Fungal attacks blight hopes of capsicum, tomato growers
-------------------------------------------------------
Tomato and capsicum crops grown in the mid-hills of the state are
increasingly being lost to collar rot and leaf blight diseases; 30 to
40 per cent of the crops are said to have already been destroyed.

"A sudden rise in diurnal temperature owing to a prolonged dry spell
coupled with unusual rains in the mid-hills over the past fortnight
have made the crops vulnerable to attacks of various fungal and
bacterial pathogens," said Dr S K Sharma, Mycology and Plant
Pathology, Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry.

He said tomato crops in Junaji, Shilli, Deothi Patta (Mehlog) have so
far been found infected with the collar rot disease.

Tomato, which is largely credited to have transformed the economy of
the farming community of this hilly state, is grown as a major
off-season cash crop in Solan, Sirmour, Bilaspur, Una, Kangra,
Hamirpur, and Mandi districts over 18 000 hectares [approx. 44 500
acres] of land. Its annual production is around 500 000 metric tonnes.

[2] Common leaf spot, strawberry - Jammu & Kashmir

Disease stalks Jammu's strawberry crop, farmers worried
-------------------------------------------------------
The strawberry crop grown over hundreds of acres in Jammu is
threatened by widespread fungal attacks. In many areas, the plants
have in fact prematurely wilted following a fungal blight attack.
According to cultivators in Bishnah, Samba, and Hiranagar -- major
strawberry producing areas -- many plants have been affected with
_Mycosphaerella_, a plant disease, resulting in wilting of leaves and
stems of the plant.

Jammu and Kashmir produces nearly 100 000 kg [approx. 221 000 lb] of
strawberries annually, which not only cater to the local demand but
are also sent to other states of the country. There are about 14
different varieties of the fruit and in addition of being consumed
fresh, it is also used in dairy products.

A senior scientist at Sher-e-Kashmir Agriculture University, Dr J P
Sharma, said, "We have received reports about a fungal blight attack
on stems and leaves of the strawberry crop," adding that though it is
for the horticulture department to take measures, the [university is]
also ready to cooperate.

[The fungus _Alternaria solani_ causes leaf blight and fruit rot on
tomato (early blight), as well as collar rot on tomato seedlings, and
can also affect capsicum. This may be one of the pathogens referred
to in item 1. However, leaf blights on these hosts can also be caused
by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_ (late blight)
and the bacterium _Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (bacterial leaf spot),
and both fungal and bacterial pathogens are reported to be active.
From the information provided, it cannot be excluded that these
pathogens may be involved. For more information on these diseases
please see links below.

Common leaf spot caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fragariae_ is
one of the most widespread diseases of strawberry crops. Symptoms
include leaf and stem lesions and infection may also result in black
spots or seed discolouration ("black seed") on fruit. Only young leaf
tissue is susceptible, and only after a minimum of 12 hours of leaf
wetness. High rainfall and warm temperatures favour disease
development and can lead to epidemics. The fungus can be spread with
infected plant material, by wind, water, and mechanical means.
Disease management includes cultural methods, fungicides, and use of
clean planting material. Some resistant cultivars are available.
