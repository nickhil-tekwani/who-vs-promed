[There are multiple genotypes of _Giardia_ spp., which infects
humans, domestic animals and wildlife worldwide, and _Giardia_ spp.
is endemic in fresh water in the United States. New molecular typing
has made it possible to start mapping infection within and between
species [see for instance: Caccio et al. Trends Parasitol.
2005;21:430-7]. Drinking water is an important route of transmission,
but other routes such as contaminated food play a role in some of the
outbreaks. - Mod.EP]
