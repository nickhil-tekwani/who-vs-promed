From: David W Smith <dwsmith@onaustralia.com.au>

The cases described by Drs Bowen and Beaman do demonstrate that there is an
ongoing problem of undiagnosed encephalitis of apparent infectious
aetiology. However that is not unique to Western Australia and is a
worldwide experience. There is nothing to suggest that all these cases were
the result of a single infectious agent. The cases were extensively
investigated, including flavivirus serology, and some were tested for bat
lyssavirus and equine morbillivirus. While it is quite possible that
unexplained cases like these are due to known agents that we fail to
detect, it is important that we continue to document and investigate them.
They continue to occur sporadically and hopefully our diagnostic success
will improve as we expand the range of tests we use.
