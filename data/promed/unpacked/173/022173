A deadly tapeworm thought to be found in Japan only on its northernmost
island of Hokkaido has turned up in pigs on the main island of Honshu,
researchers said Tuesday.
They detected the _Echinococcus_ parasite in the livers of 3 pigs
slaughtered at a plant in Aomori Prefecture (state) in northern Honshu,
said Hirosaki University professor Takashi Inaba.
"The problem is we don't know how the pigs became infected. We have to
investigate further," said Inaba, a member of a special research group set
up by the government to look for new outbreaks.
_Echinococcus_, which can kill humans who unwittingly ingest its eggs, has
been blamed for an estimated 30 deaths since 1937 on Hokkaido. The
parasite, can remain dormant and undetected for years before causing liver
failure, has infected 383 people there. [Over what period of time?]
A Health and Welfare Ministry official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the government is monitoring the parasite to make sure it
does not spread.
The ministry official said some of the pigs slaughtered at the Aomori plant
come from Hokkaido, so the animals may have been infected there. The origin
of the 3 infected pigs was unclear.
Infected pigs do not pass the parasite on, and their meat is harmless if
eaten. But dogs and foxes carry the parasite's eggs in their digestive
tracts and can pass them on to humans through water or vegetables grown in
contaminated soil, Inaba said. In humans, the parasite usually lodges in
the liver.
The parasite is commonly found in Hokkaido, which has a large fox
population. It has never been discovered in Honshu foxes, but this latest
finding may mean the parasite is moving south.

[Most likely this is in reference to _Echinococcus granulosus_. This is a
tapeworm found in the small intestine of the definitive hosts, canines and
several other wild carnivores. Its eggs are ingested by the intermediate
hosts, wild and domestic herbivores, e.g., sheep cattle, and moose and some
omnivores, e.g., pigs and man. (However, man may be both a definitive and
an intermediate host.)
After hatching in the intestine of the intermediate host, the oncospheres
(that version of the tape worm) invade the circulatory system and lodge in
various organs, usually the liver and lungs, where they develop into large,
thick-walled, hydatid cysts that bud endogenously.
Hydatids have ben rarely reported in the Central Nervous System of domestic
animals and are rare in man, in which they produce symptoms similar to
those of a brain tumor. In some cases, surgical intervention to remove the
cysts, from brain, or lungs especially, can be successful. The eggs may be
acquired from eating inadequately cooked meat that contains the cysts. -
