[1] Airborne pollen and SARS-CoV-2 spread

Two physicists have claimed that physical distancing rules designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 may be inadequate for people standing outdoors near major pollen sources such as trees and grass. The researchers at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus modeled the spread of pollen from a willow tree through a nearby crowd of people, each standing at least 2 meters apart, at a wind speed of 4 kilometers per hour. The model simulated the movement of 10 000 individual grains of pollen through groups of either 11 or 97 people around 20 meters from the tree.

The scientists found that the larger crowd of people temporarily trapped the airflow and the pollen it carried. This would have the effect of increasing potential contacts between pollen grains and the tiny droplets of saliva generated when people talk, cough, and so on. Assuming that the virus can hitch a ride on pollen grains, the results suggest that the pollen could carry the virus from one person to others in the crowd.

Talib Dbouk, PhD, and Dimitris Drikakis, PhD, from the university's Defence and Security Research Institute conducted the study, which has been published in the journal Physics of Fluids [Dbouk T, Drikakis D. On pollen and airborne virus transmission. Physics Fluids. 2021; 33: 063313. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0055845].

The researchers point out that droplets of saliva are relatively heavy and evaporate rapidly, whereas pollen grains contain little water, are lighter, and can travel tens of kilometers. "People should avoid crowd gatherings close to some types of plants or trees known to be very active in pollen grains release during a pollination season," Prof. Drikakis told Medical News Today (MNT).

"The public should be aware of the airborne transmission risks from both indoor and outdoor saliva droplets and the hazards arising from airborne pollen grains outdoors," he added. He said the safe physical distance to minimize transmission by pollen would vary according to environmental conditions.

The scientists were inspired to conduct their study after noticing correlations between high airborne concentrations of willow oak and white willow pollen in the United States in March-May 2020 and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

Other research has linked pollen levels to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A study published in March 2021 found that airborne pollen concentrations in 31 countries around the world accounted for 44% of the variability in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates [Damialis A, Gilles S, Sofiev M, et al. Higher airborne pollen concentrations correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, as evidenced from 31 countries across the globe. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2021; 118: e2019034118. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019034118].

However, when scientists in Leipzig, Germany, analyzed pollen from local air samples and conducted lab tests on purified pollen, they found no evidence that the pollen could carry or transmit SARS-CoV-2. Susanne Dunker, PhD, of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said they were unable to completely rule out the possibility that pollen can transmit SARS-CoV-2.

She told MNT that for practical and safety reasons, they incubated pollen and the virus in a fluid rather than air. "In reality, a binding would happen in the air and probably not in a fluidic system. We could only show that both do not form a "stable connection" when co-incubated in a suspension," she said.

Their paper notes that electrostatic effects in the air could affect binding between the virus and pollen grains. "Such effects might be of interest in future studies," they write.

In their article, Dr. Dbouk and Prof. Drikakis cite a study that found pollen can carry RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.

However, this study analyzed the pollen collected from flowers by bees and stored in their hives, rather than wind-dispersed tree or grass pollen. There may be an alternative explanation for the observed correlation between airborne pollen concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

Research suggests that pollen can reduce the production of antiviral molecules in a person's respiratory tract, which in turn increases their susceptibility to viral infections. More research is necessary to disentangle the relationship between pollen and SARS-CoV-2.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-killed-26-indonesian-doctors-in-juneat-least-10-had-taken-chinas-sinovac-vaccine-11624769885


At least 10 of the 26 doctors in Indonesia who died from COVID-19 this month [June 2021] had received both doses of the vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd., a medical association said, raising questions about the Chinese-made shot that is being used in many parts of the developing world.

The Indonesian Medical Association's COVID-19 mitigation group is still working to verify the vaccination status of the 16 others, said Dr. Adib Khumaidi, who leads the group. According to the group's latest figures, over a 5-month period, at least 20 doctors who were fully inoculated with Sinovac's vaccine died from COVID-19, accounting for more than one-fifth of total fatalities among doctors during that time span.

The toll could rise further in the coming weeks as the country battles a surge in infections and hospitals across the archipelago fill up.

Epidemiologists say the deaths need to be properly investigated to determine whether factors such as poor hospital care or chronic underlying illnesses played a major role. They also say more data [are] needed, including on how many vaccinated doctors overall were infected with COVID-19, which Indonesia's health ministry says it isn't tracking.

Around 90% of Indonesian doctors -- roughly 160 000 in all -- have been vaccinated with Sinovac's shot, according to the medical association, so the vaccinated doctors who died are only a tiny percentage of the total.

[B] Emerging crisis

The Indonesian Red Cross warned today [29 Jun 2021] that the country is on the edge of a COVID-19 catastrophe, with a surge of Delta variant-fueled infections overwhelming hospitals in Jakarta and other parts of the country.

In a statement today [29 Jun 2021], the Indonesian Red Cross said less than 5% of the country's adult population is vaccinated, and it needs 360 million doses to immunize at least 70% of the population. Meanwhile, the test positivity rate exceeds 20%, suggesting that the number of illnesses is likely to be widespread.

Sudirman Said, the group's secretary general, said the Red Cross hospital in Bogor, West Java, is overflowing, with emergency tents set up to take in more patients.

Jan Gelfand, who heads the Indonesian delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is pushing Indonesia closer to the edge of a COVID-19 catastrophe and fast action is needed to speed life-saving vaccine to countries like Indonesia.

Since the start of the pandemic, health officials have feared a large outbreak in the world's 4th most populous country. Over the past week, Indonesia has reported daily record highs for new cases, with 20 467 more reported today [29 Jun 2021], along with 463 more deaths, according to Reuters. Oxygen supplies are getting slim, and prices in Jakarta -- where hospitals are near capacity -- have more than doubled [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesias-covid-19-situation-nears-catastrophe-red-cross-2021-06-29/].

In Africa, currently experiencing its 3rd surge, COVID-19 cases rose for the 7th week in a row and are now near the peak of the 2nd wave, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [29 Jun 2021] in its weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report. Compared to the week before, cases were up 20% and deaths rose by nearly 17%.

South Africa is the main hot spot, reporting about 62% of last week's new cases. Others reporting high infection numbers include Zambia, Namibia, Rwanda, and Uganda. Health officials again reported high numbers of healthcare worker infections, with 541 new ones reported -- nearly all from Namibia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Several countries have reported the Delta variant, and the Alpha (B117) and Beta (B1351) have been reported in 25 African nations.

If cases continue along the current trend, cases will pass the peak of the 2nd wave in early July [2021]. The WHO notes that only 1% of Africans have fully been vaccinated, compared to 46% in the United Kingdom, 45% in the United States, 29% in the European Union, and 15% in China.

With Brazil's death toll from COVID-19 topping 500 000 this week, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said today [29 Jun 2021] that it is boosting its response in the country to prepare for a 3rd wave of infections. In a statement, it said that the country faces another devastating wave with the onset of winter and the health system challenged by the burden of other seasonal diseases.

MSF also said Brazil's COVID response remains fragmented and decentralized. Officials from MSF said it's difficult to tell if a 3rd surge has started because cases have never substantially dropped. Daily deaths have risen above 2000 for the 1st time since May [2021], and daily cases are above 70 000 again. The group said it is already working in Para, Ceara, and Bahia states and is preparing a response in Paraiba state.

More global headlines:
- In Australia, officials ordered a circuit-breaker lockdown for Brisbane in Queensland state, plus the areas around it, lifting the number of state capitals in lockdown to 4. The country is battling clusters of cases tied to the Delta variant.

- The Philippines has extended its COVID measures until the middle of July [2021], according to Reuters. Infection numbers have dropped in the Manila area, but cases are rising in some provinces [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-philippines/philippines-extends-coronavirus-curbs-until-mid-july-idUSKCN2E50CB].

-The global total climbed to 181 410 735 cases, along with at least 3 929 409 deaths, according to The New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html].

A new meta-analysis of 10 studies shows ivermectin (IVM), an anti-parasite drug, is not an effective treatment for COVID-19 and is not a viable treatment option for patients. The study was published yesterday [28 Jun 2021] in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The authors analyzed results from 10 randomized control trials (RCTs) that included 1173 patients total, and looked for IVM's effect on all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, adverse events, and viral clearance compared to standard of care. COVID-19 patients had mild disease in 8 of the trials, moderate in one [trial], and mild to moderate in one trial.

IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality when compared to controls (relative risk, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 1.13) or length of stay versus controls (0.72 days, 95% CI, -0.86 to 2.29). Adverse events, severe adverse events, and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls, the authors found.

"The quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19 disease or risk of bias were mostly consistent with main analyses, except a significant effect on all-cause mortality in 3 RCTs at high risk of bias," the authors wrote.

IVM gained interest as a COVID-19 treatment after Australian researchers showed IVM to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures by drastically reducing viral RNA at 48 hours. This led to the use of IVM as a COVID-19 treatment in some low- and middle-income countries throughout 2020 [Roman YM, Burela PA, Pasupuleti V, et al. Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Clin Infect Dis. 2021: ciab591. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab591].

China-based Sinovac's CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe and produces a good immune responses in Chinese children as young as 3, according to phase 1 and 2 results published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases yesterday [28 Jun 2021].

The researchers gave 2 low (1.5 mcg), 2 high (3.0 mcg), or 2 placebo doses to 72 children in phase 1 and 480 children in phase 2. All were from Hebei Province, ranged in age from 3 to 17 years, were healthy, and had no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean ages were 8.3 years and 9.2 years for phase 1 and phase 2, respectively, and participants were enrolled from 31 Oct to 30 Dec 2020.

More than 93% who received 2 doses of the vaccine developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 28 days after the 2nd dose, and the authors recommend two 3.0-mcg doses for all children and adolescents.

In phase 1, 100% of all vaccine recipients made antibodies regardless of dosage, although more neutralizing antibodies were detected among those who received 3 mcg (117.4 vs 55.0 geometric mean titers). In phase 2, 97% of those in the low-dose group and 100% of those in the high-dose group produced detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

No serious adverse reactions occurred except for one case of unrelated pneumonia in a placebo recipient. Adverse reactions occurred across both studies in 26% of low-dose participants, 29% of high-dose recipients, and 24% receiving placebos. Injection-site pain was the most common symptom, with 16% in the low-dose group, 16% in the high-dose group, and 2% in the placebo group.

"Given the distinct immunogenicity profile and development stage of children, post-marketing surveillance of the vaccine safety should be done and maintained for a longer period than that in adults," write Xiaohui Zou and Bin Cao, of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, in a commentary. Still, they conclude, "This promising result should inspire the ongoing trial of other COVID-19 vaccines in children younger than 12 years" [Han B, Song Y, Song Y, et al. Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in healthy children and adolescents: a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial. Lancet Infect Dis. Epub 28 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00319-4; Zou X, Cao B. COVID-19 vaccines for children younger than 12 years: are we ready? Lancet Infect Dis. Epub 28 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00384-4].

Tiny, disposable sensors to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection can be fitted into face masks and integrated into clothing like lab coats, according to a study yesterday [28 Jun 2021] in Nature Biotechnology. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University built off previous research that created paper-based diagnostics for viruses like Ebola and Zika based on freeze-dried cellular machinery.

Upon activation with water, the 1st freeze-dried biological reaction cuts open the virus membrane to expose RNA, the 2nd amplifies the spike-coding gene, and the 3rd detects, cuts, and reports any spike gene fragments via technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), according to a Harvard news release.

The study goes through different test iterations, some using color changes to the visible eye as diagnostic results and others using fluorescence that can be picked up by a spectrometer as well as different settings, such as a face mask or a jacket. For the face mask, the researchers note that the sensor has 4 modular components: a hydration reservoir that would be broken for one-time use diagnostics, a large pad for sample collection, a wax-patterned microfluidic paper-based analytical device, and a lateral flow assay strip.

The researchers say that the detection limit meets the same standard as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay tests, all within 90 minutes and at room temperature, and that the test does not cross-react with RNA from other common coronavirus strains.

"We've demonstrated that we can freeze-dry a broad range of synthetic biology sensors to detect viral or bacterial nucleic acids, as well as toxic chemicals, including nerve toxins," said senior author James Collins, PhD, original developer of the sensor technology, in an MIT press release. "We envision that this platform could enable next-generation wearable biosensors for first responders, healthcare personnel, and military personnel" [Nguyen PQ, Soenksen LR, Donghia NM, et al. Wearable materials with embedded synthetic biology sensors for biomolecule detection. Nat Biotechnol. Epub 28 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00950-3. Also see 28 Jun 2021 Harvard and MIT press releases, respectively: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/wifb-fmt062221.php and https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/miot-nfm062421.php. - Mod.LK].

A combination of metabolic activators (CMAs) reduced COVID-19 recovery time in mild to moderate cases, according to phase 2/3 results published in Advanced Science yesterday [28 Jun 2021].

Both study phases involved randomized treatment and placebo groups in a 3:1 ratio, with the treatment group receiving a combination of nicotinamide riboside, L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and L-carnitine tartrate, which are all involved with mitochondrial function. All participants were outpatients, receiving treatment or placebo daily for 14 days, starting on the day of diagnosis.

Phase 2 data were similar to phase 3 results, which found that COVID-19 recovery time among 304 Turkish patients was 5.7 days in the treatment group and 9.2 days in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.77; 95% confidence interval, 4.17 to 7.96). Overall, phase 3 patients were young (mean, 36.3 years), male (57.6%), and healthy (mean body mass index, 26.7; 9.2% with high blood pressure; 6.2% with type 2 diabetes).

By day 14, serum alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels were also significantly improved in the CMA group compared with the placebo group. (In both groups, aspartate aminotransferase and C-reactive protein were lower and platelets, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, cholesterol, and triglyceride were higher, which the researchers attribute to patient recovery.) Two of the 229 patients in the intervention group (0.6%) had rashes and skin redness, but no serious adverse events occurred.

"Dysfunctional mitochondria have been implicated in worsened progression for COVID-19, and we are pleased to find that the combination of these metabolic activators helps to remedy the stress put on the body of an infected patient," said lead author, Adil Mardinoglu, PhD, in a KTH, Royal Institute of Technology press release.

"In conclusion," the researchers write, "we evaluated the efficacy and safety of CMA in combination with HQ [hydroxychloroquine] or FP [favipiravir] therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and observed that combination therapy is safe and beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19" [Altay O, Arif M, Li X. Combined metabolic activators accelerates recovery in mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Adv Sci. 2021: 2101222. https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202101222].

Health authorities in Finland say about 300 people tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from Russia, where they watched matches of the UEFA European Football Championship. Finland played 2 group-stage matches in Saint Petersburg this month [June 2021].

Media reports say about 3000 Finnish supporters returned by bus after the 2nd match on 21 Jun 2021. About 800 of them reportedly did not go through virus testing, nor were asked to quarantine. The Finnish authorities are calling for all supporters returning from Saint Petersburg to take virus tests and isolate themselves until they test negative.

The Russian city is experiencing a rise in cases of the highly contagious Delta variant, first detected in India.

Soccer players and staff members are also found to have been infected with the virus at the South American football championship, known as Copa America, which is taking place in Brazil.

https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/19478-over-200-infections-linked-to-euro-2020-detected-in-finland.html


More than 200 in Finland have tested positive for the new coronavirus after attending UEFA Euro 2020 in St. Petersburg, Russia, reveals Mika Salminen, the head of health security at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

Salminen told YLE [Finland's national public-broadcasting company] on Sunday [27 Jun 2021] that the number of cases has doubled in the past couple of days, with people returning from the sporting event accounting for over half of the daily totals. Most of the cases have been detected in the capital region.

"The infections are found across Finland, but about 80-90% of them are here in the capital region, and most of them are here in Helsinki," he outlined to the public broadcasting company. Officials in Helsinki on Sunday [27 Jun 2021] had detected 167 infections linked to UEFA Euro 2020, according to Sanna Isosomppi, the chief physician of epidemiological operations at the City of Helsinki.

Finnish hospital districts reported a total of 95 new infections on Sunday, 125 new infections on Saturday [26 Jun 2021], 145 new infections on Friday [25 Jun 2021] and 123 new infections on Thursday [24 Jun 2021]. Over 3 million people have received at least the 1st injection of a coronavirus vaccine.

Salminen on Sunday [27 Jun 2021] viewed that although the variant behind the infections has yet been ascertained, it is likely that the infections were caused by the delta variant of the coronavirus, formerly known as the Indian variant. "[The variant] is clearly on the rise in Russia, so the probability is pretty high," he said. The confirmation should be received in a week or 2, wrote YLE.

Salminen added that the possibility of decision-makers imposing another lockdown in response to the development cannot be rule out. "It'll depend on how these infections can be stopped to make sure there are no further infections. This will depend a lot on people themselves. Every case presents the risk of further infections and, as a result, the epidemic accelerating."

He added that he would personally consider everyone who were in a coach with a person carrying the virus exposed to the virus. "Now it's really important that people who visited St. Petersburg don't go to work tomorrow but instead go to get a coronavirus test and wait to see what the results are," he stated, reiterating that this goes especially for those who returned by coach.

Congestions at the Vaalimaa border-crossing point prompted local healthcare authorities to forgo coronavirus testing for about 800 people returning from Russia to Finland. Salminen said it is critical that everyone who returned without getting tested do so without delay but appeased concerns that the situation could escalate into a crisis.

"Let's not start painting devils on the walls. What's critical now is what people do in the coming days."

https://www.euronews.com/2021/06/29/euro-2020-germany-calls-on-uk-and-uefa-to-reduce-crowds-over-delta-variant


A senior German government minister has called on the British government and UEFA to cut the number of supporters allowed into Wembley for the remaining matches Euro 2020 is due to host at the stadium, due to the increasing spread of the Delta coronavirus variant.

"I find it irresponsible that tens of thousands of people gather in confined spaces in countries classed at risk because of the highly contagious Delta variant" as is the case in Britain, Germany's interior and sports minister Horst Seehofer told Tuesday's [29 Jun 2021] edition of the regional paper Augsburger Allgemeine. His intervention comes several hours before the England-Germany clash in the last 16 of the tournament, due to be played before some 45 000 spectators, around 50% of the stadium's capacity.

This number is scheduled to rise to 75% capacity for the semi-finals and final, some 60 000 fans. In Germany, where Munich's Allianz Arena has also hosted Euro 2020 matches, the capacity has been limited to 20%, or around 14 000 supporters. Seehofer says the 20% rule should act as a benchmark for all other matches.

The UK is experiencing a resurgence in coronavirus infections due to the Delta variant, detected for the first time in India.

Germany has classed Britain as a risk zone affected by variants, reducing to a minimum the possibility for travel between the 2 countries. German citizens or residents in the country returning from Britain must observe a 14-day quarantine, including fully vaccinated people.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has again expressed her concern over the danger the Euro tournament poses in terms of spreading the Delta variant, deploring the lack of coordination at European level on restrictions to be imposed on travellers coming from at-risk countries.

In Germany, the Delta variant is responsible for around half of all new COVID-19 infections, according to reports quoting Lothar Wieler, President of the federal health agency the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).

The number of new infections has, however, sharply diminished in recent weeks. On Tuesday [29 Jun 2021], the institute announced 404 cases in 24 hours, while 54% of adults in Germany have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the country, and 36% are fully inoculated.

The surge in coronavirus cases is partly linked to football fans watching the Euro 2020 tournament indoors, Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has said. A number of cases have also been linked to coaches transporting fans to London to watch Scotland play, Mr Yousaf added.

On Monday [28 Jun 2021], the daily coronavirus figures showed 3285 people had reported positive COVID-19 tests overnight, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. However, vaccination has weakened the link between cases and being taken to hospital.

Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Yousaf said the Government was being cautious, but ministers are not looking at introducing further restrictions in the worst-affected areas. He said: "If we look at the data that's presented, it's very clear that it's skewed disproportionately towards young males, those under 40.

"A number of people, public health experts and others, have commented that that association is probably as a result of greater indoor gathering which could be an effect relating to watching the Euros and football."

Some of those fans would have travelled to London in coaches, he said, where there was little social distancing. In one coach, 20 positive cases had been identified, he said.

Mr Yousaf added: "I think some of the positive cases are linked to watching football indoors."

Asked if the Government should have done more to prevent fans travelling, he said: "We seem to get criticised regularly for putting in place travel restrictions. So I think one way or the other we would have been criticised for either doing too much or not doing enough."

He said the Government had always urged people to exercise caution and arrangements were always under review. Mr Yousaf was also asked about a report in The Herald newspaper which said worst-case scenario modelling for the Scottish Government predicted 100 000 cases per week by mid-July [2021].

The Health Secretary said: "We wouldn't expect to see those numbers and certainly we wouldn't allow such a situation to arise." Vaccination is "our route out of this virus", he said, and around 50% of 18- to 29-year-olds have currently received their 1st dose.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned of easing coronavirus restrictions as many Euro 2020 host countries are allowing large crowds of spectators to gather in stadiums and watch matches. Not mentioning specific countries or cities where pandemic guidelines were flouted, WHO regretted "that some stadiums hosting the tournament are currently raising the number of spectators allowed to see a match."

"In some of the host cities, COVID-19 cases are already on the rise in areas where matches are played," said Robb Butler, executive director of WHO Europe, in a written statement.

The concerns came after the British government announcement on Tuesday [22 Jun 2021], saying that more than 60 000 fans will be allowed to attend the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 at Wembley, which will be played between 6-11 Jul 2021.

The matches will see the largest crowds assembled at a sporting event in Britain for more than 15 months, with numbers previously strictly limited due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision for opening stadium's doors to fans has been raising fears over spreading the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which caused a catastrophe in India by killing thousands of people every day in the last 2 months.

Britain recorded 11 625 COVID-19-positive cases on Tuesday [22 Jun 2021], marking the highest daily number since mid-February [2021], amid the fear of spreading the Delta variant. The Delta is considered as "the fastest and fittest coronavirus variant" which picks off the most vulnerable people especially in places with low inoculation, according to WHO.

However, the number of cases has been rising in the UK despite vaccinating nearly 80% of its adult population. The further variant, "Delta Plus", has been seen in the UK which increased concerns over the Euro 2020 decision.

Paradoxically, the UK announced the opening Euro 2020 semi-finals and final to spectators days after PM Boris Johnson delayed easing COVID-19 restrictions plan for 4 weeks.

On the other hand, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Monday [21 Jun 2021] the Euro 2020 final should be moved out of London because of the spread of the Delta variant. "I advocate that the final should not take place in a country in which the risk of infection is very big," Draghi told reporters.

All ticket holders at Wembley will need to follow a number of strict entry requirements, including having a negative COVID-19 test or proof of full vaccination.

"We have worked extremely closely with UEFA and the FA to ensure rigorous and tight public health measures are in place whilst allowing more fans to see the action live," said UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden.

UEFA had stressed there were no plans to take the semi-finals or final away from Wembley, despite the stumbling block of quarantine-free travel, and president Aleksander Ceferin welcomed the announcement of the increased capacity.

Some of the biggest events in Britain's summer sporting calendar, including Wimbledon and international cricket matches, will also go ahead with greater capacities as part of the latest phase of the government's pilot programme to test the return of large crowds.

[The pandemic is far from over and superspreader events have the potential to facilitate rapid spread of new and emerging SARS-CoV 2 variants between countries. Masking, social distancing, hand hygiene and cough etiquette, as well as vaccination, are the key preventive and protective actions irrespective of new variants, and their implementation is increasingly a challenge. - Mod.UBA]
