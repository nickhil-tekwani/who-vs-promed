A new type of rabies virus has been discovered in Tanzania by scientists from the University of Glasgow and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA).

The virus was identified as part of a rabies surveillance research project funded by the Wellcome Trust and was investigated following an unusual incident when a child was attacked by a civet [_Civettictis civetta_, Carnivora: Viverridae] -- a cat-like nocturnal mammal -- in a part of the Serengeti which was thought to be rabies-free.

The samples that were collected tested positive for rabies at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Dar es Salaam. Subsequent genetic tests showed that the virus was a new type of rabies virus that had not been previously described, but was similar to a bat rabies virus isolated in the Caucasian region of Eastern Europe.

Scientists believe the new virus is likely to originate in bats and that cross-over infection to civets and other mammalian species is likely to be relatively rare. However further

[Rabies is the best-studied infection associated with the Chiroptera. Bats are the principal reservoirs for most recognized lyssavirus species. Spillovers from bats to other mammals are rare, and thus novel viruses with bat origin are unlikely to become an emerging infectious disease posing a major public health concern. However, it is important to consider that exposure to wildlife reservoirs of rabies must be minimized.
