38 people have died in a suspected outbreak of the Ebola virus in the
north of Congo-Brazzaville, near the border with Gabon
----------------------------------------------
The Congolese Ministry of Health says the people died in the villages
of Kelle and Mbou, about 800 kilometres north of Brazzaville, in the
Region known as Cuvette West.
The authorities were first alerted to a possible outbreak of Ebola
when a clan of gorillas in the region began to die in December
[2002]. Tests carried out on the bodies confirmed that the gorillas
had died from the Ebola virus, which has now claimed more than 80
percent of that gorilla clan.
The Ministry of Health suspects that the current outbreak was caused
by villagers eating primates that were already infected with Ebola.
But confirmation that the virus is responsible for the recent human
deaths has not yet been possible because local inhabitants are
refusing to cooperate with teams of Ministry of Health workers and
World Health Organisation specialists who have gone to the region to
study and contain the outbreak.
The villagers of Kelle and Mbou have so far refused to give blood
samples needed to test for the virus, and have become hostile towards
the visiting medical teams. They claim it is the medical workers who
bring the virus to the region.
The local inhabitants, who are mostly Pygmies, were badly mistreated
by Gabonese troops who came to the area to contain an Ebola outbreak
in 1996 and 1997, and this may be the reason why the local population
is fearful.
Since an outbreak in the same area in June last year [2002], the
Congolese ministries of Forestry and the Environment have had teams
of workers in the region trying to raise the awareness of the local
population to the dangers of eating gorillas and chimps, particularly
those which they find already ill or dead. But they admit it is an
uphill struggle in a region where bush meat has been a staple of the
local diet for centuries.
