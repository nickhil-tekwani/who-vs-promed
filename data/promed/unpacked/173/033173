On Tuesday [5 Jul 2011], the Regional Health Agency (ARS) took
precautionary measures in the lakes of the Rhone-Alpes region because
of the presence of bacteria [_Leptospira_ spp.] transmitted by
animals, mainly rodents. On Fri 1 Jul 2011, the agency was informed of
a confirmed case and 2 probable cases of leptospirosis in people who
swam in the Lake St-Jean-de-la-Porte (Savoie), where swimming has now
been banned by municipal order.

"These people were taken to the hospital in Chambery. 2 of them went
home on antibiotic treatment. The 3rd person is still in the hospital,
but her condition is no longer worrisome," according to the ARS.

However, the Rhone-Alpes ARS advises people who swam in the lake to
"consult their doctor if they have a high fever or flu-like symptoms."
The ARS specifies that because fish do not carry the disease, there is
no risk of transmission of leptospirosis through consumption of fish.

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of France can be seen at
http://healthmap.org/r/111w. Rhone-Alpes is one of the 27 regions of
France, located on the south eastern border of the country
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh√¥ne-Alpes). The eastern portion of
the region contains the westernmost part of the Alps and borders
Switzerland and Italy. Its capital, Lyon, is the 2nd largest
metropolitan area in France after Paris. Saint-Jean-de-la-Porte is a
commune in the Savoie department in a part of the Rhone-Alpes region
that borders Italy and Chambery is Savoie's capital. For a map of the

Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution. The following on
leptospirosis has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in
ProMED-mail Leptospirosis - Australia: (QL) alert 20110121.0246:

"Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria, in
fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been
contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the
several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.
Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this
organism. ...

"Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors
or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings
(such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers,
trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers,
dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk
during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming,
canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve
exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine
from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household
exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

"Most patients with leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like
illness. Some patients develop severe disease with myocardial,
pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement. Multi-organ failure,
thrombocytopenia, and bleeding may develop. Severe infection may be
fatal in 5-40 per cent of cases."

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, the diagnosis of leptospirosis cannot
be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. Leptospirosis is
usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone intravenously for
severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for milder disease.
Efficacy of antibiotic therapy when used late in the course of the
disease may be limited by the immunologic causation of the 2nd phase
of this illness. For a review of leptospirosis, see: Levett PN.
Leptospirosis. Clin Microbiol Rev 2001; 14: 296-326, available at
http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/14/2/296.

A Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking
doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials,
which "targeted different kinds of people -- travellers and people who
live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students",
"did not support the practice in all cases, though short term
travellers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped."
