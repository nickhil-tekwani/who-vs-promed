Summary
-------
The Cape Saint Paul Wilt Disease (CSPWD), a lethal-yellowing type
disease of coconut has been in Ghana since 1932. Aerial and/or ground
surveys were undertaken to assess the current status of the disease
spread. The survey showed that the spread of the disease for the past
5 years has mainly been the expansion of existing foci. However, new
outbreaks were identified at Glidzi in the Volta, Bawjiase and Efutu
Breman in Central regions. After the resurgence in the Volta region in
1995, the Woe-Tegbi-Dzelukope corridor has remained endemic, but less
aggressive. Pockets of healthy groves remain along all the coastline
and inland of known disease zones. Eradication of diseased palms at
Ampain focus lying just about 60 km [37 mi] to the Ivorian border, and
disease situations on new replanting with MYD x VTT hybrid are
discussed.

[Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease is caused by a phytoplasma
tentatively assigned to the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV)
group. The disease was thought to be a localised problem in Ghana, but
since 1985 new disease foci have developed at an alarming rate in the
major coconut-producing areas of the Western and Central regions. CSPW
is now perceived as a major threat to coconut plantings also in
neighbouring Ivory Coast.

A number of LY group strains have been described from the Caribbean,
southern and central America, East and West Africa, and a number of
locations in southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut
industries in affected areas and can infect a large number of palm
species, killing trees usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper
species _Myndus crudus_ is thought to spread LY in Florida, but the
vectors for CSPW and some other LY phytoplasmas are not known yet.
Some evidence for seed-transmission has been reported for LY
phytoplasmas, including the CSPW pathogen. Weed reservoirs are also
thought to be involved in LY epidemiology

Worldwide, very few coconut varieties have shown real tolerance to LY
diseases, and the level of susceptibility varies depending on disease
pressure and locality. Recent observations of resistance breakdown of
resistance in some widely used hybrids are causing great concern for
coconut replanting programmes worldwide. Reasons for the breakdown are
still uncertain and may include genetic variation of either the host,
the pathogen, or the vector.

In Ghana, despite major efforts only one fifth of the coconut
plantings devastated by CSPW could be restored so far and it remains
to be seen if the replanted palms will again succumb to CSPW. A
research programme on the epidemiology of CSPW was launched in 2007 to
provide information for the development of management strategies (see
link below for recent reports). No insect vector could be identified
with certainty so far, but preliminary evidence suggests that species
of _Derbidae_ may be involved in the spread of LY in Tanzania and
possibly also in CSPW spread in Ghana.
