Hepatitis C
-----------
Viral hepatitis is a major global public health problem. The discovery
of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989 ended a period of intensive
international research efforts aimed at the elusive "non-A, non-B"
virus, which was well known as a cause of post-transfusion hepatitis.
Although HCV is not as infectious as hepatitis B or HIV, as many as 80%
of affected people can become chronically infected and risk serious
long-term clinical sequelae, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma. This places HCV among pathogens of primary concern to human
health and among the known infectious causes of cancer.
As with any newly identified disease, there is considerable uncertainty
within the scientific community regarding prevalence, incidence, natural
course, pathobiological implications, socioeconomic burden and
management of acute and chronic forms. Transmission through transfusions
with unscreened blood, through the use of inadequately or unsterilized
equipment, or through needle-sharing among drug-users, is well
documented. Sexual and perinatal transmission may also occur, although
less frequently, and other modes such as those linked to social,
cultural and behavioural practices using percutaneous procedures (e.g.
ear and body piercing, circumcision, tattooing) may be important.
The incidence of HCV on a global scale is not well known, because acute
infection is asymptomatic in most cases. In areas of high endemicity for
viral hepatitis, acute HCV infection appears to be the cause of a
significant proportion of acute liver disease. Although the
socio-economic impact of chronic hepatitis C has only been partly
studied, the costs are likely to be high, as was found in studies
dealing with chronic hepatitis B. Treatment and (when it becomes
available) immunization should be evaluated for cost-effectiveness.
Treatment with interferon is effective in about 20% of patients. For the
remaining 80%, international research efforts should focus on combined
antiviral therapy. It must, however, be noted that 90% of patients who
are in need of treatment today cannot afford it.
A review of published data was undertaken in order to provide a first
estimate of the global prevalence of hepatitis C, using as a basis the
study which was considered most representative of the general population
in each country......
Conclusion:
Hepatitis C prevalence rates from 0% to 70% have been published.
Although the validity of published data is sometimes doubtful in view of
technical and sampling biases, nevertheless based on the data and expert
epidemiological judgement, WHO estimates today that a proportion in the
order of 3% of the world population has been infected with HCV, and that
there are more than 170 million chronic carriers who are at risk of
developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. In view of the large
population of chronic carriers, more work is needed to evaluate the
public health impact of HCV infection.
Hepatitis C, therefore, is a major global problem. Treatment is costly
and at present not highly effective. A vaccine is not available.
Prevention is therefore paramount. Measures to prevent HCV infections
include:
- Screening of blood and blood products worldwide
- Effective use of universal precautions and barrier techniques
- Destruction of disposable needles and adequate sterilization of
reusable material such as syringes
- Promotion of public education about the risks of using
unsterilized material.
This preliminary review is intended to encourage the collection of more
precise data at the global level in order to ensure a better
understanding of the hepatitis C epidemiology. If you are aware of more
accurate or more recent data dealing with the prevalence of hepatitis C
in the general population, please contact:
