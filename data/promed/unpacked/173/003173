------------------
A preliminary virologic diagnosis of avian influenza in one seagull in the
City of Oulu, Northern Finland, has been made by the Finnish veterinary
authorities. [Confirmation of] avian influenza in birds has earlier been
made in Finland only once in the late 1970s. The tests employed indicate
influenza A infection. The virus preliminarily identified as avian
influenza A is being submitted to an EU reference laboratory.
A slight increase has been observed in the Oulu area in findings of dead
waterfowl in summer 2005 as compared to previous summer seasons. In careful
risk assessment of the epidemiological and virological information
currently available on the incident, the Finnish veterinary authorities
have concluded that the influenza A finding most likely is of a low
pathogenicity type (LPAI).
Although LPAI in waterfowl has been a common occurrence in various parts of
Europe in recent years, pending the final results of the virological tests,
the population in the City of Oulu has been advised against handling dead
or ill waterfowl, and report them to the municipal veterinary service.
Persons who have handled the carcasses of dead waterfowl in recent weeks in
Oulu and fall ill with high fever and respiratory symptoms within 7 days of
this direct exposure are advised to contact health authorities. A hotline
service has been established at the National Public Health Institute for
inquiries by health care personnel and lay persons.
Notification of the incident has been made to the European Commission and
to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC).

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Petri Ruutu for this rapid response to
our request for information.
Extensive systemic virological surveillance in feral birds have been
undertaken since the late 70's, revealing the enormous pools of influenza
viruses now known to be present in the wild bird population, especially in
waterbirds. The majority of the viruses thus isolated were of low
pathogenicity to domestic fowl; in rare occasions, when highly pathogenic
viruses were detected, they were in the vicinity of outbreaks of HPAI in
poultry, or geographically and chronologically close to known outbreaks in
poultry. In this context, the current Finnish observation, which seems to
be indicative (pending final laboratory confirmation) that the isolate is
LPAI, is not unusual. - Mods.AS/MPP]
