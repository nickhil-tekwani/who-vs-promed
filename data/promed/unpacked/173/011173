Kerakarshaka Sangham [union] state president Jacob Pulikkan and
secretary KM Salih said that the coconut farmers in Kerala were
facing serious crisis. The disease caused by pests, lack of water
supply, increasing farming cost, and price decline have caused the
crisis.

The Central Government should declare a package for the protection of
the coconut farmers. A right proclamation convention will be held and
Coconut Development Board chairperson, Mini Mathew, will inaugurate
the convention.

Kerala may lose agri-commodity economy status
--------------------------------------------------
A host of factors like low productivity, ad hoc policies, lack of
investment, diseases, etc, have combined to undermine the leadership
position that the state has in a number of agri-commodities such as
coconuts, pepper, cashew, and others.

Three years ago, Kerala had 44.6 percent share in total production of
coconuts in the country. However, by 2006-07 Kerala's share declined
to 38.2 percent. The area of cultivation declined slightly in Kerala.

[A range of diseases of coconut palms have been reported in India
including a number of fungal rots and wilts, and several of these may
be contributing to the yield decline reported above. In addition, a
phytoplasma disease called 'Kerala wilt' (or root wilt) has been
spreading for many years in parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and it is
likely that this is also affecting the crop in Kerala. For
information on Kerala wilt see ProMED-mail posts no. 20080324.1103
and 20080105.0063 and links below.
