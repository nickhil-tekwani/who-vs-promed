St Helens is one of the worst areas to be affected by the measles outbreak, health chiefs say. There were 35 confirmed cases of the illness in the town last year [2012] compared with none in 2011, according to statistics from the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The surge is believed to be continuing this year [2013], with 2 cases seen already in 2013. However, St Helens isn't the worst affected area of Merseyside. Liverpool saw 313 cases last year and has already reported 11 in 2013.

Liz Gaulton, director of public health and local NHS, said: "In 2012, Merseyside was one of the worst hit areas for measles, and we have already had 2 cases confirmed this year [2013]. Measles is often associated with being a disease of the past. Many people are unaware that it is a dangerous infection that can have serious complications. In severe cases, measles can kill, as it spreads very easily and can affect anyone who is not protected.

Outbreaks elsewhere in the country have put medics on alert for people displaying symptoms of the condition, which in some cases can be fatal. Although often seen as a minor condition, there is no cure for measles once it has been contracted, and hundreds have already been hospitalised elsewhere in the country. It can be vaccinated against by children being up to date with their MMR immunisations, as the HPA says the disease is mainly spreading among unvaccinated schoolchildren.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness, and it can prove deadly. Children, students, and pregnant women are most vulnerable, although it can affect anyone. It is passed from human to human and is usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The early signs include fever, a cough, sore eyes, and a red rash.

http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10283156.Number_of_measles_cases_in_region_continues_to_rise/


The number of confirmed measles cases in the north east increased by 12 in the last week, bringing the total since September [2012] to 134. The latest figures published by the HPA also show that an additional 19 suspected cases were reported last week, bringing the total number of suspected cases since September 2013 up to 147. The majority of cases continue to be reported in Teesside and Darlington. The greatest numbers of confirmed cases have been in Stockton (49), followed by Darlington (28) and Middlesbrough (27).

People aged between 10 and 19 years old continue to be most affected, making up 38 per cent of all cases. Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the HPA in the north east, said: "Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. There is no treatment for measles, but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status, they should check with their GP. If you've missed out on MMR in the past, it's always possible to catch-up, as the vaccine can be given at any age."

To prevent spreading the illness, the HPA is advising people with symptoms of measles to stay away from school, nursery, or work until at least 4 full days after the development of a rash.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said: "The numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease are of serious concern to us. We cannot emphasise enough that measles is an illness that can kill, or leave people with permanent complications including severe brain damage, and the only protection is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. The continuing spread of the disease in the Swansea area means that it is only a matter of time before we have a child whose health is seriously damaged by measles. We are urging parents of unvaccinated children to make immediate arrangements with their GP for their children to receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine."

Dr Roland Salmon, director of PHW's communicable disease surveillance centre, said: "We have pockets in Wales, of which Swansea and the surrounds are one, that don't have a high enough level of MMR vaccine uptake to effectively damp down that spread." He said the vaccination rate for the city was rising again but that there is a "pocket of people" in the area who were not vaccinated as young children.

There have been 252 measles cases in the Swansea and Neath Port Talbot areas since November 2012. In total, 64 secondary and primary schools and nurseries across the area have been affected, and Public Health Wales says the spread is a "serious concern." The majority of the new cases are in the Swansea area, but cases are being reported across south east Wales.

The Kaduna state government said on Thursday [14 Mar 2013] that it has recorded 500 cases of measles in 19 local government areas of the state from December last year [2012] to date. Dr Julius Gajere, the state's Rapid Response Team leader, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna that no deaths had been recorded.

He said 83 per cent of the reported cases were in 6 local government areas. Gajere gave the names of the affected local governments as Igabi, Kaduna North, Kaduna South, Ikara, Makarfi, and Kubau. He also said that 96 per cent of the cases had manifested in children between 9 to 59 months old. "The main clinical features of the disease are fever, cough, conjunctivitis, runny nose, and maculopapular rashes. He advised the affected local councils to provide drugs, water, and clean environments to communities to prevent further spread of the disease. Gajere blamed the situation on low routine immunisation in the affected areas and urged the residents to embrace the immunisation programme.

http://www.irinnews.org/Report/97636/Suspicion-fuels-Nigeria-measles-outbreak


An ongoing measles outbreak that has killed 36 children and infected over 4000 in northern Nigeria between 16 Feb and 9 Mar 2013 has been linked to a drop-off in immunizations due to vaccine shortages in regional health clinics and widespread suspicion of the vaccine, say government health officials.

Many parents have declined to vaccinate their children against measles, as they believe the vaccine is harmful, according to Ado Mohammed, director-general of Nigeria's National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). "Parents are largely to blame ... for their refusal to have their children immunized against preventable diseases, including measles, due to unfounded suspicion that such vaccines are harmful to children, following persistent rumours that polio vaccine causes infertility in children," he told IRIN. Distrust of vaccines has grown, as parents often do not differentiate between the polio vaccine and other immunizations, according to Mohammed. The 12 states affected by the measles outbreak mirror those where polio is endemic and where resistance against the polio vaccine is highest. Kano state has reported over 1000 measles cases, and Katsina state 1260.

Nigeria's junior health minister, Ali Pate, agrees (as did Kano state's health commissioner Abubakar Labaran Yusuf, and Katsina health commissioner Hussaini Yammama): "The measles outbreak is a direct consequence of parents refusing to immunize their children," he said, adding: "Measles is a disease that is 99 percent preventable." Following incremental progress on reducing resistance to polio vaccine campaigns, on 8 Jan 2013, gunmen killed 10 polio vaccinators in separate attacks on 2 polio clinics in Kano 2 days after a radio station aired a programme which discussed suspicion of the polio vaccine.

Infants are immunized against measles for life at 9 months as part of routine immunizations in hospitals and health centres. "I don't allow my children to take any immunization, because I don't believe they are safe. The west has been insisting we give polio vaccines to our children, which we have refused, and now they insist we take our children for routine immunization, which I see as another way of giving our children what we are trying to avoid in the polio vaccine," a father of 5, told IRIN.

Health workers and parents said a shortage of vaccines has also contributed to low routine immunization coverage. A nurse at a government hospital in Kano told IRIN that many parents return to hospital week after week for routine vaccinations only to find doctors have run out of medicine. "At a certain stage, they become fed up and stop going because they come to think that it is a waste of time and energy," he told IRIN. Nigeria's Health Ministry supplies vaccines to states through NPHCDA for use in regional health centres. "Some local governments don't pick up the vaccine deliveries that we supply to states, which creates shortages at primary health care centres, depriving willing parents' access to such vaccines for their children," Mohammed told IRIN.

The national health authorities have procured 10 million doses from the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to try to vaccinate 7 million children in the affected states over the coming days as an emergency response to the outbreak. NPHCDA will also supply solar-powered refrigerators to affected areas to stockpile vaccines. Health officials, WHO, and UNICEF were already planning a nationwide measles campaign for 33 million under-5s in June and August 2013.

http://leadership.ng/nga/articles/49655/2013/03/10/outbreak_deadly_diseases_hot_season_sets.html


From March to June every year, dwellers across the sub Saharan African region bear the brunt of the hot season that culminates in the rainy season. Kano, due to longitudinal and latitudinal effects, is among cities that come under severe heat waves throughout the 4 months, bringing discomfort from the steaming heat, scorching sun, and biting hot winds. But it is not the environmental discomfort that causes people to shudder as the season approaches, but fatal diseases that also come during the period. Killer diseases like measles, meningitis, and cholera ravage people, mostly during hot weather.

The 1st to rear its ugly head is measles, which unofficial figures placed at around 8000 children infected, as proclaimed by a victim from Tukuntawa area, Kano, who lost one child to the disease. A housewife lamented that the season is to blame, since "children suffer much from measles this time around, although it may attack them during other seasons, but that is very rare. During this period, the epidemic attacks with much severity, hence the loss of lives. It may not be so severe in other seasons."

The lady, who said she had some primary knowledge in midwifery, said the disease is more fatal to children from the age of 2. "It descends mercilessly on children from 2 years up. Babies who are under breast feeding normally have mild attacks, which could go in 3 days even, but it may last a week with older children. But it attacks only once in a lifetime, as there are no records of people infected twice.

At the Infectious Disease Hospital, Weatherhead, Kano, the scene indicates an atmosphere of ambivalence, as families visit patients that have been admitted. "I noticed my child's nose running, followed by a high temperature, and then his lips became red with sores. Our parents have tutored us on how to recognise the symptoms of measles, so I rushed the baby to the hospital," a mother revealed as she tended her child at the IDH. A nurse who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that in the last one week, more than 40 children had died due to measles.

The state commissioner of health, Dr Abubakar Labaran, told Leadership on Sunday [10 Mar 2013] that the state has put resources in place to control the spread of measles in the state. In his submission in Lafia, the senior registrar of the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital (DASH), Lafia, Dr Halim Odiachi, said that the hospital is coping with a measles epidemic outbreak in which 38 cases have so far been reported, most of which occurred because of parents' attitudes towards immunising their children.

In Zamfara, Leadership Sunday checks in some hospitals and primary health centres in the state capital Gusau found elements of growing spread of measles attacks among small children who are receiving treatment in some hospitals.

On this issue, the commissioner explained that the government is on top of efforts for treatment and curbing further infection of measles across the state, noting that the disease is usually more pronounced and active during the hot period of each year, explaining further that due to the proactive measures taken by the government, there are very minimal recorded cases of measles compared to other states.

He said in the meantime, many field officers of his ministry were still in the rural areas across the state keeping surveillance on any appearance of cases of measles with a view to taking evasive measures.

[It is unlikely that the seasonality of measles in Nigeria is related to high environmental temperature. Measles virus infectivity is rapidly reduced by desiccation and elevated temperature. More likely, the seasonality is due to local patterns of agricultural and social activities seasonality, demographic characteristics, and spatial heterogeneities (Bharti N, et al. Epidemiol Infect. 2010 Sep;138(9):1308-16. doi: 10.1017/S0950268809991385. Epub 2010 Jan 25). In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primarily in late winter and spring (see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#epi.

In relation to this seasonality, Bharti N, et al. have analysed seasonal fluctuations of measles in Niger using nighttime lights imagery (Science. 2011 Dec 9;334(6061):1424-7. doi: 10.1126/science.1210554). "Measles epidemics in West Africa cause a significant proportion of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Epidemics are strongly seasonal, but the drivers of these fluctuations are poorly understood, which limits the predictability of outbreaks and the dynamic response to immunization. They show that measles seasonality can be explained by spatiotemporal changes in population density, which was measured by quantifying anthropogenic light from satellite imagery. They found that measles transmission and population density are highly correlated for 3 cities in Niger. With dynamic epidemic models, they demonstrated that measures of population density are essential for predicting epidemic progression at the city level and improving intervention strategies. In addition to epidemiological applications, the ability to measure fine-scale changes in population density has implications for public health, crisis management, and economic development."

It would be interesting to know the outcome of this type of analysis in Nigeria. - Mod.CP

Kebbi state commissioner of health Shehu Sambawa stated that the state had recorded over 2500 cases of measles in 14 local government areas in the last 2 months. Receiving drugs [vaccine?] donated by Save the Children at Malaria Control Unit in Birnin Kebbi yesterday [11 Mar 2013], Sambawa said avoidable epidemic diseases that include cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM), measles, and gastroenteritis are the common and the most serious health problems that can lead to high deaths among the populace.

The commissioner said the frequency and magnitude of the outbreak constitutes an obstacle to the efforts by the state in controlling the morbidity and mortality of these diseases. Handing over the drugs, the Kebbi state field manager of Save the Children International, Ahmed Saidu, said the group conducted an assessment of the situation and is supporting the government and people of the state with the drugs estimated for about 1000 children across the affected communities in the state.

A measles-rubella vaccination campaign being launched today [12 Mar 2013] in Rwanda marks the start of an effort to vaccinate more than 700 million children in 49 countries against the 2 diseases, according to the GAVI Alliance (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization -- Press Release: http://www.gavialliance.org/library/news/press-releases/2013/over-700-million-children-in-49-countries-to-be-protected-against-measles-and-rubella/).

The goal is to introduce the dual vaccine in all the countries by 2020, the alliance said in its press release. It said Rwanda, which is already effectively controlling measles, is the 1st African country to provide measles-rubella vaccine nationwide with GAVI support. Over the next 4 days, Rwandan health workers aim to vaccinate close to 5 million children between the ages of 9 months and 14 years. Five other countries -- Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Senegal, and Viet Nam -- plan to launch similar drives with GAVI support by the end of this year [2013].

Measles and rubella are unrelated diseases but cause some of the same symptoms and are often confused with one another, the alliance noted. In pregnant women, rubella can cause miscarriage and severe birth defects, such as blindness, deafness, and heart problems.

Vaccination efforts reduced global measles cases by 71 percent between 2000 and 2011. But as measles wanes, rubella cases, which in the past might have been mistaken for measles, begin to emerge, pointing up the need for the vaccine. GAVI is providing about USD 6.8 million to support the Rwandan immunization drive.

[Other points from the GAVI Press Release are the following: "Thanks to widespread vaccination, rubella is no longer the threat it once was in many countries. But for millions of mothers and their children in poorer countries, rubella poses an ongoing danger. Africa and South East Asia have the highest number of estimated CRS cases and the lowest uptake of rubella-containing vaccine. The human and economic toll of rubella in those regions is staggering. GAVI funding for measles and rubella vaccine campaigns will help countries to rapidly scale up introduction of rubella vaccine and protect women and children. In fact, every day of delay means about 300 newborn children enter the world with life-altering disability because of rubella infection in pregnancy. With the technical know-how available, we have a chance to make history by eradicating measles and rubella once and for all. Measles kills an estimated 430 people -- mainly young children -- every day. In 2000, about 548 000 children died from measles, whose symptoms include a high fever, severe skin rash, and a cough. At least 90 per cent of children must be covered by measles vaccine to protect communities against measles. GAVI is funded by governments (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States)." - Mod.CP

The New Jersey Department of Health has confirmed one case of measles in Somerset County and is investigating 2 other reported cases of measles in people determined to be at locations in the area from 6 to 12 Mar 2013.

In the 1st case, confirmed on 13 Mar 2013, a local health department was made aware of a medical center employee who developed fever and a rash on 8 Mar 2013. This person had contact with a known laboratory-confirmed case of measles in an unvaccinated person who had traveled internationally. A 2nd case was identified on 13 Mar 2013 in a person who also had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case. This 2nd individual has not yet been confirmed to have measles.

The Department of Health is recommending that anyone who was at the following locations contact a health provider immediately:
- Somerset Medical Center, on Rehill Avenue in Somerville -- 4 Mar 2013 between 8 am and 6 pm; 5 Mar 2013 between 8 am and 6 pm; 6 Mar 2013 between 9 am. and 4:30 pm; 7 Mar 2013 between 9 am and 8 pm; 8 Mar 2013 between 9 am and 2 pm; and 11 Mar 2013 between 8:45 am and 2 pm.
- Steeplechase Cancer Center, on Rehill Avenue in Somerville-- 6 Mar 2013 between 2:30 pm and 5:30 pm; 8 Mar 2013 between 12 pm and 5:30 pm; and 11 Mar 2013 between 2 pm and 5 pm.
- Somerset County Human Services Building, on Warren Street in Somerville-- 6 Mar 2013 between 9:15 am and 2 pm; 7 Mar 2013 between 10:30 am and 7 pm; and 11 Mar 2013 between 10:30 am and 4 pm.
- Somerset County Administration Building, on Grove Street in Somerville-- 7 Mar 2013 between 10 am and 12:30 pm.
- Carlo's Pizza & Pasta, on Union Avenue in Bridgewater-- 8 Mar 2013 between 4 pm and 6:45 pm.
- TGI Friday's, on Route 202 in Bridgewater-- 9 Mar 2013 between 5:30 pm and 10 pm.
- Barnes and Noble Booksellers, on Route 202/206 in Bridgewater-- 10 Mar 2013 between 3 pm and 6:30 pm.
- Bloomingdale's at the Bridgewater Commons Mall, on Commons Way in Bridgewater-- 10 Mar 2013 between 3 pm and 6:30 pm.
- Adam & Eve Hairstylists, on Route 206 in Hillsborough-- 12 Mar 2013 between 6 pm and 9 pm.

"We urge everyone to check to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on measles/mumps/rubella vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations," said Christina Tan, state epidemiologist, in the release. "Two doses of measles vaccine is more than 99 per cent effective in preventing measles." Any person who believes he or she has been exposed, the release said, should call a health care provider before going to a medical office or emergency room, and arrangements can be made for evaluation without possibly infecting other patients and medical staff.

"If you're planning an international trip, the World Health Organization recommends that adults or adolescents unsure of their immune status get a dose of measles vaccine before traveling," Tan said in the release. Those who are unvaccinated and are exposed to measles may be able to prevent infection by getting vaccinated within 72 hours of exposure, the release said. The immunization can also lessen the severity of the disease, and it should be given within 6 days of exposure, the release said.
