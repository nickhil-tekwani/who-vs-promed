Mass hysteria can be triggered by stress. Due to intertribal warfare and the flight of refugees, the population of North Darfur is now considerably less than it was in 2006, and the school kids could have been stressed by fighting in the area. See http://www.irinnews.org/report/97434/call-for-humanitarian-access-after-clashes-in-north-darfur (8 Feb 2013).

--------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2009, school girls in elementary and intermediate classes, their teachers, administration staff of the schools, and in some cases the parents of the students in Afghanistan suffer from an unknown disease so far called "mass poisoning of school girls". [http://www.ctvnews.ca/mass-poisoning-feared-as-afghan-schoolgirls-fall-ill-1.397584 (11 May 2009)].

The symptoms are fainting, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, headache, shivering, weeping, rash, hot flashes, redness on face, loss of consciousness and normal to small pupils. Symptoms start when students are going to their classes in the mornings and in matter of minutes to an hour tens of students and others fall sick. In the emergency rooms patients are treated with oxygen, dextrose and sometime atropine. All recover in hours and no mortality is reported to date.

So far not only ministry of health of Afghanistan, but also World Health Organization and well equipped armies of our 30 countries that are working in Afghanistan to bring peace and stability could not detect the agent and could not diagnose the disease.

The drama is [occurring] during the time that schools are open in Afghanistan (March-December), and remitting while schools are [closed] or there is no hot political issue. Incidents are happening in localities that are safe or relatively safe and not in the areas of suicide attacks or frequent explosions. Though the Afghan minister of education threatened to punish schoolgirls who claim to suffer from alleged poisonings [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/afghan-minister-vows-punishment-for-fainting-girls/article4697439.ece (9 May 2013)], [the incidences are] continuing. Sometimes they call it a mysterious disease [http://www.pajhwok.com/en/photo/177773 (7 May 2012)], sometimes a mass poisoning with malathion, and sometimes mass hysteria. No matter what, the children are suffering.

To conclude, school children are endangered everywhere civil unrest, war, or political unrest exists. Only those who have lost their childhood in the war know what costs are paid.

This is a personal view and does not reflect our institutional views.
