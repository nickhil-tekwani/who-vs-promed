Foot and mouth disease outbreak in Limpopo
------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's National Department of Agriculture (NDA) on
Tuesday confirmed a case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in the north
eastern part of the country between the Limpopo River and the Kruger
National Park. The confirmation resulted from ongoing surveillance in this
buffer zone, where 6 cases had been detected before.

Veterinary officials investigated suspected cases and the FMD laboratory at
the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute confirmed the diagnosis. "The buffer
zone is under constant surveillance with twice yearly vaccination of all
cattle and strict movement control of all cloven-hoofed animals," the NDA said.

Land Affairs and Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza said the national and
provincial agriculture departments would intensify the usual control
measures in the area where the cases had been detected. "The case occurred
in the FMD Control Area and thus does not affect the export status of the
Free Zone of South Africa," Didiza added.

[South Africa is one of 5 Office International des Epizooties (OIE)
member-countries currently recognised as "having an FMD free zone where
vaccination is not practiced, according to the provisions of Chapter 2.1.1.
of the International Animal Health Code". The free zone was reinstated in
South Africa in May 2002, following the eradication there of an outbreak
caused by the PanAsian type O FMD virus.

Since 2000, FMD viruses of types O, SAT 1 and SAT 2 have been identified in
South Africa. The history and current FMD situation are described in the
paper "Foot and Mouth disease: the experience of South Africa", GK
Bruckner, et al> Rev Sci Tech Off Int Epiz 2002; 21(3): 751-64
<http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/rt/2103/4.2.Bruckner.pdf>.

Details on the animal species affected by the current outbreak, and the FMD
virus strain involved, would be useful. - Mod.AS].
