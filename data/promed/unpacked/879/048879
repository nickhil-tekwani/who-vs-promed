The Legionnaires' outbreak linked to Hopkins, Minn. has increased to 14 cases. One individual has died, according to a report from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. It can be contracted by inhaling mist from infected water sources such as cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems. It is not spread by person-to-person contact [Possible person-to-person transmission has been described - Correia AM, GonCalves J, Gomes, JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016;374:497-8. - Mod.ML] or by drinking water [Legionnaires' disease can be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water; see moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below. - Mod.ML].

The infected individual who died was reportedly elderly. The individual's exact age and gender remain undisclosed. Those sickened in the outbreak range in age from 20s to 90s. Some are in serious condition and suffer from comorbidities. "While it's unfortunate to see a death, we are not surprised that one has occurred in an outbreak of this size," the Minnesota Health Department said Wed [21 Sep 2016] in a prepared statement, according to the Star Tribune. According to the CDC, approximately 10 percent of those who contract Legionnaires' will die.
