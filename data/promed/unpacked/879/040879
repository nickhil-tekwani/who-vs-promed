A horse in Monmouth County died this month [August 2018] after contracting a serious, mosquito-borne disease, the 1st case of its kind in New Jersey this year [2018].

The 5-year-old mare was euthanized on 18 Aug 2018 after it acquired eastern equine encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain tissue and, in most cases, kills any horse that acquires it, according to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture in a release issued Friday [24 Aug 2018].

The horse had been vaccinated against the disease in 2017, but not this year [2018].

"Horse owners need to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes," New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher said in a release. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus."

After the 1st human case of West Nile virus was confirmed in New Jersey this season, here's a breakdown of which counties have had the most mosquitoes found with West Nile virus this year [2018].

New Jersey had 6 cases of eastern equine encephalitis in 2017 and 2 cases of West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne viral disease that affects a horse's neurological system, according to the release. However, eastern equine encephalitis has a "significantly higher" risk of death in horses than West Nile virus.

Humans are unlikely to catch eastern equine encephalitis from horses, as the animals are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus, officials said.

The Department of Agriculture encouraged all horse owners to have their animals vaccinated against both eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.

Both viral diseases must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609-671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis, the department said.

A horse in Camden County has been euthanized after contracting a disease that it was not vaccinated against, according to state officials.

The 12-year-old gelding was the 2nd horse in 2 weeks to come down with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious, mosquito-borne illness, stated a news release from the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.

The 1st case -- which also was the 1st incidence of the disease reported this year [2018] -- was in a Monmouth County mare.

The Camden County horse was euthanized Monday [27 Aug 2018]. The horse in Monmouth County also was euthanized, health officials said.

Officials are now urging animal owners to remember vaccines for EEE and West Nile virus, which also can be deadly to horses. But EEE, which causes inflammation of the brain tissue, has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection, officials said. Both diseases are spread by mosquitoes and affect a horse's neurological system.

Horses with EEE don't pose a serious risk of infecting people because horses (like humans) are "dead-end" hosts for the virus, officials said.

Horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against both EEE and West Nile virus.

EEE and West Nile virus, like other viral diseases affecting horses' neurological system, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609-671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis. The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with testing for both diseases and can be reached at 609-406-6999 or <jerseyvetlab@ag.nj.gov>.

[Preventing EEE and WNV is through vaccination and control of mosquitoes. EEE and WNV, and usually tetanus, are combined into one injection. If an animal has not been vaccinated or the vaccine history has a lapse in it, then the animal needs 2 vaccines 3-4 weeks apart, and then an annual vaccine. In areas where the mosquito season is long, the vaccine may need to be given approximately every 3-4 months. The immunity to EEE wanes in approximately 4 months. Vaccines are cheap compared to treating the horse for the disease or losing your friend and investment. Please vaccinate your horses.

Mosquito control is very important as well. There are sprays specifically for horses for mosquitoes and flies. However, do not believe you can protect your animal with sprays alone. Vaccine is necessary. - Mod.TG
