Avian influenza spreading in Cloppenburg [District]
---------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza is spreading in the [district] of Cloppenburg. An
influenza virus that poses no danger for humans has been detected in
4 additional holdings in Garrel and Boesel. Affected are a total of
58 000 turkeys, which will be culled immediately.

This information was made available by the district authorities on
Saturday [13 Dec 2008]. During the last couple of days a total of 43
000 turkeys have been culled and destroyed. According to the
veterinary authorities the virus is spreading fast.

Low pathogenic H5N2 [sic; see commentary] influenza virus was
detected on turkey fattening units. It is a mild form of bird flu, a
disease sometimes called fowl plague and not the dangerous, highly
aggressive virus H5N1, which is also known to affect people.

The new outbreaks in the [district] are, according to the district
administration, on 2 farms in the exclusion zone set up around
Garrel, on a farm near the exclusion zone and a fattening unit in
Boesel, about 12 km (7.5 mi) away from the current disease zones.
Around Garrel, the exclusion zone was extended and in Boesel a new
exclusion zone was set up. By extending the restricted areas, a
further 14 farms are officially investigated.

[District Administrator] Hans Eveslage said that all precautions are
being taken to act swiftly and rapidly in the event of a further
spread of the disease. How the virus was introduced is still unclear.
The Agriculture Ministry of Lower Saxony had ordered to keep all
poultry confined. This applies to all owners of chicken, ducks,
geese, and poultry, commercial and private.

Agriculture Minister Hans-Heinrich Ehlen (CDU) said that "to prevent
further spread of bird flu, quick action is necessary. We need to
trace all infected poultry in a very short time. Speed is of the
essence so that we can quickly get on top of the disease," said Ehlen
in Hannover. The minister called for permission of vaccination to
contain the disease.

The district of Cloppenburg is one of the strongholds of poultry
production in Lower Saxony. In the [district], about 12 millions
birds are kept of which 3 million are turkeys, a district spokesman
said. The extent of economic damage for farmers is, so far, not
established. Direct losses, which means animals culled by order of
the State veterinarian of the district, are covered by the compulsory
health fund (Tierseuchenkasse).

[Germany's notifications to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) of 17 Oct and 12 Dec 2008 reported 3 outbreaks of LPNAI (low
pathogenic notifiable avian influenza): 2 in October, Leipzig, Saxony
-- a zoo (1 goose, 3 ducks) and a small holding (106 birds,
unspecified species), and the current outbreak in Saxony, almost 400
km (about 250 mi) distant from the October outbreaks. As reported,
the LPNAI virus involved is H5N3 and not H5N2, as stated in the
newswire above; the notifications, and a map showing the 3 outbreaks,
are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7439>.

In a separate holding in Saxony (Gorlitz, close to the
German-Czech-Polish border junction), HPAI (highly pathogenic avian
influenza) H5N1 was reported on 10 Oct 2008 (see ProMED-mail posting
20081022.3340).

All H5 and H7 viruses have been classified by the OIE as notifiable
avian influenza (NAI) viruses. The methods used for the determination
of strain virulence for birds have evolved over recent years with a
greater understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity. LPNAI
are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that are not HPNAI
viruses. Since all HPAI outbreaks are notifiable, there is, in fact,
no apparent need to use the abbreviation HPNAI.
