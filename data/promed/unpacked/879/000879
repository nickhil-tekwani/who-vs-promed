The Mauritian veterinary services late Thursday [18 Oct 2007] began
the slaughtering of all the swine that were contaminated by the
African swine fever [ASF] virus, PANA saw [in Port-Louis.]

The slaughtering was done by the staff of the Ministry of
Agri-industry and the local farmers.

The discovery of this disease and its confirmation by a South African
laboratory, where contaminated samples were sent last week [11 Oct
2007], spread panic among the swine farmers on the Island, who are
rearing about 17 000 heads.

"The situation is disastrous for the farmers who live on this
activity," said the president of a co-operative society of swine
farmers, Rajakrishna Pachamootoo.

Eric Mangar, the Director of the Food Self-sufficiency Movement
(MAA), said the infection was a result of a break in the control on
swine farms in Mauritius.

"The discovery of this disease threatens our self-sufficiency in
pork," he said, adding that self-sufficiency dropped from 100 percent
in 1992 to 60 percent in 2000, then to 54 percent in 2005. "With the
on-going swine slaughtering, this self-sufficiency will further drop,
and the Island will have to import much more pork than the usual 650
tons per year," Mangar lamented.

He also said it was time to review the strategy in this sector, by
setting up integrated farms on the Island.

[Classical Swine Fever (CSF) virus, known in Mauritius from previous
outbreaks, was initially suspected as the cause of the current
disease and mortality in pigs. While ordering CSF vaccine, the
Mauritian veterinary authorities have acted with commendable
precaution and sent samples from affected pigs for confirmation in
the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) reference laboratory
in Onderstepoort. There, the causative agent has been identified to
be ASF virus: a disease which, according to OIE data, has never
before been reported from Mauritius, and against which no vaccine is
available. The 2 diseases are indistinguishable on clinical grounds.

The outbreak has been immediately reported to the OIE, notifying 3
affected locations with a total of 549 dead and 49 destroyed pigs.
For the notification and a map, submitted on 19 Oct 2007, see

It will be interesting to note if the current ASF outbreak in
Mauritius is related to the outbreak reported from Madagascar last
month (September 2007). - Mod.AS
