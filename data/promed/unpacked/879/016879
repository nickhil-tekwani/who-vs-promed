Fake alcohol causes Turkey deaths
----------------
Health officials in Turkey say at least 21 people have now died after
drinking counterfeit raki.
A major operation is under way to withdraw and replace millions of bottles
of the strong alcoholic aniseed drink in shops and markets. The counterfeit
batch is reported to have contained up to 200 times the permitted amount of
methyl alcohol. The outbreak of poisoning has caused deep unease, as many
Turks regard raki as their national drink.
The deaths occurred after bootleggers apparently stole labels from genuine
raki bottles and stuck them onto bottles of their fake product.
Most of the deaths were in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, but thousands
of bottles of counterfeit raki have been seized in police raids across the
country.
Manufacturers have produced new labels to show bottles are genuine. Mey
Drinks -- a major distributor of the official product -- is recalling
millions of bottles from shops and markets and destroying them. On
Wednesday, the company said it had started to re-stock markets in Istanbul
with fresh bottles of raki with a new cap which it described as more secure.
Some bar owners have alleged that increasingly high taxes on alcohol may
have encouraged the spread of potentially dangerous bootleg distilleries.
But the Turkish government has brushed aside such suggestions and has ruled
out reducing taxes.

[Outbreaks of methanol poisoning continue in both the developed as well as
the developing world (see refs below for prior ProMED-mail coverage). In
the above incident it is unclear if this is an intentional poisoning as a
retaliation for government-implemented taxation.
Borrowing my colleague Mod.TG's comment from earlier postings on methanol
poisonings (see refs below) to provide background on the topic:
"Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination
rate depends upon the folate pool, which in primates is generally small,
and consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol
toxicity than other animals.
Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints,
paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a
40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual.
Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels
occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.
Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life.
Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion.
Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the
absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent
period is 12-24 hours.
Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion,
which are common in mild-to-moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and
convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema.
Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.
Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 percent of severe cases. Methanol
is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain,
not unlike large doses of ethanol.
Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may
be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these
patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too
late for this type of treatment to be helpful.
Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may
be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the
treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well."
An additional comment on the treatment of methanol poisoning was submitted
by Dr. Gary Greenberg (<Gary.Greenberg@Duke.edu> in prior postings as well:
"Better than ethanol, Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, Antizol) inhibits
alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium, fetal risks, liver
injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting.
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/344/6/424>
Also, Folinic acid (leucovorin) is recommended for restoration of 1-carbon
metabolism, especially for methanol exposure."
