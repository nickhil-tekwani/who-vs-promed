"Tuberculosis, multi-drug resistant - South Africa (KN)"
[20060904.2514] must be a late news report of research that was
presented in mid-August 2006 at the XVI International AIDS Conference
in Toronto. It was presented as a late-breaker abstract. You can find
the abstract (and PowerPoint slides) here
<http://www.aids2006.org/PAG/PSession.aspx?s=263>
by searching for "Gandhi," who was the presenter.
So, the XDR-TB did occur in the context of HIV infection; but there
was also a report in MMWR of the 1st global survey of XDR-TB in March
2006 ["Emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with Extensive
Resistance to 2nd-Line Drugs --- Worldwide, 2000--2004"
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5511a2.htm>.

Background: In a rural district in Kwazulu Natal, South Africa, where
the TB/HIV coinfection rate is greater than 80 percent,
antiretroviral therapy (ARV) has significantly reduced mortality. Of
the remaining deaths, 67 percent have been documented to be due to
multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. We sought to determine the extent and
consequences of MDR TB among patients in this district.
Methods: Surveillance with sputum culture and drug susceptibility
testing was performed for patients with known or suspected TB in a
rural district hospital. Spoligotyping was performed on isolates
resistant to all tested TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol,
streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin).
Results: Between January 2005 and March 2006, sputum collected from
1540 patients revealed that 536 (35 percent) patients were culture
positive for M.tb. Of these, 221 (41 percent) had MDR TB, and 53 (24
percent of MDR isolates, 10 percent of all positive cultures) had
resistance to all 1st and 2nd line drugs tested (XDR TB).
Spoligotyping revealed 90 percent of XDR TB patients were infected
with a genetically similar strain. 52 of 53 (98 percent) XDR TB
patients have died; the median survival after sputum collection was
25 days (range: 11-136). All 47 XDR TB patients with known HIV status
were HIV positive. Only 34 percent of patients were previously
treated for TB, and 56 percent had been previously hospitalized."
Our thanks to Terry Murray for bringing the original data to our
attention. These data answer many of the questions we raised. -
