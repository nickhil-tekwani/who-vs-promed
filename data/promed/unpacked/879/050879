The number of hand-foot-mouth cases recorded at sentinel centres (137) and
in public hospitals (47) in the week ending Aug 1 showed a downward trend.
As at today 40 confirmed cases of EV-71 and six suspected cases were
recorded. All patients had been discharged except for a 34-year-old man who
developed complications of meningoencephalitis and is in satisfactory
condition in hospital.
Members of the public can dial the Department of Health's new hotline (2833
0112) to seek health advice and information on enterovirus infections.
