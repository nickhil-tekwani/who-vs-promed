EPIDEMIC OF ACUTE RENAL FAILURE - HAITI
=======================================
[Although this outbreak is not due to an infectious agent, we are posting
this notice as a public health service, of special interest to travelers to
Haiti - Mod.JW]

WASHINGTON, 25 June, 1996 -- The Pan American Health Organization has been
helping Haiti's Ministry of Health investigate an epidemic of kidney failure
that has killed at least 30 Haitian children, apparently caused by
contaminated liquid acetaminophen manufactured by a local pharmaceutical
company.
According to laboratory analysis performed by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, diethylene glycol, an ingredient of automobile anti-freeze, was
found in two samples of liquid acetaminophen called "Afebril" and "Valodon."
There is no known antidote.
Data from Haiti show that 68 cases have been reported, and at least 30
children have died. Haiti's Health Minister, Dr. Rodolphe Malebranche,
issued a press release asking the population to stop using the "Afebrile"
and "Valodon" liquid medicines, and ordered their removal from all
pharmacies. Investigations are continuing to see if other anti-fever
medications have also been contaminated with the toxic substance.
Diethylene glycol "is almost always fatal when consumed by humans, typically
leading to acute renal failure," the CDC's National Center for Environmental
Health reported, adding: "Any formulations intended for oral consumption
which may contain or are suspected of containing di-ethylene glycol should
be immediately withdrawn from any possibility of human consumption and
reserved for future analysis."
The Haitian Health Ministry requested assistance from the Pan American
Health Organization [PAHO], the Centers for Disease Control, and PAHO's
Caribbean Epidemiology Center to investigate the outbreak. PAHO sent two
epidemiologists to Haiti to assist in the investigation. Most cases are from
Port-au-Prince, but cases have also been identified in seven other areas.
Affected patients range from 1 month to 13 years old. Kidney specimens from
four of the children who died were examined at Johns Hopkins University,
which reported the deaths were due to toxic poisoning. The CDC analysis of
the medication supplied by parents of two of the children showed the
presence of diethylene glycol.
The Haitian Ministry is continuing its investigation of the local
pharmaceutical company and has also issued radio announcements asking the
public to stop all use of liquid acetaminophen products. Haitians traveling
abroad are being urged to discard any bottles of "Afebril" or "Valodon" in
case they are contaminated.
