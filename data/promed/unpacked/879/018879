Health officials are calling for a change of strategy in fighting
hydrophobia (rabies) in a bid to cut costs. The healthcare
authorities spend around Rs. 600 million [USD 52 877] annually to
protect people from the killer disease, North Western Province Health
Minister Asoka Wadigamangawa said in a recent meeting.

The anti-rabies serum injection [immunoglobulin] that costs Rs. 22
000 [about USD 194] contributes to the higher expenditure, he pointed
out. The Minister was addressing officials from provincial rabies
prevention centres who had gathered to discuss the ongoing [canine]
sterilisation programme in Kurunegala and Puttalam districts.

The officials, while stressing the need to save human lives [by
post-exposure vaccination and immunoglobulin treatment], said
sterilisation of dogs would help fight rabies at lesser cost. They
alleged that some health ministry officials were trying to halt the
ongoing sterilisation programme. The participants also told Minister
Wadigamangawa that some top officials were benefiting from the Rs.
600 [USD 52 877] million budget.

The anti-rabies officials, citing official data, said the disease
killed more than 50 000 people around the globe annually. Last year's
[2009] figure reached 56 000, with a majority of the deaths being
reported from Africa and Asia.

They said 56, 51 and 56 Sri Lankans died of the disease in 2007, 2008
and 2009 respectively. [To put these figures in perspective, the
death toll from snake bite in Sri Lanka, another imunnoglobulin
treatable condition, is about 600 persons per annum. - Mod.CP]. Last
year's toll in Kurunegala was 5 with 2 more deaths being reported
this year [2010]. The toll in Puttalam was 5 last year, and one death
has been recorded for 2010 so far.

In Sri Lanka, domestic dogs are being blamed for most of the cases.
Studies in Kurunegala show that the disease claimed 38 lives during
the last decade. The data revealed that hydrophobia had claimed more
lives than dengue.

Officials say 25 040 and 22 141 people were vaccinated [post
exposure?] against rabies in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The
casualties are in the low-income group as more cyclists become victims.

Most of the immunised dogs are from the Kurunegala district's
Galgamuwa and Giribawa divisions. Ratnapura comes in 2nd in the
immunization project. Data revealed that Rs 500 million [USD 44 000]
had been spent on vaccinating around 150 000 dogs in Kurunegala in
the past 18 months. The minister said district officials were
satisfied with the ongoing anti-rabies efforts in their respective areas.

[As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, canine rabies is a major hazard for
the human population and a considerable drain on public health
resources. Concentration of effort on control of canine rabies by
vaccination and sterilisation would seem to be the best
cost-effective options for protection of the human population.
