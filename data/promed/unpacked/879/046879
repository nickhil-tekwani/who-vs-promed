Foot and mouth may have spread to Europe
------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) threatened to spread to Europe yesterday after
a seventh case was confirmed on a farm in Devon owned by a dealer who
exports large numbers of sheep to France. A senior Ministry of Agriculture
vet said that the spread of the disease was "extremely serious" and could
reach the scale of the 1967 outbreak. John Cross, the head of veterinary
services in the South West, spoke as checks were being made at 12 other
farms owned by William Cleave, whose sheep and cattle have been infected at
Highampton.
Fears grew that an unknown number of infected lambs were shipped abroad
before export licences were suspended on Tuesday. Richard Haddock, Devon's
representative on the ruling council of the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales, said: "Real fear is gripping the farming community now.
Everyone down here is petrified."
He said: "Even if they don't have the disease, they cannot move any
livestock, so they can't get any income. We are approaching March when we
have to pay bills and settle our rents. Many people simply don't know where
the money will come from."
Vets found FMD blisters on one of his cattle and 50 others were salivating
unusually. Mr. Cross said he was particularly worried Mr. Cleave was a
dealer and the farm was close to Hatherleigh, which has one of the busiest
markets and abattoirs in the South West.
He said: "An extremely serious situation has arisen. We are involved in a
complex tracing exercise and are checking with the owner exactly what
movements there have been. If we find animals have been exported, the
ministry will notify the European authorities so the animals can be
slaughtered. One of the reasons for concern is the danger of aerial spread.
In 1967 it was one of the main ways the disease spread."
He said: "The Chief Veterinary Officer has said this outbreak is getting
towards 1967 proportions. We are not at that stage yet, but there is great
potential for that position to be repeated."
Government vets expressed concern the disease could be passing unnoticed in
sheep because the signs resemble those of other diseases.
Mr. Brown may make a statement to Parliament before flying to Brussels.
While he has received messages of sympathy and offers of help from several
European countries, he will be questioned closely by EU farm ministers
about progress being made to eliminate the outbreak before it becomes an
epidemic.
Belgium imposed a ban on the transport of live sheep and goats, but not of
pigs and cattle, and France is expected to take emergency measures. The
spread of the disease has all but destroyed hopes the EU will lift its
temporary ban on British meat, livestock and many food products in 4 days'
time. That ban, combined with the British 7-day ban on all movements of
cattle, sheep, pigs and goats, will cost farmers and food manufacturers
about 100 million pounds.
Snow enables the virus, which cannot survive long in bright conditions, to
linger. Windy conditions can spread it. Jim Scudamore, the Chief Veterinary
Officer, said he had not ruled out the possibility that the virus could
have spread to Britain on the wind from an unreported outbreak in Europe.
Farmers were furious that many walkers were ignoring appeals from the
Government, farming unions and the Ramblers' Association, to stay off
farms. They were also angry that the Government had not imposed an
immediate ban on imported meat.

Britain has been scrambling since 19 Feb 2001 to contain the outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), its first in 2 decades. Exports of meat, milk
and live animals have been banned, and inspectors have been quarantining
farms and slaughterhouses suspected of harboring the disease.
"Our hopes that the disease could be contained ... have been horribly
shattered," said Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers' Union. "We
are now more determined than ever to maintain our vigilance and beat this
disease."
Authorities also confirmed prior to last week's export ban, sheep from the
Devon farm had been sent to buyers in Europe. Agriculture Minister Nick
Brown acknowledged there was thus a risk infected sheep could have been
exported before the outbreak was discovered.
Veterinary officials cannot say precisely when the British outbreak began,
but some have speculated the disease could have been present for as long as
3 weeks before being discovered.
So far, more than 2000 animals have been slaughtered. In 1967, a disastrous
FMD epidemic continued for months and forced the slaughter of nearly half a
million animals in Britain.
In the Netherlands, more than 3000 sheep, cattle, pigs and deer were
slaughtered as a preventive measure, all from farms that had imported
animals from Britain, officials said Sunday. No FMD cases have been detected.
Belgium imposed a ban Saturday on all transport of sheep and goats.
Foot-and-mouth disease spreads very easily. The virus can be airborne,
spread from one animal to another, transmitted through contaminated feed,
or carried by humans on boots and clothing.
The outbreak has raised questions about modern farming methods, and whether
mass production, transport and slaughter have made animals more vulnerable
to disease.
Officials have not announced the number of confirmed infections, only
places where the disease has been detected. It is presumed wherever the
disease is found, it will spread. So all animals at risk to date (more than
2000) are being slaughtered.
