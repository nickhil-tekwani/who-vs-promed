More than 100 workers were hospitalized with food poisoning after eating
lunch in the cafeteria of a recently opened Taiwanese factory in southern
Vietnam, a doctor said on Friday, 22 Nov 2002. The 110 workers, all women
except for 1 man, worked at Effort Co., a T-shirt factory in Cu Chi, a
suburb of Ho Chi Minh City, the doctor said.
One day after the illness that occurred on Thu 21 Nov 2002, 13 were still
hospitalized. The cause of the food poisoning was still being
investigated, the physician stated.
An executive at the Taiwanese-owned factory said it has been operating for
2 months and orders food for its cafeteria from a restaurant in Ho Chi Minh
City, formerly named Saigon.
The workers ate pork with turnips, okra and pumpkin soup for lunch, said
the executive, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. 59 people died
from food poisoning in Vietnam in the first 10 months of this year,
compared to 63 people in all of last year, according to the National
Committee for Food Hygiene and Safety Control.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more information about this cluster
of presumptive food-borne illness. Clinical information including the
incubation time from lunch until onset of symptoms, the spectrum of
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neurological complaints, presence or
absence of fever) and the length of the illness are needed to assess
possible etiologies.
Short incubation periods (<12 hours) generally result from preformed
biologic or chemical toxins, whereas longer periods are needed for the
replication of infections _per se_. The chemical toxin category includes
medications given to the pigs, as was suspected to have occurred related to
clenbuterol, which caused vomiting, headache, and a rapid heart beat in an
outbreak in Heyuan of Southern Guangdong Province in China, reported in a
posting of ProMED-mail in 2001 cited below. - Mod.LL]
