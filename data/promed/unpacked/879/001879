Emergency Management Warning 2: Newcastle Disease in California in Game Fowl
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Newcastle disease (ND) has been confirmed in game fowl in the Riverside and
Los Angeles Counties CA area.
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on 1
Oct 2002 and is restricted to backyard fowl. Clinical signs in infected
birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality
is up to 90 percent of exposed birds. Commercial poultry, at this time are
not involved in the outbreak.
The National Veterinary Services Laboratory isolated an avian paramyxovirus
type-1. The virus was found to have multiple basic amino acids at the
fusion (F) protein cleavage activation site: arg. arg. glu. lys. arg* phe,
a sequence compatible with that of mesogenic/velogenic pathotypes. The
intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) for the Newcastle disease virus
from the game fowl is 1.75.
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiologic associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning, disinfection, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA and
APHIS. Carcasses are bagged and buried 3 feet deep in local landfills.
CDFA has also closed all avian exhibits at fairs and expositions within the
State of California.
The following are the numbers associated with the Newcastle disease
situation in California:
Number of Premises Positive by Clinical Signs and Laboratory Findings: 13
Number of Premises Quarantined: 27
Number of Premises Depopulated: 11
Number of Premises under Surveillance: 107
Fowl Depopulated to Date: 5348
Premises Waiting to be Depopulated: 2
If you have any additional questions, please contact the USDA, APHIS,
Veterinary Services, Emergency Programs staff at 301-734-8073, 800-940-6524,
or EMOC@APHIS.USDA.GOV.
Please forward this information to other Federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.
