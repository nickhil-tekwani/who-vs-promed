Mosquito larvae [of a species] that carry the Zika virus have been trapped at Auckland Airport near the international baggage area.

The Ministry of Health says that last Thursday [3 Mar 2016] specialist mosquito staff contracted by Auckland Airport captured the exotic mosquito larvae in their trap inside the terminal.

The specimens were positively identified as _Aedes aegypti_, commonly called the yellow fever mosquito. The mosquito can transmit a number of [viruses causing] human diseases, including yellow fever, dengue fever, Ross River virus, and Zika viruses.

An intensive surveillance programme has now been initiated by Auckland Airport and Auckland Regional Public Health Services. A number of adult and larval traps have been set inside and outside the international terminal building alongside the airport's existing permanent surveillance programme. Potential mosquito breeding sites have been identified and treated or eliminated. There will also be increased surveillance over the next 30 days, covering 3 potential breeding cycles. To date, no more exotic mosquitoes have been trapped.

This is the 1st time _Aedes aegypti_ larvae have been found in traps in New Zealand. On 2 previous occasions, in 2007 and 2010, larvae were found on board incoming vessels from the South Pacific.

[The occurrence of larvae in traps indicates that the mosquitoes have been breeding in this area. The swift action being taken to detect these mosquitoes will be helpful in their elimination. - Mod.TY
