Researchers have decoded the gene map of a strain of extensively
drug-resistant tuberculosis and said on Tuesday [20 Nov 2007] their work
has identified mutations that may help develop better treatments. They also
sequenced the genome of another dangerous strain called multidrug-resistant
TB, as well as run-of-the-mill tuberculosis bugs, and found a few mutations
may explain how the mutant strains evade antibiotics.

"By looking at the genomes of different strains, we can learn how the
tuberculosis microbe outwits current drugs and how new drugs might be
designed," said Megan Murray of the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Harvard University.

The team at Broad, well known for its genome sequencing work, decided to
make its findings public immediately instead of waiting to publish the
study in a scientific journal. "It is important that genomic data be made
immediately available, particularly to researchers in areas most heavily
burdened by disease," said Broad's Eric Lander.

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a disease caused by a bacterium called
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. It infects up to 2 billion people, one-third
of the world's population, although most have latent, or inactive infections.

In 2005, 8.8 million people became infected with TB and 1.6 million died of
it. It takes months of careful antibiotic treatment to clear the infection.
The microbe can mutate and now an estimated 500 000 people globally have
multidrug-resistant, or MDR TB, according to the World Health Organization.
Standard antibiotics do not affect MDR TB, and patients need special drugs.

Extensively drug resistant TB, XDR TB for short, is virtually immune [that
is, resistant] to traditional antibiotics and kills up to 85 per cent of
those infected. The researchers studied an XDR TB strain that affected
hundreds of people in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. "Genetic
characterization of this strain is essential for developing tools to get
this epidemic under control," said Willem Sturm, of the University of
KwaZulu-Natal, who worked on the study.

The researchers also identified some genes that may be important to the
spread of TB. They said it was lucky the various strains are so similar
genetically. "These results also lay the groundwork for the development of
a rapid diagnostic test for TB," Murray said in a statement. "Such a test
would enable more rapid and accurate diagnoses, and help to prevent the
spread of TB -- especially the most virulent strains." It can take weeks to
tell if a person is infected with standard TB or a more dangerous MDR or
XDR strain.

The sequences are published on the internet at

[Time is precious for the public health and clinical management of
tuberculosis. The ability to make a microbiologic diagnosis of
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection by means of culture takes weeks of
incubation, because this organism is notoriously slow growing. Use of
liquid broth media shortens the time required for incubation, but still
requires 1-3 weeks of incubation, rather than the 3-8 weeks of incubation
required for solid media. If speciation is required (such as,
distinguishing _M. tuberculosis_ from _M. bovis_ or _M. bovis-BCG_),
further time-consuming in vitro cultivation is necessary. Drug resistance
is currently also determined by in vitro cultivation in the presence of
various antibiotics, which can take up to an additional 8 weeks.

Mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin,
pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, and fluoroquinolones have been
identified (see chapter 248 in the 6th edition of Principles and Practice
of Infectious Diseases. GL Mandell, JE Bennett, and R Dolin, editors).
Molecular tests can shorten the time required to detect drug resistance by
identifying chromosomal mutations associated with drug resistance, but none
has yet been approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The rapid detection of drug-resistant _M.
tuberculosis_ in clinical specimens by molecular techniques for 1st- and
2nd-line drugs could have tremendous clinical utility, allowing early
institution of appropriate drug therapy and reducing isolation time and
medical costs (<http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2007/10/t20071030a.html>). -
