An outbreak of tuberculosis is posing a growing threat to British cattle,
prompting a face-off between farmers and wildlife groups about the role of
badgers in the spread of the disease.
The farm ministry is due to unveil its strategy for tackling the disease
later this month with farmers demanding it include badger culls, a view
strongly rejected by wildlife conservation groups such as the Badger Trust.
The National Farmers Union (NFU) has backed badger culls as part of its
proposed strategy, saying, "evidence shows that there is a substantial risk
of badger-cattle disease transmission."
"We feel it is imperative that some sort of sustainable badger control is
implemented at the earliest opportunity," the NFU said in a policy document.
Jack Reedy of the Badger Trust disagreed. "It is a dangerous process to
reach for the shotgun before all the thinking has been done," he said,
calling for more research to be undertaken on how the disease has spread
across Britain.
A total of 20 423 cattle were slaughtered during the first 8 months of 2005
following positive herd tests, up nearly 37 percent from 14 940 in the
January to August 2004, according to data issued by Britain's farm ministry.
The outbreak spread rapidly as cattle farms restocked after the
foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. There were 8353 cattle slaughtered
following positive tests in 2000.
A report issued by the farm ministry's Science Advisory Council concluded
that "some carefully planned and executed culling may contribute to an
effective control strategy in some heavily infected and geographically
distinct and isolated areas, but only when coupled with other control
measures."
The council's report, which also noted that in many cases the scientific
evidence was "incomplete or equivocal," said it was clear that cattle
movements substantially increased the spread of the disease.
It backed measures including pre-movement testing of cattle, a strategy
supported by the Badger Trust but given only conditional backing by the NFU.
The NFU has said farmers would be willing to accept compulsory pre-movement
testing of cattle "only if action to deal with the disease in badgers is
taken simultaneously."
"The government would be imposing significant extra cost and inconvenience
on farmers in the core TB areas, for no worthwhile benefit. It would be
like baling out a leaking boat without doing anything to plug the hole,"
the NFU said.
Bovine TB can be caught by humans, although such infections are rare, with
about 40 cases each year in Britain, according to the government. [The
causal organism] is killed by the normal pasteurization of milk. Herds
[from which unpasteurized are sold] are subject to more regular TB tests
than other herds.

[There certainly seems to be a relationship between the TB-infected badger
and the spread to farmed livestock. Although studies involving the
transmission may not be complete, and should be continued, this situation
is rapidly expanding to the point where human cases are sure to occur. -
