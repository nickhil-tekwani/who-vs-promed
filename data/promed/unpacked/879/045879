Situation report on atypical pneumonia 13 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 13 Apr 2003, an additional 42 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 9 healthcare
workers (4 from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, 2 from Princess
Margaret Hospital, 2 from Prince of Wales Hospital, and one from Queen
Elizabeth Hospital) and 5 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 28 were
new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 223 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 8 were discharged today.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 122 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.
5 patients died in hospitals last night and this morning, bringing to 40
the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. A 40-year-old
male died in United Christian Hospital. 2 men, aged 41 and 52, a
45-year-old female and a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic
disease died in Princess Margaret Hospital.
The cumulative figures for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative number of reported cases/ total no. discharged cases/ no. deaths
(all reported cases have evidence of pneumonia)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 276/ 91/ 40
Patients, family members & visitors: 874 / 132 / 0
Total: 1150 / 223 / 40
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively
late stage of infection.

SARS Situation Update 13 Apr 2003
As of 13 April 2003, 81 SARS patients have been discharged. 58 SARS
patients remain hospitalised.
There were 4 additional SARS cases reported today, 3 of whom are linked to
the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) cluster comprising a hospital staff
member and 2 visitors. The last case is the resident of the Orange Valley
Nursing Home whose death as been reclassified as SARS. There were 2 deaths
yesterday, both linked to the SGH cluster comprising a visitor and an
inpatient.
Situation Update at SGH
So far, 60 persons are linked to the SGH cluster, comprising 30 probable
and 30 suspect SARS cases. They comprise 28 SGH staff, 12 inpatients, and
20 contacts.
4 staff from SGH Urology Outpatient Centre and a visitor who was at the SGH
Diagnostic Radiology Barium Investigation corridor were admitted to TTSH
over the weekend. These 2 areas are adjacent and connected to each other.
The visitor and a staff member are probable cases. The other 3 staff are
suspect cases.
Investigations showed that these cases can be traced back to the same
Chinese man in his 60s who started the cluster at Wards 57 and 58. 2 of
the urology staff are healthcare assistants in the Urology Outpatient
Centre. One of them, a new employee, started work on 1 Apr 2003 and became
symptomatic on 4 Apr 2003. The other was her supervisor and she became ill
on 7 Apr 2003. The other 2 urology staff are staff nurses. The visitor to
the Radiology Department was at the department when the 'index' case was
there for a procedure. He became ill on 9 Apr 2003.
Additional Precautionary Measures from 12 Apr 2003
Active contact tracing of 110 staff who work in the urology and the
radiology barium investigation corridor was started immediately and has
been completed. Contact tracing of patients who may have been exposed is in
progress. The Urology Outpatient Centre has been closed and will remain so
until 18 Apr 2003. As an added precaution, the Urology ward (Ward 55B), has
been isolated. 12 patients who were in the ward at the time have been
isolated in 12 rooms. A "No Visitors" rule has been enforced on the ward.
The Radiology Barium investigation corridor affected has also been closed.
In addition, the Radiology archives are closed.
Altogether 120 staff have been put on hospital-enforced quarantine. This
includes doctors from the Department of Urology. All inpatients will now
have their movement and contact history logged. All visitors to the
Hospital will be registered at each visit location.
Cluster around the resident of Orange Valley Nursing Home
A 90-year-old Chinese woman was discharged from Tan Tock Seng Hospital
(TTSH) to the Orange Valley Nursing Home on 23 Mar 2003. She had been
admitted to TTSH since 8 Mar 2003 for non-SARS related condition. When the
patient was in TTSH, she was in the same ward for a day as a patient who
was later diagnosed as a SARS case. On 25 Mar 2003, she became unwell, was
admitted to the Changi General Hospital (CGH) Ward 18, and died of
pneumonia on 30 Mar 2003.
The 24-year-old Fillipino nurse from the nursing home who had been
attending to this lady was admitted to CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and
transferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003 for probable SARS. A 57-year-old CGH
health attendant who had attended to the 90-year-old woman was admitted to
CGH on 10 Apr 2003 and transferred to TTSH on 11 Apr 2003 as a probable
SARS case. They are both currently in intensive care.
The deceased lady's daughter-in-law, who had visited her several times at
the nursing home and CGH, was admitted to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 for SARS. She
is also in intensive care. A relative of hers and her son, a secondary
student at Zhonghua Secondary, were also admitted to TTSH on 8 and 9 Apr
2003, respectively. They are both in stable condition.
In view of the epidemiological evidence that persons who had close contact
with the older woman have been diagnosed with SARS, the cause of her death
has been changed to SARS.
Situation Update at CGH
Besides the 57-year-old CGH healthcare attendant who was exposed to the
90-year-old Chinese lady when she was in CGH, there have been no other
cases reported in CGH. The hospital is now contacting 35 patients who could
possibly be exposed to the healthcare worker at Ward 18.
The 2 nurses who were exposed to a patient who has not been diagnosed as a
SARs patient then were transferred to TTSH on 5 and 6 Apr 2003. They are in
stable condition. The hospital has contacted 53 out of 59 patients who were
possibly exposed to them. These are patients warded at Ward 15 on 29 and 30
Mar 2003 and Ward 28 on 3 Apr 2003. They are well. CGH is still trying to
get in touch with 6 patients who remain uncontactable.
Update on Super Star Virgo
Cruise ship Superstar Virgo arrived in Singapore on 9 Apr 2003 at 1900 hrs
with 625 passengers and 1354 crew onboard. An Indian crewmember was
examined by the vessel doctor and found to have high fever. The MPA and
Port Health Office were later notified. ICA activated the ambulance to send
the unwell crewmember to TTSH at 2015 hrs. After examination, he was
admitted as a SARS suspect at TTSH.
Nurses were deployed to do visual screening of all passengers and crew who
disembarked from the vessel, and none were found to be unwell. All were
required to fill out Health Declaration Cards (HDC), which were collected
by the ICA officers.
The ship left Singapore for Port Klang on 9 Apr 2003 at 2330 hrs. The
vessel had 188 transit passengers from the previous sailing, 677 new
passengers, and 1353 crewmembers when it left.
In view of the SARS suspect case, it was decided that additional
precautions were to be taken when the ship returned to Singapore on 11 Apr
2003. The ship's doctor was to take the temperature of the 125 transit
passengers (63 of the 188 transit passengers had disembarked at Port Klang)
and declare their temperature readings before passengers were allowed to
disembark in Singapore. Star Cruises would also suspend crew shore leave
and disallow its crew to disembark.
Superstar Virgo returned to Singapore on 11 Apr 2003 at 1345 hrs. Based on
the temperature readings submitted by the ship's doctor, none of the 125
transit passengers had a fever. All the transit passengers and new
passengers were thus allowed to disembark and underwent visual screening by
nurses when they did so. No one was found to be unwell. All filled out
health declaration cards and these were submitted to ICA Officers. The
Indian crewmember, who was warded to TTSH as a SARS suspect case, is
expected to be discharged tomorrow, as he is no longer feverish.
Superstar Virgo is scheduled to depart Singapore at 2230 hrs on 13 Apr
2003. In preparation for its next sailing, the vessel left its anchorage
at 0700 hrs on 13 Apr 03 and arrived at the Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC)
at 0800 hrs. About 309 crew are to be repatriated, subject to temperature
checks and confirmation that they are well. Star Cruises has a medical
doctor onboard the vessel to conduct the necessary medical checks. Once
cleared, these crew members are to be taken straight to the airport for
their flight home. As of 1700 hrs, a total of 82 crew members have been
repatriated after they were confirmed to be well and fit for travel. The
repatriation of the crew members is expected to be complete at 0115 hrs, 14
Apr 2003.
Health screening for incoming air passengers
Between 4 PM 12 Apr 2003 and 4 PM 13 Apr 2003, 35 passengers from affected
areas required further screening by the nurses at the airport. None were
sent to TTSH for further assessment.
Below is the summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 81
Hospitalised: 58
Intensive care: 16
Deaths: 10 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)
Total: 151
Suspected: 87 (including 2 children)
Under home quarantine orders: 608

[A] Update: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 13 Apr 2003 4:00 PM
Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS
As of 13 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 283 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 13 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is
based on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 97 probable and 135 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 36 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 55 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 13 Apr 2003.
[B] Epidemiologic analysis of outbreak
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/prof_e.html>
[Information on epidemiologic analyses of the outbreak of SARS in Toronto
are available via the above given link. The data available as of today are
current through 12 Apr 2003 and can be accessed at:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030412_e.html>.
Interested readers are urged to check out the available data, as it
contains an excellent epidemic curve current through 2 Apr 2003 based on
date of onset of illness of cases, and type of contact transmission
(travellers, healthcare-related exposure, index case household contact,
healthcare-related exposure household contact).
According to the analyses to date, the conclusion is "there is currently no
evidence to suggest the presence community transmission of SARS in Canada.
All identified probable cases of SARS have been linked to either
travel-related exposures, or in healthcare and household settings."
Additional information of interest from this presentation is given below. -
Mod.MPP]
Since yesterday, no additional probable cases of SARS have been reported in
Canada. A total of 100 individuals who meet the probable case definition of
SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 13
deaths; 174 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect case of SARS
have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Ontario, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. Since SARS is a diagnosis
of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.
At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at
approximately 4.7 percent of probable or suspect cases (13 of 274 probable
or suspect cases). Most of the case fatalities occurred in patients with
underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70
years.

[Hong Kong reported 42 new cases in the 24 hours since the last
report. More detailed information on the epidemiology of these cases was
not provided, other than the data that 9 of the new cases were health care
workers, 5 were residents of Amoy Gardens (the residence associated with
unusual transmission), and the remaining 28 newly reported cases were in
known contacts of previously diagnosed SARS patients and new patients. The
number of new patients is not specified, nor is the definition of possible
exposure risks of these new patients given (e.g., are there other apartment
blocks that are showing up epidemiologically to have increased numbers of
cases? As a reminder, there is a posted list of apartment blocks where
SARS cases have been identified on the Hong Kong Department of Health
website <http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>). We look forward to seeing
more detailed epidemiologic analyses of the current transmission patterns
in Hong Kong.
We have included the report from Singapore in depth as a demonstration of
their intense effort towards disease control. From the reduced numbers of
new cases reported on a daily basis, it appears as though these efforts
have been reasonably successful.
For those who are interested in PowerPoint presentations summarizing the
epidemiologic points from investigations of the ongoing outbreak, we
suggest visiting the CDC website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ppt/domesticsars.ppt> for information on
the USA and <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ppt/globalsars.ppt> for
information on the global outbreak.
Global updates on SARS cases were not available at the WHO SARS website as
of 8:00 PM EDST (2:00 AM GMT +2 Geneva time). Similarly an update on the
status of SARS cases in the USA was not available on the CDC SARS website
as of 8:00 PM EDST. Additionally, the lay press reports did not contain
additional information that would add to this current posting or earlier
postings, other than a quote in the NY Times from one of the WHO team
leaders, Dr. James Maguire, while visiting hospitals in Beijing: "If there
had been hundreds of SARS patients, it would have been very difficult to
hide them," in response to press speculation that there was significant
underreporting in Beijing.
(<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/international/asia/13CHIN.html>) This
quote was given after the team visited Chaoyang Hospital, a large general
hospital that has seen some patients with the new ailment. We await more
official details on the results of the epidemiologic investigations in
China. - Mod.MPP]
[Please note that the number of prior postings on SARS is too numerous to
include in the references section below. The large size of each posting is
due to the extensive amount of new information being generated on a daily
basis. For those who have not been receiving these postings in emails and
are interested in following the history and evolution of SARS, we strongly
suggest you visit our website at: <http://www.promedmail.org> and follow
the update information in the designated SARS "box". In addition, the
postings before the name "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)" was
given to this observed clinical syndrome can be found by linking on the
last reference for each thread (e.g., Pneumonia - China (Guandong) (07),
and then linking to the given references. - Mod.MPP]
