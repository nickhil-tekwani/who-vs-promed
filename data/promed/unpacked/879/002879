----------------------------------------------------------------------
A collar canker and dieback disease of tea has recently emerged in Sri Lanka. This study aimed at identifying the causal organisms in different tea growing regions.

Dieback incidence in affected fields ranged from 50 to 85 per cent. The affected tea bushes had fewer and smaller leaves, yellowing of leaves and premature falling. Heavy flowering and fruiting commonly followed canopy thinning. Progressive dieback of branches resulted in bare bushes. Foliar symptoms were always associated with cankers having cracks and peeling of bark at the collar region. The exposed cambium and wood were discoloured, tan, brown, or black. Fibrous root formation just above the cankered area was also observed.

Symptomatic samples were collected from tea fields covering a range of rainfall and elevation during the period 2013-2014. 90 per cent of 96 isolates were fusaria. 4 selected isolates were identified as members of _Fusarium solani_ species complex (FSSC) based on morphological characters and analysis of 2 DNA loci (ITS and tef1).

Combined phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 4 isolates from tea belonged to FSSC clade 3. 2 isolates formed a sub-cluster within the Ambrosia _Fusarium_ Clade (AFC) [which] includes symbiont fusaria associated or not with [the] ambrosia beetle Tea shot-hole borer, _Euwallacea fornicatus_, a serious pest of tea in India and Sri Lanka.

This study established the existence of diversity among isolates. Artificial inoculation of isolates from each group resulted in prominent cankers in 50-80 per cent of nursery plants and 70-90 per cent of field plants, confirming pathogenicity.

The information will help to develop intervention strategies [to] reduce the economic impact of this disease of tea.

[The _Fusarium solani_ species complex (FSSC) includes at least 45 species classified into 3 major clades. Members of FSSC are best known as plant pathogens and saprotrophs, but some species can affect animals or humans.

_F. solani_ has a large host range which includes over 100 plant species from 87 genera. It causes wilt and rot diseases on a wide variety of herbaceous crops, as well as seedling wilts and dieback due to collar, stem and root cankers on woody hosts. The fungus is soil borne and may occur singly or in mixed infections with other pathogens. Disease development appears to be favoured by additional environmental stress factors.

Ambrosia beetles (Scolytinae) have been reported to spread tree diseases associated with different fungi, for example laurel wilt and thousand canker disease (such as, ProMED-mail posts 20170816.5255213, 20130103.1479446, and 20090205.0513). Both fungi and vectors can be spread with infected plant material and equipment. Disease management may include phytosanitary measures and quarantine exclusion zones to prevent spread to new areas.

An undiagnosed disease of tea was reported from Sri Lanka in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20140108.2157811), but it is not clear whether the report above relates to the same problem.
