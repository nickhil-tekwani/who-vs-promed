Lifting of all quarantine measures
See also: 12 June 1998
Follow-up report No. 1
Text of a fax received on 2 October 1998 from Dr J.M. Arnoldi, Deputy
Administrator,
Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC:
End of previous report period: 8 June 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[23, 87, dated 12 June 1998).
End of this report period: 2 October 1998.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: continued review and
investigations have failed to determine the source. The only sources that
could not be fully explored were traffic of people or undocumented movement
of birds.
B. Other epidemiological details: there is no evidence that the virus has
spread from the initial outbreak site. The intensive surveillance area
consisted of 52 premises containing 75 birds. These birds showed no illness
by 10 July 1998 and were released from quarantine. No further indications
of disease have been detected despite enhanced surveillance throughout
California.
Control measures during reporting period: stamping-out policy. Cleansing
and disinfection were completed on 10 June 1998. On 10 July, the outbreak
of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease was considered eradicated and
all quarantines released. The disease is notifiable and importation is
prohibited from infected countries.
