[The vesicular stomatitis virus has been shown to be transmitted by
the sand fly _Lutzomyia shannoni_ and the black fly _Simuliidae_. It
occurs year round in tropical areas but only seasonally (that is,
during the warmer months) in the northern part of the Western
Hemisphere, including countries such as the United States. Vesicular
stomatitis outbreaks can involve large numbers of horses and occur
over a fairly wide geographic area. So far, there is no indication of
major outbreak requiring a change of disease eradication tactics.
These small outbreaks occur with some regularity this time of year in
Central America -- see references. - Mod.PC
