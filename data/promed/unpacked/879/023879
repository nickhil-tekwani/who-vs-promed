Health officials say 4 school children have lab-confirmed cases of _E. coli_ and 2 others have _E. coli_ symptoms after attending a Whatcom County dairy festival last week [21-23 Apr 2015]. The Bellingham Herald reports (http://is.gd/sA3OLy) that more than 1000 elementary school pupils attended the Milk Makers Fest at the Lynden fairgrounds.

Greg Stern with the Whatcom County Health Department says 2 children have been hospitalized. Their conditions weren't known late Tue 28 Apr 2015. Those sickened by _E. coli_ bacteria can develop symptoms including severe stomach cramps, often-bloody diarrhea and vomiting. The health department is trying to determine a specific source of the illness. Stern says the main sources are contaminated food, contaminated water and contact with livestock.

The festival was sponsored by the Whatcom County Dairy Women. It introduced young students to farming and gave them a chance to pet farm animals, including small horses, sheep, rabbits, chickens and a calf. Officials encouraged parents of any child who visited the festival and develop diarrhea before 1 May 2015 to take the child to a doctor.

[Although the serotype of _E. coli_ is not stated, from this and similar postings regarding this recent outbreak it is certainly likely to be an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either O157 or one of the other serotypes. Petting zoos at state fairs are well recognized to be a venue for transmission of this potentially lethal toxin-producing pathogen.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer [2015]. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised."
