'Incurable' grape disease devastating vines
-------------------------------------------
French winemakers have demanded emergency funding to deal with an "incurable" grape disease, which they fear could become devastating and destroy the nation's vineyards.

The resurgence of the fungal disease esca was detected in mid-August [2014] on sauvignon vines in the Loire Valley. It has now spread elsewhere in France [and] infected 13 per cent of France's vines this year [2014], costing the industry more than Euro 1 billion [USD 1.27 billion].

Esca is transmitted by airborne spores and the only known treatment, sodium arsenite, is banned because it is carcinogenic. Once esca is detected, vines have to be ripped up and burned. Vineyard owners are facing catastrophic costs because their yields have fallen drastically and they have been forced to plant new vines.

French wine industry leaders are urging the European Union and national governments to declare esca an international emergency and provide funding to step up research to find a cure or a preventive treatment. Guy Vasseur, [France] Chambers of Agriculture, said more needed to be done. "We've got to work out how how to deal with this. It's potentially more serious than people seem to realise," he said.

Lifting the ban on sodium arsenite has been ruled out on health grounds. "The problem is that because sodium arsenite worked, there was no research for years on an alternative," Michel Badier, Loir-et-Cher chamber of agriculture, said.

[Esca is a complex disease syndrome involving several fungal species. It is considered a series of pathological events starting in the nursery and finishing when the plant is mature. Esca is an important problem for grape production worldwide and historic evidence suggests that it may have been around since the start of viticulture. With climate warming and similar to other fungal diseases, it has extended its range in the last decades.

Esca presents 2 different types of symptoms: one characterised by leaf alterations, including interveinal yellowing and necrosis, and brown spots on fruit ("measles"), the other by wood degradation and sudden death of the plant. Species reported so far to be associated with the different symptoms in different areas, include _Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum_, _P. aleophilum_, _Eutypa lata_, _Stereum hirsutum_, _Phellinus igniarius_, and _Sphaeropsis malorum_. It is suggested that the different pathogens play different roles in the process which starts with leaf discolourations and eventually leads to wood degradation.

Where chemical control with sodium arsenite is not permitted, eliminating infected plants and pruning affected plant parts have been suggested to control the disease. Removal of infected material from the vineyard is essential since masses of spores are produced by the fungi even at low temperatures. Spores can be airborne, but can also be spread with plant material, water, contaminated equipment and by mechanical means.
