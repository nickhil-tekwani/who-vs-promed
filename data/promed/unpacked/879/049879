Health authorities are trying to find out where the person most
probably infected with West Nile [WN] virus was bitten [by the vector
mosquito], since in [the person's] area no mosquitoes with the virus
have yet been found.

The information was provided today [26 Jul 2010] to Lusa by the
Subdirector for Health, Jose Robalo, who added that the Directorate
General for Health is awaiting the results of the last laboratory
tests from the National Institute of Health in order to "be certain"
that they are dealing with a case of infection by West Nile virus,
which is transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito. "The
probability is that it is [WN virus], but, to be certain, we need
confirmation of the last tests, which will take some time, perhaps
days or weeks," he explained, pointing out that the possibility of
other cases of [WN virus] infection "is very low."

[In Europe, especially in the Mediterranean region and in the south
of Eastern Europe, WN virus transmission has been occurring for
several years. Few humans are infected, but usually infected equine
animals are found. It is not any mystery that a human case occurs in
Portugal. - Mod.LJS]

[This is not the 1st instance of human WNV infections acquired in
Portugal. In 2004, there were 2 human WN virus infection cases
diagnosed in Ireland that were acquired in the tourist area of
Algarve in Portugal (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20040726.2044). The
26 Jul 2010 edition of Diario Digital
(<http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=62&id_news=461658>,
in Portuguese) indicated that the National Institute of Health (INSA)
reported that the current case of WN virus infection is an isolated
one because no WN virus infected mosquitoes have been detected by the
surveillance network. According to Jose Calheiros, of the INSA
administration, the case is laboratory diagnosed as a WN virus
infection, and so the agency classifies it as "very probable".
