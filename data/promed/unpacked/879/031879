After a 2-month emergency intervention in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) teams have begun handing over Ebola response activities to the Congolese Ministry of Health (MoH) and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Itipo, and Iboko.

"This Ebola outbreak is not yet officially over, but we are very pleased with the progress that has been made," said Henry Gray, MSF emergency coordinator in Equateur Province. "Given the low volume of cases and the increasing expertise of local staff, the Ministry of Health is well placed to finish the work which we started together."

Throughout the course of the outbreak, officially declared on 8 May 2018, Congolese MoH teams supported by MSF in Bikoro, Itipo, Mbandaka, and Iboko provided care to 38 confirmed patients, 24 of whom survived and returned to their homes. Sadly, 14 died. Over 120 other patients who presented with symptoms consistent with Ebola were isolated and tested before being allowed to return home after testing negative for the virus.

The handover process began with the closure of MSF's Ebola Transit Center at the Itipo General Reference Hospital on 20 Jun 2018. All new suspected patients are now cared for at the nearby Ebola treatment center managed by the organization ALIMA, which is also taking care of outreach and surveillance activities in the affected areas and will assist the MoH in running a clinic for Ebola survivors. [Dakar/Paris, 18 Jun 2018. The medical humanitarian organization ALIMA (The Alliance for International Medical Action) will open an Ebola treatment center equipped, for the 1st time, with bio-secure emergency care units, in Itipo in the Equateur Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). [See ProMED-mail Ebola update (35): Congo DR, cases, response, WHO 20180614.5855415 for description of ALIMA. - Mod.LK]

MSF subsequently handed over the Ebola treatment center at Bikoro's General Reference Hospital on 25 Jun 2018 to MoH staff, who continue to isolate and test those suspected of being infected by the Ebola virus. All outreach, surveillance, health promotion, disinfection, and safe burial activities in Bikoro have also been handed over to the MoH and other NGOs.

An MSF team is currently constructing a small isolation unit at the Mbandaka General Reference Hospital. Once completed, any new suspect patient will be isolated and tested for the virus in this new facility. The 40 bed Ebola treatment center constructed by MSF on the outskirts of Mbandaka will be disinfected and dismantled by early July 2018.

On 15 Jul 2018, the Iboko General Reference Hospital's Ebola treatment center will be the last MSF-supported structure to be handed over to the MoH. In the meantime, MSF will continue surveillance and outreach activities and support the hospital with pediatric care and infection prevention and control.

Finally, given that no new cases of Ebola have been reported since 6 Jun 2018, MSF teams, alongside the World Health Organization (WHO), have completed the "ring vaccination" of all contacts of confirmed Ebola patients, as well as the contacts of their contacts with the investigational Ebola vaccine rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP. Likewise, MSF's vaccination of frontline workers in Bikoro and Iboko health zones was completed on 23 Jun 2018. If there are no new confirmed cases of Ebola, the 21-day follow-up of the last frontline workers vaccinated by MSF -- and MSF's vaccination activities in Equateur Province -- will be completed on 14 Jul 2018.

We're encouraged that there has been a massive international response to this Ebola outbreak, but Congolese people are much more likely to be affected by malaria, measles, cholera, or violence-related displacement than Ebola. In addition to the medical activities that MSF already runs alongside the Ministry of Health around DRC, MSF is now responding to a new outbreak of cholera in Mbuji Maji (Eastern Kasai Province) and assessing how to best respond to the consequences of recent violence in Tshikula (Central Kasai province).

Should there be no more confirmed cases of Ebola, the outbreak will be officially declared over by the Congolese health authorities on 22 Jul 2018. This date is 42 days (twice Ebola's maximum incubation period) and one day after a safe burial was held for the last confirmed patient who died at the Ebola treatment center in Bikoro.

In total, 3199 people were vaccinated against Ebola with the investigational Ebola vaccine rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP under WHO's Expanded Access Framework by teams from MSF, WHO, and the Congolese Ministry of Health. [According to the MoH, 3330 people have been vaccinated, including 893 in Mbandaka, 779 in Bikoro, 1530 in Iboko, 107 in Ingende, and 21 in Kinshasa. - Mod LK]. MSF teams alone vaccinated some 1673 people in the Bikoro and Itipo areas, including the contacts of confirmed Ebola patients and their contacts and front line workers (health workers, burial workers, traditional healers, and motorbike taxi drivers) considered to be most at risk of contracting the virus.

[This is a hopeful sign that the experts on the ground in DRC are feeling confident the outbreak is over, and they are free to move on to fight other fires taking place elsewhere in the world. The healthcare workers in the DRC should have picked up expertise from MSF and other organizations that fought the outbreak and are now more prepared to fight whatever infectious disease challenge comes next. There is some question as to what the etiologic agent of the cases being observed in Lusambo is; one hopes it is not Ebola virus; see next post. - Mod.LK]

[2] Lusambo: suspected deaths, diarrhea, RFI

Three people died in Lusambo, the capital of Sankuru province, following diarrhea of unknown origin that has been rampant since the beginning of last week in this city, the ACP [Congolese Press Agency] said Sat [30 Jun 2018], close to the WHO, Mbujimayi sub-office.

According to this source, the local population lives in general panic as the clinical signs of this diarrhea are similar to Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

Samples of this bloody and deadly diarrhea, it has been reported, are already being sent to the National Institute for Biochemical Research, INRB, in Kinshasa for analysis. Sankuru province shares borders with the former province of Equateur, where the Ebola epidemic had recently erupted.

[Sankuru province is in Central DRC. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankuru. The major geographical features are the Sankuru River, Lomami River, Lubefu River and Lukenie River. There are typically 3 natural environments in the province: forest, savanna and bush. There are numerous mountains, valleys, and striking natural obstacles. This province has some of the richest Congolese fauna, with its various species of animals including lions, zebras, antelope, kudu, hippopotami, various species of tropical snakes, crocodiles, turtles, various species of monkeys, an array of fish species, various birds, and chimpanzees. Sankuru has very rich biodiversity.

Sankuru is mainly an agricultural region. Staple crops are rice, banana, pineapple, potatoes, sugar cane, sorghum and various local agricultural produce. Sankuru's industry is poor and limited to traditional wood production, fishing and construction brick for local consumption. The lack of developed roads, electricity and other transportation infrastructure are a challenge to development.

Sankuru has diamond and cassiterite as well as various other mineral resources. To an important extent, the province depends on imports of primary supplies from large Congolese cities such as Kinshasa, Mbuji Mayi, Lubumbashi and Kindu. - Rapp.MM]
