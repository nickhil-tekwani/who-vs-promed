I believe that Arctic explorers in desperate times who were reduced to
eating their sled dogs acquired trichinosis.

[There is a varied and fat list of Arctic fauna that are infected with
_Trichinella_. So one need not wait until one is driven to eating one's dogs
to become infected. For example, walruses are commonly infected. There was
of course the exploration party that struggled heroically back to one of the
islands off the Russian coast and then died as a result of eating a polar
bear. The bodies of the explorers and the remains of their bear were
discovered in due course and the source of their lethal infections plainly
seen in the tissue sections from the bear. - Mod.MHJ

For general information we export horse meat from Australia (a country that
has no incidence of _Trichinella_ [infection) but due to an old fashioned
EU requirement we have to test all horse meat produced. The testing
procedure uses acid to denature the meat and allow the inspection of the
filtered remains under a microscope for the _Trichinella_ worm. The point
to all this is the belief that some horse meat is eaten raw or only lightly
cooked such that the _Trichinella_ are not killed.
I [would be interested if any European readers could confirm [whether
this practice (of eating raw or under cooked horse meat) is continued.
Given the lack of occurrence the testing seems somewhat bureaucratic to us
Australians and comes across as a non-tariff trade barrier hidden in
veterinarian and human health requirements. [Many countries ask for
requirements that do not enhance the quality or safety of a product but do
significantly add to the cost of production.
I am also interested in the morbid history of _Trichinella_ as [I
understand that the consumption of carnivores (dogs and polar bears etc.)
would mean certain cultures would [have far greater risk. Australians as a
rule tend to overcook our meat, but of course the Japanese eat raw meat
products. Europeans and Eskimos eat fermented (cured) meat products so I
assume this would not disable _Trichinella_.
This is a fascinating subject not just from a parasitological point of view
but from a cultural perspective so I hope some readers can share some
information.

[How horses acquire _Trichinella_ is a matter of some discussion though it is
frequently assumed that they do it through scavenging small carcasses
purposefully or by accident in ground feed. Non-traditional routes of
infection have been proposed but, I think, never demonstrated. - Mod.MHJ
