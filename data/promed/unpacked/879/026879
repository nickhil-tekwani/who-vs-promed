[The following description of a hitherto undiagnosed outbreak in
Israel, by Dr Nadav Galon, the chief veterinarian of "Hachaklait" --
a country-wide Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services in
Israel -- derived from the website of the Israel Cattle Breeders
Association, includes accessible pictures of clinical cases. Dr
Galon's clinical description and the pictures might be helpful for
those engaged in veterinary surveillance activities in other
countries in the eastern Mediterranean and northeast African realms. - Mod.AS]

An outbreak along the Jordan valley suspected as bluetongue and
bovine ephemeral fever
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1st cases of the disease were seen about 2 weeks ago in several dairy
and beef cattle farms in the valleys of Jordan and Beit-Shean. About
10 days ago, the outbreak took wide dimensions in the above areas.
[On Thu, 14 Sep 2006], the disease is being reported from the
northern tip of the Dead Sea up to the Lebanese border near the
village Rajar in dozens of dairy and beef herds, almost all of them
along the Jordan river and the shores of Lake Kinneret (Lake
Tiberias, Sea of Galilee), with several extensions east and west. The
number of cases per farm varies from several to hundreds.
The main and most prominent clinical signs were:
- A sharp drop in milk production, anorexia, mild temperature
elevation, lameness with or without reddening of the skin above the hooves.
- Reddened eyes.
- Salivation and nasal discharge, redness and scaling of the snout and mouth.
- Tongue swelling and some cyanosis.
The duration of the disease is 7 to 10 days, with very low mortality.
The diagnosis has been undertaken by the Kimron Veterinary Institute,
assisted by the reference laboratory in the UK.
The treatment [of sick animals] is supportive and symptomatic.
In view of its rapid and extensive evolution, the disease is likely
to be spread by midges; spraying the cattle and surroundings with
certified insecticides and treatment of insect breeding sites might
reduce the spread rate.
The potential diseases under investigation are bluetongue, bovine
ephemeral fever or other viral fevers. These potential disease agents
are not zoonotic and do not pose risk to human health.
The main suspect, bluetongue disease, has long been known to affect
sheep in Israel. No extensive outbreak of this disease has been
reported in cattle in Israel since the early 1950's. Surveys
throughout the years have shown that bovines are exposed and infected
with the 5 locally identified bluetongue serotypes, but generally
without any disease symptoms. During the current outbreak, no cases
in sheep have been reported.
The affected farms have been put under quarantine.
"Hachaklait" practitioners are engaged daily in clinical
investigations; daily reports are received, and updates are
disseminated on a daily basis to them. We hope for an early diagnosis
and termination of the outbreak.
A link to several pictures of affected cattle is enclosed.

[There are unofficial rumors from reliable sources on similar cases
in cattle along the eastern side of the Jordan, within the Kingdom of
Jordan. Information on such phenomena from animal-health agencies and
practitioners in other countries in the region will be appreciated.
Readers are referred to Peter Roeder's observations on 1996 outbreaks
of erosive stomatitis and coronitis in Kenyan Gerenuk (__Litocranius
walleri_, Waller's gazelle) and erosive stomatitis in South African
cattle, suspected to be associated with EHD (Epizootic Hemorrhagic
Disease -- see ProMED archive 19980222.0347). See also the report by
Truuske Gerdes from the Onderstepoort laboratory in South Africa with
detailed description of the cattle affected in 1996, presenting with
lacrimation, salivation, stomatitis, coronitis, nose and teat
sloughs, hemorrhagic diarrhea and a drop in milk production (ProMED
archive 19980227.0379). She reported about 13 bluetongue virus
isolates, serotypes 2,3,6 and 8 from the affected cattle, as well as
("yet untyped") EHD virus (isolated from a spleen sample).
Results from the investigating laboratories, in Israel and at
Pirbright, UK, are anticipated with great interest.
The clinical and epidemiological data, included in our previous post
on this issue, were also based upon "Hachaklait" observations, to
whom -- and particularly to Dr Galon -- we extend sincere gratitude. - Mod.AS]
