Congenital and neonatal varicella in Australia
The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) is conducting a study to
estimate the incidence and severity of congenital and neonatal varicella
and the potential benefits of vaccinating susceptible women before they
become pregnant (1). Varicella affects 2% of babies born to mothers who
develop chickenpox at 13 to 20 weeks gestation, with skin scars, limb
defects, growth retardation, chorioretinitis, and neurological
abnormalities (2). Fetuses exposed to varicella are also at risk of
spontaneous abortion, premature labour, and the development of herpes
zoster in infancy (3). Fetuses exposed to varicella in the four weeks
before birth may develop varicella neonatally, and neonates may also
acquire the infection. Neonatal varicella has a high mortality (4),
associated with haemorrhagic rash and visceral infection.
Until 1995, when the APSU began its study only three reports of varicella
embryopathy had been published in Australia (5), and the incidence of
neonatal and congenital infections was unknown. Two cases of congenital
and 15 of neonatal varicella were reported in the first 10 months of the
study (March to December 1995). One of the congenital cases had
chorioretinitis, and the other was healthy at birth but developed herpes
zoster at 5 months of age (6). A further two congenital and 16 confirmed
neonatal infections were reported in 1996 (1). One of the congenital cases
arose after maternal infection at 12 weeks gestation. The child had chest
and leg scars, was blind as a result of bilateral chorioretinopathy and
optic nerve hypoplasia, and went on to develop herpes zoster at 10 weeks of
age. The second case was exposed at 18 weeks gestation, was healthy at
birth, and developed herpes zoster on an arm and the trunk at 16 weeks.

[Compared to veterinary medicine, human medicine displays a lack of known
teratogenic infections and associated congenital problems. We vets have it
easy as we routinely know when livestock are served and got pregnant,
usually in large numbers, sometimes similtaneously, housed/grazed together
(thereby sharing incidental infections quite apart from experimental
exposures), and with detailed genetic knowledge of the dams and sire(s).
For those interested in such human problems the methodology behind this and
related human studies given in the same surveillance report are worth
reading. There must be more conditions like this in human medicine,
waiting to be described. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-AHEAD moderator (pro
