The children's emergency hospital in Omdurman has received, within the past 2 weeks, 53 cases of meningitis, amid the severe heat wave that swept central Sudan. Residents in parts of Khartoum are not receiving drinking water, and went out to protest against the supply's disruption.

A hospital official reported the number of meningitis cases on Thursday [28 May 2015].

[The above news report says there is an outbreak of meningitis, involving 53 cases, in the city of Omdurman. However, we are not told the microbial causes. Omdurman, with a population of 2 395 159 (2008), is the largest city in Khartoum State and in Sudan, on the western banks of the River Nile, opposite the capital city, Khartoum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omdurman).

Sudan is just north of the African meningitis belt that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. The African meningitis belt is plagued by epidemics of bacterial meningitis during the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to June). Large epidemics usually take place in irregular cycles every 5-12 years. During epidemics, the rate can be as high as 1000 cases per 100 000 population (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/meningococcal-disease). Serogroup A meningococcus is the main cause of meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt and accounts for an estimated 80-85 percent of all cases. A map showing the countries in the African meningitis belt can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf.

A massive vaccination program against meningococcal serogroup A meningitis that targeted 16.9 million children and young adults aged 1-29 years was launched in Sudan, including Khartoum in 2012 (http://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/meningitisa-2012sudan.html). The vaccine used was likely the conjugated serogroup A "MenAfriVac" vaccine that is used in the WHO mass meningococcal vaccination program of all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt. This program was initiated in 2010 (http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/events/menafrivac_faqs/en/index2.html). Burkina Faso became the 1st African country to introduce MenAfriVac nationwide and immunized more than 11 million people from 6-15 Dec 2010 (http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).

Because immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is serogroup-specific, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups, MenAfriVac will protect only against disease caused by the serogroup A meningococcus. Its use in the African meningitis belt has been associated with subsequent outbreaks in which serogroup A has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups, such as C and W135. (See ProMED-mail posts Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (03): serogroup C, fatal, WHO, update Archive Number: 20150517.3368315 and Meningitis, meningococcal - France ex African Meningitis Belt Archive Number: 20120526.1145958.)

A large epidemic (February-August 1988) of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis occurred in Khartoum, with a total of 10 099 cases, corresponding to an annual incidence of 1679 per 100 000, but was thought to be related to the Mecca meningitis outbreak in August 1987 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2356440). The 1st reported international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987 was caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2569063).

The microbial causes of bacterial meningitis have also been studied during non-epidemic years in Khartoum. During the period April 1985 to November 1986 (18 months), 44 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis in Khartoum, 25 of whom had meningitis due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b; 8, _Neisseria meningitidis_; 7, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_; 3, Enterobacteriaceae; and 1, mixed infection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699486).

Identifying the specific microbial causes of the current meningitis outbreak in Khartoum is important, because the prior serogroup A meningococcal vaccination program in Khartoum in 2012 may have resulted in replacement of serogroup A with other meningococcal serogroups or the current outbreak may actually be due to non-meningococcal bacterial species or even non-bacterial etiologies. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
