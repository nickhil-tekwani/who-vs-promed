[1] Cholera - Zambia (Kitwe)

Kitwe District has recorded its 1st 2 cases of cholera involving children below the age of 2. Despite the early preparations by Kitwe mayor Christopher Kang'ombe and district commissioner Binwell Mpundu, the epidemic has hit the mining town breaking out from 2 rural compounds, Zambia and Buchi. Binwell Mpundu said the 2 cases of cholera are being treated at Kitwe Teaching Hospital.

"I wish to confirm that here in Kitwe, we have recorded so far 2 cases of cholera, very little children that have tested positive for cholera. There is need for the public to take precaution now that we are also affected," Mpundu stated. He added that with the cases of cholera now recorded in the district, the sale of any edible foods on the market has since been banned until such a time the situation will normalise.

Mpundu has, however, advised the public not to panic, as the 2 cases recorded are being treated and measures have been put in place to avoid further outbreaks. "However, I wish to inform the public not to panic as the 2 victims who are children are being attended to by health personnel, but there is need to take precautions to avoid further outbreaks," said Mpundu.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Lusaka)

Zambia has declared a curfew in a poor Lusaka township badly affected by a cholera outbreak that has killed 58 people across the country since September 2017, the government said on Sun 7 Jan 2018.

The curfew in Kanyama, a densely populated slum of iron-roofed shacks and winding dirt tracks, begins on Sun 7 Jan 2018, and will run from between 1800 and 0600, health minister Chitalu Chilufya told reporters. The township has a population of 370 000 people. Street vending and public gatherings have been banned in Lusaka to prevent the spread of cholera, but the residents of Kanyama have been defying this order in the evenings after soldiers deployed to clean the streets have left.

"Kanyama has recorded the highest number of fatalities because of the poor compliance with interventions that have been put in place," Chilufya said. The cholera outbreak was initially linked to contaminated water from shallow wells, but investigations indicated that contaminated food was the main culprit.

Zambia last week shut 3 of South African retailer Shoprite's Hungry Lion fast food restaurants after their food tested positive for the bacterium that causes cholera. Hungry Lion said on Sat 6 Jan 2018 that the restaurants had been closed for disinfection, and it hoped that the government would soon allow them to reopen.

President Edgar Lungu on 30 Dec 2017 directed the military to help to fight the spread of the waterborne disease.

Management at Zambia's biggest public university on Fri 5 Jan 2018 announced the closure of the institution following a cholera outbreak. Students at the University of Zambia (UNZA), which is in Lusaka, the country's capital, who have already reported for commencement of classes have since been directed to return back to their homes.

Sitali Wamundila, the university's registrar, said management decided not to reopen the institution following a cholera outbreak, which has mainly affected the country's capital and following a statement by the health ministry postponing the reopening of all schools in the country. Free transport will be provided for students without means to return back to their homes, Wamundila said in a statement.

The Zambian Ministry of Health said 100 new cases of cholera have been recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 2248, according to a statement. Minister of health Chitalu Chilufya said 3 more fast food outlets have been closed in Lusaka after samples from their premises tested positive for the cholera bacterium.

No vendors will be allowed back on the streets after the containment of the cholera outbreak, the statement said, adding that 2 designated sites have been identified from where the traders will be operating.

The Mombasa health department has confirmed 2 deaths as a result of cholera. The 2 were among 4 people hospitalised with symptoms. Two from Maka area in Likoni tested positive for the bacterial infection, while the other 2, from Vijiweni village, tested negative.

County communications director Richard Chacha issued the statement from chief health officer Hadija Shikely. He said 17 cases had been reported but that the county had taken steps including closing all unlicensed food outlets. "The county will close all unlicensed food joints," he told The Star at his office on Fri 5 Jan 2018.

So far, Chacha said, notices have been distributed on the closure of such businesses to prevent the spread of the disease. Residents were also asked to maintain high standards of cleanliness. "There are health barazas aimed at sensitizing people on how to protect themselves," Chacha added. The disease was contained in 2017 after 2 people died, while 25 of 80 reported cases were found to be positive.

[5] Cholera - Malawi
Date: Wed 3 Jan 2018

Malawi is battling a cholera outbreak that began at the start of the rainy season in November [2017]. The disease has killed 4 people, and more than 150 others are hospitalized. The disease -- an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water -- affects children and adults and can kill within hours if left untreated.

The hardest-hit districts are Nkhatabay and Karonga, on the shores of Lake Malawi. "As of today [3 Jan 2018], we have 137 cases, which we have registered from Karonga only," said Joshua Malango, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health. "And unlike Karonga, in Nkhatabay we have 16 cases as of today [3 Jan 2018], with no deaths. While in Karonga we had 3 deaths." The Kasungu and Dowa districts have registered one case each, while on [Tue 2 Jan 2018], medical workers confirmed 2 cases in the capital, Lilongwe.

The outbreak is believed to have been triggered by poor hygiene among residents, especially in Karonga.

According to Karonga-based journalist Special Absalom, more than 70 per cent of people there use untreated water. "People who are along the lakeshore area use water directly from the lake, while others who are close to the rivers, they are using water from the rivers, and some are even using wells," Absalom said.

In neighboring Zambia, the disease has killed about 40 people in the capital, Lusaka, and affected more than 1500 others since September [2017]. However, Malawians bordering Zambia should not panic over the Lusaka outbreak, Malango says. "We are not that close with Lusaka. But we are not taking it lightly. We are putting measures to ensure that people traveling in and out of the country must have proper surveillance; we have checked them to ensure that Malawians are safe," he said.

Meanwhile, Malawi's government has embarked on a nationwide campaign to remind people to wash their hands with soap, especially after using the toilet and before eating any food. More importantly, Malango says, the government is distributing chlorine and other chemicals to treat drinking water.

Malawi suffered its worst cholera outbreak in 2009, when 82 people died and more than 3000 people were infected across the country.

[6] Diarrhea - India (Kerala State)
Date: Fri 5 Jan 2018 00:43 IST

An outbreak of acute diarrhoeal disease (ADD) in coastal wards 10 and 11 of Athiyannur block in Karumkulam gram panchayat [village council] has prompted the health department to launch immediate control measures to prevent more people from falling ill.

A total of 35 people reported sick in the locality for the past 2 days. Most of the cases have been treated as outpatients, while 5 people have been admitted to the Pulluvila community health centre (CHC). All those admitted are stable and recovering, health officials said.

With reports of more people seeking treatment for moderate diarrhoeal disease and vomiting at the Pulluvila CHC, local private hospitals, and the general hospital here [in Thiruvananthapuram], a team of doctors visited the locality and Pulluvila CHC on [Thu 4 Jan 2018] to assess the situation. Senior health officials said that health workers had been told to be on alert as cholera had been reported from the area in 2013.

However, after taking a detailed history of food and water intake of the patients and going by the available evidence, the current outbreak seemed to be an episode of ADD, probably due to some contamination in water supply in the area, they said.

Apart from the KWA [Kerala Water Authority] water supply, the locality also has the panchayat's [village council] water supply scheme. Many households also use water from their own borewells for drinking. The team has collected water and stool samples for testing.

The public should take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of any waterborne diseases, a statement issued by the health department said. Only boiled and cooled water should be used for drinking, and food should be cooked hygienically and kept well covered. People have been advised to avoid consuming stale food and to make sure that fruits and vegetables are scrubbed and washed well using drinking water before consumption. Sanitation and frequent handwashing were of utmost importance.

Meanwhile, health minister KK Shylaja has asked the health department to ensure that all treatment facilities, including an ORS (oral rehydration salts) counter, were available at the Pulluvila CHC. She has also ordered an inquiry into reports that unsafe drinking water was being supplied in the area from Karichal and Kumily pump houses. Safe drinking water will be supplied in tankers in the locality, if necessary, a statement issued by the minister said.
