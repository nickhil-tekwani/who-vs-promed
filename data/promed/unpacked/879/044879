From: Dr. Mike McCarthy <smo.oms@caucasus.net>

I am currently in charge of a large expatriate clinic in Tbilisi. (OMS
Georgia Ltd. / Liberty Occupational Health). I have received a copy of a
transcript to which I may be able to shed some light. We have limited lab
resources but they are essentially accurate.
Gastroenteritis is, as you will agree, probably the single most common
presenting condition in these regions.
I have recently been informed by some of my patients that there is
presently a mild panic propagating through the expatriate community with
regard to Amoebiasis and 'eventual and inevitable liver abscess formation
and a requirement for a partial hepatectomy.'
As you are aware this is not the case as the causative agent is quite
susceptible to conservative management even in the unlikely event of
advanced and unattended cases with early and moderate hepatic involvement.
All expatriates are and have always been advised to drink bottled or boiled
water as with any foreign second / third world country (or even when on
holiday in Spain or the Canary Islands, etc) and this should be reiterated
frequently.
The local Georgian medical care system has its own protocols and procedures
for the treatment of disease and injury, and the reporting and indeed
management of same should not bear upon the western management of what is
essentially a relatively innocuous infectious illness.
We have attended 500 patients in the last eight weeks and the diagnosis of
_Entamoeba histolytica_ / _Naegleria_ / _Acanthamoeba_ has yet to be made.
Liver function tests and ultrasound have been performed on more protracted
enteritis patients all within normal limits thus far.
