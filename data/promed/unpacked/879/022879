Botulism type E associated with eating a beached whale - western Alaska,
July 2002
------------------------------------------------------
Botulism is a neuroparalytic illness caused by toxins produced by the
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, an obligate anaerobe found commonly in
the environment. Intoxication with toxin type E is associated exclusively
with eating animal foods of marine (salt or fresh water) origin. People who
eat raw or fermented marine fish and mammals are at high risk for botulism
from type E toxin.
On 17 Jul 2002, the Alaska Division of Public Health investigated a cluster
of suspected botulism cases among residents of a fishing village in Alaska.
The outbreak investigation linked disease to eating raw muktuk (skin and a
pink blubber layer) from a beached whale (see publication for figure). To
avoid delays in treatment, health care providers evaluating patients
suspected of having botulism should base treatment decisions on clinical
findings. Public health authorities should be notified immediately about
any suspected botulism case.
From 13 to 15 Jul 2002, residents of a western Alaska village on the
Bering Sea shore shared a meal consisting of muktuk harvested from a
beached adult beluga whale found near their village. The villagers
estimated that the whale had been dead for at least several weeks. They cut
the whale fluke (tail) into pieces and stored them in zipper-sealed plastic
bags in a refrigerator until they were eaten one or 2 days later. On 17 Jul
2002, after a physician from western Alaska reported 3 suspected cases of
botulism among patients who had eaten the muktuk, the Alaska Section of
Epidemiology began an investigation.
A case of foodborne botulism was defined as illness in a person who had
eaten the muktuk and subsequently had symmetric descending flaccid
paralysis of motor and autonomic nerves. Persons who ate muktuk were
interviewed and examined, and their hospital records were reviewed. Serum,
stool, and gastric contents from patients and leftover blubber were tested
for botulinum toxin.
Eight out of 14 people identified who ate the muktuk had an illness that
met the case definition. 5 of the 8 patients were female; the median age
was 73 years (range: 13 to 83 years). Symptom onset after ingestion of
muktuk occurred within 36 hours in all patients. 5 patients were admitted
to hospital, 4 received antitoxin, and 2 required mechanical ventilation. 3
stool, 3 gastric fluid, and 7 serum samples from the 8 patients and 7
samples of muktuk were tested for botulinum toxin at the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Botulism Surveillance and
Reference Laboratory. The diagnostic laboratory received all laboratory
specimens on 26 Jul 2002, and results were reported on 1 Aug 2002. Type E
toxin was detected in stool from one patient. All 7 samples of muktuk were
positive for type E botulinum toxin.

Editorial Note:
This report summarizes a foodborne outbreak of botulism in a western Alaska
village that resulted from residents eating muktuk contaminated with type E
botulinum toxin. From 1973 to 1998, a total of 814 cases and an annual
median of 24 cases (range: 14-94 cases) of foodborne botulism were reported
to CDC (1); 236 (29 per cent) of these cases occurred in Alaska (CDC,
unpublished data, 2003). Although botulism is a rare disease, its
presentation is distinctive. Because of the epidemic potential of foodborne
botulism, every case should be reported and investigated immediately.
All patients suspected of having foodborne botulism should be placed in an
intensive care setting, monitored regularly for respiratory function
deterioration, and provided mechanical ventilation if necessary. Prompt
administration of polyvalent equine-source antitoxin can decrease the
progression of paralysis and severity of illness but will not reverse
existing paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is available in the United States
only through the public health system. Therefore, rapid clinical diagnosis,
notification of public health authorities, and timely administration of
antitoxin are imperative (2). Laboratory confirmation of botulinum
intoxication cannot be relied on in making treatment decisions because the
standard test, the mouse bioassay, requires about 4 days for final results
(2). In addition, the sensitivity of laboratory testing of clinical samples
is low (3,4). In this outbreak, typed toxin was detected in only 8 per cent
of samples from patients who had definitive exposure to contaminated muktuk.
The probable mode of contamination of the whale in this outbreak was either
growth and toxin secretion by _C. botulinum_ present in the intestinal
tract of the whale or traumatic introduction of _C. botulinum_ spores into
the beached whale tissue from contact with sand, rocks, and driftwood, and
subsequent germination and toxin production. _C. botulinum_ type E has been
found in Alaska coastline soil (5), and outbreaks of botulism associated
with eating beached marine mammals are documented (Alaska Section of
Epidemiology, unpublished data, 2003). A previous report on the
accumulation of _C. botulinum_ toxins in the North Sea coastal food chain
associated with beached whales suggested the disposal of the carcasses as a
preventive measure (6). However, because of the impracticality of frequent
scanning of the vast Alaska shoreline and high costs associated with
disposal, the US Fish and Wildlife Service does not remove beached mammal
carcasses regularly. Because of the epidemic potential of foodborne
botulism and the status of botulinum toxins as a category A agent of
terrorism, health care providers should be familiar with the presentation
of botulism.
Treatment is based on clinical diagnosis, and rapid recognition and
reporting of cases are the cornerstones of successful public health
interventions to prevent additional illnesses. People should avoid eating
beached marine mammal carcasses and boil raw or fermented Alaska native
dishes >10 minutes before eating to inactivate botulinum toxin. Additional
