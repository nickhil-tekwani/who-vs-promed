[1] Cholera - South Sudan (Northern Liech State)

Authorities in Northern Liech State have declared an outbreak of cholera after confirming 2 cases of the disease in Rubkona County. The State Minister of Health, Nura Luk Gatluak, says 4 suspected cases have been reported in Bentiu since August [2016]. Up to 2 have been confirmed to be cholera. Miss Nura told Eye Radio that all the cases have been treated and discharged, but she warns that the outbreak is the biggest threat to the health system in the state.

Cholera is spread through drinking or eating contaminated water or food. It can be prevented through proper hygiene and sanitation.

This year [2016], cases of the disease in South Sudan were first reported in Juba in May and later spread to other areas. Health partners say more than 30 people have been killed in the epidemic.

Kapiri Mposhi District has recorded 27 cases of cholera and 2 people have since died from the bacterial infection. Kapiri Mposhi District Commissioner, Peter Mwiinde told ZANIS that cholera broke out in the district in the past week.

Mr Mwiinde said all the cholera cases recorded in the district have been emanating from Lukanga fishing camp in the district. He said the 2 fatalities were recorded at Kapiri Mposhi Urban Clinic and Waya Rural Health Centre in Lukanga Swamps over the weekend respectively. "We have seen 4 cases at Urban Clinic and 23 at Waya Clinic and unfortunately we have lost 2 people since the outbreak on Wednesday last week, 12 Oct 2016" Mr Mwiinde said

The DC said the Ministry of Health has since opened screening and treatment centres in Lukanga Swamps and at Kapiri Mposhi Urban Clinic to receive suspected cases of cholera. He said the ministry is also distributing chlorine and has also intensified health education in the area to mitigate the outbreak.

Mr Mwiinde said the council has also been advised to put into effect a fish ban to prevent fish trading activities in the district to avert the further spread of the disease. "Cholera is coming from the swamps where we a have a lot of fish business going on as a result a fish ban has been effected to prevent movement of this diseases to other areas," Mr Mwiinde said.

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District)

The 3 cholera patients admitted for treatment at St Mary's Hospital Lacor in Gulu have been discharged from isolation. Dr Emmanuel Ochola, the head of HIV, research and documentation department says the hospital effectively contained the disease within days and no new cases have emerged.

Dr Ochola says the 3 left the isolation ward on Fri 14 Oct 2016 after fully recovering from the disease. They were residents of Bibiya village in Elegu parish, Atiak sub-county in Amuru district. The 3 were brought from the outskirts of South Sudan refugees' reception centres on Elegu border post where the ministry of Health has been battling an outbreak since September 2016.

As many as 2 of the victims were members of the same family while the 3rd was a 14-year-old boy who reported to the hospital while already on treatment. Dr Ochola urged communities to practice proper waste disposal and observe high standard of hygiene to prevent further outbreak.

Cholera is wreaking havoc in the Democratic Republic of Congo with the number of cases and deaths doubling from 2015. More than 22 000 cases have been reported, including more than 5500 involving children. To date, there are 646 deaths to count. Along the River Congo 660 000 people are at risk, including more than 316 000 children. The country faces high rates of cholera in endemic areas in the volatile eastern part of the country as well as the west.

United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) has warned the situation is worsening with the onset of the rainy season. The disease is likely to spread to the capital Kinshasa with a population over 11 million residents.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
