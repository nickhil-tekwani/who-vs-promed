[With the addition of these 9 newly confirmed cases and 5 deaths, this increases the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia to 529 including 168 deaths.

Noteworthy in today's report is the mention of a 33-year-old in Jeddah with clinically compatible symptoms of MERS-CoV who tested negative twice prior to a positive test. There was another similar report of a 39-year-old with co-morbidities in Riyadh who tested negative twice prior to a positive test (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (60): Middle East, Netherlands, USA, WHO 20140515.2474996). There is much room for speculation as to what may explain the 2 negative tests prior to a positive test, ranging from inadequate specimens to the possibility that the original presenting illness was due to a different respiratory virus infection and the individuals were infected with MERS-CoV in the health care environment. Another noteworthy item in today's update includes the mention of a 37-year-old male in Al-Madina who refused initial testing for MERS-CoV while being evaluated in an emergency room in Al-Madinah. It raises the question of how frequently this is occurring, and how many infections may be missed. It is also curious that of the 9 newly confirmed cases, 7 were in the 25-44 year old age group and none had a history of co-morbidities and only one of the cases reported known contact with a previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 16 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 15 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Netherlands notified WHO about a 2nd laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the Netherlands. The case was discovered during the national contact investigation, performed in relation to the 1st MERS-CoV case in the Netherlands reported on 14 May 2014.

This 2nd patient is a 73-year-old female citizen of the Netherlands and a close family member of the 1st case. Both patients were on the same trip through the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and shared a hotel room throughout the entire journey. This 2nd patient has co-morbidities and developed 1st symptoms, including some breathing difficulties, on 5 May 2014 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Upon return to the Netherlands on [10 May 2014], the patient presented with mild respiratory symptoms and fever, but these were not severe enough for her to seek medical help.

During contact investigation, her clinical condition was re-evaluated by a general practitioner and sampling for MERS-CoV was initiated. Samples taken from the patient are currently being tested, but initial findings confirm she is positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, the patient is in a stable condition with fever and mild respiratory symptoms and is hospitalized in isolation.

Identification of close contacts (including flight contacts) has been initiated, although the majority of her contacts overlap with those from the 1st patient.

Globally, 614 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 181 deaths. The global total includes all of the case reported in this update, plus 41 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO from Saudi Arabia between 10 and 15 May [2014]. WHO is working with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

[Adding the 6 additional cases and 3 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia on 16 May 2014 and the 9 additional cases and 5 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia today (17 May 2014), this will bring the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 629 including 189 deaths. If one counts the additional 7 cases from the 1st known outbreak in Jordan in April 2012 that were retrospectively confirmed through serologic testing, the global count will increase to 636 cases including 189 deaths.

With respect to the 2nd reported case in the Netherlands, in the above media report, there is mention that the date of onset of respiratory symptoms of this case was on 5 May 2014. From the earlier report, the 1st case (a close relative sharing a hotel room for the entirety of the trip to Saudi Arabia) had onset of "symptoms" (non-respiratory) on 1 May 2014 and sought medical care at an emergency room in Mecca on 6 May 2014, with onset of respiratory symptoms on 10 May 2014. Was the 1st case the "index case" in this family cluster beginning the clinical illness with non-specific "viral syndrome" symptoms on 1 May 2014? Or was the 2nd reported case, the 1st case, developing respiratory symptoms on 5 May 2014, with the 1st case developing symptoms on 10 May 2014? Or to confuse the situation further, were the 2 individuals 2 separate "index cases," one with exposure outside of the health care environment (case 2) and one with exposure inside the health care environment (case 1); or to further confuse the situation, did they both have a common exposure but varying incubation periods? etc.

[3] USA, 1 new infection, asymptomatic contact - Illinois
Date: Sat 17 May 2014
Source: CDC Press Release [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0517-mers.html


Ongoing investigation of the 1st imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the United States has identified evidence of apparent past MERS-CoV infection in an Illinois man who had close contact with the Indiana MERS patient. The Illinois resident did not seek or require medical care. However, local health officials have monitored his health daily since [3 May 2014] as part of the investigation. At this time, the Illinois resident is reported to be feeling well.

The previously reported Indiana MERS patient is a US resident who had traveled from Saudi Arabia and was admitted to an Indiana hospital on [28 Apr 2014]; the patient was confirmed to have MERS on [2 May 2014], and has since been released from the hospital.

For the Illinois resident, laboratory test results showing apparent past MERS-CoV infection were reported late night on [16 May 2014]. CDC officials explained that these laboratory test results are preliminary and suggest that the Illinois resident probably got the virus from the Indiana patient and the person's body developed antibodies to fight the virus. There are 2 main ways to determine if a person is or has been infected with MERS-CoV. We can collect a respiratory sample and use a test called PCR to determine if a person has active infection with the virus. Or we can do a blood test that looks for antibodies to MERS-CoV that would indicate a person had previously been infected with MERS-CoV.

"This latest development does not change CDC's current recommendations to prevent the spread of MERS," said David Swerdlow, M.D., who is leading CDC's MERS-CoV response. "It's possible that as the investigation continues others may also test positive for MERS-CoV infection but not get sick. Along with state and local health experts, CDC will investigate those initial cases and if new information is learned that requires us to change our prevention recommendations, we can do so."

The Illinois resident has no recent history of travel outside the United States. He met with the Indiana patient on 2 occasions shortly before the patient was identified as having MERS-CoV infection. As part of the MERS follow-up investigation, the local health department in Illinois contacted the Illinois resident on [3 May 2014]. The health department 1st tested this person for active MERS-CoV infection on [5 May 2014]. Those test results were negative. Public health officials are collecting blood samples from people who were identified as close contacts of the Indiana patient. On [16 May 2014], the test result was positive for the Illinois resident, showing that he has antibodies to MERS-CoV.

Reports of the 1st 2 confirmed imported cases of MERS in the United States -- the 1st in Indiana on [2 May 2014], and the 2nd in Florida on [11 May 2014] -- have resulted in large-scale multistate investigations and responses aimed at minimizing the risk of spread of the virus. As part of this effort, public health officials are reaching out to healthcare professionals, family members, and others who had close contact with the patients to provide guidance about monitoring their health and recommendations about when to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation. Public health officials also are working with airlines to identify and notify US travelers who may have been exposed to the patient on any of the flights. Efforts are now under way to identify, notify, test, and monitor close contacts of the Illinois resident.

All reported cases of MERS have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. In some instances, the virus has spread from person to person through close contact. However, there is currently no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings.

At this time, CDC's recommendations to the public, travelers, and healthcare providers have not changed on the basis of this new information.

For the general public: While experts do not yet know exactly how this virus is spread, CDC routinely advises that people help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by taking everyday preventive actions like washing their hands often; avoiding touching their face with unwashed hands; avoiding contact with people who appear sick; and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

For travelers: CDC currently does not recommend that anyone change their travel plans. If you are traveling to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, CDC recommends that you pay attention to your health during and after your trip. The CDC travel notice for MERS-CoV was upgraded to a level 2 alert. The travel notice advises people traveling to the Arabian Peninsula for health care work to follow CDC's recommendations for infection control, and other travelers to the Arabian Peninsula to take general steps to protect their health.

Healthcare professionals should evaluate patients for MERS-CoV infection who have:
(A) fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and either
- a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset, or
- have had close contact with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, or
- are part of a cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology in which MERS-CoV is being evaluated;
(B) or anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS while the person was ill, in consultation with state and local health departments.

Background
----------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a virus that is new to humans and was 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. As of [16 May 2014], there have been 572 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS in 15 countries. Most of these people developed severe acute respiratory illness, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath; 173 people died. Officials do not know where the virus came from or exactly how it spreads. There is no available vaccine or specific treatment recommended for the virus.

[The occurrence of a secondary case of MERS-CoV infection in a close contact of a case that was actively symptomatic at the time of the contact is not surprising, based on observations in other countries. A key unknown at present is whether there will be additional generations of infections related to this case or if the chain of transmission will stop following asymptomatic infection(s). In an NPR article on the announcement, the level of contact between the 1st MERS-CoV infected case in the USA and this business contact was described as "extensive and close face to face contact" (see http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/17/313452408/mers-virus-appears-to-have-jumped-from-human-to-human-in-u-s).
