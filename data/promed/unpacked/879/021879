[1] India: recovered national quarantined in New Delhi airport

This is the 1st confirmed case of Ebola in India, though the victim contracted the virus abroad and has already been treated. Officials have quarantined a man who was cured of Ebola in Liberia but continued to show traces of the virus in samples of his semen after arriving in the country, the health ministry said on Tues [18 Nov 2014]. The ministry said in a statement that the Indian national had been shown to be negative for Ebola in tests conforming to World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines but had been quarantined as a precautionary measure when he arrived at New Delhi airport on 10 Nov [2014]. Later, tests of his semen detected traces of the virus.

"It is a known fact that, during convalescence from Ebola Virus Disease, persons continue to shed virus in bodily fluids for variable periods," the ministry said. "However, presence of virus in his semen samples may have the possibility of transmitting the disease through the sexual route up to 90 days from time of clinical cure." India has screened thousands of passengers travelling from Ebola-hit West Africa in recent weeks. The Indian man carried with him documents from Liberia that stated he had been cured. He will be kept in quarantine until the virus is no longer present in his body, and will undergo tests over the next 10 days or so, a senior health ministry official said. "It is not an Ebola case; he is an Ebola-treated patient who is negative in blood but whose body fluid is positive. He has no symptoms," the official said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter...

Many experts say densely populated India is not adequately prepared to handle any spread of the highly infectious haemorrhagic fever among its 1.2 billion people. Government health services are overburdened, and many people in rural areas struggle to get access to even basic health services. Hygiene standards are low, especially in smaller towns and villages, and defecating and urinating in the open are common.

[Correction: the New York Times version of this report says ebolavirus is present in urine for 3 months after recovery from the disease. This is incorrect. Regarding semen: "Men should wear condoms during sexual contact for at least 3 months after recovery from Ebola," see: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/messages/en.

But "Sexual transmission of Ebola has never been reported." See: US CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html?s_cid=cs_284, and if it had in fact occurred during the many earlier outbreaks in Africa, one would have expected sporadic cases in women to have been reported after those outbreaks were over. They are apparently proposing to test his semen at periodic intervals until it turns negative, so he may have to stay in the airport quarantine quarters for weeks. If the test used only detects ebolavirus RNA, there may in fact be no live virus present. - Mod.JW]
