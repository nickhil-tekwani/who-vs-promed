China's Ministry of Health reported over the weekend that nearly 40
000 children have sought medical treatment related to the consumption
of melamine-contaminated powdered infant formula. Almost 12 900 are
currently hospitalized.

Three deaths have been confirmed as being related to contamination of
infant formula. One is under further investigation.

Authorities of Singapore and Hong Kong SAR reported finding melamine
in dairy products manufactured in China. A 3-year-old girl received
treatment in Hong Kong due to consumption of the contaminated milk.

WHO will continue to share information through its International Food
Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to help national authorities to
be better informed and enable them to better target their monitoring.

[2] Early rumors of event

Fonterra and New Zealand embassy staff in China failed to notice the
looming scandal over melamine-contaminated baby formula despite
months of rumours on popular internet sites, and a TV news programme
about babies falling ill after drinking milk products.

And a Christchurch political scientist says Fonterra's lack of
understanding of the Chinese political and business environment meant
the dairy giant was out of its depth before it had even bought its 43
percent shareholding in China's largest dairy company, Sanlu, in late
2005 for USD 107 million.

Four children have died from drinking Sanlu products contaminated
with the industrial chemical melamine, used by suppliers to disguise
watered-down milk, and more than 6000 have been made sick. Last night
[21 Sep 2008], a Fonterra spokesman reiterated CEO Andrew Ferrier's
statement that Fonterra China had no knowledge of any problems with
Sanlu products until [2 Aug 2008].

Sanlu had been fielding complaints from worried parents as early as
March [2008], was approached by health authorities in June [2008],
and conducted its own tests for contaminants in July [2008], but
Ferrier said none of Fonterra's 3 directors on the 7-person board of
Sanlu was informed before [2 Aug 2008].

But Anne-Marie Brady, a specialist in Chinese politics at the
University of Canterbury, said it was remarkable that a huge company
such as Fonterra failed to learn of problems at Sanlu through other
channels. Despite strict controls of official media by the communist
government, important stories still come to light via the internet
and smaller outlets.

In July [2008], Hunan TV, which screens on cable TV nationally, made
a programme about an epidemic of kidney damage in infants. To avoid
censorship, it didn't name Sanlu, but signaled the connection by
using Sanlu brand packaging as a backdrop to the report. 22 Chinese
milk companies are now implicated in the scandal.

Even if Fonterra didn't have staff who spoke Chinese, said Brady,
there are organisations in China that could do the work. "You could
say 'we specialise in the dairy industry; please comb the media and
tell us what's going on.'"

Brady also criticised the New Zealand embassy in Beijing for failing
to spot an issue that is bound to have huge effects on New Zealand's
interests in China.

Last night [21 Sep 2008], Foreign Affairs spokesman David Courtney
said while Mfat [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade - New Zealand]
"informally" monitors international media, it does not engage in
constant monitoring of all international media sources. He added
"China has a vast number of media outlets [television, press,
magazines and blogs], and the number is growing."

Brady said the Sanlu scandal is a demonstration too of the lack of
understanding by New Zealand businesses of the complexities of
Chinese commerce and politics. She points to the multiple roles held
by Sanlu's chairwoman, Tian Wenhua, who was also secretary of the
company's Communist Party chapter. Tian would have been privy to
classified Communist Party edicts that negative reports on food
safety be censored, and this may have kept her from passing news
about contaminated milk to Fonterra.

A spokesman said Fonterra "entered its business partnership with
Sanlu with careful consideration of all the factors influencing its
investment, political and cultural, as well as the strictly business
due-diligence issues."

Last night [21 Sep 2008], Fonterra's 3 Sanlu directors, 2 New
Zealanders, and a mainland Chinese national were believed to be in
China. Although a media report yesterday [21 Sep 2008] said Trade
Minister Phil Goff had talked to Ferrier about assuring their safety,
Mfat said Fonterra had not approached it about helping directors leave China.

A chronology of events in the tainted baby formula scandal that has
been blamed for the deaths of 4 infants and for sickening nearly 53
000 others in China:

- December 2007: Sanlu Group Co. receives complaints from consumers
that its infant formula was sickening babies, according to state
broadcaster China Central Television, citing findings from a State
Council investigation.

- June 2008: Sanlu learns its milk powder is contaminated with
melamine, CCTV says.

- 30 Jun 2008: China's product quality watchdog receives a complaint
that 5 infants at the Hunan province children's hospital have kidney
stones and were all fed Sanlu brand milk powder, according to data on
the website of China's food safety watchdog that has since been removed.

- 24 Jul 2008: A pediatrician tells the watchdog he has seen 9 cases
of kidney stones in infants, all of whom drank Sanlu formula. The
unidentified doctor expresses concern over the milk powder, according
to data on the watchdog website that has since been removed.

- 2 Aug 2008: Sanlu alerts the government of Shijiazhuang, the
northern Chinese city where the company is based, that its infant
formula is tainted, according to CCTV. At a Sanlu board meeting, New
Zealand dairy farmers' group Fonterra, a major investor in the
company, learns about complaints of sick babies and urges an immediate recall.

- 6 Aug 2008: Sanlu pulls baby milk powder from distributors but does
not do a public recall.

- 8 Aug 2008: The Beijing Olympics open and run until 24 Aug 2008.

- 5 Sep 2008: Fonterra informs New Zealand's Prime Minister Helen
Clark about the issue. Three days later, Clark orders New Zealand
officials to inform officials in Beijing.

- 9 Sep 2008: Shijiazhuang city officials inform Hebei provincial
officials. A day later, Hebei provincial officials contact the
central government.

- 11 Sep 2008: Sanlu publicly recalls 700 tons of baby formula.
Government vows "serious punishment" for those responsible. Xinhua
reports dozens of babies have kidney stones and that one baby has died.

- 13 Sep 2008: Vice Health Minister Gao Qiang says 432 babies fed
Sanlu formula have developed kidney stones. Gao blames Sanlu for
delays in warning the public and launches an inspection of all
Chinese formula companies. Hebei's vice governor says authorities
have seized 2176 tons of Sanlu formula and recalled 8218 tons.

- 15 Sep 2008: Number of sickened children rises to more than 1200,
with 2 deaths. China's quality watchdog says contamination occurred
mainly at farms, which sell raw milk to dairy companies. Sanlu's vice
president apologizes but does not explain the delay in informing the public.

- 16 Sep 2008: A nationwide inspection of 109 Chinese baby milk
powder companies uncovers 22 with traces of melamine. Sanlu General
Manager Tian Wenhua is fired and dismissed from board of directors,
state media reports.

- 17 Sep 2008: China's 2 largest dairies, Mengniu Dairy Co. and Yili
Industrial Group Co., recall baby formula. Health minister says 3
babies have died and more than 6200 others have been sickened. China
deploys 5000 inspectors to companies producing baby milk.

- 18 Sep 2008: Authorities arrest 12 more people, bringing total
detained to 18. Police confiscate 660 pounds of suspected chemicals.

- 19 Sep 2008: Crisis widens after government tests find melamine in
liquid milk produced by 3 of China's leading dairies.

- 21 Sep 2008: Health ministry reports the number of sickened
children soars to nearly 53 000, with 12 892 hospitalized and 104 in
serious condition. The Chinese territory of Hong Kong reports the 1st
known illness outside mainland China, a 3-year-old girl who developed
kidney stones after drinking Chinese dairy products.

- 22 Sep 2008: The head of China's product quality watchdog agency resigns.

[4] Newswire update
Date: 22 Sep 2008
Source: Radio New Zealand [edited]
<http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2008/09/17/124373ee10c9>

About 53 000 children have been made ill from drinking milk
contaminated with melamine, China's Health Ministry has admitted.

It says most were treated as outpatients and sent home, but 13 000
remain in hospital, 104 of them seriously ill.

Four babies have died after consuming the nitrogen-rich compound,
which can cause kidney stones and lead to renal failure among children.

The Chinese government is now trying to show that it is on top of the
poisoned milk crisis and also that it cares. Premier Wen Jiabao has
been seen on state-run television visiting a Beijing children's
hospital, talking to parents and apologising.

"We must make the physical health of the public a priority," he said.
"The most crucial point is that after a clean-up, there can be no
problems at all with newly produced milk products. If there are fresh
problems, they must be even more sternly punished under the law."

A girl in Hong Kong diagnosed with a kidney stone at the weekend is
the 1st reported case outside mainland China. The government says the
3-year-old drank milk from the Yili brand but is in a good condition
and has been discharged from hospital.

The contamination scandal was 1st identified in baby formula produced
by the Sanlu Group, which is 43-percent owned by New Zealand dairy
giant Fonterra.

It is thought melamine was added to watered-down milk to help it pass
quality inspections. The toxin has also been found in popular brands
of regular milk, yoghurt and ice-cream in China.

The World Health Organisation has condemned China's handling of the
milk scandal, suggesting there has been a cover-up.

New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is defending the
weeks it took its embassy in China to tell the New Zealand Government
about the contaminated baby formula.

Fonterra told the New Zealand embassy in Beijing about the problem on
[14 Aug 2008], but the ministry in Wellington did not receive the
information until [1 Sep 2008].

The ministry's director of the Asia Division, David Taylor, said
Fonterra and the embassy struggled to collect detailed information
from Chinese managers and officials.

Mr Taylor said the embassy wanted to be sure of the facts and knew it
would be irresponsible to report inaccurate information.

New Zealanders working for Sanlu are still in China and are not in
danger of being arrested by authorities, he said.

The New Zealand embassy knew of tainted Sanlu milk powder in
mid-August [2008] but says it did not make an official report because
it lacked information.

MFAT said the New Zealand embassy in China was told informally by
Fonterra on [14 Aug 2008] that there had been reports of a small
number of sick children and that Sanlu appeared to have been
receiving milk contaminated with melamine.

The ministry said at this time the embassy did not have enough
information to send an authoritative report to Wellington.

On [22 Aug 2008], Fonterra told the embassy Sanlu did have a problem
and local authorities had been urged to begin a full product recall.

The embassy and Fonterra continued to communicate between [23-29 Aug
2008] about the way the problem was being handled.

Fonterra China told the embassy about discussions with their joint
venture partner and the local authorities and efforts to achieve
recall of Sanlu products.

New Zealand's Trade Minister Phil Goff was briefed on the issue on [2
Sep 2008].

An officials group was convened by MFAT involving the New Zealand
Food Safety Authority, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

A formal report was finalised on [5 Sep 2008], and a top-level New
Zealand Government meeting took place on [8 Sep 2008].

On [9 Sep 2008], the embassy in Beijing contacted relevant central
government agencies in China to convey the views and concerns of the
New Zealand Government.

Prime Minister Helen Clark told the ABC on Saturday [20 Sep 2008]
that Fonterra had responsibilities and should focus on helping the
sick children. She said the matter will probably be fully analysed in
the future.

Hong Kong earlier ordered a recall of Chinese powdered milk made by
dairy giant Yili after discovering it contained melamine.

On Sunday [21 Sep 2008], supermarkets pulled some milk powder
products, including those from Swiss giant Nestle, from their shelves.

Nestle said it was confident none of its products have been made with
melamine-laced milk. Tests done by government-approved labs showed
the product in question was melamine-free, it said.

However, Hong Kong's food safety centre says later tests showed that
another product, Nestle Dairy Farm Pure Milk, contained the harmful substance.

It said the product is used by caterers and has asked suppliers to
stop selling the product and to recall it.

Nestle declined to comment on the food safety centre report.

The World Health Organisation has asked the Chinese authorities to
explain why it took months for the tainted milk scandal to be made public.

The UN children's agency UNICEF has asked Chinese authorities to
launch a full investigation into the matter.

Brunei has banned imports of Chinese milk products after similar
moves by Singapore and Malaysia.

Meanwhile, Chinese officials have ordered an all-out effort to save
babies who have been made ill by contaminated milk products.

The State Council, or cabinet, has also called on medical authorities
to give free examinations and treatment to infants affected by the
tainted milk products. It has also called for more screening to take
place in remote areas.

Panicked parents have crowded hospitals in China and demanded redress
since officials and Sanlu said last week that babies were sick with
kidney stones and complications after drinking toxic milk powder.

Beijing has already recalled some milk powder exported by 2 firms
whose products were contaminated, though it said "there has been no
bad reaction" to those goods.

The escalating scandal has triggered sacking of officials and the
detention of a sacked Sanlu executive, Tian Wenhua. Police have
arrested 4 people, including 2 dealers in Hubei province.

[The newswires seem to have nicely responded to the RFI (request for
information) in an earlier ProMED-mail posting, on possible early
reports of this event that may have fallen "under the radar" of the
international public health community (see Infant kidney stones -
China (05): HK, other responses, RFI 20080921.2973). From the
newswire in [2], it does appear as though information on the
occurrence of kidney damage in infants using powdered milk was
publicized in a documentary shown on Hunan TV in July 2008.
Information from this documentary apparently did not have wide
dissemination, possibly due to conflicting focus on the Olympic
events. Of additional interest is that according to the timeline
presented in [3] above, it appears as though the major producer of
the implicated milk powder received complaints that children were
getting sick as early as December 2007.

It appears as though each day more cases of adverse events associated
with the consumption of milk adulterated with melamine are being
identified. In the initial reports carried in the 1st ProMED-mail
posting on this on 10 Sep 2008 (see Infant kidney stones - China:
Gansu, milk powder susp., RFI 20080910.2828), there were reports of
one death and 59 cases. As of today, 22 Sep 2008, there have now been
more than 53 000 cases identified, of which 13 000 are hospitalized,
possibly 4 associated deaths, and 104 infants in "serious" condition.
One suspects that as the news of the problem is further disseminated
in the population, more parents will bring their infants to be
checked for possible problems associated with the use of
supplementary milk products (non-breast milk).

There is much coverage of the press over the initial handling of this
event on the part of all parties involved in the milk industry in
China (including foreign companies). The order of magnitude of this
problem is still under question, but the event serves to further
demonstrate the importance of early reporting of adverse health events.

To date, there has been only one case of a similar problem identified
outside of mainland China, a 3 year old in Hong Kong. The exact
distribution of exported milk products appears not to be conclusively
known, with company stated distributions seeming to differ from
testing results in other countries. - Mod.MPP]
