Influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China - Update
---------------------------
As of 20 February the Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR confirmed that
a 33-year-old man, who died in hospital in Hong Kong on 17 Feb 2003, had
been infected with a strain of the influenza A(H5N1) virus. ( see previous
report ). A nasopharyngeal aspirate taken from the man tested positive for
influenza A(H5N1) in the Hong Kong SAR Government Virus Unit.
The 33-year-old man is the second confirmed case of influenza A(H5N1) virus
related to this outbreak in Hong Kong SAR. The man is known to have been
the father of the 9-year-old boy reported as having tested positive for
influenza A(H5N1) yesterday. Both cases had travelled to Fujian Province
(China) in January 2003, and 2 other members of the family who accompanied
the cases to Fujian in January have also been unwell. The mother of the
family has now made a full recovery; the other affected member of the
family (an 8-year-old girl) died on 4 Feb 2003 in Fujian Province. The
health authorities in Hong Kong SAR are continuing laboratory and
epidemiological investigations to determine the source of infection of this
outbreak. Further laboratory tests, including gene sequencing, are being
conducted. The Department of Health in Hong Kong has reported that no
unusual increase in influenza activity has been detected over the past few
weeks.
The World Health Organization is in close contact with the health
authorities in Beijing, China and in Hong Kong, SAR. The WHO Global
Influenza Surveillance Network has been alerted, and additional reagents
for laboratory diagnosis are being made available to National Influenza
Centres and other Members of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network.

Bird Flu Death Confirmed in Hong Kong
----------------------------------------
A Hong Kong man who died earlier this week had contracted bird flu, health
officials confirmed Thursday, in a case that disturbingly echoes a 1997
outbreak in which the disease first crossed over into humans and killed 6
people.
When bird flu hit Hong Kong's populace more than 5 years ago, officials
killed all the territory's 1.4 million chickens in an attempt to wipe out
the virus.
Health Department spokeswoman Eva Wong said the man, whom she did not
identify, had been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The hospital that
treated him said he died of severe pneumonia.
The man's 9-year-old son remained hospitalized Thursday with the same
strain of the bird flu. It is a different strain of the disease than the
one that infected humans in 1997.
The man's family visited relatives in southeastern China's Fujian province
in late January 2003. One of his daughters, an 8-year-old, contracted
pneumonia and died 28 Jan 2003 in a Fujian hospital. Officials were
investigating what caused her death.
The man, his son, wife, father and another daughter were hospitalized in
Hong Kong after their return. The wife and father were released Thursday,
but the other daughter, 10, remains in the hospital.
Wong said officials believed the disease did not originate in Hong Kong,
but declined to say whether the family might have caught it in mainland China.
Mainland health authorities so far found that none of the family's
relatives or medical staff caring for them in Fujian had shown similar
symptoms.
The latest case coincided with reports that 12 chickens were found dead at
market stalls in a Hong Kong suburb Wednesday -- one of numerous outbreaks
of bird flu in recent months. It was, however, unclear whether the birds
were infected with the same strain as the boy and his father, whose home is
in a different area.
The cases have prompted speculation that the bird flu might have originated
in mainland China. Hong Kong returned almost 10 000 chickens to the
mainland in 2001 and 2002 after tests indicated they might have been
exposed to the virus. A mainland Chinese official recently insisted the flu
was endemic to Hong Kong.

[This newswire confirms a second case of human illness (and first death)
associated with an H5N1 infection. In this article there is the additional
suggestion that the geographic area of transmission of this infection may
have been Fujian, as the entire family had been in Fujian in the immediate
period preceding onset of illness. While it may be too late to obtain
specimens from the family member who died while in Fujian, results of
specific avian influenza testing from the area in Fujian where the family
stayed will be of interest and may possibly shed further light on this. To
date there has been confirmation of H5N1 activity among poultry in Hong
Kong but not elsewhere in mainland China. Perhaps this current cluster of
human H5N1 infections with associated mortality will lead to more
widespread avian testing/monitoring in mainland provinces. We await
further information on this outbreak as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
