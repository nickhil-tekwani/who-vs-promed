[We are informed that the case involves a male calf imported from Portugal.

The veterinary health certificate required by Israel's Veterinary Services to accompany male calves for slaughter from EU countries includes the following relevant segment: "The herds from which the animal originate are officially declared free from tuberculosis and have passed a negative tuberculin test within the last 36 months (state date of test)."

According to the report, the male calf, born "at the end of 2017 or the beginning of 2018" in Portugal, was received, with its group of 254 animals (same origin?), on the farm on 3 Sep 2018 and slaughtered almost 4 months later, 24 Dec 2018. Duration and means of international transport, time of arrival in Israel and location of stay (in a quarantine station?) before entering the farm of destination are not given. These data are relevant to the epidemiological assessment and measures applied.

Bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated in Israel in 1973, with not a single case detected on a dairy farm since. The last case in grazing beef cattle was recorded in 1999.

On 11 Jan 2018, Israel submitted to the OIE an immediate notification reporting a suspected outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in Kibbutz Galon (20180112.5555373). We are informed that the suspicion was eventually not confirmed in cattle, and the case closed.

Portugal's presentation to the PAFF Standing Committee, Brussels, 12 Jul 2018, titled "Implementation of Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Programme in Portugal, 2017" is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180712_pres_bov-tub_por.pdf.
