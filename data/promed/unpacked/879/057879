Many pet owners are increasingly concerned about the risk of over-vaccination and are choosing to vaccinate animals less frequently, if they vaccinate at all.

The American Veterinary Medical Association's feline panleukopenia page (https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/feline-panleukopenia.aspx) states: "In the past, feline panleukopenia was a leading cause of death in cats. Today, it is an uncommon disease, due in large part to the availability and use of very effective vaccines."

However, animals are still losing their lives daily to this disease. In fact, the disease has appeared in all parts of the United States and most countries of the world, its prevalence being anywhere groups of cats congregate, such as kennels, pet shops, feral cat colonies, etc. Outbreaks often occur when cats are more likely to come into contact with unvaccinated cats, especially during the warm months of "kitten season." In Tehama county, there have already been instances of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) noted.

FPV infects small and large cats as well as raccoons, mink, and possibly foxes, and, while cats of any age may be infected, young kittens, sick cats, unvaccinated cats, and previously unexposed cats are the most susceptible.

Although there are no breed or gender tendencies, the severity of disease varies with age. Severe infection with death ensuing is most likely to occur in kittens between 2-6 months of age. Generally, adult felines are more resistant, having either received vaccinations or developed their own immunity through exposure to the virus in the environment.

The incubation period (the time from exposure to onset of clinical symptoms) of FPV is generally less than 14 days. The "shedding period," that period of time when a virus is being excreted and is transmissible, often begins before clinical signs are observed. Therefore, it can be very hard to determine just by looking which animals are healthy and which are infectious. An infected cat will typically shed the virus for a relatively short period (1-2 days), but be aware that the virus can survive for up to a year in the environment, so cats may become infected without ever having direct contact with a diseased cat. In addition, while FPV is not transmissible to humans, it can be spread if a person has it on their hands or clothing and then has contact with an at-risk cat. Also, any shared food and water bowls, litter boxes, and equipment such as grooming tools, can transmit FPV.

The panleukopenia virus attacks and destroys white blood cells, weakening the immune system and putting the animal at a greater risk of contracting other infections. The 1st visible signs one might notice include depression, lack of appetite, high fever, lethargy, vomiting, severe diarrhea, nasal discharge and dehydration. Affected cats may sit by their water bowls for lengthy periods but not drink. In some felines, the fever may come and go, with body temperature abruptly falling to lower-than-normal levels shortly before death. In kittens, infected in utero or up to 2 weeks after birth, FPV can permanently damage their cerebellum, a part of the brain that coordinates nerves, muscles and bones to produce body movements. Should they survive, they may have uncoordinated movement of the limbs, head and neck, head tremors, body tremors and swaying of the torso. Pregnant cats are at a high risk for fatal complications, since their immune systems are compromised by the pregnancy. In addition, the virus may cross the placenta to cause abortion or stillbirth.

In order to diagnose the disease, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam and take the cat's history, including vaccination status. Panlukopenia might be suspected based on a history of possible exposure to any infected cats, the feline's lack of vaccination and any overt signs of illness. A blood sample will be drawn for a CBC (complete blood cell count) in addition to obtaining a fecal sample, if possible. Severely reduced levels of all white blood cell types would indicate that FPV is the cause of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed when the FVP is found in the cat's stool. However, the results might be falsely positive if the feline was vaccinated 5-12 days prior to the test.

Because there is not a cure for panleukopenia, the resultant treatment will consist of supportive care: to prevent secondary infections with the administration of antibiotics, to combat dehydration with fluid administration, and to control vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms with the administration of varied, multiple medications and vital nutrition. Recovery from the FPV for kittens less than 8 weeks old is poor. Adult cats have a greater chance of survival if adequate treatment is provided early.

Prevention is key to your cat's health, and the best way to protect him and others is to adhere to a schedule of vaccinations determined by your veterinarian. For something so effective and relatively inexpensive, it would be foolhardy to elect not to vaccinate.

There are very few vaccine reactions. If your pet is not vaccinated and comes into contact with any number of devastating diseases shed by unvaccinated animals, your pet's risk of a severe illness or death increases 10-fold. I urge you to seriously consider the risk of not vaccinating your pet.

[The Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel of the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) recommends that vaccination against panleukopenia is considered core. MDA [maternally derived antibodies - CopyEd.MSP] may interfere with immunization when antibody titers are high during the neonatal period, and kittens will be at greatest risk of infection in the period between waning MDA and effective vaccine-induced immunity. MDA titers generally wane sufficiently to allow immunization by 8-12 weeks of age. However, there is considerable variation between individuals, with some kittens having no or low levels of MDA at 6 weeks of age, and others failing to respond to a final vaccination given at 12-14 weeks of age, indicating that in some cases, MDA may last longer.

Because of this variability, the initial series of vaccinations should begin at 6-8 weeks of age and be repeated every 3-4 weeks (or 2-3 weeks in shelters) until 16-20 weeks of age. However, in some countries vaccines are only licensed for use from 8-9 weeks of age.

Revaccination should take place at one year of age after kitten vaccination or one year after the primary course in older cats. Thereafter, cats should be vaccinated no more frequently than once every 3 years.

To repeat, thanks to the success of vaccination programs, feline panleukopenia has become an infrequent disease, but it is still lethal, and there is no cure, so make sure your cats are vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ]
