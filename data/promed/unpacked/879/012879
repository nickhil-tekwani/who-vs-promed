Update: Acute respiratory illness among U.S. travelers to Mexico
--------------------------------------------------
The Mexico Ministry of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) are investigating an outbreak of acute respiratory illness
among U.S. travelers returning from Acapulco, Mexico, during March [2001.
The source of the exposure has not yet been determined. However,
preliminary information has revealed that all ill persons either stayed in
or spent time on the premises of the Calinda Beach Hotel in Acapulco.
This cluster of illness was reported to CDC after a number of U.S.
university students, who traveled to Acapulco during March, sought medical
care for acute respiratory illness, with symptoms that included high fever,
headache, dry cough, and chills. Laboratory testing for the cause of the
illness is ongoing; however, initial tests indicate that the illness is
probably histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by a fungus
[_Histoplasma capsulatum_ and primarily affects the lungs. The disease is
not transmitted from an infected person to someone else.
U.S. travelers to Acapulco during March, especially students who visited or
stayed at the Calinda Beach Hotel, should consult their primary health care
professionals if symptoms develop. CDC has contacted all 50 state
epidemiologists to begin identifying other possible persons with acute
respiratory illness who recently traveled to Acapulco. Persons concerned
about this outbreak should contact their health care professional or state
health department for more information.

[The history of "major construction" at the hotel during the time when the
travelers were visiting Acapulco, especially if the building had been
inhabited by birds or bats or if the soil disturbed during the construction
had been enriched with bird or bat excrement, would be consistent with an
exposure history to _H. capsulatum_.
Interested readers are directed to the practice guidelines from the
Infectious Diseases Society of America for the management of patients with
histoplasmosis, which is available in .pdf format
at <http://www.idsociety.org/pg/Histo.pdf>. Information on the thermally
dimorphic fungus _H. capsulatum_, including attractive photographs is
available at <http://www.doctorfungus.org/thefungi/Histoplasma.htm> and
information on histoplasmosis can be found at

We await further information on this outbreak. - Man. Ed. DS
