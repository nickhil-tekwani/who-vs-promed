H5N1 virus strain found in native birds
---------------------------------------
The H5N1 avian flu virus strain has been found in 6 types of indigenous
birds, including pigeons and Asian open-bill storks, in 5 provinces, said
Dr. Charal Trinwutthipong, chairman of the center to prevent bird flu,
yesterday [13 Dec 2004].
However, Dr. Charal said only 10 out of a total of 1011 bird samples tested
positive for avian influenza. They were 3 out of 6 pigeon samples collected
from Chachengsao province (1), Nakhon Sawan (3) and Lop Buri (2), 2 out of
15 Asian open-bill storks, one little cormorant and a red-collar dove from
Nakhon Sawan, one scaly-breasted munia from Saraburi, and a black drongo
from Lop Buri. All the infected birds were native ones he said. None of the
samples of migratory birds tested positive.
Currently, there is no evidence of any direct transmission of the H5N1
virus from [non-domestic] birds to humans in Thailand or in any other
country, Dr. Charal said. However, it is possible the virus could spread to
humans via carriers such as chickens rather than directly from birds in the
wild, he said.
The government will make further studies to find out whether the infected
sample birds had caught the virus while in close contact with infected
poultry, or whether the birds themselves were carriers. Authorities also
planned to study the habits and travel routes of various types of birds, as
well as their life cycles, in order to draw up effective preventive measures.
The government intended to collect up to 6000 samples of wild birds
throughout the country by the end of this cold season for testing, he said.
Dr. Charal said the finding of the H5N1 virus in indigenous birds was "not
unexpected," since they tended to have close contact with poultry,
particularly chickens raised on open farms.
Yukol Limlamthong, chief of the Livestock Development Department, warned
poultry raisers to build proper holding pens, as well as to put up nets, to
prevent their fowl from coming into close contact with birds in the wild.
He said the bird flu situation in Thailand had improved. The number of
areas under watch had dropped from 122 spots in 21 provinces to 71 in 19
provinces, including 2 newly listed ones: Nakhon Si Thammarat and Pattani.
Suwit Viboonpolprasert, chairman of an anti-bird-flu working group, said
his group was about to finish mapping out a strategy against the disease
and expected to forward it for consideration to the national bird flu
committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng, within the
next 2 weeks.
The strategy would have 6 parts, including a new way to raise poultry and
other animals safely.

[This report adds details on the Thai surveillance program in wild birds
that were missing in previous postings. Data on the species of tested
migratory birds will be useful. In view of the findings in herons in Hong
Kong and Cambodia, it will be interesting to note whether this species is
(or will be) included in the Thai surveillance. - Mod.AS]
