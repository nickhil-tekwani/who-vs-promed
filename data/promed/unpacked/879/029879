- Thu 16 May 2019. Ebola treatment distrust leading to greater likelihood of spread
[Axios, abridged, edited]
https://www.axios.com/ebola-treatment-leading-spread-43e3a39a-ba09-4bf3-a1d2-81cc98f59eb5.html
[Byline: Eileen Drage O'Reilly]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo now has 7 hotspots and is considered to have an increased risk of spread within DRC and neighboring countries, the World Health Organization said in an update on [Thu 16 May 2019].

What's new: WHO expects case numbers to continue rising due to the inability to reach all hotspot areas and the persistent pockets of community resistance that cause people to either not go to Ebola treatment centers or go after the infection is too advanced. 68% of deaths were of people not in an ETC, and the disease overall has had a 66% fatality rate, WHO said.

Healthcare workers continue to face peril, as well. Not only are some getting infected -- 102 people, or 6% of total cases, per WHO -- but violence continues to target them as well.

Violence targeting healthcare workers has grown globally, too -- with 973 attacks and 167 deaths in 23 countries in 2018, according to a report out this week [week of 13 May 2019] from the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition.

What they're saying: DRC Ministry of Health spokesperson Jessica Ilunga tells Axios:
"The security situation has always been complex. However, over the last few months, it is getting worse and Ebola responders and operations are more often targeted by acts of violence mainly perpetrated by community-based militias. While these local militias have close links with the community, one should avoid using these acts of violence to gauge the level of community engagement in the region."

"Doing that creates a narrative that stigmatises the entire population of the city of Butembo, portraying them as inherently violent people who can only express themselves through these despicable acts. Such narrative also stigmatises and blames healthcare workers who are the first victims of that violence."

But, but, but: The news is slightly tempered by a welcomed but "unpredictable calm" in recent violent episodes in the DRC, accompanied by an increase in security around ETCs, WHO stated earlier this week.

Meanwhile, a WHO advisory group recommended last week [week of 6 May 20190] that the DRC offer lower doses of vaccines to spread them out farther and to consider accepting other experimental vaccines to help boost the current one that's approved for use. Ilunga says "National authorities received informal requests to consider 3 other vaccines but discussions are still in their preliminary stage. None of the manufacturers has already introduced a formal request to the national authorities."

- Sat 19 May 2019. Fighting Ebola when mourners fight the responders
[New York Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-congo.html
[Byline: Joseph Goldstein]

An Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo -- the 2nd-largest in history -- is escalating in part because locals don't trust health workers and government officials.

When Ebola came to [the city of Beni] in the Democratic Republic of Congo, [JMM] quit farming and got work burying the highly contagious bodies of Ebola victims.

But [Mr M] is less afraid of Ebola than of the mourners he encounters at funerals. He and his burial team have been attacked by relatives of the dead, one swinging a hoe. Mourners have shouted at team members, accusing them of stealing the organs of corpses, and have threatened to throw them into the open graves. Last month [April 2019] a mourner brandished a hand grenade, he said, sending everyone scattering and leaving a 3-year-old Ebola victim unburied.

"Someone like me can be buried alive," [Mr M] said as his colleagues hosed down their trucks at the Red Cross compound after another day of burials.

This Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo, the 2nd-largest ever recorded, is now spiraling out of control. Despite some early success -- helped by a new and effective vaccine -- the disease has come roaring back in the past 2 months.

Efforts to combat the epidemic have been hobbled by attacks on treatment centers and health workers; deep suspicion of the national government, which is managing the eradication efforts; and growing mistrust of the international medical experts who have struggled to steer patients into the treatment centers, according to interviews with dozens of family members, politicians, doctors, and health workers in recent weeks.

When a doctor was killed, and treatment centers attacked by gunmen or set on fire, front-line health workers suspended their work, giving the virus time to spread. Some medical and aid groups have decided to pull some of their personnel from the very areas where Ebola has hit hardest.

So far nearly 1150 people have died in the outbreak, according to the World Health Organization [1209 deaths (1121 confirmed and 88 probable) as of 19 May 2019, according to the DRC MOH -- see [1] above]. But that is a significant undercount, aid groups said in interviews. Health workers have been turned away regularly from homes where someone has died, leaving them unable to test for Ebola.

Earlier in the outbreak, the police would remove these bodies from homes, at gunpoint if necessary, said [PK], 39, who is often the 1st member of his Ebola response team to arrive at a grief-stricken home.

"The new protocol is that we just abandon the body," he said. "They will learn their lesson when they get sick."

Initial optimism
----------------
When the outbreak was discovered last summer [2018], health workers had reason to worry. This part of eastern Congo has long been beset by dozens of armed groups fighting over land, natural resources, ethnicity, and religion -- including one outfit with ties to the Islamic State.

Yet optimism ran strong among the arriving wave of international health experts and humanitarian workers, many of whom had experience treating Ebola, an often fatal disease caused by a virus that is transmitted by body fluids.

They came with lessons learned from the outbreak that tore across West Africa starting in 2013, killing more than 11 000 people. And they were buoyed by a recent success: the speedy containment of an outbreak in western Congo.

They also brought medical advances: a strikingly effective vaccine, experimental treatments, and a transparent container known as the "cube" that Ebola patients live inside, reducing the transmission risk to doctors and visitors.

Some of the responders hoped that big outbreaks were already a thing of the past.

Patients who went to see their doctors with common symptoms, such as headaches and fevers, were often forced into Ebola quarantine centers for a few days pending tests.

Many of the symptoms of Ebola resemble those of more common maladies, such as malaria. At one quarantine facility in Beni, fewer than 2 percent of patients tested positive for Ebola, according to interviews with health officials and an epidemiological report provided by a medical organization.

Many of the front-line Ebola workers say they keep their work a secret from neighbors. Perhaps no job is riskier than that of the burial teams, who retrieve the bodies of people suspected of dying from Ebola from grieving families.

[Bradenton Herald, Associated Press (AP) report, abridged, edited]
https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/health-care/article230483814.html


An international aid organization says it only has enough funding to continue safe burials for Ebola victims in eastern Congo for 2 more weeks.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said [Thu 16 May 2019] that unless it gets more funding it won't be able to continue providing support to crews burying Ebola victims.

Each Ebola burial costs about USD 500 for, among other things, the protective gear for workers.

- Tue 14 May 2019 Ituri: Threatened with Ebola contamination, Mbororo farmers have left Mambasa to return to Haut-Uele
[Crofsblog, Bunia Actualite report, abridged, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/05/ituri-threatened-with-ebola-contamination-mbororo-farmers-have-left-mambasa-to-return-to-haut-u%C3%A9l%C3%A9.html

The interim governor of Ituri announced the departure of approximately 3000 West African Mbororo pastoralists who had already settled in Mambasa territory, along with their cows, whose number is estimated by the local authorities, between 15 000 and 20 000. These nomads returned to the neighboring province of Haut-Uele [directly north of Ituri province] from which they had come.

"We have been in contact with the group leader and the Mambasa Territory Administrator who are confirming that the Mbororo have left our province. They found that the conditions were not favorable and that the environment was not conducive to their activities, "said Pacifique Keta in an interview on Mon 13 May 2019 to our fellow radio Okapi.

Among the major causes of their departure, the provincial authority cites in particular their fear of being infected by the Ebola virus epidemic, as well as the payment of a provincial tax on the movement of livestock imposed on them.

"Some of their cows died, they realized that this was already a bad sign. They feared a possible contamination by Ebola," he continued.

The Mbororo are a West African nomadic pastoral people, and not always welcome among more settled communities.

[IRC (International Rescue Committee), abridged, edited]
https://www.rescue.org/video/david-miliband-eyewitness-fight-against-ebola

International Rescue Committee president and CEO David Miliband recently visited the IRC's Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Congo has spent decades in the grip of violent conflict, and attacks on health centers are hindering efforts to treat patients and prevent the spread of the virus.

Video transcript
----------------
I'm convinced that the Ebola crisis taking place north of here in the cities of Beni and Butembo is far more worrying, far more dangerous than is generally realized.

David Miliband recently visited IRC's Ebola response in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo.

IRC staff are supporting over 50 health centers to tackle Ebola.

The places where Ebola seems to be out of the grip of authorities are conflict zones.

Attacks on health centers have halted many Ebola treatment and prevention programs.

Here in Goma, people are worried that Ebola is going to arrive, it's going to be brought here.

With Ebola cases rising, the outbreak is far from under control.

It's very, very important that the government, the international community press the reset button, step up together, to change the approach, to win the confidence of the local community to make sure that the coordination of the effort is of the highest order.

At least 10 people, including 9 civilians and one soldier, died this morning [17 May 2019] in an attack attributed to Ugandan rebels of Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Kilhewa, a village at kilometer point 13 (PK13) on the Mbau-Kamango road in the territory from Beni (North Kivu).

The rebel assault was launched at 9 am, the attackers targeted the civilian population, the military intervened. The local civil society that adds this report adds that three people do not answer the call so far and one civilian is seriously injured.

"There are 9 civilians killed, including 5 women and 4 men, among them pygmies, a killed soldier, and a wounded civilian, 3 missing persons, and we are following the situation in the area. [The attack was] a surprise for all the communities that are in the area there.

[Radio Okapi; in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/05/17/actualite/economie/rdc-ebola-affecte-leconomie-de-beni-butembo-et-lubero-selon-la-fec

The outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Beni, Butembo, and Lubero (North Kivu) has negatively affected the economy in this region. According to the president of the local group of the Federation of Enterprises of the Congo (FEC), Polycarpe Ndivito, production and trade with some neighboring countries and the export of some products to Uganda and Kenya are slowing down as a result of this epidemic. He is talking about a loss of several million dollars since the declaration of this disease in the region.

Polycarpe Ndivito reports distrust of traders in rural areas: "The production itself has fallen sharply because people are suspicious, for example those who leave Butembo as a center to go to rural areas. They cannot get in easily because the (villagers) with whom they have to collaborate in rural areas are saying, 'People who come from Butembo have Ebola virus disease' and that affects production."

According to him, the marketing of local products, banana, tea, wood, cocoa, coffee, is also affected by the epidemic. Customers who had to leave Kampala (Uganda) or Kenya to buy these products no longer come for fear of the disease. This fear slows trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In brief
A longitudinal study of Ebola virus infection survivors maps out the antibody features that confer protection, with potential implications for vaccination.

- Ebola virus infection causes massive recruitment of naive B cells
- Virus-specific antibodies continue to class-switch and mutate for months after acute infection.
- Protective antibodies can be neutralizing or non-neutralizing and can appear early.
- Convergent, protective antibody rearrangements are seen in multiple donors.

Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) remains a public health threat. We performed a longitudinal study of B cell responses to EBOV in four survivors of the 2014 West African outbreak. Infection induced lasting EBOV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, but their subclass composition changed over time, with IgG1 persisting, IgG3 rapidly declining, and IgG4 appearing late. Striking changes occurred in the immunoglobulin repertoire, with massive recruitment of naive B cells that subsequently underwent hypermutation. We characterized a large panel of EBOV glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Only a small subset of mAbs that bound glycoprotein by ELISA recognized cell-surface glycoprotein. However, this subset contained all neutralizing mAbs. Several mAbs protected against EBOV disease in animals, including one mAb that targeted an epitope under evolutionary selection during the 2014 outbreak. Convergent antibody evolution was seen across multiple donors, particularly among VH3-13 neutralizing antibodies specific for the GP1 core. Our study provides a benchmark for assessing EBOV vaccine-induced immunity.
