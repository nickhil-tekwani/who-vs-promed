Scientists fear pigs may play role in bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Government officials are in discussions with farmers about restricting the
movement of pigs as well as poultry, as they prepare for the possible
arrival of avian flu in the UK.
Powers to cull and control poultry as well as remove potentially infected
birds from the food chain are already available, but it emerged yesterday
[23 Aug 2005] that talks are under way on whether further measures might be
necessary.
Scientists fear that pigs can act as "mixing vessels" for flu viruses that
would otherwise be mainly harmful to birds -- although humans in close
contact can be infected and killed by such viruses -- and turn them into a
highly contagious disease that spreads easily between humans.
The trend towards outdoor breeding of pigs as well as the popularity of
free-range chicken means that British farms may be susceptible to the
threat from migrating wild birds bringing bird flu from other parts of the
world.
Avian flu is not regarded as a pig disease, so there are no powers to cull
them at present, although the European commission is introducing a
directive that would enable governments to act. Fred Landeg, the deputy
chief vet, will be Britain's representative at an EC meeting in Brussels
tomorrow to discuss avian flu and other issues.
Meanwhile, the government insisted there was no need to shut free-range
chickens indoors as was ordered in the Netherlands on Monday [22 Aug 2005].
The environment department, Defra, yesterday [23 Aug 2005] met with
industry bodies. It said: "There will be continuing dialogue to ensure we
are best prepared to meet any heightened risk of disease or any future
outbreak. We are continuing to review together the assessment of the risk
of avian influenza but are content that the risk remains low and there is
no need at this stage for the industry to be asked to bring indoors
free-range birds. We are looking jointly at what steps might be appropriate
in future in different circumstances to respond to changes in levels of risk."
Bob McCracken, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said it
was vital to spot the arrival of avian flu early and called on the
government to authorize more proactive surveillance in at-risk areas, such
as farms where poultry is kept outdoors and on water where migrating birds
are likely to land.
"We would not go out and blindly sample domesticated birds throughout the
UK," he said. "We would concentrate our efforts on those areas where we
believe contact with migrating birds is more likely."
Ian Campbell of the National Pig Association said: "At this moment, the
actual risk on the pig side is relatively low, though clearly, the
expectation is that it will grow."
There was no clear indication of how many farms have pigs and poultry on
them, especially since the law did not require poultry owners to be
registered. "I suspect the number that have a few poultry running round the
place is probably quite significant." About 30-35 percent of the pig
breeding herd was now thought be outdoors, he said.
The RSPB [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds] warned against any
clamor for the destruction of wild birds. A spokesman, Andre Farrer, said:
"If you kill wild birds, it would not only be highly likely to be
ineffective, but also would be likely to disperse the birds in a highly
unpredictable manner."
Although migrating flocks could bring bird flu to Britain, it is also
possible that travelers to areas where there have been outbreaks could
return with it. There are no plans to screen for it at ports or airports,
because flu is infectious before symptoms show.
But GPs are being warned to look out for patients who might have had a
travel history. Tests could show within hours whether a patient had a virus
of the H5N1 type which has caused such problems in Southeast Asia.
If a pandemic arrives, the government hopes its ordering of 14.6 million
courses of antiviral drugs for those most at risk, plus 2 million courses
of vaccines for key workers, even though these might not be effective
against a new strain of flu, could hold the line against it while other
measures were developed.
Officials hope to learn from problems in the Netherlands, where bird flu
struck 2 years ago. A vet died, and at least 1000 people were infected.

[Dutch investigators reached the following conclusions, following a survey
in pigs carried out during the H7N7 epizootic of 2003:
"Our conclusions from these results, so far, are:
1] Swine in mixed herds with infected poultry are at risk for introduction
of avian influenza, subtype H7N7.
2] Swine in mixed herds with no infected poultry or swine in herds with no
poultry at all are at no significant risk for introduction of avian
influenza, subtype H7N7.
3] No evidence was found for (ongoing) transmission between pigs. Most of
the infections seem to be transmitted from poultry to swine, either
directly or indirectly.
4] No evidence was found that the virus is able to remain for a long period
in the swine herds after the removal of the source of infection, namely the
infected poultry.
5] It seems most likely that no residual avian influenza virus was present
in any of the swine herds tested.

Europe steps up attempt to halt lethal pandemic
-----------------------------------------------
Dutch poultry farmers complied with a government order to move all their
birds indoors yesterday [22 Aug 2005], as Europe stepped up its efforts to
prevent a potentially deadly bird flu pandemic this winter.
Germany plans to follow suit by ordering that all free-range birds be moved
indoors in the middle of next month [September 2005] to prevent contact
with birds arriving from the East that may be carrying the virus.
On Thursday [25 Aug 2005], experts from the European Union's 25 member
states are to meet in Brussels to coordinate contingency plans to combat
the threat.
Britain and other EU states are monitoring poultry health closely and
stocking vaccines for use in the event of an epidemic.
Over the weekend [20-21 Aug 2005], Italy announced stricter import
controls, heightened surveillance and accelerated vaccine production.
European worries about bird flu have mounted with evidence that H5N1, the
latest strain, found in western China last month [July 2005], has been
moving steadily westwards. It has now reached Siberia, and experts are
saying that migratory fowl could bring it to Western Europe this autumn.
Discovered in China in 1997, bird flu has infected 112 human beings since
2003, killing 57 in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. So far,
human beings who contracted the disease got it from handling birds, but the
World Health Organization fears that it might mutate into a human strain
that could cause a global pandemic.
The Dutch have taken the most drastic action in Europe so far, because the
country was badly hit in the previous outbreak in 2003. The European
Commission banned the import of live birds and feathers from Russia this
month [August 2005]. Yesterday [22 Aug 2005], it insisted that its measures
so far were adequate.
The Commission said: "We are following the situation closely, but we are
not alarmist." The authorities in Siberia and Kazakhstan ordered the
slaughter of thousands of birds during the past 2 weeks, and 142 000
chickens are being monitored as possibly infected on a poultry farm near
Omsk, western Siberia.
The Commission said that it had been assured by Russia that reports of an
outbreak west of the Urals, near the Caspian Sea, were false.
Experts have been predicting that ducks and other birds will carry the
virus southwestwards as they flee the autumn chill, heading across the
Black Sea and southern Europe.
Some 850 000 reach Britain later in the autumn every year, including the
mallard and pochard ducks that are thought to have brought the disease from
Asia to Russia.
While the EU and national officials played down the danger, some experts
are talking of potential catastrophe on the scale of the 1919 influenza
epidemic, if H5N1 changes into a virus that can be transmitted from human
being to human being. Tens of millions could die, and the world economy
could be pushed into its biggest slump since the Great Depression of the
1930s, pessimists say.
The Australian Government has plans to seal off the country from the world,
closing air and sea ports, in the event of an Asian bird flu outbreak. Its
contingency plan also calls for compulsory quarantine, closing schools,
public transport and places of work.
French environmentalists are criticizing the Government for complacency.
Edir Delhaye, of Cap21, a small environmentalist party, said that France
was especially vulnerable because of its large number of free-range poultry
farms and the popularity of shooting migratory water birds. He said: "It is
vital that we rapidly take measures like the Netherlands and Germany."
Renate Kunast, the Agriculture Minister and a Green Party member, has been
campaigning on a safety-first ticket.
"We have to proceed systematically and with an eye on the risks," she said.
The minister sees the biggest risk coming from the illegal animal trade.
The customs service has tightened controls on imported birds. German
travelers have been warned against visiting bird markets and any kind of
livestock trading center east of the Urals.

EU to Consider Coordinated Action on Avian Influenza (Update 3)
-----------------------------------------------
The European Union will this week [4th week August 2005] consider
coordinated action across the bloc to prevent an outbreak of avian
influenza, after the Dutch and German governments announced bans on keeping
poultry outdoors.
"We remain open to reviewing the measures in force if we consider that's
required," said Philip Tod, a spokesman for the European Commission in
Brussels. "We have to stay vigilant."
Veterinary representatives will discuss the issue on 25 Aug 2005 after the
Dutch government this week [4th week August 2005] took action to prevent
contact between farmed poultry and their wild relatives. The German
agriculture ministry plans a similar ban on keeping birds outside by 15 Sep
2005.
Bird flu has infected 108 people in Asia and killed half of them since
2004, 3 health agencies including the World Health Organization said last
month [July 2005]. More than 140 million chickens have been slaughtered in
the region because of concern that H5N1, a deadly strain of the avian flu
virus, may mutate into a form easily transmissible between humans.
The EU on 8 Aug 2005 added Russia and Kazakhstan to a list of 9 nations
whose poultry exports are banned following outbreaks of the disease. The
bloc may decide to step up monitoring of wild birds to ensure that the
virus isn't spread along migratory routes, Tod said.
French Agriculture Minister Dominique Bussereau yesterday [22 Aug 2005]
wrote to bird breeders to remind them to remain vigilant about the threat,
according to a statement from his department.
Britain won't advise its poultry keepers to follow the Dutch and German
example, because "we do not think that response is proportionate to the
risk," the U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said
in a statement. "Obviously, we will maintain high levels of vigilance and
advise poultry keepers to keep high levels of biosecurity, as always."
The Italian and Belgian authorities said in separate statements in the past
week [3rd week August 2005] that they are monitoring the situation.

Penning poultry indoors doesn't eliminate risk of bird flu spread officials say
-----------------------------------------------
Nervous about the threat migratory birds may pose for the spread of avian
influenza, a number of European countries are looking at requiring poultry
operations to keep their flocks in barns.
But health leaders from Canada and the United States insisted Tuesday [23
Aug 2005] that moving poultry flocks indoors doesn't guarantee their safety
from deadly avian flu strains and may actually make them more susceptible
to illnesses.
Dr. Karen Becker, a veterinarian with the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, said it would be hard to argue in favor of such a
"Draconian" order at this point, given that infectious diseases often sweep
through poultry operations where flocks are raised entirely in chicken houses.
"There's no data to know whether outdoors or indoors would protect these
birds," said Becker, a senior health adviser in the department's public
health emergency preparedness division.
Becker led a teleconference Tuesday [23 Aug 2005] during which public
health officials from the United States and Canada discussed a variety of
pandemic preparedness issues.
In the wake of news that migratory birds appear to have transported the
H5N1 avian influenza strain to parts of Russia, European governments are
boosting biosecurity on the assumption the virus's migration westward will
continue.
The Netherlands, which was hit by a nasty outbreak of an H7N7 avian flu in
2003, has ordered poultry operators to keep chickens indoors. Germany is
considering a similar move.
Dr. Arlene King of the Public Health Agency of Canada said too little is
known about the flight paths of migratory birds to quantify the risk that
they might bring the H5N1 virus to North America.
"We simply don't know what wild water fowl are carrying," she said.
Dr. Perry Kendall, chief medical officer of health for British Columbia,
said that province's H7N3 avian flu outbreak in 2004 showed the chickens
kept indoors were more vulnerable than those kept outside.
"You've got 10 000 birds all in a small shed, packed in together; they act
like a petri dish," Kendall explained in an interview.
"The intensely farmed birds tend to be very genetically similar. The
methods of farming result in them being actually more frail and more
vulnerable to diseases, particularly since there are so many of them in
such a small volume (space)."
Penning chickens indoors may keep them from sharing a pond with migratory
birds, but it won't necessarily shelter them from avian flu viruses,
Kendall said. Farm staff can tramp virus-laced bird droppings into a
chicken house on their boots. Tractors can move viruses from farm to farm.
Indoor poultry operations only keep birds safe from disease if stringent
biosecurity standards are maintained, he noted.
"You need to ramp up your biosecurity level to what you see in a laboratory
if you really want to keep infections out of the barns."

[During the 2003 H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands, investigations revealed
infections in some "kept wild birds" (tamed ducks and mute swans), sampled
in the vicinity of infected poultry farms; no infections were found in
wild, free roaming birds of approximately 24 species. A similar situation
was observed during the H5N1 2004 outbreak in Thailand. These and similar
observations do not preclude the possibility of migratory birds playing
some or even a significant role in the epidemiology of avian influenza but
underline the absence of evidence, at least regarding the currently
spreading highly pathogenic strain(s). On the other hand, biosecurity
measures, including control upon movements of humans, fomites, and
particularly live birds and their products, are of essential importance. It
will be interesting to follow the decisions obtained during tomorrow's
deliberations in Brussels. - Mod.AS]
