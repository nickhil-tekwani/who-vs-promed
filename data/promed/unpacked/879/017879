Worst case of ascochyta blight ever seen on lentil crops in SA
--------------------------------------------------------------
Wet weather across South Australia has caused the worst outbreak of
ascochyta blight on lentil crops. The fungal disease has caused
dramas in lentil paddocks on Yorke Peninsula and in the mid north, as
well vetch crops near Saddleworth.

SARDI's [South Australian Research and Development Institute] Jenny
Davidson says it's the highest levels of ascochyta ever seen on
lentils in South Australia. "What's happened over the last 10 years
is, on Yorke Peninsula in particular, we've had a very tense rotation
of lentils [and so] the fungus has built up. It's causing a problem
in [some susceptible varieties]. It's not a problem when it comes to
yield loss, but there's a potential for rejection of the grain
because it can cause staining on the seed."

Farmers are being advised to spray their lentils to slow the spread
of the fungal disease, however there are concerns fungicide supply
could run low if the wet weather persists.

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of lentil is caused by the fungus _Didymella
lentis_ (previously _Ascochyta lentis_). It can decrease yields by up
to 50 percent and also reduces seed quality and thus grain value
considerably. Symptoms include light brown spots (lesions) surrounded
by dark margins on all aerial parts of the host. Leaf yellowing, some
defoliation, and necrosis of stem tips may also occur. Purple-brown
discolouration and shrivelling of seeds result from pod infections.
Occasionally, infected seeds may be asymptomatic increasing the risk
of pathogen spread. AB develops rapidly and epidemic levels can be
reached in cold and wet conditions. Infection can occur at any growth
stage, but is most detrimental during flowering and podding.

The pathogen is seed borne and also spread by splashing rain, wind,
mechanical means, and with infected plant material. It can survive
for several years on seed and between seasons on infected crop
residue. Disease management may include removal of stubble (such as,
by burning, burrowing, or grazing), crop rotation, use of certified
disease free seed, and fungicides as seed treatment and foliar
applications. Lentil varieties with different levels of resistance
are available. More aggressive fungal strains have emerged in recent
years leading to resistance breakdown in some lentil cultivars.

Vetch (_Vicia_ species), which is also reported above to be affected
by _D. lentis_, is used as a pasture legume and to regenerate
nitrogen-poor soils.

A serious outbreak of ascochyta blight of chickpea caused by
_Mycosphaerella rabiei_ (previously _Ascochyta rabiei_) is currently
affecting crops in other Australian states (ProMED-mail posts
20100903.3145 and 20100802.2589). Although the 2 pathogens are now
being classified into different genera, the same common name derived
from their previous classification into the same genus is still used
for both of the diseases.
