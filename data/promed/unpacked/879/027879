Two cases of East African trypanosomiasis have been diagnosed in tourists
following short visits to the Serengeti park Tanzania.
On 15 May 2000, a 37 year old American short-term traveler was diagnosed
with acute trypanosomiasis (_T. brucei rhodesiense_) at the CIWEC Clinic
GeoSentinel site in Nepal. A week before arriving in Nepal, the patient had
received multiple tsetse fly bites during a 2 day safari in the Serengeti
National Park in Tanzania. The patient was transferred to Massachusetts
General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA for treatment.
On 22 Oct 2000 a British tourist was diagnosed at the Hospital for Tropical
Diseases GeoSentinel Site in London, as having trypanosomiasis (_T. brucei
rhodesiense_) after a 3 day visit to the Serengeti followed by week stay in
Mombasa. He noted tsetse activity in the Serengeti.
Both cases presented with a chancre at the site of infection, fever and
other non specific symptoms.
We would like to know if any other cases of trypanosomiasis have been noted
in visitors to this region of East Africa and to bring to the attention of
clinicians dealing with returned travellers, the ongoing transmission of
this infection, even during short term exposure.

These 2 cases were presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine
and Hygiene meeting last week and are unusual given that 2 cases have
recently occurred in rapid succession in tourists with very brief exposure.
The GeoSentinel network database from our 26 global sites (going back 3
years) contains no other cases of East African trypanosomiasis in
travelers. This enquiry is being circulated to GeoSentinel, TropNet Europ,
and ProMed [ProMED-mail to ascertain whether there are further cases.
Comments from those on the ground in Tanzania on increased recent activity
in local populations would be interesting as well.

[Trypanosomiasis occurs all over Tanzania but is most prevalent in a belt
from Kigoma at lake Tanganyika to Arusha in Northern Tanzania, which is
close to Serengeti National park. No recent data from national sources are
available, but the GIDEON database report 250 cases in 1995 (latest year),
but also notes that the true number are in thousands. There are only few
previous reports of trypanosomiasis in tourists (Ponce-de-Lyon et al. Clin
Infect Dis 1996,23:847-8; Otte et al. Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd
1995,139:2100-4). The 2 cases reported here raise concern that
trypanosomiasis is emerging in the Serengeti National park, and data on
tsetse densities in the park and its vicinity would be appreciated.
Trypanosomiasis in Tanzania spread from the Congo at the beginning of the
last century and it is a possibility that an increase in trypanosomiasis in
Eastern Tanzania is a consequence of the emergence of trypanosomiasis in
the Congo over the last few years. The cases justify an investigation of
tsetse flies in Serengeti to find out whether any hot spots for
transmission have been established. - Mod.EP
