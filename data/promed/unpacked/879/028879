An outbreak of anthrax has been reported in the Kursk region of Stavropol
oblast. The administration of Rospotrebnadzor (Territorial Directorate of
the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare) for
Stavropol informed IA Regnum that a resident of the village of Avalovo died
on 12 May 2007. The case was reported on 10 May 2007, after the owner of a
[sick] bull calf slaughtered it in [his yard.]
Currently, anti-epidemic, organizational, and anti epizootic measures are
being taken in the village, Rospotrebnadzor reports. The main prophylactic
measures are the immunization of animals and compliance with
veterinarian-sanitary rules for preparation, storage, transportation, and
processing of materials [of animal origin.]
Note: the territory of Stavropol is not favorable for anthrax. [sic] Cases
of anthrax among animals and humans are being registered periodically in
the constantly bad areas.

[Anthrax has long been a problem in the livestock of this oblast, though
presently the incidence is a mere fraction of what it once was. In
addition, the Russian authorities seem only to report cases that involve
humans, and it may be that livestock cases without human involvement are
underobserved and underreported. How this bull calf became infected is
unclear. Suckling animals rarely get anthrax and are not vigorous grazers.
On the other hand, it might have been a yearling animal, not strictly a
"calf". - Mod.MHJ]

[A resident] of the Kursk region of Stavropol oblast died in the Mozdok
regional hospital of North Ossetia. He was admitted to hospital last week
with [probable] signs of anthrax. The Ministry of Urgent Situations of
Russia in the Southern Federal District informed the "Interfax" agency that
the 48 year old man slaughtered [and butchered] a bull calf in [his yard]
and sold the meat in the market. There are reasons to believe that the bull
had had anthrax.
Those who could have bought and consumed the infected meat are being
traced. It has been clarified that the meat had been sold in the territory
of Kabardino-Balkaria but the buyers have not been identified yet.
Specialists from the anti-plague station took specimens from the yard and
from the carcass, and the results will be available by Wednesday.
The administration of Rospotrebnadzor stated that the cause of infection
could have been a contaminated soil nidus. The man slaughtered the bull
being forced to do it [Sense not clear. -Mod.MHJ]. It is known that the
animal was vaccinated. The person could have [become infected] while
butchering the carcass.

[The fact that the animal was vaccinated does not mean that 100 per cent
protection was achieved. The protective antibodies could fail to be
produced for some reason. The man could have acquired the infection either
from the animal or from the soil. The rapid course of the disease and the
absence of information about local signs indicate that the disease took a
generalized (septic) course. At the end of last year (2006), 2 other fatal
cases were registered in the neighboring area of Ossetia-Alania. (see
reference below). - Mod.NP
Human infections from soil are, frankly, exceptionally rare. The only
reliable case that this writer knows of was when some men were illegally
salvaging some steel buried in an abandoned car factory site in Georgia,
which had also been used as a cattle grave for anthrax infected cows. The
Russian/Soviet literature quotes cases, but the authorities there
investigate human cases vigorously and if there is any evidence of the
illegal slaughtering and butchering of (sick) animals, court cases and
fines follow. Thus, reports exist of agricultural workers getting cutaneous
anthrax after hoeing cabbages and no animals had died.
How this man was "forced" to slaughter this animal is hard to understand.
The usual situation is that when faced with a moribund animal, the owner
will kill and butcher it hoping to get something for the meat when sold to
his neighbors or in a local market. Competent veterinary authorities
actively discourage such activities, even if the animal is going just for
domestic consumption. However, the continuing incidence of Russian human
cases indicates a veterinary shortcoming there in the rural areas.
We are hearing more and more these days of ineffective livestock vaccines.
On the other hand, if this animal had been vaccinated while still with
maternal immunity, the latter would have affected the ability of the live
vaccine to multiply and stimulate antibodies. Time will tell. If the local
vaccine is poor, there will be reports this coming summer of vaccinated
cattle succumbing to the disease. - Mod.MHJ
