[The exemplary report above has been submitted as soon as the results of the last, final test, namely IVPI, which indicated the high pathogenicity of the causative H5N2 strain, were obtained.

In the past, both high- and low-pathogenic H5N2 strains were identified in Taiwan. Following the outbreak in March 2012, serological investigations were applied in human contacts to exclude possible infection (see ProMED-mail posting 20120423.1111010).

Penghu county is an archipelago off the western coast of Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait consisting of 64 small islands and islets covering an area of 141 square km [54.5 sq mi]. An interactive map is included in the OIE report available at the source URL above. - Mod.AS
