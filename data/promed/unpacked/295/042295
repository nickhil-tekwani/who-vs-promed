A total of 10 people died and a larger number of people from 4
villages were hospitalized after they consumed wild boar meat.

Paubo block of Pauri district, including the village of former
Uttarakhand chief minister and BJP [Bhartiya Janta Party] national
vice-president Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, has been affected.

The villagers died from trichinosis, caused by eating raw or
undercooked pork or bush meat infected with the larvae of
trichinella.

On Sunday [16 Oct 2011], Nishank visited Pauri District Hospital and
directed the chief medical superintendent and doctors to ensure proper
treatment and provide all necessary medical facilities to the
_Trichinella_ infected patients. Nishank also visited his native
village Pinani and Shival, Gadigaon, and Charghad to enquire about
those who had fallen sick.

Deputy chief medical officer Dr KD Sharma told The Pioneer that so
far, 10 people had died after eating the infected meat, while the
condition of 18 admitted to hospital remains serious. Sharma added
that the villagers consumed the wild boar meat on 9 Sep 2011,
following which some of the infected persons went for treatment to the
All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and other hospitals in
Delhi and returned to the district after that.

The 1st death occurred about 10 days ago while the latest deaths
occurred during this weekend [15-16 Oct 2011]. Dr Mukesh Sundriyal of
Pauri District Hospital identified trichinosis as the cause. The
larvae can be detected by conducting a muscular biopsy.

The 1st symptoms of the illness are evident after 4 to 10 days but the
parasite migrates in the human body within 4 to 10 weeks and can
become active at any time during this period.

Death is caused by the effect of the parasite on the brain,
respiratory system, and cardiac system. Sundriyal emphasised that
everyone who had eaten the infected pork should undergo a
haemagglutination blood test and take the prescribed medicines in
order to avert serious or even fatal consequences.

[A recent review (Gottstein B, et al. Epidemiology, diagnosis,
treatment and control of trichinellosis. Clin Microbiol Rev 2009;
22(1): 127-45;
http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/22/1/127?view=long&pmid=19136437)
indicates that _Trichinella pseudospiralis_ has been reported from
Mumbai, but information from the rest of India is lacking. A map from
the same paper of the worldwide distribution of _Trichinella_ spp. can
be found at http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/22/1/127/F3?ck=nck

Wild boar is a well known source of infection with trichinella. The
reported mortality is very high and this suggests that there are many
undiagnosed cases. The report does not contain detailed information on
how the boar meat was consumed, especially whether it was used in
sausages for wider distribution which would result in more cases.

We assume that the diagnosis was made by a test for specific
antibodies against trichinella as muscle biopsy will have a low
sensitivity and it is an invasive procedure.
