The Minnesota Board of Animal Health confirmed today [7 Jun 2013] that one 4-year-old cow in Pennington County died of anthrax earlier this week. This is the 1st documented case of the disease in Minnesota since 2008.

The cow was found dead on the farm on Monday [3 Jun 2013]. Samples were collected on Tue 4 Jun 2013 and were sent to the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota. The Board received confirmation of the positive anthrax diagnosis on 6 Jun 2013. The herd had not been vaccinated for the disease and will remain under quarantine for 30 days after the last death.

The board recommends vaccination as an inexpensive way to protect animals from anthrax. "Since 2000, all reported cases of anthrax have been confined to northwest Minnesota," said Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Dr. Linda Glaser. "It makes sense for producers in that area to consider vaccination."

Grazing animals are most likely to become infected with the disease after periods of heavy rain, flooding, or excavation. Cases usually occur in areas where animals have previously died of anthrax. Anthrax is not spread by animal-to-animal contact. Any animal in northwestern Minnesota that dies suddenly of unknown causes should be treated as an anthrax suspect. Producers should contact their veterinarian immediately to collect blood samples for testing. Necropsies should not be performed on suspect carcasses as the procedure could result in contamination of surrounding soil. Suspected cases of anthrax must be reported to the Board at 651-296-2942.

[Our thanks to Linda for this report.

Pennington county is in the northwest corner of Minnesota near the border with North Dakota in a part of the state where anthrax has occurred in the past; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/minnesota_1990.jpg.

In 2006, the state was severely afflicted, with 25 outbreaks affecting cattle, bison, and horses. But it had only one case in 2007, an unvaccinated bull, and 2 cases in 2008, and these cows had been grazing where cases had been seen in the past. Prior to that, there were 5 northeast outbreaks in 3 counties in 2005 involving 23 cases, and, previously, 18 outbreaks in the Roseau valley in 2001 affecting cattle and horses, and in the adjoining counties in Manitoba. There is an enzootic risk in this part of Minnesota, which presently can only be held at bay by vaccination.

As others will have not maintained their vaccination status, I fear we must expect more outbreaks in northeast Minnesota. - Mod.MHJ
