An unidentified victim of the fungal meningitis outbreak has suffered a recurrence a full year after the outbreak, prompting an immediate effort by a Nashville hospital to contact other known victims to detect other possible relapses. The recurrence was acknowledged late Friday, 4 Oct 2013, by Rebecca Climer, spokeswoman for Saint Thomas Health, who said the hospital is in the process of contacting the original victims to ask about their current status.

"The patient was admitted to Saint Thomas West Hospital on 3 Oct 2013 and is now receiving appropriate treatment at the hospital," Climer said in a prepared statement. She said the patient had contracted fungal meningitis in the original outbreak linked to receiving a contaminated steroidal injection.

The statement came after an inquiry by The Tennessean after it received a call from one of the original patients who had been called by the hospital. "As a precautionary measure," Climer wrote in the statement, "Saint Thomas West Hospital staff is currently contacting former patients previously diagnosed with fungal meningitis to inquire about their health status and urge them to be alert to the following possible symptoms." She said the symptoms include persistent and severe headache, worsening back pain, and unexplained fever.

The disclosure comes a year after news of the outbreak became public. 16 patients treated in Tennessee died and 153 were sickened. The outbreak has been blamed on a now-closed Massachusetts drug compounding firm that sent out thousands of vials of fungus-tainted methylprednisolone acetate.

The local patients received the spinal injections at the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgical Center in Nashville, 1 of 3 Tennessee facilities to purchase spinal steroids from the New England Compounding Center. The neurosurgical center is owned in equal shares by the Saint Thomas Health Network and the Howell Allen Clinic.

Though relapses or recurrences have been reported, they are more likely to occur within a few months of the original infection. The current case is the 1st to be reported a full year after the outbreak became public. In an article published in June 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine, physicians from Virginia and the CDC reported on the case of an 80-year-old man who became ill in early October [2012] and suffered a recurrence in March [2013]. "This shows the possibility for relapsed infection among patients after more than 4 months of antifungal therapy," the study states.

Dr William Schaffner, who heads the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said recurrences "have been our concern all along."

"I'm sure that it's very concerning to the patients and their families and physicians," Schaffner said. "We would hope that this doesn't indicate more recurrences will follow."

Under a contract awarded by the CDC earlier this year [2013], a follow-up study on the fungal meningitis victims is being conducted by Dr Peter Pappas at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In a telephone interview Friday [4 Oct 2013], Pappas said it was too early to draw conclusions about the relapse. He said that Saint Thomas was one of the focal points of the study, which is just getting underway. He said recurrences are "fairly common" with fungal infections.

Officials at the FDA and the CDC said they could not immediately respond to questions due to the budget crisis and the resulting lack of staff.

[As of September 2013, the case count of _Exserohilum_ infections associated with contaminated steroids compounded for injection was 750, involving 20 states and causing 64 deaths.

As stated in the posting, relapses in fungal meningitis, such as those due to _Coccidioides immitis_, can relapse even after a prolonged period of time.

In the relative absence of the governmental agencies, information regarding the risk of late relapses may be slow to be disseminated. - Mod.LL
