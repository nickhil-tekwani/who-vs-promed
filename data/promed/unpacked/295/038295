Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary carcasses tested for anthrax
------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax may have been discovered among bison in the
Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary. 4 bison carcasses were discovered on 13
Aug 2010 and since then 6 more have been found. The carcasses have
been treated with chemicals and burned, and samples were sent to the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency lab in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada,
for testing for anthrax.

"We haven't confirmed it's anthrax yet because we haven't got the
results back from the lab," said Ella Stinson, a spokesperson for the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources. "We're kind of
waiting in limbo right now."

The carcasses were found within 4 kilometres of each other, about 27
km [16.8 miles] northwest of Fort Providence in the area of Mills
Lake. They were spotted by aerial surveys. The last anthrax outbreak
in the sanctuary was in 1993.

There has been one confirmed anthrax outbreak in the NWT this summer.
The outbreak in the Slave River Lowlands, about 80 km [50 miles]
southeast of Fort Resolution, was declared over on 10 Aug 2010 after
killing 45 bison.

Meanwhile, results of testing had not yet returned as of late last
week on samples from dead bison found in Wood Buffalo National Park.
2 carcasses were discovered within a day of each other in late July
off Highway 5, about 140 km northwest of Fort Smith. [In fact these 2
dead bison were confirmed anthrax cases on Mon 30 Aug 2010. They were
found and burnt on 27 an 28 Jul 2010. Both were estimated to have
been dead for 10 days. One had been bear scavenged. - MHJ]

One other dead bison was later found in roughly the same area. That
carcass was not tested, but it was burned as a precaution like the
other 2 dead bison. [This was found on 31 Jul 2010, was mummified;
estimated to have been dead for 14 days; bear and raven scavenged;
burnt on 4 Aug 2010. - MHJ]

Earlier this month, another bison carcass was found along the Pine
Lake Road in the Alberta section of the park, but no samples were
taken for testing because of the advanced stage of decomposition.
[Found on 4th August on the old Mile 99 fire road; very decomposed so
not sampled. - MHJ]

Also, 2 other carcasses were found [on 18 Aug 2010] in the far
southern part of the park in the Peace-Athabasca Delta area. Samples
were taken for testing. [Both had been heavily scavenged by wolves;
been dead 7-14 days; carcasses and soils sampled. - MHJ]

The last anthrax outbreak in the park was in 2007. Bison can contract
the disease from spores in the ground while wallowing in dust.

[The details on the dead bison found and sampled in the WBNP were
generously provided by Ceiridwen Robbins, WBNP, Fort Chipewyan. The
1st 2 sampled have turned up positive; the next 2 were not sampled
because of advanced decomposition; and results are awaited from the
last 2 bison found in the Peace-Athabasca Delta.

The Parsons Lake Road - Pine Lake area had an outbreak in 2007 with
20 dead bison. There was an outbreak in the Peace River - Athabasca
Delta in 2001 with 58 dead bison and one moose; in the exact same
area in 2000 there were 48 dead bison there. So both areas had the
potential for significant contamination in spite of the thorough
efforts to minimize it.

Finding carcasses of dead bison takes a lot of effort, experience,
and skill. And remember, these are wood bison, not plains bison. They
like being in woodland. However hard one tries there will be the
occasional sporadic cases until any remaining spores are either dead
or too few to cause trouble. The Delta area was _very_ heavily
contaminated in 2000 and 2001. To have only 2 new cases after 9 years
is a clear sign of success.
