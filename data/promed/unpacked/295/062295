The Kaziranga National Park (KNP) authorities breathed sigh of relief after test confirmed that the 7 Asiatic wild buffaloes did not die of anthrax infection. Kaziranga divisional forest officer, Suvasish Das said that the final test on the samples of 7 carcasses showed negative result for anthrax. Das said that tests were done at the College of Veterinary Science (CVS) and Animal Research Laboratory (ARL). "We received confirmation from CVS and ARL that the samples from carcasses of seven buffaloes were tested negative for anthrax," Das said.

Kaziranga, a World Heritage Site about 250 km [about 155 mi] from here [Guwahati], has over 1000 Asiatic wild buffaloes besides rhinos, elephants, tigers, eastern swamp deer, among other wildlife life in 430 sq km [about 166 sq mi] area'.

Seven Asiatic wildlife buffaloes were found death on [10 Aug 2016], prompting the park officials to send samples from the carcasses to CVS for ascertaining the cause of deaths.

A preliminary test, however, indicated that the cause of death might be due to anthrax. "That is why we waited for the final test which takes at least 5 days to culture the anthrax bacteria. Now that the test showed negative to anthrax, we are relieved," a park official said. Given the fact that in 1955 there was a "sporadic" death of Asiatic wild buffaloes due to anthrax infection, park officials said that this time the 7 animals were disposed in adherence to all the standard precautionary measures, even before the final test results. "We used chemical treatments, as well as incineration of the carcasses, before burying all the remains according to the prescribed safety measures," the official added.

Das said that the tests for ascertaining the [actual] cause of deaths of 7 buffaloes are still on.

Kaziranga suffered a large-scale loss of wildlife in the flood last month [July 2016]. Over 300 different species of animals, including 22 rhinos were killed during the flood, one of the worst deluge the park experienced in last five years.

[The park officials made absolutely the correct decision to properly dispose of the carcasses by disinfection with formalin, incineration, and burial. And they also had 2 diagnostic labs cross check each other. Over the years I have acquired some experience, personal, direct, and indirect, with this pathogen and it regularly surprises me how sometimes even very competent laboratories can miss seeing it. So take 2 samples and use a 2nd lab if you doubt the first's findings.

With stains off the shelf there is a 20 percent chance of a false positive when reading stained blood smears. Better to use Michael Owen's M'Fadyean stain; see Michael P Owen, et al: A simple, reliable M'Fadyean stain for visualizing the _Bacillus anthracis_ capsule. J Microbiol Methods. 2013; 92(3): 264-9

The Asian buffalo (_Bubalus arnee_) is a large bovine native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is considered endangered, and their populations have declined by around 50 percent in the last decades. The most important threats include interbreeding with feral and domestic buffalo in and around protected areas; poaching; habitat loss; invasive species; disease and parasites transmitted by domestic livestock (such as, tuberculosis, brucellosis, foot and mouth disease, etc.), and competition with domestic livestock. - Mod.PMB
