[DM] and other farmers in Abothuguchi West said 2 cows died on [Sun 28 Oct 2018] at Karugwa area after they developed symptoms of the deadly disease. "They started oozing blood from their mouths and all other openings. We suspect it is anthrax, especially because a local vet said so. These areas are inhabited by people who depend on livestock so we fear we could lose more animals," said [DM] yesterday [30 Oct 2018].

More animals were reportedly also exhibiting symptoms of the disease at Muthingiki in Central Imenti.

Abothuguchi West MCA [Member of County Assembly] Patrick Muthuri asked the livestock department in the area to respond promptly to curb the spread of the disease. "Farmers in Abothuguchi West and surrounding areas are mainly in dairy farming. Their livelihoods are at risk if the spread of anthrax is not checked. They need an emergency vaccination for their herds since many are not in a position to meet vaccination costs at such a short notice," said [DM].

The ward rep advised farmers not to move their animals around to avoid them getting into contact with others that might already be infected.

Dr Julius Kinyua, a veterinary officer, said plans were underway to vaccinate the animals.

[Central Imenti is an electoral constituency in Kenya. It is one of 9 constituencies of Meru County. Meru is in central Kenya, in what was once the Eastern province; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/kenya.gif (former provinces) and https://informationcradle.com/kenya/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg (counties).

Kenya's Eastern province, still listed in the OIE annual animal health reports, is regularly afflicted with bovine anthrax, essentially every year; in 2017 (3 outbreaks, 3 bovine cases), 2016 (no statistics), 2015 (2, 8), 2014 (4, 12); 2013 (3, 3); 2012 (1, 1); 2011 (2, 3), and so on, and those are just the reported bovine outbreaks. Outbreaks involving sheep and goats are also seen, but less frequently reported. Unfortunately, livestock anthrax gets little attention from the Kenyan government. - Mod.MHJ
