Dr. Robert M. Chanock, Prominent Virologist, Dies at 86
-------------------
Dr. Robert M. Chanock, a pediatrician whose discoveries of viruses
led to far-reaching improvements in preventing and treating common
respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, died Friday [30
Jul 2010] in Sykesville, Md. He was 86.

His death, at an assisted living facility, was caused by
complications of Alzheimer's disease, the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. He had worked at the institute,
in Bethesda, Md., for 53 years and had lived in Bethesda.

"Dr. Chanock was one of the top 20 virologists in history and covered
a broad range of infectious diseases with an amazing productivity,"
Dr. Erling C. J. Norrby, a virologist and former secretary general of
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said in an interview on
Tuesday [3 Aug 2010].

Dr. Chanock 1st gained wide attention in 1957 with the discovery of
the human respiratory syncytial virus, one of the most common causes
of illness in the world. It can cause bronchiolitis, an infection of
the small airways in the lungs, especially among infants and young children.

As the head of research teams, he subsequently discovered 4 other
infectious agents, called para-influenza viruses, which include the
most important cause of severe croup in infants.

In 1962, a team led by Dr. Chanock showed that a bacterium,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, is a cause of atypical pneumonia, commonly
known as walking pneumonia, in which even extensive lung infection
may nonetheless not limit mobility. Additional studies showed that
antibiotics can cure Mycoplasma infections.

In 1968, Dr. Chanock became chief of the national institute's
laboratory of infectious diseases, where his colleagues and trainees
discovered still other viruses, including some that cause common colds.

In 1972, a colleague, Dr. Albert Z. Kapikian, used a technique known
as immune electron microscopy to discover what caused outbreaks of a
condition called explosive diarrhea, often occurring on cruise ships.
The virus, then called the Norwalk agent and now known as a
norovirus, each year affects an estimated 23 million Americans and
causes about 220 000 deaths in developing countries.

Dr. Chanock also led teams of epidemiologists in deciphering how the
viruses were transmitted and determining whom they most affected. And
he pursued, unsuccessfully, the development of vaccines against
respiratory syncytial virus and the para-influenza viruses.

"That turned out to be a very hard nut to crack," said Dr. Kenneth
McIntosh, a former colleague who is now professor of pediatrics at
Harvard Medical School, "and so we still, 40 to 50 years later, do
not have vaccines for these important viruses."

But Dr. Chanock's teams did develop a vaccine that the Food and Drug
Administration licensed to prevent 2 types of adenovirus infection, a
respiratory illness that often breaks out among troops living in
close quarters.

The teams also played important roles in developing vaccines against
the liver infection hepatitis A as well as against rotavirus, which
is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among infants and which
continues to be fatal to about half a million of them worldwide every year.

Further, the teams' research was important in the licensing of the
1st nasal spray form of influenza vaccine. And their experimental
immunizations against dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease
recently found to have infected people in Key West, FL, are in clinical trials.

Dr. Chanock was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.

"Never in the history of infectious diseases has one person developed
so much definitive information about the causes of so much human
disease in so short a period of time," Dr. Dorland Davis, another
leading scientist, wrote of Dr. Chanock in 1967.

Some virus experts today question whether that comment was
overstated, but few deny the significance of Dr. Chanock's
discoveries or fail to marvel at their rapid pace.

Robert Merritt Chanock was born [8 Jul 1924] in Chicago, where his
father, Theodore, converted his lamp factory to produce artillery
shells during World War II. After retiring in 1948, Theodore and his
wife, Frances, moved to California, where he became successful in the
hotel and early cable television businesses.

In high school, Dr. Chanock wanted to be a physicist. But after
drafting him in 1943, the Army gave him a choice of going to the
European front or, if he passed an examination, to medical school,
with military support. He took the 2nd option, attending the
University of Chicago, where he received undergraduate and medical
degrees. He interned at Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif. (now
part of the Alameda County Medical Center), before returning to the
University of Chicago to complete his pediatrics training.

In 1952 he was drafted again. On a flight to Korea to work on the
Japanese B virus, which causes encephalitis, an inflammation of the
brain, Dr. Chanock's appendix ruptured. Because of his condition,
Army regulations prevented him from going to Korea, and so he did
infectious-disease research in Tokyo.

After his discharge from the military, he worked with Dr. Albert B.
Sabin at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati. Dr. Sabin later developed
the oral polio vaccine. Dr. Chanock went on to do research and teach
at the University of Cincinnati and at Johns Hopkins University
before joining the national institute in Bethesda.

Survivors include a son,. Stephen, of Potomac MD, a doctor who is a
researcher at the National Cancer Institute, and 4 grandchildren. His
wife, the former Catherine Elizabeth Osgood, died last year; another
son, Foster, died in 1980.

Dr. Chanock customarily swam a mile a day in his pool at home. After
Alzheimer's robbed him of the ability to count laps, a family member
did it for him until he stopped swimming last October [2009].
