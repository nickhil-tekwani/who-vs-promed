Until recently, researchers believed that leprosy was caused by a single species of bacterium, _Mycobacterium leprae_. To the surprise of the leprosy research community, in 2008, a pathologist discovered an entirely new leprosy-causing species in the liver of a deceased man from Mexico. A new full genome sequence of the organism, _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, shows that despite having diverged 13.9 million years ago, the 2 leprosy-causing species are nevertheless remarkably similar, genetically. A team led by researchers from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland described the _M. lepromatosis_ genome in PNAS [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] this week (23 Mar 2015) [1].

"It appears, to me, to be a landmark paper which really provides a bounty of insight into this newly recognized and little-understood organism," said Richard Truman, chief of the laboratory research branch at the National Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Program in Baton Rouge, Louisiana [USA]. Truman, who was not involved in the research, said that _M. lepromatosis_ was originally only characterized using a few snippets of DNA, causing some skepticism in the community about whether it was truly a new species. The sequence, he added, ends any lingering confusion.

"It's a really beautiful study," said Xiang-Yang Han, the pathologist who discovered _M. lepromatosis_ [2]. Han, who analyzes patient samples at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, was not involved in the present study but said he has also sequenced the _M. lepromatosis_ genome and hopes to publish a sequence soon. He noted that his results are consistent with those described in the new paper.

Sequencing the _M. lepromatosis_ genome was no easy task. Both leprosy-causing species have lost large portions of their genomes and can only survive within host cells, so researchers can only isolate DNA from the bacteria from patient tissue samples. In infected human skin samples, 99 percent of isolated DNA is human.

Stewart Cole of Ecole Polytechnique Federale and his colleagues overcame this problem by isolating _M. lepromatosis_ DNA using an array of _M. leprae_ DNA, separating out human DNA using human DNA as bait, and simply doing deep sequencing on all DNA isolated from tissues, and then carefully combing the data to separate bacterial and human DNA.

At approximately 3.27 million base pairs, the _M. lepromatosis_ genome is comparable in size to the _M. leprae_ genome. Protein-coding genes are 93 percent identical in sequence between the 2 species, while the sequence of pseudogenes is 82 percent the same. This suggests that evolutionary pressures have led the bacteria to remain remarkably similar to one another, even though the species likely diverged 13.9 million years ago, the researchers noted.

By comparing the sequences, the researchers also concluded that large portions of the leprosy-causing bacterial genomes lost their functions before the 2 species diverged. This suggests that the ancestor of the 2 species already caused leprosy, according to study coauthor Andrej Benjak, a scientist in Cole's lab. "The ancestor evolved into an obligate intracellular organism, losing all the capabilities to survive outside the host," Benjak wrote in an e-mail to The Scientist. "After the split, the 2 species still kept losing some genes, 'fine tuning,' but this is nothing compared to what happened to their ancestor."

This likely explains why the species' genome structures remained so similar over millions of years. Because the leprosy-causing bacteria had already developed to occupy a precise niche and lost certain genes necessary for independent survival, they could only continue to survive by continuing to use a single, specialized strategy, the researchers proposed.

The team did find some differences between the species. For example, _M. lepromatosis_ has lost the ability to make some amino acids, while _M. leprae_ has lost a gene necessary for producing heme, an iron-holding structure. The reasons for these differences are not yet clear. "We cannot grow these bacteria in the lab, so we cannot conduct genetic experiments," explained Benjak.

In the limited number of _M. lepromatosis_ cases analyzed so far, researchers have noted that the bacterium is associated with diffuse lepromatous leprosy, a form of the disease in which the bacteria widely infiltrate the skin and cause a spotted appearance. This form of the disease has long been associated with leprosy cases in western Mexico and the Caribbean. However, _M. leprae_ can also cause these symptoms, so the researchers hope to examine more cases to fully characterize how the symptoms caused by the 2 species differ. It appears that _M. lepromatosis_ is treatable by the same antibiotics used to treat _M. leprae_, the authors noted.

Having this sequence at the ready will make detection of _M. lepromatosis_ easier, said Truman. "I don't think we know exactly where [this organism] has come from, or how it evolved, but a paper like this provides a backbone from which hypotheses can be made and new investigations can be launched," he said.

[_Mycobacterium leprae_ has been thought to exclusively cause leprosy. However, a prior study by Han et al (1) identified, on the basis of sequencing the 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene and 5 other genes, a new species of mycobacteria (_Mycobacterium lepromatosis_) that causes leprosy. (See ProMED-mail post Leprosy, new species - USA, Mexico, Singapore, archive number 20081126.3723.) Sequencing the 16S rRNA gene is a rapid and cheap alternative to phenotypic methods of bacterial species identification, especially for non-cultivable microorganisms like the mycobacterium that causes leprosy.

Han and colleagues found significant genetic differences with _Mycobacterium leprae_, including a 2.1 percent divergence of the 16S rRNA gene, a highly conserved marker of bacterial evolution, and 6 to 14 percent mismatches among 5 other less conserved genes. In all previously studied _M. leprae_ strains, no variation in the 16S rRNA gene had been noted at all. They found the new species _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_ in patients with diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL), a rare, but severe form of the disease, in Mexico and Singapore. At the time, Han et al said that they were attempting to sequence the entire _M. lepromatosis_ genome.

The current study referred to in the above news release (2) did just that; they sequenced nearly the entire genome of _M. lepromatosis_ present in a skin biopsy from a Mexican patient with DLL, and compared it with that of _M. leprae_, confirming the conclusions of the prior 2008 study.
