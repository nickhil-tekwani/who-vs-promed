Barangay health workers have distributed medicines for leptospirosis in different evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro, but more may be needed, according to the Department of Health. Authorities expressed fear there may be a rise in leptospirosis cases in flood-affected areas, as some 9000 residents from Cagayan de Oro alone are affected by flooding.

Meanwhile, thousands have fled to Butuan City after the Agusan River overflowed Tuesday [21 Jan 2014] due to 3 days of incessant rains spawned by Tropical Depression Agaton. Some 16 000 residents are now housed in different evacuation centers in Butuan City, with one classroom accommodating as much as 15 families or more than 20 individuals.

Meanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard conducted operations in Barangay Mahogany in Butuan City to rescue residents who have been trapped in the area for 2 days. Some residents, however, refused to leave their homes, reports said.

Classes in all levels remain suspended in Butuan City, but work suspension has been lifted as floodwaters have started to abate.

[A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines and is the native term for a village or neighborhood (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barangay). Butuan is a city in Agusan del Norte province, along the northwestern coast of Mindanao, the 2nd largest and southernmost island in the Philippines (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao). Mahogany is one of Butuan's 88 barangays (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Butuan_barangay_officials). Cagayan de Oro, the capital city of the province of Misamis Oriental, is 125.6 miles (202 km) southwest of Butuan City along the northern coast of Mindanao (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagayan_de_Oro). A map of the Philippines that shows the locations of Butuan and Cagayan de Oro can be found at https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&gl=us&daddr=Butuan+City,+Philippines&saddr=Cagayan+de+Oro.

Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.
