2000/062 Pepino mosaic potexvirus found in one tomato glasshouse in France
Pepino mosaic potexvirus (EPPO Alert List) has very recently been found on
tomato for the first time in France. It was observed in one glasshouse in
Guipavas, Bretagne, growing both tomato and cucumber (the virus only
attacks tomatoes). 3 hectares of glasshouse of tomato and cucumber will be
destroyed and the premises will be disinfected. The origin of this outbreak
is unknown.
Note: Pepino mosaic potexvirus was originally described in Peru on pepino
(_Solanum muricatum_). The EPPO Secretariat wondered whether this crop was
grown in Europe. Dr. F. Nuez kindly provided some information. Pepino is
beginning to be grown in Spain on a commercial scale, but this remains a
very small production (probably less than 10 ha). There are scattered small
fields, mainly on the Mediterranean coast, and pepino is essentially grown
under glass. There are reports of experimental fields in the Netherlands,
Germany, France, Poland, Belgium and Italy and of some commercial fields in
Israel.
