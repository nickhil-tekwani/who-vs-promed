Human contacts with oral rabies vaccine baits
---------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Baits laden with oral rabies vaccines are important for the management of wildlife rabies in the United States [and elsewhere]. In August 2012, the Wildlife Services program of the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service began a field trial involving limited distribution of a new oral rabies vaccine bait in 5 states, including Ohio. The vaccine consisted of live recombinant human adenovirus type 5 vector, expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (AdRG1.3) (Onrab). A previously used oral rabies vaccine consisting of a live recombinant vaccinia vector, expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (V-RG) (Raboral V-RG), was distributed in other areas of Ohio. To monitor human contacts and potential vaccine virus exposure, surveillance was conducted by the Ohio Department of Health, local Ohio health agencies, and CDC. During 23 Aug 2012 to 7 Sep 2012, a total of 776 921 baits were distributed in Ohio over 4379 square miles (11 341 square kilometers). During 24 Aug 2012 to 12 Sep 2012, a total of 89 baits were reported found by the general public, with 55 human contacts with baits identified (some contacts involved more than one bait). In 27 of the 55 human contacts, the bait was not intact, and a barrier (such as, gloves) had not been used to handle the bait, leaving persons at risk for vaccine exposure and vaccine virus infection. However, no adverse events were reported. Continued surveillance of human contacts with oral rabies vaccine baits and public warnings to avoid contact with baits are needed because of the potential for vaccine virus infection.

Wildlife accounts for more than 90 percent of the rabid animals reported in the United States, and raccoons are the species most frequently reported. Oral rabies vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the spread of rabies in reservoirs such as raccoons, coyotes, and foxes. Baits laden with oral rabies vaccine are distributed in strategic areas where target species can find and consume the baits, thereby releasing vaccine into their oral cavity. Oral rabies vaccination has contributed to the elimination of the red fox rabies virus variant and the canine rabies virus variant from several European countries and the United States, respectively, and has helped to prevent any appreciable spread of the raccoon rabies virus variant in the eastern United States.

V-RG has been used in the United States since 1990, with approximately 138 million doses released to date. Baiting strategies have attempted to minimize human contact with V-RG baits because of the risk for infection with the V-RG vaccine virus; only 2 human vaccinia infections have been reported from V-RG exposure. AdRG1.3 is an alternative to V-RG that might have a different human safety profile given the high prevalence of antibodies in humans to human adenovirus type 5 and the mild illness that typically results from infection with this virus. AdRG1.3 has been integrated successfully into raccoon rabies management programs in Canada and has shown promise when used at higher bait densities for eliminating residual rabies foci in skunks.

Outcome
-------
Before and during the 2012 distribution of baits, the Ohio Department of Health, Wildlife Services, and Ohio local health jurisdictions used print media, television, radio, and the Internet to raise awareness and provide guidance to the public regarding what to do if a bait was found by a person or domestic animal. Despite these efforts, 75 percent of persons who came in contact with a bait were unaware of the baiting operation. A human contact was recorded when a person reported either seeing or coming into physical contact with a single bait or multiple baits with or without a barrier such as gloves. Contacts were reported by calling the toll-free telephone numbers printed on all baits or by contacting local health departments directly.

Persons who came into physical contact with an intact bait (that is, a bait that was neither punctured nor leaking) did not require further follow-up, even if they did not use a barrier such as gloves, because vaccine exposure was not likely to have occurred. However, persons who came into physical contact with a bait that was not intact and who did not use a barrier such as gloves were considered to be potentially exposed to vaccine and at risk for vaccine virus infection. Attempts were made to contact all persons potentially exposed to vaccine 21 days after the event to ensure that their symptoms, if any, were reported. Persons who were immunocompromised, pregnant, aged less than 12 years, or cognitively impaired and persons with dermatologic conditions or a history of vaccine exposure to a mucosal membrane were contacted sooner than 21 days after the potential exposure.

During 23 Aug 2012 to 7 Sep 2012, a total of 776 921 baits were distributed by automobile in urban areas and by aircraft in rural areas of Ohio over an area of 4379 square miles (11 341 square kilometers). A total of 89 baits were reported found by the general population during 24 Aug 2012 to 12 Sep 2012 (11.5 baits found per 100 000 baits distributed).

Among the 89 baits found, 55 human contacts occurred (some human contacts involved more than one bait). 14 of the human contacts were with AdRG1.3 baits, and 41 were with V-RG baits. Among the 55 human contacts, 27 involved potential vaccine exposures. Among the AdRG1.3 bait contacts, 79 percent resulted in potential vaccine exposure, compared with 39 percent of V-RG bait contacts (odds ratio: 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval: 1.4-23.8). Only 5.8 percent of persons physically contacting a bait used a barrier such as gloves.

Of the persons who had potential vaccine exposures, 5 also had one of the conditions that required closer follow-up. 3 of these incidents occurred with AdRG1.3 and involved a boy aged 11 years, a pregnant woman, and a woman with eczema. The other 2 incidents occurred with V-RG in women who had autoimmune conditions and were on immunosuppressive medications. No adverse events were reported among these 5 persons or among the other persons who contacted baits.

A total of 38 (79 percent) of the 48 reports of human contact involved domestic animals, and all of the animals were dogs. One animal adverse event resulted from an AdRG1.3 bait temporarily obstructing a dog's airway, but the dog survived. 2 other adverse events were reported for V-RG baits in which the dogs regurgitated the baits.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Surveillance during rabies vaccine baiting operations in Ohio suggests that human and domestic animal contacts with baits are rare. Overall, fewer human contacts with baits were reported in 2012 than in the preceding 2 years: 55 in 2012, compared with 83 in both 2010 and 2011 (Ohio Department of Health, unpublished data, 2012).

In 2012, AdRG1.3 was distributed for the 1st time in Ohio. The rate of 4.4 reports of AdRG1.3 bait contacts per 100 000 baits distributed was higher than rates observed in Canada and in the 1st AdRG1.3 field trial in the United States in rural West Virginia in 2011 (Wildlife Services, US Department of Agriculture, unpublished data, 2012). However, no adverse events were reported as a result of human contacts with baits in Ohio, Canada, or West Virginia (Wildlife Services, US Department of Agriculture, unpublished data, 2013).

Baits laden with oral rabies vaccine play an important role in the management of rabies in wildlife. An oral rabies vaccine consisting of a recombinant vaccinia vector (V-RG) has been used in the United States for over 20 years; during this time only 2 cases of human vaccinia infection from human contact with vaccine in the baits have been reported. An oral rabies vaccine consisting of a recombinant human adenovirus type 5 vector (AdRG1.3) is now being field tested in the United States to assess its safety and immunogenicity. A total of 55 human contacts with the baits were reported, with potential vaccine exposure in 27 of the human contacts (11 with AdRG1.3 and 16 with V-RG). No adverse events were reported. However the efficacy of the vaccine in inducing protection to rabies virus infection is not known, but on theoretical grounds the adenovirus vectored rabies antigen should be less hazardous than the vaccinia-vectored rabies vaccine used in Europe an North America in the past. These experiments do measure the effectiveness of the adenovirus vectored vaccine in controlling rabies in wildlife, not merely its safety in the environment. It would have been interesting to know if the few domestic dogs who encountered thee bait had developed a protective immune response. - Mod.CP]
