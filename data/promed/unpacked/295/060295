Mozambican government lifts ban on fishing
-----------------------------------------
MAPUTO, Jan 5 (AFP) - Mozambican health authorities on Tuesday lifted
a ban imposed on all fishing off the coast of the northern province
of Cabo Delgado after the deaths of scores of people from eating
contaminated fish.
The ministry said a total of 890 people out of some 16 000 cases died
of either poisoning or cholera also affecting the province since
August.
No fresh cases of diarrhoea and vomiting caused by the poisoning have
been reported in recent weeks. The ban had been imposed for a month.
The similarities between the early symptoms of the poisoning and
cholera are apparently behind the government's failure to establish
the exact number of people who died in the epidemic.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi has demanded a complete
investigation into the nature of the pesticide that contaminated fish
products in the province and exactly how the chemicals entered the
province's Indian Ocean coastal waters.
Laboratory tests carried out so far showed the presence of
organochlorate pesticides. Tests conducted on squid and octopus
showed no sign of contamination, but a high rate of contamination in
lobsters.
