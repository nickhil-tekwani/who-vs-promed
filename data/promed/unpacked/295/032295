Bird flu kills quail in Indonesia's Central Java
-----------------------------------------------
The bird flu virus has killed thousands of quail on Indonesia's main island
of Java since February 2005, the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday [28
Mar 2005].

H.R. Wasito, director-general of animal husbandry at the ministry, said
some 60 000 quail had either died from the disease or had been culled at
farms in Central Java province. The province's farmed quail population was
around 130 000.

New cases of the H5N1 virus on a small scale have re-emerged in some parts
of Indonesia since it was 1st found in late 2003. The authorities have
insisted that, overall, the deadly disease is under control.

Wasito said that in the January-March 2005 period, bird flu had killed a
total of 281 730 fowl in 3 provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java and
Central Java.

The Indonesian government has said bird flu is endemic and that it would
take years to fully stamp out the disease that has swept large parts of
Asia since late 2003.

So far, there have been no reports of the deadly H5N1 strain, which has
killed 49 people in Asia, infecting people in Indonesia.

[Indonesia's last HPAI follow-up report, received by the OIE on 10 Mar
2005, referred to outbreaks in Sulawesi Selatan Province, reportedly caused
by highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1. The outbreaks
that, according to the current newswire, have taken place during
January-March 2005 in West Java and Central Java have yet to be officially
reported.

In case genetic studies of Indonesian H5N1 virus strains -- similar to the
ones described in posting 20050314.0746, involving Vietnamese strains --
are being carried out, their results will be of interest, in particular,
data on the relationship of these strains to other recent Asian H5N1 virus
strains and their virulence to various avian and mammal species. - Mod.AS]
