Press Release
Contact Information: John Sauls, Animal Control, 919-245-2081
Orange County Animal Control today reported that a raccoon it had sent to
the state public health lab has tested positive for rabies.
On Wed 17 Mar 2004, at about 6 pm, a woman who lives near Bradshaw Quarry
Road in southwest Orange County, saw a raccoon chasing one of her dogs in
her backyard. She grabbed her rifle and went outside to see her larger dog
fighting with the raccoon. The raccoon then ran up a tree and the woman
shot it several times. When it fell from the tree, it was still twitching
and hissing and her rat terrier jumped on it, grabbing it by the neck and
shaking it. She put the rifle butt on the raccoon to hold it still and
picked up the terrier with one arm and shot the raccoon again to kill it.
She put the terrier in a dog pen and bagged the
raccoon.
Unfortunately, the terrier's rabies vaccination had expired in December
2003. In that the woman does not want to destroy the dog, she has made
arrangements to have her dog confined and observed (as required by law) at
her veterinarian's clinic for 6 months. The larger dog's vaccination was
current and was boostered.
In that the woman picked up her terrier without gloves after it had been
fighting with the raccoon, and there is a likelihood that the raccoon's
saliva was on the dog, she might have been exposed to the virus herself.
She will be seeking a consultation with a physician regarding her need for
post-exposure rabies shots.
Animal Control Director John Sauls noted that it was unfortunate that the
terrier's rabies vaccination had expired, necessitating the 6-month
confinement, especially in that this owner usually keeps her pets'
vaccinations up-to-date. And although she knew better than to handle her
possibly-exposed dog without gloves, she temporarily forgot that in the
heat of the moment.
Animal Control will sponsor a reduced-cost rabies clinic on Thu 15 Apr 2004
from 6 until 7 pm at the Hillsborough Courthouse parking lot and at the
Caldwell Community Center on Hwy 157 N. The following Sat 17 Apr 2004, the
Animal Protection Society will sponsor a reduced cost rabies clinic from 2
pm until 4 pm. Sauls asked every dog and cat owner to be certain that their
pets' rabies vaccinations are up-to-date or to take advantage of one of
these rabies clinic dates.
