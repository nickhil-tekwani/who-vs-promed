A nursery is being investigated by Ofsted [Office for Standards in
Education] after it was linked to 147 cases of salmonella. The
investigation by the Government body into Cannock House Nursery,
Hawstead Lane, Chelsfield will determine whether it meets acceptable
care standards. It is expected to run until 4 May 2007.
Ofsted's investigation is running alongside the one started by the
Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Bromley Council's environmental
health department. They are trying to identify the source of the
outbreak and are also still testing for _E. coli_.
As reported in last week's News Shopper, the nursery was closed on 19
Mar 2007 as a precaution after 3 children were hospitalized after a
diarrhea outbreak. This figure has now risen to 147 [hospitalized? - Mod.JW].
An Ofsted spokesman said: "The environmental health department has
informed us the nursery is closed while it investigates an outbreak
of salmonella. Environmental health and the HPA are investigating
possible causes and have closed the setting to prevent the spread of
infection. In addition, we have suspended the registration while we
carry out our investigation into the provider's compliance with
national standards."

[Epidemiologically, the number of cases developing over less than 2
weeks suggests that this may be a common source outbreak related to a
food, with some cases, perhaps, being spread from child-to-child at
the nursery. The number of children in total at the nursery and their
age range is not stated nor is the serotype of _Salmonella_ involved.
Chelsfield is in Kent County, England, which can be seen on a map as
