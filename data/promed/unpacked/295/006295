Outbreak of leprosy feared on Bougainville
Health authorities in Solomon Islands are looking into concerns that there
may have been a leprosy outbreak on the troubled neighbouring Papua New
Guinea island of Bougainville. The Ministry of Health says it is aware of
the possibility of an outbreak following requests for drugs by the Solomon
Islands Christian Association. The ministry also reassured Solomon
Islanders the disease is not likely to spread to the Solomon Islands
because of its good immunization programme.

[Leprosy has been treated with sulfone antimicrobial agents with some
degree of success. Immunization with BCG vaccine has been shown to offer
an approximate 50% reduction in leprosy risk as compared to controls
(Lancet, 1996 Jul 6, 348:9019, 17-24). Reports of data indicating more
optimistic protection rates would be appreciated. - Mod.ES]
