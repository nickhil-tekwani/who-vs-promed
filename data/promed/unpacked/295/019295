BSE - EUROPE
============

Subject: BSE Reporting in Europe
From: British Dairying Magazine (p17 March '97)
Claims from other EU countries that they have little or no BSE are looking
increasingly silly. Evidence is mounting that thousands of cases should have
been reported while some, notably the Netherlands (now one case: Oz) and
Belgium have still to report any. One of the latest pieces in the jigsaw is
the news that Poland has confirmed 51 cases - 29 of them this year.
The pattern of recovery (ie recovering as in identifying: Oz) is remarkably
similar to Switzerland, which up to last year had disclosed 230 cases in a
manner which persuaded our (ie UK: Oz) vets at Tolworth [UK/MAFF/VS HQ] that
it was operating a fully accountable reporting system. It is regarded as
significant that each of these countries is outside the EU and has a common
border with Germany.
The main source of infection is thought to be infected MBM exported by us
(ie the UK: Oz) to France and other EU countries between 1988 and 1989.
Official customs and excise figures show that 12,533 tonnes, worth 2.3M UKP,
were sent over in 1988, most of it after the ban - imposed in July on MBM
being included in UK *cattle* (my emphasis: Oz) feed. But in 1989, some
25,005T, worth 4.6M UKP, was exported. It is significant that most, if not
all, was sold before the introduction of the SBO ban that November - which
means it undoubtably contained BSE-infected material
and would have been dangerous if fed to *cattle* (my emphasis: Oz).
MAFF investigations have shown that MBM from the UK was dispersed widely to
feed mills across the EU. Some went to Germany where it was sold on to
buyers in Switzerland and other non-EU countries.
Other damning statistics, which show that BSE is a disease best cured by a
trip across the Channel (the English Channel between UK and France: Oz),
include the delivery of 58,000 UK-bred dairy heifers, mainly to France and
the Netherlands, between 1985 and 1990. After studying their records, MAFF
have concluded that 1,668 would have gone down with BSE.
Their conclusions are supported by the University of Berne in Switzerland
which is angry that most BSE on the continent seems to stop at the Swiss border.

Reading between the journalese and spuriously accurate statistics - an
interesting overview. I was once laughed at for suggesting that with the
strict regulations on SBO's and the 30 month ban, British beef was the
safest (as regards BSE) in Europe.

[While Oz is trailing his coat, as ever, my one-time head of department,
Bill Hubbert once noted that while infections know no boundaries, diseases
do. The Germans claim that their farmers use little or no animal protein in
their livestock feed. While in general this may be so, one must presume that
in border areas agricultural practices will be common to both sides of the
border. MHJ]
