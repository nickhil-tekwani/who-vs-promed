The following information has been derived from FEWS NET (Famine Early
Warning Systems Network, a USAID (United States Agency for International
Development) subsidiary), where the most recent report for Tanzania,
covering the period from 24 Apr to 18 May 2007, was published on 23 May 2007:
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) has been contained, and the vaccination campaign is
continuing, although a significant shortfall of vaccine dosages persists.
The consumption of red meat is starting to increase, improving incomes in
the livestock sector that was hit by low demand for red meat following the
RVF outbreak.
