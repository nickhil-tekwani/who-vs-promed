Louisiana was struck by Hurricane Katrina on 29 Aug 2005, and by Hurricane
Rita on 24 Sep 2005. The 2 hurricanes caused unprecedented damage from wind
and storm surge to the Louisiana Gulf Coast region, and levee breaks
resulted in flooding of large residential areas in and around New Orleans.
With the flooding, an immediate public health concern was the potential for
outbreaks of infectious diseases, including cholera.
Nearly all Vibrio infections in the USA are caused by noncholeragenic
_Vibrio_ species (such as _V. parahaemolyticus_, _V. vulnificus_, and
non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_) (1,2). Cases of cholera rarely occur in the
USA, and cholera epidemics, such as those reported in certain developing
countries, are unlikely, even with the extreme flooding caused by the 2
hurricanes (2). This report describes the investigation by the Louisiana
Office of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) into 2 cases of toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 infection in a Louisiana
couple; the cases were attributed to consumption of undercooked or
contaminated seafood. Although noncholeragenic _Vibrio_ illnesses were
reported in 22 residents of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane
Katrina (1), no epidemic of cholera was identified, and no evidence exists
of increased risk to Gulf Coast residents.
In Louisiana, cases of notifiable diseases, including _V. cholerae_
infections, are reported through the internet-based Reportable Disease
Database (RDD). All health care providers and diagnostic facilities
throughout the state submit reports through this system. A 24-hour
telephone line is available to report emergencies. Although the 24-hour
telephone line was disrupted immediately after hurricane Katrina, the RDD
never stopped functioning. In addition, after the hurricanes, morbidity
surveillance systems were implemented in acute care facilities in severely
damaged areas and in evacuee centers throughout the state. During 29 Aug-30
Oct 2005, a total of 81 reports were investigated by Louisiana
infectious-disease epidemiologists; 33 (41 per cent) of these
investigations were related to diarrheal illnesses. 5 suspected cases of
cholera were reported in Louisiana on the basis of presumptive laboratory
results from clinical laboratories. However, of the 5 stool specimens sent
to the Louisiana State Public Health Laboratory, only 2 were confirmed as
containing toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1.
The 2 cases of toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 infection were identified in a
Louisiana couple about 3 weeks after Hurricane Rita. On 15 Oct 2005, in
south eastern Louisiana, a man aged 43 years and his wife aged 46 years had
onset of diarrhea... After treatment with ciprofloxacin and aggressive
rehydration therapy, the man recovered to his previous state of health. His
wife had mild diarrhea and was treated as an outpatient with ciprofloxacin
and extra fluids.
Because the couple's residence had been severely damaged and flooded by
Hurricane Rita, both patients had waded in coastal floodwaters in late Sep
2005, 2-3 weeks before their illness onset. 5 days before onset of illness,
both had eaten locally caught crabs. On 14 Oct 2005, the day preceding
illness onset, both had eaten shrimp purchased from a local fisherman. The
shrimp were boiled for 5 minutes; however, at least some of the boiled
shrimp were returned to a cooler containing raw shrimp and were eaten
later. 2 other people who ate the shrimp reported mild diarrhea and
abdominal discomfort; they did not seek medical attention, and no stool or
serum specimens were collected from them for testing.
Toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1, serotype Inaba, biotype El Tor, was isolated at
the hospital from stool specimens of the 2 patients and was confirmed at
the Louisiana State Public Health Laboratory and the Foodborne and
Diarrheal Diseases Laboratory at CDC. Both isolates were susceptible to all
antimicrobial agents tested and were hemolytic on sheep blood agar, 2
characteristics of the strain of toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 that is endemic
to the USA Gulf Coast. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the isolates
were indistinguishable from each other and from other isolates previously
associated with the Gulf Coast.

Editorial note:
Cholera is caused by toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 or O139 and is
characterized by severe watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting,
that can lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypovolemic
shock if fluid losses are not promptly replaced (3). In developing African
and Asian countries, where most cholera cases and epidemics occur (4,5),
transmission tends to be waterborne. However, because _V. cholerae_ occurs
naturally in some marine or estuarine environments, cholera is also
occasionally acquired from consumption of inadequately cooked crustaceans
or molluscan shellfish (3,6-8).
In the USA, epidemic cholera has not occurred during the past 100 years.
Although small outbreaks have been identified, most cases have been
sporadic. During 1996-2005, a total of 64 cases of toxigenic _V. cholerae_
O1 were reported to CDC from USA states and territories (Figure [for
figure, see original URL - Mod. LL]). In 35 (55 per cent) cases, cholera
infection was acquired during foreign travel. For the remaining 29 (45 per
cent) cases, infection was acquired in the USA. 7 (24 per cent) of these 29
cases were attributed to consumption of Gulf Coast seafood (such as crabs,
shrimp, or oysters); 22 (76 per cent) others could not be attributed to
consumption of Gulf Coast seafood. Among the 22 cases not associated with
either foreign travel or Gulf Coast seafood, 13 were associated with
consumption of seafood from areas other than the Gulf Coast, and 9
exposures were undetermined. 13 of the cases occurred in states outside of
the Gulf Coast, 8 occurred in USA territories (7 in Guam and 1 in the
Mariana Islands), and 1 case occurred in Louisiana.
7 of the 11 USA cholera cases in 2005 were reported during Oct-Dec 2005,
after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In addition to the 2 Louisiana cases
described in this report, 2 cases occurred in Guam, and 3 others were
attributed to foreign travel. The number and sources of these 7 cases are
consistent with reports of cholera in previous years (9). No evidence
suggests increased risk for cholera among Gulf Coast residents or consumers
of Gulf Coast seafood after the hurricanes.
Illness in the 2 Louisiana residents was attributed to shellfish that was
not prepared or handled properly, perhaps because of difficult living
conditions after the hurricanes. Boiling shellfish for more than 10 minutes
is recommended to render the _V. cholerae_ organism nonviable and then
placing the shellfish into clean serving dishes to prevent recontamination
(3,8).

[Our earlier postings of post-hurricane vibriosis did not include cases of
toxigenic _V. cholerae_. The male patient who developed more prominent
disease may have had achlorhydria (no acid in his stomach), which
predisposes to more symptomatic disease, since the bacterium is in part
inactivated by low pH. - Mod.LL]
