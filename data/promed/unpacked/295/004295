10 children have died in Moscow from meningitis so far in 2003. Altogether,
259 cases of meningitis were registered in Moscow, 129 of which are among
children, according to the Chief Pediatrician of Moscow, Mr.Rumyanzev.
According to him, the Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance staff together
with physicians conducted investigations of the focus of
infection. Someone in each area was identified as a carrier of infection.
Disease was registered in all suburbs of Moscow.
Vaccination is organized in Moscow, with obligatory vaccination of children
under 3 months to 9 years. Rumyanzev thinks that these measures will
prevent an epidemic. According to formal signs, no epidemic has yet been
declared in Moscow. The epidemic can be announced only when disease is
registered in more that 20 persons per 100 000 population. Currently the
figure is 3-3.5 per 100 000.

Meningococcal meningitis increases in Moscow, associated with serogroup A:
advice to travelers
------------------------------------
There has been a rise in the number of cases of meningococcal meningitis in
Moscow. By the end of October 2003, there had been 268 cases (including 22
deaths) mostly in children, approximately twice the average number of cases
reported (1). Unusually, many of the cases have been reported at the end
of the summer and in early autumn; the usual seasonal increase occurs in
February and March. Meningococcal serogroup A has been identified in 90
percent of the strains isolated. The city health authorities in Moscow have
initiated a mass vaccination campaign in order to prevent further cases
occurring during the coming peak transmission season.
Cases of meningococcal serogroup A infection are rare in the European
Union, and it is uncommon even to have infections associated with travel to
those endemic areas where serogroup A is most frequent, such as the
meningitis belt in Africa, and therefore it is not anticipated that many
cases will be imported from Russia into the EU.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre in England (NaTHNaC,
<http://www.nathnac.org>) has issued guidance for English health
professionals who may be advising travelers to Moscow (2), recommending
that meningococcal vaccine should be considered only for travelers to
Moscow who will be teaching in schools, attending university or other
courses, frequenting crowded bars and clubs, or working in a medical setting.
The European Union Invasive Bacterial Infections Surveillance Network
(EU-IBIS, <http://www.euibis.org/>) would be interested to know what
guidance is being issued in other European countries; please email
information to Sarah Handford (<sarah.handford@hpa.org.uk>).
