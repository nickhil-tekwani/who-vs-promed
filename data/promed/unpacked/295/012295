From 2003 to 2007, Italy is implementing a national plan to eliminate
measles and congenital rubella [1]. In addition to efforts to reach 95 per
cent coverage with the 1st dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine
(MMR) by the age of 24 months, ongoing activities include increasing
coverage with the 2nd dose at 5-6 years of age, and catch-up of 6-13 year
old children in primary and lower secondary schools. In Toscana (often
known in English as Tuscany - a region of central Italy with about 3.5
million inhabitants), coverage with the first measles-containing-vaccine
(MCV) dose by 24 months of age was 44 per cent in 1993, 65 per cent in
1998, and 89 per cent in 2003 [2], according to 3 cluster sampling surveys.
In children 6-10 years old attending primary school, MCV coverage was
estimated to be 88 per cent for the 1st dose, and 66 per cent for the 2nd
dose by December 2004. Although the elimination plan has so far been very
successful in achieving its goals, a continually insufficient coverage rate
for measles vaccine during the past 15 years has created a large pool of
susceptible adolescents and young adults.
Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
Between 20 Jan and 5 May 2006, 40 cases of measles were reported to the
local health unit in the province of Grosseto in Toscana. The population of
the province, which includes the town of Grosseto and the surrounding area,
is about 200 000. Of the cases, 23 (58 per cent) were in males and 17 (42
per cent) in females, and 75 per cent occurred between mid-February and the
end of March 2006, with a peak in March (illustrated by a figure in the
original text). Ninety-five per cent of the patients were over 15 years old
(illustrated by a figure in the original text), and the mean age was 27 years.
The index case was a 23 year old woman who showed symptoms suggestive of
measles after returning from a visit to India. She initially presented with
fever and was treated with antibiotics. She then developed a generalised
rash, which was diagnosed as a drug reaction, and she was admitted to
hospital in Grosseto on 20 Jan 2006. During her admission to hospital, she
came into contact with a nursing student, who developed measles 14 days
later, on 3 Feb 2006, and was the 1st secondary case to be reported.
As patients were not always properly isolated (for example, during
transportation between different wards), 12 patients (30 per cent) in this
outbreak were thought to have acquired infection through nosocomial
transmission. Eight of the cases (20 per cent) were in health care workers.
Twenty-six cases (65 per cent) were laboratory confirmed, while the
remaining 14 were epidemiologically linked. Measles virus genotype D4 was
confirmed in samples from 7 seven patients. No biological samples for
measles confirmation were collected from the 1st patient, the 23 year old
woman who had returned from India, as samples should be taken within 7
seven days of rash onset, and the diagnosis was too late. However, measles
virus was isolated from the 1st secondary case and had the same genomic
sequence as all the other cases.
Of the 40 patients, 14 were admitted to hospital (35 per cent), including 8
of the 12 patients who acquired measles by nosocomial transmission, and 6
of the remaining 28 cases. Complications recorded in the hospitalised
patients included cholestatic hepatitis with cytonecrosis (7 cases; 50 per
cent), thrombocytopenia (2; 14 per cent), and 1 case (7 per cent) with each
of respiratory distress, brain oedema, otitis media, haemorrhagic lesions,
bacteraemia with isolation of _Streptococcus capitis_, and oral
candidiasis. None of the patients died.
Only one patient reported having received measles vaccination, in 1982.
Actions taken and conclusions
-----------------------------
In response to the 1st secondary case, active tracing of contacts began on
6 Feb 2006, and MMR vaccination was administered to individuals who were
not vaccinated or who had previously received only one dose of MCV. In
total, 27 contacts were vaccinated: 26 received their first MMR dose, and
one was vaccinated with the 2nd dose. No further cases were reported after
5 May.
Measles virus genotype D4 has been found to circulate in India [3], and
outbreaks related to importation of this genotype were recently reported in
Europe [4-6]. In this outbreak, measles transmission following importation
occurred in a hospital. A similar experience recently occurred in northern
Italy, in the autonomous province of Bozen [7], where a cluster of 5
measles cases, 3 of which were related to nosocomial transmission, were
reported. This underlines the importance of verifying immunity and offering
MMR vaccination to susceptible health care workers.
A high rate of admission to hospital was also observed. This is expected
when measles infection is acquired by adults, who are more vulnerable to
severe complications.
It must be stressed that recognition of this outbreak was only possible
thanks to the implementation of the elimination plan for measles and
congenital rubella and to the efforts of health care workers to implement
laboratory confirmation of cases. The [response to this] outbreak shows
that a system of early warning and laboratory confirmation is feasible in
Toscana. It will be crucial to properly investigate all suspected measles
cases as the goal of measles elimination approaches.
