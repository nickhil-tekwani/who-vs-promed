A resident of Daraa complained about the continuing sicknesses in her family since the beginning of April 2022, following the discovery of contamination in drinking water in the city. Although the regime's institutions in the city claimed to have fixed the faults and solved the pollution problem, the consequences of the pollution did not end, as hundreds of people have contracted hepatitis C [see moderator comment below - Mod.LL] and typhoid fever.

Dozens of cases arrive daily at the medical facilities of the Syrian Red Crescent and the Daraa National Hospital, amid fears of complications, especially among children, according to the resident. A resident of the city told Enab Baladi that she and 4 of her children had contracted typhoid fever. She added, "In the end, I began to feel general weakness in addition to vomiting and constant headaches, and after the tests, it was found that I had typhoid."

A doctor in Daraa said that the contamination of drinking water in Daraa is a major cause of these infections, and that the hepatitis A virus is a contagious disease, transmitted through the mouth or stomach through contamination of food, drink or water.

Symptoms of the disease are digestive (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever). The doctor added that a small percentage of hepatitis infections may lead to death, but most cases are cured quickly. According to the doctor, the most important prevention methods are water sterilization, which stops the infection cycle, in addition to observing personal hygiene measures.

On Wednesday [11 May 2022], Ashraf Barmo, Director of Daraa Health, confirmed to the "Sham FM" radio program that 670 cases of hepatitis C [see comment below - Mod.LL] had been discovered after conducting a survey of 2070 people, most of which were concentrated in the "Al-Sabil" neighborhood. He considered that the number of infections has decreased, pointing out that the reason is due to the mixing of water and sewage, but the problem has been addressed directly.

The director of health told the "Snack Syrian" website, earlier, that the number of cases examined was 2070, of which 939 were infected with hepatitis C [see comment below - Mod.LL]. Barmo added that the Health Directorate started 2 mobile clinics in Al-Sabil neighborhood, where infections occurred as a result of contaminated drinking water last month [April 2022].

At the beginning of last April [2022], the Daraa Water Directorate announced a blockage in the sewage lines and subsequent contamination of drinking water. This was accompanied by a daily infection of dozens of people with intestinal diseases, in addition to severe dehydration of children.

With the spreading news of water pollution, residents of neighborhoods whose water supply was polluted began to buy mineral water, according to residents interviewed for Enab Baladi at the time.

On [13 Apr 2022], the Daraa Drinking Water Corporation announced the completion of maintenance work and the replacement of the worn-out line that caused the pollution, and it called on residents to open the taps to wash away pollution.

In an interview with "Sama" channel, which is close to the regime, on [8 May 2022], the director of the Daraa Water Directorate, Muhammad al-Masalma, said that the responsibility for pollution is a collective responsibility that the institution does not bear alone. He considered drinking water to be the cause of pollution.

This is not the 1st time that regime-controlled areas have witnessed a water crisis, as the city of Damascus and parts of the Damascus countryside witnessed 1200 cases of illness due to water pollution, on 16 Oct 2021. In early 2020, the Wadi Barada region witnessed dozens of cases of poisoning caused by drinking non-potable water in the area richest in drinking water in the governorate of Damascus and its countryside.

[Human illnesses associated with ingestion of sewage-contaminated water may be viral, bacterial or parasitic. Most of the illnesses are manifested as gastroenteritis but there are more systemic illnesses such as salmonellosis, particularly typhoid fever (_S._ Typhi) and certain kinds of viral hepatitis.

Although the posting mentions hepatitis C as the cause, HCV is not enterically transmitted and the etiology is much more likely due to either hepatitis A or genotypes 1 or 2 of hepatitis E. The ages of those with hepatitis are not stated but in the developing world, outbreaks of HAV are uncommon as most of the population have been infected subclinically by the age of 10. Therefore, HEV would be suspected, even more so if severe disease was found in pregnant women.

Daraa is the capital of Daraa Governorate in southwestern Syria. - Mod.LL
