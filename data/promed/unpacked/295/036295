[Sporadic cases continue to be identified and reported in Saudi Arabia, with 4 newly confirmed cases in the past 9 days. The 4 cases came from 4 different regions in the country -- Makkah, Al Qasim, Asir, and Riyadh. Curiously, the most recent case (case No: 19-1958) is listed as Buraidah city, plus Wadi Aldwasir. As Buraidah city is in Al Qasim region and Wadi Aldwasir is in Riyadh region, clarification would be helpful from knowledgeable source. In addition, there is mention that case No: 19 -1957 is a secondary case, but no further information on location of contact with previously confirmed case occurred -- household contact, healthcare facility in a patient or in a healthcare worker. Again, information from a knowledgeable source would be greatly appreciated.
