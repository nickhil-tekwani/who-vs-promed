A day after a 2 year old child died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday [26 May 2021] reviewed the preparedness and announced the extension of the socio-economic survey to all the AES-affected districts, including the 5 blocks of Muzaffarpur where it is already going on.

This is the 1st case of death of a child in the district due to AES this year [2021]. Sitamarhi, East, and West Champaran have reported one AES death each this year. The disease, which mainly affects children below 15 years of age and returns almost every year in certain districts of north Bihar, particularly Muzaffarpur, left over 200 children dead in 2019 alone.

Confirming the death, deputy superintendent of the SKMCH, Dr GS Sahni, said the child, registered as MA of Paru area, was brought to the hospital on Monday morning [24 May 2021] with a high temperature and convulsions. "Pathological and clinical tests confirmed AES in him. His blood sugar level was also very low, resulting in his [death] on Tuesday [25 May 2021]," he said, adding that altogether 20 cases of confirmed AES have been reported so far.

Last year [2020], the state had selected 15 endemic districts for AES and Japanese encephalitis survey. Nearly 22 districts were affected by AES last year. This year [2021], 14 teams, having 2 members in each group from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences [AIIMS] at Jodhpur, have reached out in the villages worse affected last year.

Talking to media persons, team leader and head of neonatal department at AIIMS-Jodhpur, Dr AK Singh, said his team members would collect data from the affected families. "The teams will collect data regarding the food habits of children below 5 years of age and about other activities from their guardians," he said.

[Bihar state is well into the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) season. Apparently, JE has been ruled out in these and the other cases classified as AES. The majority of JE cases, often reported with cases of AES, occur in the north eastern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Assam. Although there are fewer cases of AES and JE in Bihar state this year [2021] than in previous years, these cases continue to occur in that state. From 27 Mar 2020 until 1 Nov 2020, 89 children suffering from AES/JE were admitted to Muzaffarpur's Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital in Bihar.

The above and previous reports do not indicate how many of the AES cases are due to Japanese encephalitis. As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Interestingly, the case above mentions hypoglycemia. Dr T Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar. These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. It is encouraging to learn that 14 teams from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Jodhpur, have reached out in the villages worse affected last year (2020). Their findings may shine additional light on the circumstances under which AES occurs.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of cases will not be possible. The season in which AES and JE cases occur is under way, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 2-3 months. - Mod.TY
