Asian rust spots increase in Brazil
-----------------------------------
Mato Grosso [MT] state is reaching 100 percent of soybeans harvested,
and registers 9 percent more rust foci than for the last crop. In the
whole of Brazil, so far there were 2810 sites with Asian rust
registered. This is 34 percent more than last year.

In MT the number of samples submitted to laboratories increased by 70
percent, and in the whole country the monitoring program was also
intensified on the same scale.

But the Ag Eng. Carlos Bortolini Jr warns the rust is getting more
resistant each year, and so producers need to expend more investments
in fungicide. In his point of view, Asian rust must be handled as an
epidemic to be defeated.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) caused by the
fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean
crops of up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and
spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment
in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of
_Fabaceae_, including kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), can also be affected
and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long
distances. Several epidemic cycles may occur in one cropping season.
Fungicides may be used in disease management, but timing of
applications is considered important. Partially resistant soybean
lines are available. However, new fungal strains with increased
virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging, as is being
reported above from Brazil.

While the related species _P. meibomiae_ is also found in South
America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms, this species is
less virulent and is not referred to as 'Asian' rust. The item above
refers to _P. pachyrhizi_ which has been established in Brazil since
2002.
