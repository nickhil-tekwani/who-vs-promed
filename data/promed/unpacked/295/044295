Agriculture officials have raised an alert in the central Philippine
province of Iloilo for the outbreak of a contagious livestock disease
known as surra, a television report said Friday [19 Jul 2002].
Monitoring made as of 17 Jul 2002 by agriculture officials in the
province detected a rise in the number of carabaos, cattle, and
horses affected by the disease, the report added. [The report] quoted
local officials in the province as expressing fears that the
province's livestock industry could be debilitated if the disease is
left uncontrolled.
Dr. Leoniolo Resontoc of the agriculture department's Animal Health
Division in Manila said surra is a blood parasite transmitted by
flies. Affected animals begin wasting, promoting the contraction of
secondary diseases that lead to their death. The disease, however, is
not transmitted to humans.
Resontoc said the government has an ongoing program to control surra
in various areas of the country, but lack of funds and the difficulty
of controlling flies that spread the disease have hampered the
program.

[_Trypanosoma evansi_ has been reported to occur in a variety of
hosts, the most economically important being horses, buffalo, and
cattle; but it has also been reported from sheep and goats, pigs,
dogs, cats, and a range of wild animals. Bactrian and dromedary
camels are known to be susceptible as well. Of these, horses are most
severely affected. Indonesia and the Philippines are southeast Asian
countries where the disease is known to have caused serious outbreaks
in the past.
The disease is transmitted by haematophagous flies. The clinical and
haematological characteristics of infection is similar amongst the
different species of host animals and includes a progressive anaemia,
high temperature, marked depression, dullness, loss of condition, and
in some cases, death. Reproductive wastage has been identified
occasionally as a source of economic loss. There is a tendency to
ascribe the occurrence of severe and often fatal disease to the horse
and camel, and milder disease in cattle, but the range of
susceptibility of the livestock and the variation in pathogenicity of
the trypanosome strains is so great that this is an unrealistic view.
The parasite does not affect humans. - Mod.AS]
