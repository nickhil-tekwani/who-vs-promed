Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Iran: 1 Jan to 29 Apr 2004
---------------------------------------
This is an up-to-date report on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
Iran, from the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Laboratory
(National Center) of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, in Tehran, for the
period 1 Jan to 29 Apr 2004. This completes our report submitted to
ProMED-mail on 12 Jan 2004, and archived as: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic
Fever, 2003 - Iran 20040114.0146.

From 1 Jan to 29 Apr 2004, the total number of suspected cases was 11. We
found 2 IgM positive and one IgG positive, and there was one death among
the suspected cases.

Our results from the last 4 years are summarized below:
From 7 Jun 2000 until 31 Dec 2003, we tested 613 samples from suspected
CCHF human cases from different provinces of Iran. 229 were IgM positive
(confirmed cases), 211 were IgG positive and, of the confirmed cases, 25 died.

The details for each of the past 4 years are as follows:
1 Jan-31 Dec 2003: 145 suspected cases, 47 IgM-positive, 42 IgG- positive,
6 deaths of confirmed cases.
1 Jan-31 Dec 2002: 246 suspected cases, 101 IgM-positive, 96 IgG-positive,
8 deaths of confirmed cases.
1 Jan-31 Dec 2001: 166 suspected cases, 61 IgM-positive, 55 IgG- positive,
7 deaths of confirmed cases.
7 Jun-31 Dec 2000: 56 suspected cases, 20 IgM-positive, 18 IgG- positive, 4
deaths of confirmed cases.

NOTE (1): According to our protocol, 3 serum samples are collected from
each patient: 1st after clinical diagnosis, 2nd 5-10 days after clinical
diagnosis, and 3rd 10-15 days after clinical diagnosis.

The reasons that we found fewer IgG positive than IgM positive samples are:
the early death of IgM-positive patients, and we did not receive some of
the 2nd or 3rd sera, because the follow-up in some provinces has not been
possible due to the refusal of certain patients to give another serum
sample, and, also, because some cases were no longer available.

NOTE (2): After a period of heavy rain, a certain number of domestic
animals died in Boushehr province, in the south of Iran, in Feb 2004. The
health authorities of this province suspected Rift Valley Fever virus
(RVFV) as the cause of death, and, in order to analyze these incidents, 32
human sera, from 32 farmers, and 29 domestic animal sera (24 ovine, 4
bovine and 1 caprine) were collected. Serological tests (specific ELISA)
for RVF-specific IgM and IgG and immunofluorescence (IF) were done on these
sera. All results were negative.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Chinikar for providing these regular updates on the
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever situation in Iran. The failure to confirm
the presence of Rift Valley fever in the south of Iran earlier in 2004 will
be of interest also to veterinarians and epidemiologists. - Mod.CP]
