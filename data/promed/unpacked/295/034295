Quarantine has been introduced in a village of the Akmola oblast [region], due to an outbreak of brucellosis in which more than 2 dozen sheep in the village Petrovka became infected. The presence of the dangerous disease was established by laboratory tests. Restrictive measures have been introduced in the village, Liter.kz reports with reference to Khabar 24.

Now a state anti-epizootic delegation is working in Petrovka. The livestock will be tested every 15 days. Veterinarians say that the uncontrolled import of livestock is the cause of the outbreak of the virus in the village.

"The reason is the failure to notify the veterinary service about the import of livestock. Also, failure to carry out the required quarantine measures upon delivery. That is, quarantine is imposed by the veterinary service and [stock are] examined for brucellosis and other diseases. This has not been done, since they did not notify" said the head of the regional veterinary department, Talgat Zhunusov.

The slaughter of livestock and the export of dairy and meat products in the village are still prohibited.

[Brucellosis is considered hyperendemic in Kazakhstan. A similar situation prevails in several other regional republics of the former Soviet Union (Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan). _Brucella melitensis_, of which small ruminants (sheep, goats) are the reservoir, is the main pathogen circulating in these countries, with a steadily increasing rate of spill-over to cattle, though the typical pathogen in cattle is _B. abortus_. It is expected that the undertaken serology tests, in Petrovka, will address sheep and cattle.

Most strains recovered from human patients in Kazakhstan have, traditionally, been identified as _B. melitensis_; likely, this pathogen, introduced by sheep, is responsible for the Petrovka event. The control and, eventually eradication of _B. melitensis_ is a complex undertaking, requiring close cooperation between the various authorities (public and animal health institutions), combining reporting of abortions, mass serological tests, vaccinations and, when necessary, culling of severely infected flocks. Such an approach requires the full cooperation of farmers. Adequate and timely payment of compensations for culled animals is a prerequisite.

An effective control project requires, on top of effective veterinary services and adequate diagnostic facilities, effective movement control and animal identification system as well as inter-boundary coordination. The existence of the said components, backed by adequate budgeting, contributed to _B. melitensis_ eradication in EU member countries such as Bulgaria and France. The eradication is close to being achieved in Croatia and Spain, but the disease is still prevalent in Greece and in some regions of Italy and Portugal.

The forecast for controlling brucellosis in Kazakhstan, which depends on the quality of diagnostic measures and the timely adoption of measures for the immediate destruction of sick animals, is unfavorable. Outbreaks of the disease are expected to continue among small ruminants in the southern and eastern regions, and among cattle in the eastern, western and northern regions of Kazakhstan (see "Analysis of the epizootic situation on animal brucellosis in Kazakhstan in 2020" by Telmanova SB et al. https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=45752452, in Russian). - Mod.AS
