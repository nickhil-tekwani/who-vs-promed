First Record of Barley yellow striate mosaic virus and Cereal yellow dwarf
virus-RPV Infecting Wheat in Uzbekistan.
K. M. Makkouk and S. G. Kumari, ICARDA, P.O. Box 5466, Aleppo, Syria; and
Z. Kadirova and A. Zueva, Institute of Genetics and Experimental Biology,
Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Plant Dis. 85:1122, 2001; published on-line as
D-2001-0813-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication 24 Jul 2001.
A preliminary survey to identify virus diseases affecting wheat in
Uzbekistan was conducted during May 2001. The survey covered 12 wheat
fields from 2 cereal-growing regions (Tashkent-Angren and Tashkent-Samarkand).
A total of 250 wheat samples with symptoms suggestive of virus infection
were collected and tested for the presence of 9 [cereal viruses by
tissue-blot immunoassay (TBIA) (1) at the Virology Laboratory of ICARDA,
Aleppo, Syria, using the following antisera: monoclonal antibodies for
Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV) (ATCC PVAS-669 [American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and Barley yellow dwarf virus-MAV
(BYDV-MAV) (ATCC PVAS-673); and polyclonal antibodies for BYDV-SGV and
BYDV-RMV (3); BYDV-PAV, Barley stripe mosaic virus [BSMV, and Wheat streak
mosaic virus [WSMV (from Virology Laboratory, ICARDA); Wheat dwarf virus
[WDV (provided by J. Vacke, Research Institute of Crop Production, Prague,
Czech Republic); and Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV) isolated
from Lebanon (2).
The most common virus present was BYDV-PAV (... 12% of the 250 samples
tested), followed by BYDV-SGV (10.8%), BYSMV (5.6%), BYDV-RMV (2.4%),
BYDV-MAV (2%), and CYDV-RPV (1.2%). CYDV-RPV was detected in 3 fields; 1
field was 50 km southeast of Tashkent, and the other 2 ... were between
Tashkent and Samarkand. The majority of BYSMV-positive samples originated
from the same field, [about 40 km northeast of Samarkand. Field symptoms
of BYSMV-infected plants included yellow flag leaf and stunting.
All samples that produced a positive reaction to BYSMV-Lebanon antiserum
were tested against [4 other rhabdovirus antisera: BYSMV-Italy,
BYSMV-Morocco, Cereal chlorotic mottle virus [CCMoV, and [Wheat American
striate mosaic virus (WASMV). ... [All samples reacted strongly with
BYSMV-Italy and BYSMV-Morocco. In ... SDS-PAGE, followed by western blots,
extracts from BYSMV-infected plants were found to contain 66- and 47-kDa
structural proteins, typical of G and N proteins of rhabdoviruses, both of
which reacted strongly with BYSMV-Italy antiserum.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of BYSMV and CYDV-RPV in Uzbekistan.

[BYSMV (genus Cytorhabdovirus) is transmitted by leafhoppers and is
reported to be present in the African, Eurasian and Pacific regions, the
Middle East, Australia, France, Iran, Italy, and Morocco. BYDV-MAV and
BYDV-PAV (genus Luteovirus) and CYDV-RPV (genus Polerovirus) are
transmitted by aphids, are found worldwide and are collectively probably
the most widely distributed viral diseases of cereals, attacking wheat,
barley, triticale, oats, and many other grass species. Early infection by
BYDV can result in crop yield losses exceeding 20 percent.
I assume that there were no positive serological reactions between the
wheat samples and antisera to WSMV, WDV, BSMV, WASMV or CCMoV.
Given the current tense political and military circumstances in some
Eurasian countries, it may be very difficult to continue surveying for
diseases of cereals and other crops in those areas. - Mod.DH
