Sierra Leone's health authorities have confirmed the first cases of human infections of anthrax, less than a week after an outbreak of the disease was reported in animals. The Ministry of Health says 3 people tested positive for the bacterial infection which was first confirmed in animals at the beginning of last week [w/e 22 May 2022] in the northern Port Loko district. A spokesman in the Ministry of Health said the human cases were detected in the neighbouring Karene District*.

Harold Thomas, Communications Lead in the Directorate of Health Security and Emergencies in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) told ManoReporters that samples from 4 people who presented with symptoms of the disease were tested and 3 came back positive for anthrax.

In Port Loko, over 200 animals have been confirmed dead due to the outbreak. Officials in the ministries of Agriculture and Health said they mounted an investigation in response to reports of several unexplained deaths of animals in Tinkabere Village in Kamasondo, Bakeloko Chiefdom. A total of 223 livestock - 91 heads of cattle, 53 goats, and 79 sheep - were eventually confirmed dead.

According to Thomas, there has been no indication of human-to-human transmission, which means that those who were infected in Karene might have gotten it from either infected animals, animal products, or bacteria spores.

Anthrax is described as a serious infectious disease caused by a bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. The bacteria occur naturally in soil and commonly affect domestic and wild animals. Human beings can contract the disease if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. But the disease is treatable.

According to the Health Ministry spokesman, all the confirmed human cases were Cutaneous anthrax, which is the most common of the 3 types of the disease and the less dangerous one. The other 2 types are Inhalation and Gastrointestinal anthrax.

[For a map of Sierra Leone, go to: https://maps.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/sierra_leone_pol_2005.jpg For Port Loko go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Loko_District. Karene is a district in the North West Province, Sierra Leone. Karine is one of the 16 districts that make up the Republic of Sierra Leone.

This latest report fills out what we knew earlier. They are very fortunate that all the human anthrax cases were cutaneous, indicating the infection came through handling the contaminated meat. Such cases respond well to antibiotic treatment. I hope that the veterinary authorities are able to discover the source of the infection and how it became so widespread. This will help in defining their surveillance programme to prevent future outbreaks. Our thanks to Mahmoud for this interesting report. - Mod.MHJ
