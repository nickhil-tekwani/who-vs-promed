2 cases of a bacterial infection that rarely manifests itself in
human beings have been detected in Grand Island, prompting health
officials to issue a warning to the community.
Tularemia, also known as "rabbit fever," is typically found in
animals, especially rodents and rabbits. The disease naturally
exists, but human cases are "very rare in Central Nebraska,"
according to the Central District Health Department, which issued a
warning on Thu, 29 Dec 2005.
"We've had 2 cases in 2 weeks, and that's pretty exceptional," said
Michelle Ellermeier, epidemiology nurse at the Health Department. "We
usually see 3 to 4 cases a year, so we felt it necessary to let
people know it was out there."
Ellermeier said it's likely the local rabbit population is the
culprit, and during times when hunters are out and when pets might
get hold of a rabbit, the public should be on alert. The signs of the
disease may include skin ulcers, swollen lymph glands, inflamed eyes,
sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea and pneumonia.

[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection, a category
A biowarfare agent, are not clearly stated here. Many cases of
tularemia involve lymph node infection with (ulceroglandular) or
without (glandular) a local skin infection draining to the lymph
node. In the winter, infection tends to be associated with rabbit
hunting and in the summer, with tick or deer fly bites.
Summer cases associated with lawn mowers, as has been described on
Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, are often pneumonic, related to
inhalation of bacilli. Unlike human plague infection, pneumonic
tularemia does not spread from person to person. Bloodstream
infection (bacteremia) can be associated with different forms of
disease or may be the only manifestation (typhoidal form). - Mod.LL]
