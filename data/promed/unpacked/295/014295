Since October 2021, the number of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases caused mostly by the H5N1 subtype has continued to increase. Although most detections have been in wild birds, many have also been in poultry.

The increase of detections in wild birds points to a period of high risk in countries having migratory flyways this season. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the necessary biosecurity measures to protect their flocks from exposure and infection. - Mod.CRD]
