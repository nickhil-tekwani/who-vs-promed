[1] USA (Connecticut, Fairfield County): 2nd case of measles

https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Press-Room/Press-Releases---2021/DPH-Confirms-A-Second-Case-of-Measles-In-Fairfield-County-Household#:~:text=The%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public, measles%20announced%20on%20April%209.


The Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) today [23 Apr 2021] said it has confirmed a 2nd case of measles in a Fairfield County child. The child did not attend school while infectious. The child is a household contact of the child who contracted the 1st case of measles announced on 9 Apr 2021. DPH is collaborating with local partners to identify contacts and implement appropriate control measures. These are the 1st cases of measles in Connecticut since 2019.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread quickly among unvaccinated people. However, the majority of people exposed to measles are not at risk of developing the disease, since most people have either been vaccinated or have had measles in the past, before vaccination became routine.

"The single best way to protect yourself and your children from measles is to be vaccinated," said DPH Acting Commissioner Dr. Deidre Gifford. "One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while 2 doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure that we continue to protect our children from vaccine-preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination."

Very few people -- about 3 out of 100 -- who get 2 doses of measles vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus. Measles vaccine does not cause measles illness.

Most Connecticut residents have been vaccinated. Vaccination with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is required to attend schools and colleges in Connecticut; however, students with medical or religious exemptions may attend school without being vaccinated.

According to the 2019-2020 Statewide School Immunization Survey, 96.2% of Connecticut students were vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR by kindergarten entry. Exposed individuals who are not vaccinated against measles must stay out of school, or other high-risk settings, for a full 21 days after their last known exposure.

CDC recommends that all children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-months through 15-months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age.

CDC also recommends that adults born after 1957 should receive at least one dose of MMR vaccine if they have never been vaccinated against measles. Adults born in the U.S. before 1957 are considered immune to measles from past exposures; in situations where exposure to measles is likely, these adults may benefit from a dose of MMR vaccine. Certain adults need 2 doses of MMR, such as college students, healthcare workers, international travelers, and persons at high risk for measles complications.

International travelers should be up to date on their vaccinations. Most cases of measles are acquired or linked to international travel. Most people who are diagnosed as having measles are not vaccinated or did not know their vaccination status. So far during 2021, other than in Connecticut, no other measles cases have been confirmed in the United States. From 1 Jan-31 Dec 2020, 13 cases of measles were confirmed in the U.S.

[Measles is highly infectious, so it is not surprising that this new case is a household contact of the 1st case. The R0 for measles is approximately 12-18, meaning that each person with measles would, on average, infect 12-18 other people in a totally susceptible population. Of course, the population is not totally susceptible. In fact: "According to the 2019-2020 Statewide School Immunization Survey, 96.2% of Connecticut students were vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR by kindergarten entry."

It is not stated where the 1st case likely became infected and whether the individual was not vaccinated or only partially vaccinated, but, fortunately, the person did not attend school when it was clear they were infected. - Mod.LK

[2] Africa: Measles outbreak looming
Date: Fri 23 Apr 2021

https://africa.cgtn.com/2021/04/23/measles-outbreak-looming-in-africa-amid-stalled-vaccination-who/


Several African countries could experience an outbreak of measles amid stalled vaccination against the viral disease linked to COVID-19 disruptions, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thu 22 Apr 2021 ahead of the African Immunization week slated for 24-30 Apr 2021.

Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said that countries that have delayed measles immunization in the continent could experience a resurgence of the disease that affects young children.

"Recent outbreaks of measles, but also yellow fever, cholera, and meningitis, all point to worrying gaps in immunization coverage and surveillance in Africa," Moeti said in a statement.

Statistics from WHO indicate that 15 African countries postponed immunization drives against measles in 2020 to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moeti said that an estimated 16.6 million African children missed supplemental measles vaccine doses from January 2020-April 2021, while 8 countries in the continent reported a major outbreak of the disease during the same period.

She said delayed vaccination campaigns fueled the outbreaks, adding that the quality of measles surveillance in Africa fell to its lowest level in 2020, with only 11 countries meeting their target.

Moeti said that it requires at least 95 percent immunization coverage in a given population to avert a measles outbreak, while administering the 1st dose of the measles-containing vaccine has stagnated at around 69 percent in Africa since 2013, and only 7 countries achieved the 95 percent coverage in 2019.

She said that the low measles immunization coverage in Africa is also reflected in other vaccine-preventable diseases like tetanus, yellow fever, and diphtheria amid pandemic-linked disruptions.

"As we fight COVID-19, we cannot leave anyone dangerously exposed to preventable diseases. I urge countries to double down on essential health services, including life-saving vaccination campaigns," said Moeti.

She said that WHO had partnered with African countries to ensure that routine immunization against childhood ailments was sustained during the pandemic through enhanced surveillance, training of healthcare workers, and community engagement.

[Collateral damage from COVID-19 includes the neglect of other serious diseases. As this report states, not only "outbreaks of measles, but also yellow fever, cholera, and meningitis all point to worrying gaps in immunization coverage and surveillance in Africa."

Resources are scarce, and it is difficult to address the myriad diseases that need attention. See the hybrid approach addressing COVID-19 and neglected tropical diseases together in: Molyneux, D., Bush, S., Bannerman, R. et al. Neglected tropical diseases activities in Africa in the COVID-19 era: the need for a "hybrid" approach in COVID-endemic times. Infect Dis Poverty 10, 1 (2021); https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00791-3:

"Abstract
With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showing no signs of abating, resuming neglected tropical disease (NTD) activities, particularly mass drug administration (MDA), is vital. Failure to resume activities will not only enhance the risk of NTD transmission but will fail to leverage behaviour change messaging on the importance of hand and face washing and improved sanitation, a common strategy for several NTDs that also reduces the risk of COVID-19 spread. This so-called "hybrid approach" will demonstrate best practices for mitigating the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by incorporating physical distancing, use of masks, and frequent handwashing in the delivery of medicines to endemic communities and support action against the transmission of the virus through water, sanitation and hygiene interventions promoted by NTD programmes. Unless MDA and morbidity management activities resume, achievement of NTD targets as projected in the WHO/NTD Roadmap (2021-2030) will be deferred, the aspirational goal of NTD programmes to enhance universal health coverage jeopardised, and the call to 'leave no one behind' a hollow one. We outline what implementing this hybrid approach, which aims to strengthen health systems and facilitate integration and cross-sector collaboration, can achieve based on work undertaken in several African countries. - Mod.LK
