Boy died of lung infection, not SARS
---------------------------------------
The public was today [Tue 31 May 2005] assured that a 14-year-old boy who
died of an infection of the lungs here last Sat 29 May 2005 was not a
victim of the dreaded Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The
assurance came in the wake of widespread speculation that the boy, from
Taboh Naning New Village, about 45 km from here, had died of SARS at the
Malacca Hospital.
State Health, Consumer Affairs and Human Resource Committee chairman Datuk
Seah Kwi Tong said: "He had an infection in his lungs, and doctors have
confirmed it had nothing to do with SARS. People should not listen to
rumors," he said.
The boy was admitted to the hospital last week [4th week May 2005], about
the same time as 2 20-year-olds with similar symptoms. Seah said the 3
cases were not related. "The boy who died was from Alor Gajah, while the
other 2 are from Ayer Keroh and Melaka Raya."
The youths are being monitored in the hospital's Intensive Care Unit. It
was learned that the boy died of suspected melioidosis, also called
Whitmore's disease, an infectious disease caused by the bacterium
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_.

[Melioidosis is a bioterrorism category B disease, and _B. pseudomallei_ is
a soil/water organism found primarily in Southeast Asia and northern
Australia. Severe pneumonia with sepsis syndrome is the most common cause
of death with this infection and usually occurs in the compromised host,
particularly the diabetic. No information is given regarding co-morbidities
that may have existed in the boy. - Mod.LL]
