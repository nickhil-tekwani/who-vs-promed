Our lab received samples from 2 diseased caribou from Southampton Island. _Brucella suis_ was isolated from both samples by the Ontario Public Health Laboratory. I assume that they were biovar 4, but this was not specified in the report.

I apologize for the delay in replying to the previous post with a moderator's request for further information.
