Avian influenza -- situation in China -- update 12
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed the country's 19th case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The patient is a 31-year-old man employed as a truck driver in Shenzhen
City, Guangdong Province, near the border with Hong Kong. He developed
symptoms on 3 Jun 2006 and was hospitalized on 9 Jun. He remains
hospitalized, in critical condition, with severe pneumonia.
Investigation of his source of infection is under way. Preliminary reports
indicate the man visited a local market where live poultry are sold on
several occasions prior to symptom onset. However, health authorities have
not been able to determine whether he was exposed to infected poultry at
that market or elsewhere.
H5N1 infections in poultry have not been officially reported in the area.
