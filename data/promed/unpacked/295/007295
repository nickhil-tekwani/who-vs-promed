It was confirmed that the soccer coach of the Club Unión Vecinal Etcheverry, died of the hantavirus. "The evolution of his disease was rapid, due to the symptoms samples were taken that confirmed the disease," reported Manuel De Battista, director of the Health Region XI. The young man's picture aroused suspicions that it could be hantavirus, leptospirosis or COVID-19. In addition, after a tour of the areas in which he worked, the presence of rodents was found.

As this newspaper learned, [he] was doing rural jobs and began to have sudden respiratory problems, for which he had to be admitted to the Spanish Hospital. The young man would have been decompensated on [Wed 1 Dec 2021] and, based on testimonies that EL DIA collected from those close to the entity of 54 and 229, he would have suffered a "multi-organ failure", which caused his death. "Due to the symptoms he presented, the doctors took samples that were referred to the Malbrán Institute and the contagion of hantavirus was determined," De Battista reported.

The official pointed out that at this time some cases are presented and, according to the analysis of the Epidemiology area, it is within what is expected. He also clarified that there was not a string of cases in the Region.

Of note, since it was suspected that the cause of death could be due to the disease transmitted by the long-tailed mouse, the Ministry of Health of the Municipality intervened. "The virus is transmitted by the secretion of mice and cannot be diagnosed only by symptoms, when there is a suspicion, the hospital warns and epidemiological surveillance is carried out. This was a typical case related to the rural area, the young man worked in the fields and the summer is a time of risk ", added De Battista and said that the case should not cause excessive alarm, but rather that we must take care to avoid favorable environments the rodent.

For his part, Enrique Rifourcat, head of the Municipality's Health Secretariat, reported that they acted immediately, as soon as there was a presumption that it could be a case of hantavirus. "Due to the characteristics of the patient and their context, we intervened immediately. The young man worked with forage in Olmos and also did work such as cutting grass, we went and controlled all those factors, "said Rifourcat.

The official explained that the fodder and the places where [he] cut the grass were deratted. In addition, we worked with the people of the neighborhood to indicate to them the advisability of keeping the land cleared, that they do not leave food waste outside and that, when in doubt, ventilate all closed spaces before entering. Since the disease is transmitted by aerosols given off by mice and that, for example, if you enter a shed, you should avoid sweeping it before ventilating it. It is also recommended to wipe wet cloths and work with protectors such as gloves and chinstraps.

In relation to the young person's environment, a follow-up was done to rule out that they could also have the disease, but so far, no contagion has been recorded. Regarding the symptoms, they are similar to those of the flu and that if in doubt, it is recommended to consult a doctor early.

[Several hantaviruses are endemic in Argentina and sporadically cause severe cardiopulmonary disease with death there. As noted in ProMED archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (in western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina; in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _O. forensi_); and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. The locality where the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is Lisandro Olmos municipality, Buenos Aires province in Argentina. His infection might have been due to the Buenos Aires hantavirus. The rodent host of this virus has not been determined. Individuals in the affected neighborhoods would be prudent to follow the recommendations that the Public Health recommends above in order to prevent exposure to the virus. - Mod.TY
