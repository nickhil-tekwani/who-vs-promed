Texas health officials say the number of people sick with whooping cough [pertussis] statewide is on track to reach the highest level in more than 50 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services on Tuesday, 3 Sep 2013, urged people to make sure they are vaccinated against the highly contagious disease that causes a severe cough.

There have been almost 2000 cases reported so far in 2013 with the annual total likely to surpass the recent high of 3358 cases in 2009. In 2013, 2 infants have died from whooping cough; both were too young to be vaccinated.

The infection spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. While infants are most at risk, people of all ages can get whooping cough.

The New Mexico Department of Health reported that 331 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) have been reported in New Mexico in 2013.

"Pertussis is very contagious and can cause serious illness -- especially in infants too young to be fully vaccinated," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent pertussis. The Department of Health recommends that pregnant women and anyone who is going to be around a baby make sure they are up to date on their pertussis vaccination."

The counties with the highest rate of pertussis in 2013 are Los Alamos, Taos and Santa Fe. Rates are used to describe disease activity of cases over a given period of time. Rates take into account the different population sizes of demographic groups or geographic areas so that meaningful comparisons can be made between groups and areas.

In 2012, 898 cases of pertussis were reported in New Mexico; 2 children died that year. No deaths have been reported in 2013, but 9 infants have been hospitalized.

Towns and cities across Montana are still reporting cases of the whooping cough [pertussis]. During a health board meeting earlier in August 2013, it was revealed that 225 cases of pertussis were reported between June 2012 and May 2013. That's an average of nearly 19 cases a month -- and 25 more cases were reported in June 2013.

Data for the month of August [2013] was not made available in that report, but the Flathead City-County Health Department tells us they are still confirming cases of pertussis in the Flathead.

The Butte-Silver Bow Health Department is also dealing with an outbreak of whooping cough. Health officials say so far in 2013 there have been 27 cases of pertussis. In 2012, there were only 2.

Meanwhile, Anaconda Deer Lodge County is also seeing a huge increase with 36 diagnosed cases already in 2013. In 2012, there was just one.

As of 14 Aug 2013, 326 cases of pertussis, including 50 cases in infants, have been identified by public health officials in North Carolina, according to a press release from the state Department of Health and Human Services.

"State law requires that kindergartners and all rising 6th graders be up to date on pertussis vaccination before going to school," Robin Cummings, MD, acting state health director, said in the press release. "But as parents are getting their children ready to go to back to school, it is also good for parents to check on immunizations for the whole family. Any adults or older siblings, especially those who will be around newborns, should be vaccinated against pertussis."

High numbers of pertussis cases are being seen in Davidson, Forsyth and Rockingham counties, so the state Department of Health and Human Services authorized those counties' local health departments to provide the vaccine free to anyone, regardless of insurance status.

Development of a better pertussis vaccine has emerged as a pressing need in light of persuasive evidence of waning immunity to current vaccines. But can it be done? Can a new vaccine be created that provides enhanced efficacy and longer-lasting immunity without increasing reactogenicity? "I think it can be done," Dr. Myron J. Levin said at a conference on pediatric infectious diseases sponsored by the Children's Hospital Colorado.

Evidence of waning immunity to the current 5-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine has convinced some scientists that a better pertussis vaccine is needed. "The question you might ask is, can we do a better job than nature? After all, pertussis infection doesn't cause lasting immunity, so could we do a better job than nature? I think so. And here's an example: We know that antibody is protective against HPV [human papillomavirus], and that the HPV vaccine gives a much stronger antibody response, often by 100-fold, than does natural infection with HPV," observed Dr. Levin, who led development of the shingles vaccine.

Convincing evidence of waning immunity to the current 5-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine series completed before age 7 years in the USA comes from research conducted at the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California. The investigators analyzed the large California pertussis outbreak of 2010. Their case-control study showed that the protection provided by the DTaP vaccine was short-lived, such that each year after completing the 5th dose the likelihood of developing PCR-proven pertussis climbed by an average of 42 percent (N. Engl. J. Med. 2012;367:1012-9). Thus, they calculated that if the initial effectiveness of DTaP was 90 percent, it would drop to a mere 42 percent 5 years after the 5th and final dose. In addition, there is a strong argument that the original estimate of the vaccine's efficacy of about 85 percent was inflated due to the case definition used. The efficacy rate after 5 years becomes disturbingly low if the actual efficacy rate was roughly 7 percent, as many now believe, noted Dr. Levin, professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Colorado, Denver.

The whole-cell pertussis vaccines were clearly more effective than the DTaP, which began replacing them in the early 1990s. In another Kaiser Permanente study that zeroed in on the transition period between the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccine and DTaP, patients who contracted PCR-confirmed pertussis did so an average of 14.7 years after receiving their last dose in the series if they received one or more doses of whole-cell vaccine compared with a mere 5.6 years after the last dose if they got the all-DTaP series.

The national switch to DTaP was carried out because the vaccine has fewer adverse effects than does the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. Components of whole-cell vaccines, including lipopolysaccharides and internal proteins, were important in signaling the innate immune system to shape a more robust response. Unfortunately, these whole-cell vaccine components also trigger unwanted reactogenic local and systemic effects.

"Whenever a vaccine is cleaned up to decrease side effects, there is a great likelihood that the efficacy will be affected. This is almost certainly the case with acellular pertussis, and probably with the split-product flu vaccines as well. I would say we need to learn why the whole-cell pertussis vaccine was so effective -- which component was most important in directing the immune response -- and see if we can separate that from the side effects. This is a research issue," said Dr. Levin.

Possible ways to create a better DTaP vaccine might involve incorporating a detoxified lipopolysaccharide or adding additional adjuvants to increase the innate immune response to the pertussis antigen.

Vaccine development takes time. In the interim, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC has taken steps to deal with the nation's worsening pertussis epidemic outbreak. Because the herd protection effect is probably low, a "cocooning" strategy has been adopted. This involves targeted immunization of pregnant women and all close contacts of their babies during the 1st year of life, when pertussis has its highest morbidity and mortality. In addition, an adolescent dose of pertussis vaccine has been introduced. And consideration is being given to the possibility of universal once-per-decade booster doses in adults, but this has thus far been rejected as not being cost-effective.

[It certainly appears that the current DTaP vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
