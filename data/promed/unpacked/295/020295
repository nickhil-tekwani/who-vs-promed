African swine fever virus (ASF) was detected in a wild boar found dead in Brandenburg near the German-Polish border. The Berlin-Brandenburg state laboratory detected specific genome sequences of ASF virus in the samples taken on site. The National Reference Laboratory for ASF at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) on the island of Riems confirmed the finding on 10 Sep 2020. This is the 1st case of ASF in Germany.

Bones of a largely decayed carcass were sampled. It can therefore be assumed that the entry took place a few weeks ago.

According to the assessment of the FLI, the risk of the pathogen being introduced into Germany was classified as high. The geographical distance to the last confirmed case of ASF in Poland is only 30 km [18.6 mi]. The proximity to the German-Polish border of about 6 km [3.7 mi] makes an entry by a migrating wild boar likely. An introduction by humans through contaminated food cannot be ruled out. The local veterinary authorities must now take the necessary measures. ASF has been spreading in Eurasia since 2007, reaching in 2014 the eastern border of the EU. ASF is spread over longer distances through human activities such as improper disposal of contaminated food. This led to outbreaks in the Czech Republic and Belgium, both successfully eradicated, supported by the construction of fences. Brandenburg also erected a protective fence against the ASF on its border with Poland, in December 2019.

It is now extremely important for farmers to strictly observe farm biosecurity. This offers the best protection against the pathogen entering farm animal populations. The pig keeping hygiene regulation serves as the legal basis for this.

Examinations of wild boars found dead for the presence of the ASF virus should be intensively undertaken on the national level. Such carcasses should be reported immediately to the authorities. This is usually done by calling. Marking and georeferencing of the site [sending the coordinates] are important. The 'Tierfund-Kataster' (Germany-wide registration of wild animals) free mobile-phone application, at https://www.tierfund-kataster.de/tfk/tfk_erfassung.php, allows convenient reporting and can also be used to send a photograph and coordinates to a remote database.

The disposal of potentially contaminated pig products such as sausage and meat should be applied in a way that excludes access of domestic pigs. Vehicles, clothing, footwear, and equipment that could have been contaminated during hunting, for example, should be cleaned and disinfected.

The Federal German states ("Bundeslaender") are responsible for implementing the protection measures prescribed by the Swine Fever legislation, in particular the establishment of restricted areas and observation areas. Exercises to combat ASF have taken place in some federal states. Regular task force meetings on the current situation and disease control issues are held under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture.

Research is being carried out worldwide into the development of a vaccine against ASF, but it will not be used in practice in the foreseeable future. The ASF virus reservoir is the wild boar population; the pathogen is transmitted from pig to pig through blood and droplets. The ASF virus only affects pigs (wild and domestic) and cannot be transmitted to humans. The consumption of wild boar is still safe.

[The introduction of ASF from wild boar in western Poland into Germany was anticipated for quite some time. Since the remains of the infected animal date back several weeks, additional animals could have been infected or died in the meantime. Their earliest possible detection and testing, and culling of potential contact animals, are warranted.

One of the most important challenges observed in EU countries that have already suffered ASF in wild boar was the difficulty for the veterinary service to keep up with the collection and disposal of all wild boar carcasses for a prolonged period after the detection of the index case. Therefore, as soon as possible after the beginning of the 1st outbreak, other stakeholders need to be involved in the enhanced passive surveillance, and responsibilities need to be shared to control the spread of the disease in wild boar populations.

Furthermore, as the density of the wild boar population is never known exactly and the percentage of wild boar found dead that are notified to the veterinary service is also not precisely known, it is difficult to evaluate the exact impact of the ASF infection on wild boar populations and the effect of the control measures.

Despite the awareness campaigns and information distributed through different channels, some people, especially hunters, were found to still be reluctant to notify authorities of wild boar carcass. Perhaps the reason was the unknown consequences that could have a negative impact on hunting (such as hunting bans, trade restrictions, etc.). Enhanced passive surveillance of ASF in wild boar populations demands for a continuous dialogue between all involved stakeholders and shared responsibility in monitoring and the control of the disease.

The above, and exhaustive, additional information on ASF in Europe's wild boar was included in the Scientific Opinion on 'African swine fever in wild boar', adopted by the European Commission on 12 Jun 2018, published 18 Jul 2018 (EFSA Journal 2018; 16(7): 5344); this paper can be downloaded at https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5344. - Mod.AS
