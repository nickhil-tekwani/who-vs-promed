The Director of Veterinary Services at the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Karim Boughalem, said on [Sun 13 Sep 2015] in Oran that no cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been recently detected in livestock in Algeria.

"No cases of FMD are presently evolving in Algerian livestock. We have so far registered no symptoms of the disease in the controlled herds/flocks," he said at the opening of the event "Espace veterinaire algerien" held at Ain Turck (Oran province).

Mr. Boughalem highlighted human and material resources mobilized on the ground for the prevention of the highly contagious virus within
the sheep flock, reiterating that "no cases of FMD have been identified in the country for more than 4 months."

"Thanks to the measures taken by the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, we managed to contain the FMD epizootic
which affected cattle in 2014," he said, recalling that the last cases were registered in March and April [2015], some of them in the province of El Bayadh.

The official said that the operation of livestock inspection and vaccination against this [exceptional] zoonosis continues, with the mobilization of all national resources including 2000 veterinarians from the public sector and more than 7500 from the private sector.

The operation also includes vaccination against other diseases that affect livestock such as sheep pox, he added, saying that despite the stability of the situation in the animal population, it is essential to be vigilant and intensify control measures.

In anticipation of Eid El Adha [Feast of Sacrifice], vaccination against FMD involved, to date, more than 16 million sheep head out of the total of 25 million head that constitute the sheep population in Algeria. Furthermore, Mr. Boughalem reported progress achieved by the ongoing campaign of Eid without hydatid cyst [hydatidosis], which was launched in conjunction with the intensification of control actions in grazing areas, especially in steppe regions.

Regarding the situation of livestock markets in anticipation of Eid El Adha, he gave assurances about the availability of the required number of sheep this year [2015] and the stability of their prices.

Mobile veterinary teams were set up to control livestock markets and supervise the opening of slaughterhouses on the forthcoming Eid day, and hotlines at all municipalities in the country will be open to answer the citizens' queries, said the Director of Veterinary Services at the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries.

[The newswire says: "...no symptoms of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been recorded to date in the controlled livestock" without specifying what is meant by the term "controlled livestock." It remains to be seen whether all the Algerian herds/flocks are controlled or whether there are some that are not and thus likely to experience FMD outbreaks that may go unnoticed.

It also gives the vaccination coverage rate that was achieved in sheep (16 million head over a total estimated at 25 million) without mentioning whether the operation will be extended to goats, nor does it provide figures on the immunization coverage achieved in cattle during the various provincial campaigns organized for this purpose in [2015] as a booster vaccination.

It should be noted that sheep did not benefit from the emergency FMD vaccination carried out in 2014 following the onset of the disease; no doubt, proven cases of clinical FMD observed in sheep in 2015 in the province of El Bayadh (and other provinces) have prompted the veterinary authorities to vaccinate this animal species as well.

As we approach the feast of sacrifice [Eid al Adha], it seems that the statements of the Director of Veterinary Services are primarily designed to reassure farmers and consumers so to ensure a calm atmosphere during the acquisition of sheep in livestock markets. - Mod.AB
