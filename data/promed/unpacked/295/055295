Saudi camel breeders blame government for dying herds
-----------------------------------------------------
Thousands of camels have died due to "toxic fodder" over the past
month in Saudi Arabia, where breeders are venting their anger at
government officials. Residents of the desert kingdom cherish camels,
which evoke memories of battles and feats of their bedouin ancestors.
And breeders, some of whom have lost herds worth millions of dollars,
are blaming the ministry in charge.
"Officials of the Agriculture Ministry have remained arms-folded
vis-a-vis this unprecedented disaster," a camel owner from the
southern Jazan region, charged in Al-Watan daily.
The local press has described the deaths as a "national tragedy"
since the unexplained "contamination" claimed its first victims in
Wadi al-Dawasser, 400 km [248.5 miles] south of the capital, Riyadh,
before spreading to other parts of the kingdom. Camels, nicknamed
"ships of the desert" and reputed for their sturdiness and
resilience, have since been dying in large numbers. Many owners have
attributed the deaths to the bran fed to the animals instead of
barley, whose price has been spiraling.
"It is the bran originating from the [state-owned] silos and mills of
Khamis Mushayt [the closest to Wadi al-Dawasser] that is responsible
for this catastrophe," Saudi-owned pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat wrote on
20 Aug 2007.
One expert told the business daily Al-Eqtisadiah that the afflicted
camels lose control of their movements and suffer a cerebral
hemorrhage and total paralysis. Under fire for alleged negligence,
authorities have sent frozen samples of dead camels to be tested in
French laboratories.
Ali Khalaf al-Hassawi, a veterinarian with the Agriculture Ministry,
blamed "the wrong methods of stocking bran."
Agriculture Minister Fahd bin Abdel-Rahman Balghnaim told Al-Watan
Thursday [6 Sep 2007] that preliminary results showed the bran was
contaminated by poisonous fungi. Balghnaim broke his silence to
announce that 2000 camels had died 2 weeks after the deaths began,
then revised the figure upward to 2500.
An AFP count based on press reports shows, however, that at least
5000 camels have died and thousands more have become sick, in a
country which boasted around 862 000 camels in 2005.
In mid-August [2007], King Abdullah ordered the payment of
compensation of 4000 riyals (USD 1066) per head, but camel owners
cited in newspapers thought this was too little.
Deputy Defense Minister Prince Abdel-Rahman bin Abdel-Aziz offered
300 of his own camels to breeders who have lost animals.
One breeder was quoted in Al-Watan in late August [2007] as saying
that a similar, albeit less widespread, disaster struck 12 years ago:
The bran importer was the same and the results of tests undertaken in
Germany and Egypt were never made public.
"The killers must be identified to protect the rest of the herds from
this programmed commercial death ... This time we will not allow the
killers to be spared," wrote Jasser Abdullah al-Harbash in Al-Hayat.
One contributor to a Web site used by Saudis suggested the problem
could be the result of rivalries among owners of camels -- which can
fetch more than 1 million riyals (USD 267 000) -- and an influential
prince who owns rare species.

Government Says Contaminated Fodder Killed Camels
---------------------------------------------
Toxins in animal feed rather than any contagious disease are to blame
for the deaths of more than 3000 camels, cows and goats in different
parts of the Kingdom over the past 2 months, the Ministry of
Agriculture announced yesterday [8 sep 2007].
The announcement was made after tests were conducted in laboratories
both inside and outside Saudi Arabia. The tests were carried out on
samples taken from dead animals, from suspicious fodder as well as on
pesticides, cyanides, nitrates, urea and phenol, and radioactive materials.
"The results showed that the samples contained salinomycin, a
compound to which camels are highly allergic. Laboratory tests showed
that the bran used to feed camels contained this compound in high
concentrations," the ministry said.
Another toxic [contaminant] found in large quantities in the fodder
was _Aspergillus clavatus_, which is a fungus. The ministry said that
the fungus usually appeared in places with high humidity as well as
high temperature. The fungus [rather several mycotoxins produced by
the fungus. - Mod.AS] affects animals' nervous systems and the fodder
got infected as a result of poor storage.
Tests also proved that the samples of bran and those taken from dead
camels contained toxic aluminum in large amounts. The ministry
pointed out that most insecticides available in the market contain aluminum.
The ministry has not yet identified the source of the fodder that
killed hundreds of animals across the country. It said, however, that
it would continue its search in order to find the source of toxins in
the bran, which was used to feed the animals.
The ministry advised farmers and owners of animals to buy fodder from
factories and authorized distributors and store it in suitable places
in order to avoid contamination. The public is also advised not to
store fodder near pesticides, to apply pesticides in a scientific
manner and approach the Agriculture Ministry if guidelines are needed.
The 150-member Shoura Council is expected to discuss this week the
deaths of hundreds of camels and other animals across the country.
Agriculture Minister Fahd Balghunaim said a special panel composed of
officials from the ministries of Interior, Agriculture and Finance
was investigating to ascertain the source of the fodder that caused
the deaths. According to figures reported in the press, at least 5000
camels have now died and thousands more are sick.
The minister said owners of the dead animals would be paid
compensation on instructions from Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
King Abdullah. Some camel owners have refused to bury their dead
animals as they are awaiting the arrival of panel members to register
their dead animals in order to receive compensation. Citizens fear
that the delay in burial might trigger an environmental catastrophe.
The Kingdom's camel population is estimated at 850 000.

[I am uncertain that camels are highly allergic, as the article
states, but I do know that camels are as sensitive to ionophores as
horses are. It is quite simply, very toxic to most camelids, which
includes the alpacas mentioned in my colleague's comment [see below].
Many of the Aspergillus species can produce a variety of mycotoxins.
The article does not tell us the level that was found in the fodder
samples. Neither does it tell us the level of aluminum.
My strongest impression is that the salinomycin is responsible for
the deaths. However, salinomycin is more often added to grain
mixtures than fodder. And the deaths may be related to a combination
of all of these factors over perhaps a few days to a month.
What is difficult is to follow the ministries direction and purchase
new feed, when the source of the feed is unknown. Since the source is
unknown, the distribution may also be unknown so how is one to
purchase clean food for the animals? - Mod.TG].
[Salinomycin is an ionophore coccidiostat with a broad spectrum of
efficiency, closely related to monensin. It is known to cause
myopathy leading to cardiac failure and death in various domestic
animals when fed in toxic levels; serious toxicity has been
documented in cattle, sheep, pigs, turkeys and others. As underlined
above by Mod.TG, camelids are particularly susceptible. A mass
intoxication event of alpacas, fed with varying amounts of a
commercial feed to which salinomycin had been accidentally added at
the poultry feed rate, 66 ppm, was documented in the USA in 2003. Out
of about 1000 animals involved, 250 alpacas displayed clinical signs
and 135 died (see: Kosal and Anderson, J. Anim. Sci., 2004, 82:
3394-3400, free at
<http://jas.fass.org/cgi/reprint/82/11/3394>).
According to the said paper, estimates of salinomycin intake were
determined to be between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg of BW consumed by those
displaying clinical signs (estimated overall feed intake was 0.227 to
0.454 kg per animal daily).
It will be interesting to compare the above toxicity and the
clinico-pathological observed in the alpacas with the available
recordings from the exposed and affected Saudi Arabian camels.
More details on the control upon fodder supply, supplements and
animal medication in Saudi Arabia, and on the steps undertaken to
remedy the situation as reflected during this unfortunate, overly
extended event, are anticipated from the Saudi authorities.
Public health aspects of salinomycin in edible tissues should not be
neglected. Paradoxically, the more toxic the substance is to a food
animal species, the less likely it will be able to breach the
permitted maximum residual levels (MRL) in animal tissue for human consumption.
Australia has recently published updated MRLs (mg/kg) for salinomycin
in tissues of some mammal species, as follows:
Cattle, edible offal: 0.5;
Cattle, meat: 0.05;
Pig, edible offal: 0.1;
Pig, meat: 0.1.

results from the laboratories involved will be helpful. Conclusions
and lessons will be useful for many a country. - Mod.AS]
