[3] Iran: 95 cases, 16 deaths

2 more people infected with the new coronavirus have died, taking the toll in Iran to 16, a Health Ministry official told state TV on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020].

Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year.

"Among those who had been suspected of the virus, 35 have been confirmed and 2 died of the coronavirus infection," said Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. He said 95 people had been infected across Iran.

The Health Ministry urged Iranians to stay at home.
Iran, which confirmed its 1st 2 deaths last week in Qom, has yet to say how many people it has quarantined, but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalized.

Iraj Harirchi, Iran's deputy health minister, has tested positive for the coronavirus and is now under quarantine.

6 Arab countries have reported their 1st cases of coronavirus, with those infected all having links to Iran. Kuwait said the number of infected people there had risen to 8.

Bahrain's Health Ministry said 15 more people, including 6 Saudi women, had tested positive for the virus after returning from Iran via Dubai and Sharjah. The new cases were carried by Bahraini and Saudi nationals who arrived at Bahrain International Airport from Iran via Dubai or Sharjah. The Saudi Ministry of Health said that it was coordinating with Bahraini health officials for the treatment of the Saudi women who had visited Iran. They will remain in Bahrain until they are fully recovered. The Kingdom has advised citizens and residents to avoid traveling to Italy and Japan.

Iranian authorities have ordered the nationwide cancellation of concerts and soccer matches and the closure of schools and universities in many provinces.

[In the past 24 hours, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran have grown from 61 to 95 - an increase of 34 newly confirmed cases. The number of fatalities has also increased from 12 to 16, an increase of 4 new fatalities. Repeating my comment from yesterday "One suspects as testing expands and more milder clinical presentations are found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive, the reported case fatality rate will be lower. The epidemiologic picture is still unfolding."

The Ministry of Health in Bahrain has registered 9 new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus carried by Bahraini and Saudi citizens arriving at Bahrain International Airport via Dubai and Sharjah, confirming a total of 17 registered cases in the Kingdom so far.

The ministry highlighted that all necessary tests were taken on all 9 cases, in a well-equipped, isolated area at the airport, after which the patients were transferred to the Ebrahim Khalil Kanoo Community Health Center in Al Salmaniya, for complete isolation and treatment.

The ministry outlined that the 9 new registered cases were detected among 4 female Bahraini nationals arriving from Iran, via Sharjah, and 3 male Bahraini nationals arriving from Iran (2 arriving via Sharjah and 1 arriving via Dubai), and 2 female Saudi nationals arriving from Iran, via Sharjah. All patients are under isolation and are receiving treatment from a specialised team. In addition, the ministry has quarantined all individuals the patients have been in recent contact as a precaution, after they tested negative for the virus.

The ministry further noted that the infected individuals had arrived in the Kingdom before the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to suspend flights from Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport for 48 hours. The ministry stressed that all necessary measures are being taken to examine each passenger arriving from affected countries, adding that patients will be immediately transferred to isolation for treatment if symptoms of the condition are found or confirmed following laboratory analysis.

It's impressive that over 8600 specimens have been taken, most likely as part of contact tracing. One suspects there will be more positive cases confirmed as the specimens are processed.

Italy is a major tourist point for other Europeans, with Lombardy being a major commercial hub. In addition, Italians are highly mobile and travel throughout Europe. See section [6] below for imported cases from Italy to other countries in Europe, a sign of this mobility.

A hotel in the Austrian Alps has been put on lockdown after an Italian receptionist working there contracted the virus. Officials haven't named the hotel, but they have said it's in the Alpine city of Innsbruck. It's also not clear how long it will remain on lockdown. Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told reporters: "No one can get in or out of the hotel to make sure that if other infected people are staying in the hotel, the virus won't be spread. All these measures have one purpose, to stop the virus and its spread. There is no reason to panic."

Innsbruck is the capital of the state of Tyrol, which borders Italy. The infected woman's home was also being isolated, a state government spokeswoman told AFP. She and her partner, both 24, had travelled to Innsbruck by car from their home in Lombardy, Italy last week.

Italy is the worst-hit European country, with 322 cases and 11 deaths.

Switzerland reported its 1st coronavirus case on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020] in canton Ticino in the south of the country, which borders Italy. Laboratory tests carried out in Geneva uncovered a coronavirus case in canton Ticino, authorities said on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020]. The Federal Office of Public Health told reporters in Bern that the male patient was in his 70s and had been infected in the Milan region of Italy during an event on [15 Feb 2020]. The 1st symptoms appeared 2 days later, explained FOPH director Pascal Strupler.

The pensioner has remained with his family ever since. He is now in isolation at a clinic in Lugano, canton Ticino, but is said to be doing well. Those who have been in contact with him will be tested and placed in quarantine to monitor their condition over the next 14 days.

According to FOPH, this 1st case does not change the risk assessment in Switzerland. At present the new coronavirus poses only a moderate risk to the population, FOPH officials say. "We are still in a normal situation," Strupler added. However, the probability of further cases being diagnosed is increasing. Medical institutions are prepared to carry out early detection and testing of suspected cases. They said it was not necessary at this stage to take further measures, such as closing schools. New measures would be considered if authorities had the impression that virus transmission was not under control.

So far, around 300 suspected cases of COVID-19 have been tested in Switzerland, but there had been no confirmed cases until now, according to the interior ministry. Daniel Koch, head of the department of communicable diseases at the FOPH, said there were currently 70 outstanding suspected cases in Switzerland being tested, spread throughout the country - including several in cantons Bern and Basel but only a small number in canton Ticino. Test results will be known in the coming hours, he said.

The number of cases in Italy has ballooned from 3 last Friday to 322 confirmed cases and 11 deaths, most in Lombardy and neighbouring Veneto. Italian authorities have rushed to seal off the worst affected towns, but the virus has continued to spread, and authorities reported an infection in Sicily, the 1st case south of Rome, on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020].

Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset is currently in Rome, Italy meeting his counterparts from Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Slovenia to discuss the outbreak and cross-border coordination.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally has risen above 80 000. It has killed more than 2600 people, most in China, and spread to some 29 other countries.

The Government Department of Health has confirmed the 1st positive sample for coronavirus in Catalunya on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020] from an Italian woman resident of Barcelona who is currently hospitalized in the Clinic Hospital, reference center for contagious diseases.

The patient is a 36-year-old Italian woman who is a resident of the Catalan capital who travelled in the north of her country, in the Lombardy Region between 12 and 22 Feb 2020, the zone where the epidemic has been increasing over the past days where there are more than 200 infected. She, herself, contacted the Clinic on Monday [24 Feb 2020] night where they performed the epidemiological and microbiological tests.

This is the 1st positive test for this disease in the peninsula after the other 4 confirmed cases occurred in the Canary and Balearic Islands. The 1st was detected last January [2020] in La Gomera and was discharged, while the 2nd is a British citizen residing in Mallorca.

The last positive result reported in Spain was an Italian tourist, a doctor by profession and later on by his wife. Both are awaiting the 2nd test by the National Microbiology Center. Their identification has led to a control of guests in the hotel where they are staying.

The Ministry of Health is investigating a possible patient with coronavirus in Sao Paulo. The case is pending a 2nd confirmatory test (results expected tomorrow morning, 26 Feb 2020]. A 61-yer-old man, who lives in the capital of Sao Paolo was travelling in Italy between 9 and 21 Feb 2020. The 1st test was done in the Albert Einstein Hospital and was positive. Now a 2nd confirmation by the Adolfo Lutz Institute is pending.

The patient has mild signs of the disease, such as cough. He will remain in respiratory isolation for 2 weeks, and all contacts will be traced.

[I usually wait for official final confirmation of cases before reporting them, but with the 1st positive test at the hospital combined with the importance of the geographic location, it's a good example of reason for concern given the high amount of traffic between many European cities and Brazil, and especially Sao Paulo (and Rio de Janeiro). If this suspected case is ruled out, it is only a matter of time before there will be an officially confirmed case.

A map of Brazil showing states is available at: https://www.mapsofworld.com/brazil/brazil-political-map.html. Sao Paulo is the largest city in Brazil and the financial capital of the country. It has an estimated population of over 12 million people.

Yesterday [24 Feb 2020] among the key issues was the identification of 4 "new" countries reporting confirmed cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region of WHO (Bahrain, Oman, Iraq and Afghanistan), with a history of travel from Iran. Today [25 Feb 2020] there are 3 "new" countries in Europe and 1 in North Africa reporting confirmed cases with a link to travel from Italy (Croatia, Switzerland, Austria and Algeria) and a 4th "new" country (Romania) that hosted one of the infected cases (Croatia) from Italy and a possible 5th country: Brazil in South America. A key question is whether these remain isolated imported cases or will they lead to local transmission in each of the countries where the importations occurred? - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China is now 24 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Italy, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Canada, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Iraq and Afghanistan). (This does not include the additional countries with newly confirmed cases related to travel from Italy). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has most likely been occurring on the ship. More confirmations have been reported from the cruise ship, but, in addition, confirmations on returning evacuees from the cruise ship have been reported by the USA, UK, Hong Kong, Israel and Australia.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 2459 including 34 deaths, with reports coming from 33 countries.

The Preliminary findings of the WHO mission to China were:
- the epidemic peaked and plateaued between 23 Jan 2020 and 2 Feb 2020 and has been declining steadily since then.
- there has been no significant change in the DNA of the virus.
- the fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan, and 0.7% outside Wuhan.
- for people with mild disease, recovery time is about 2 weeks, while people with severe or critical disease recover within 3 to 6 weeks.
- the team estimated that the measures taken in China have averted a significant number of cases.

It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
