Toxic algae cause lake fishing ban
-----------------------------------
Health officials have banned boating and fishing on the picturesque lake at
Queen's Park in Crewe after an outbreak of toxic blue-green algae. They have
been forced to take action at the height of the season after water tests by the

Environment Agency revealed high levels of the jelly-like substance on the
surface.

Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which manages the park, has put up warning
signs banning boating and fishing activities to protect the public while asking

dog owners to keep their pets from the water's edge.

The Environment Agency has found large amounts of the potentially poisonous
algae which can cause vomiting, skin rashes, muscle pain and diarrhoea.

Similar action had to be taken during a heat wave in 2004 and in 1997, when the

lake was treated with Reglone, a herbicide, which kills algae but does not harm

wildlife or fish.

A combination of high temperatures, calm waters and a large population of geese

fouling the lake are believed to have brought the algae to the surface.

Experts estimate there are about 40 to 50 tonnes of waste matter on the lake
bed, caused by the extremely fertile build-up of leaf litter and bird mess.

Council spokesman Ron Clarke said: "Illnesses including skin rashes, eye
irritation, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and pains in muscles have occurred in
some recreational users of water who swallow or swam through algae scum. There
have been no reports of long-term effects or death in humans, but in some cases

the illness has been severe. Scum is not always harmful but it is sensible to
avoid contact with the scum and the water close to it. Our grounds maintenance
section is working with the Environment Agency to ensure this important leisure

facility is open again as soon as agency tests say we can do so."

Plans are being made to dredge the lake later this year as part of a 3 million
pound Heritage Lottery-funded revamp of the Victorian park.
