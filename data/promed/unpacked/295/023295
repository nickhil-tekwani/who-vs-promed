Threat played down after new swine flu virus find
-------------------------------------------------
A new swine flu virus with human genes has again been found in
mainland pigs at a Hong Kong slaughterhouse. But the swine flu H3N2
virus is unlikely to cause a "major" human health risk, the Centre
for Food Safety said. 15 pigs were found infected with "essentially a
swine influenza H3N2 virus that has picked up some genes of human
swine influenza virus," the center said. They were detected out of
1000 samples taken from August to mid-October [2011].

The same flu subtype [had been] isolated also in the last round of the
surveillance programs, from May to July 2011, in 16 pigs. In both
instances, the department said it had notified mainland authorities.
There have been no recent reports of such H3N2-infected swine in
Guangdong province, however.

Flu expert Malik Peiris said the H3N2 subtype seen in the pigs is not
the same swine-originated new H3N2 that has infected 7 people in the
United States since July [2011]. The US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention said earlier that while [these] infections have been
mainly mild, they are being closely monitored [see: ProMED-mail
archived reports below]. Dr Nancy Cox, head of the Atlanta- based
agency's influenza division, said a seed strain for a vaccine that
would protect against the virus has already been developed and given
to manufacturers. [This statement likely refers to the
USA-swine-origin H3N2 reassortant (see ProMED-mail Influenza (66): USA
swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, update 20111105.3298) and not the Hong
Kong swine-origin H3N2 reassortant. - Mod.CP]. The World Health
Organization also said that for pandemic preparedness purposes, it has
developed and made available 2 candidate vaccine viruses.

All pigs coming from the mainland are slaughtered centrally in the
Sheung Shui slaughterhouse before they are taken to Hong Kong markets.
A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said the
infected pigs were destroyed. However, abattoir workers have not been
checked for the presence of the virus, the spokesman revealed. "There
is no routine check of influenza antibody level in slaughterhouse
staff," he said, in response to questions from The Standard. But staff
are advised to wear face masks and gloves while on duty, and to
observe personal hygiene.

Peiris said human flu viruses cross to pigs occasionally, and vice
versa. "This one [H3N2] is a pandemic reassorted virus," he said,
adding it was derived from the 2004-5 human flu, so most of the
population would have [acquired] immunity from [exposure to] it,
except very young children. "There is really no risk of acquiring
viruses from eating pork meat."

[A previously characterised swine-origin H3N2 reassortant, responsible
for a few isolated non-contagious benign infections in children, had
acquired one of the genes -- the M gene -- of the H1N1 flu strain that
caused the 2009 pandemic. The CDC reported the swine H3N2 virus
probably picked up the M gene from the pandemic H1N1 virus when a pig
was co-infected with swine H3N2 and the H1N1 strain. It's not clear
whether the acquisition of this human-origin gene facilitated
transmission of the reassortant to humans, but It did not enhance its
virulence or facilitate its transmissibility among humans.

Likewise there is no evidence (yet) that the Hong Kong swine H3N2
reassortant virus described above has any increased virulence for
humans or enhanced ability to infect human hosts. It is likely that
sub-unit reassortment of influenza A virus genome sub-unit is a
frequent occurrence, and inapparent without some specific selection
pressure to reveal its occurrence. - Mod.CP]

[The most common subtypes currently found in pigs are H1N1, H1N2 and
H3N2; however, the situation is complex, as 2 or more viruses of each
subtype are circulating in swine populations. "Swine influenza" is not
included in OIE's list of notifiable animal diseases. A recent
exception was registered when an influenza H3N2 virus was found, in
Denmark in 2009, as the causative agent of a new disease entity in
minks, subsequently reported to the OIE as an "emerging disease."

The definition of an emerging disease is "a new infection resulting
from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known
infection spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a
previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the
1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public
health". Subscribers are referred to the archived post 20091023.3660
addressing the said event, and in particular to the following citation
from the commentary by Mod.PC: "The 1968 Hong Kong influenza in humans
was an H3N2, swine in Europe have been infected for decades with an
H3N2, and an H3N2 swine strain became a prominent virus in the North
American swine population in 1998. H3N2 has been isolated from turkeys
in USA. As is the case with H1N1, it is critically important to do
surveillance in both the affected animal population and people to try
as best we can to establish time ordering of events and the
directionality of transmission. The key to this is comprehensive,
integrated outbreak investigations in geographically co-located animal
and human subpopulations." - Mod.AS]
