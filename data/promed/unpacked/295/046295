Taking anticoagulants before contracting COVID-19 is associated with a 43% lower risk for hospital admission, and receiving anticoagulants while in the hospital is tied to a lower death rate, according to a study published late last week in EClinicalMedicine.

The researchers created a retrospective cohort of 6195 adults with COVID-19 across M Health Fairview hospitals and clinics in the midwestern United States from [4 Mar to 27 Aug 2020]. Of these, 598 were immediately hospitalized and the remainder were initially treated as outpatients. Overall, case fatality was 2.8%, with hospitalized patients having a 13% mortality rate, and the researchers note that 5.9% of outpatients eventually needed hospitalization.

Multivariable analysis showed that the 2.9% of outpatients on 90-day anticoagulation regimens prior to COVID-19 were associated with 43% risk reduction for hospital admission (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.86; p = 0.007) but not mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.62; p = 0.64). If patients did not begin anticoagulation treatment upon hospitalization or continue their outpatient anticoagulation after being hospitalized, they had greater mortality risk (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.37; p = 0.015). Stratification by prophylactic/escalated prophylactic or therapeutic initiation compared with continued anticoagulation treatment showed HRs of 1.24 and 1.45, respectively, with p less than 0.3.

"While our study was underpowered to study bleeding complications, the comparable mortality rates between those initiated on anticoagulation or were continued on anticoagulation are reassuring. Similar to other studies, those with elevated D-dimer levels had an increased risk of death," the researchers write.

"To date, there is no consensus on the type of anticoagulant, dosage, or duration of therapy. Randomized controlled trials for anticoagulation therapy among both inpatients and outpatients are urgently awaited to address these critical questions for COVID-19 patients."

[COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state, and the risk of thromboembolic disease is increased in critically ill (and sometimes well-appearing) individuals. Thromboembolism is typically venous but, in some cases, may be arterial. Bleeding is much less common but can occur, including intracerebral bleeding, highlighting the importance of documenting ischemia or thrombosis when feasible. Decisions about anticoagulation are made based on clinical criteria as illustrated in https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=HEME%2F128045 rather than on isolated laboratory findings such as D-dimer, which is primarily used as a measure of disease severity and prognosis. Even though a small study, the results above describing deceased risk with early initiation of anticoagulants or continued use following hospitalization is promising, with the caveat that early initiation would be difficult unless the patient is taking the anticoagulants for another medical problem. - Mod.LK]

The prevalence of COVID-related hospitalizations early in the pandemic was linked with poverty and minority status in the United States, according to a study published in PLOS One late last week.

The researchers look at US COVID-19 hospitalizations from [1 Mar to 30 Apr 2020], using COVID-NET data, which covers about 10% of the country's population across 14 states. Out of 16 000 adults who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 34.8% were White people, 36.3% were Black people, and 18.2% were Hispanic or Latino people. Age-adjusted COVID-related hospitalization was higher in census tracts with 15.2% -- 83.2% of people living below the federal poverty line compared with census tracts where 0% -- 4.9% were (151.6 hospitalizations per 100 000 people vs 75.5).

Hospitalization prevalence also seemed to be affected by race. White, Black, and Hispanic people living in high-poverty census tracts had 120.3, 252.2, and 341.1 hospitalizations per 100 000 people, respectively, and the researchers found even larger racial disparities in low-poverty census tracts. When poverty and minority status overlapped, Hispanic and Black people had 9.2- and 5.3-fold higher hospitalization rates compared with White people, respectively (304 and 540.3 hospitalizations vs 58.2 per 100 000 people).

"Because hospitalization rates among Black and Hispanic persons were high regardless of census tract poverty, racial/ethnic disparities in hospitalization rates were largest in low-poverty census tracts," write the researchers. "Public health practitioners must ensure the mitigation measures and vaccination campaigns address the social, behavioral, and medical needs of racial/ethnic minority groups and people living in census tracts with lower socioeconomic indicators."

The researchers add that 33.1% of hospitalized patients were in the highest quartile of service industry workers, 30.8% were in the highest quartile of public transportation commuters, and 30% were in the highest quartile of people 25 years or older who didn't have a bachelor's degree.

Delta (B1617.2) variant transmission is complicating plans for easing COVID-19 restrictions in some Asian nations, including Singapore and South Korea, countries that have won praise for their containment efforts over the past pandemic months.

South Korea's daily total topped 3000 for the 1st time a few days ago, a rise officials said was triggered by people returning from a 3-day holiday period, according to Reuters. South Korea was one of the 1st countries outside China after SARS-CoV-2 emerged, and the country is experiencing a spike in its 4th surge. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-daily-covid-19-cases-top-3000-first-time-after-holiday-2021-09-25/]

The Seoul area is currently the hot spot, making up more than 75% of the latest infections.

Today [Mon 27 Sep 2021], the South Korea's health ministry said it would keep social distancing measures in place for 4 more weeks, maintaining them at the highest level for the greater Seoul area.

In Singapore, officials yesterday [Sun 26 Sep 2021] reported nearly 2000 cases, marking a daily record high, according to Reuters. The country recently saw cases rise as restrictions were loosened, but a few days ago, the health ministry tightened them again, limiting the size of group gatherings and urging people to work from home, according to CNBC. So far, about 82% of the population have received 2 vaccine doses. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/singapore-reports-1939-covid-19-cases-highest-since-april-last-year-2021-09-26/]

In other developments, Vietnamese officials signaled that as cases continue to decline, they will begin easing COVID restrictions on [30 Sep 2021], as officials seek a balance between reopening the economy and keeping virus levels under control, but not with a goal of zero cases as before, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-relax-covid-19-restrictions-revive-pandemic-hit-economy-2021-09-25/]

In the country's current wave, the manufacturing hub around Ho Chi Minh City has been particularly hard hit, which triggered the closure of some factories.

And in Japan, government officials are expected to allow the state of emergency, in effect for 19 prefectures, to expire on [30 Sep 2021], according to the Japan Times. New cases are declining, but officials are urging the public not to let their guard down. So far, about 52% of the country's [population] is fully vaccinated, and last week officials said booster shots will be given to health workers by the end of the year [2021]. [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/09/27/national/virus-emergency-lifting/]

Meanwhile, Australian officials today announced steps for reopening Sydney, which is the country's main hot spot and has now been under lockdown for several weeks. The plan consists of a 2-tier system, which gives vaccinated people more freedoms, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-set-unveil-freedom-roadmap-more-covid-19-curbs-eased-2021-09-27/]

[In the US, restrictions are likely to ease in most locations since "the summer surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the delta (B1617.2) variant may be tapering off after causing the 4th wave of heightened pandemic activity in the United States.

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 118 015, with 1996 deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week, new daily cases fell 20%, deaths fell 0.8%, and hospitalizations fell 8.9%.

According to NBC News, the drop in COVID-19 cases over the last week is the longest sustained decline in cases in nearly 3 months. NBC said the 4th wave likely peaked on (13 Sep 2021), when the 7-day average of cases at 166 807.

Though new case counts and hospitalizations seems to be declining, experts warned the peak deaths caused by this wave are still likely 2 -- 4 weeks away, as has been seen throughout the pandemic. " (from

[3] Life expectancy

American men lost 2.2 years of life expectancy last year because of COVID-19, the biggest decline among 29 nations in a study of the pandemic's impact on longevity.

Deaths among working-age men contributed the most to declining lifespans in the U.S., according to research led by demographers at the U.K.'s University of Oxford. Only Denmark and Norway, who have excelled at controlling their outbreaks, avoided drops in life expectancy across both sexes, the study published [Sun 26 Sep 2021] in the International Journal of Epidemiology found. [Aburto JM, Scholey J, Kashnitsky I, et al. Quantifying impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through life-expectancy losses: a population-level study of 29 countries, International Journal of Epidemiology, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab207]

Before the pandemic, life expectancy at birth had continuously increased in most countries for generations. COVID-19, though, "triggered a global mortality crisis," the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed since World War II in Western Europe or the breakup of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the researchers said.

The study is the first to use an extensive collection of demographic data from 29 countries representing most of Europe, Chile and the U.S., to examine the impact of the pandemic on life expectancy in 2020, said lead researcher Jose Manuel Aburto, the Newton International Fellow in the department of sociology at Oxford, and his co-authors. The impact of COVID-19 on lifespans may be even greater in less developed countries that weren't included in the research.

"Emerging evidence from low- and middle-income countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, that have been devastated by the pandemic suggests that life-expectancy losses may be even larger in these populations," they said, noting that losses in life expectancy are also likely to vary between subgroups within countries.

Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped the most in more than 7 decades last year, falling 1.5 years, to 77.3 years, a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in July [2021]. It found the pandemic's disproportionate toll on communities of color also widened existing gaps in life expectancy between White and Black Americans.

American men and women led the losses. The biggest declines in life expectancy, a loss of 1.5 years or more at birth in 2020, were documented among males in the U.S., Lithuania, Bulgaria and Poland, and females in the U.S. and Spain. Females from 15 of the 29 countries studied and males from 10 ended up with lower life expectancy at birth last year.

It's taken an average of 5.6 years for these countries to achieve a 1-year increase in life expectancy, with "progress wiped out over the course of 2020 by Covid-19," Aburto and his co-authors wrote in the study.

They found:
- Life-expectancy losses were larger for males in every country except Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Northern Ireland;
- The magnitudes of losses in 2020 haven't been witnessed since World War II in Western European countries such as Spain, England & Wales, Italy, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Portugal;
- The losses observed in Eastern European countries exceeded those after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, with the exception of Lithuania and Hungary.

The researchers cautioned against viewing COVID-19 as "a transient shock to life expectancy."

There is evidence of potential lingering harm from long-COVID and delayed care for other illnesses, compounded by the health effects of widening inequality from the pandemic's social and economic disruption. "The scars of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health may be longer-lasting,"

[The research team assembled an unprecedented dataset on mortality from 29 countries, spanning most of Europe, the US and Chile - countries for which official death registrations for 2020 had been published. They found that 27 of the 29 countries saw reductions in life expectancy in 2020, and at a scale which wiped out years of progress on mortality.

Across most of the 29 countries, males saw larger life expectancy declines than females. The largest declines in life expectancy were observed among males in the US, who saw a decline of 2.2 years relative to 2019 levels, followed by Lithuanian males (1.7 years).

According to co-lead author, Dr. Ridhi Kashyap, 'The large declines in life expectancy observed in the US can partly be explained by the notable increase in mortality at working ages observed in 2020. In the US, increases in mortality in the under 60 age group contributed most significantly to life expectancy declines, whereas across most of Europe increases in mortality above age 60 contributed more significantly.'

Life expectancy, also known as period life expectancy, refers to the average age to which a newborn live if current death rates continued for their whole life. It does not predict an actual lifespan. It provides a snapshot of current mortality conditions and allows for a comparison of the size of the mortality impacts of the pandemic between different countries and populations.

The Lancet Infectious Diseases. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00485-0 Available online 14 Sep 2021

Summary
Background
The antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support.

Results.
The difference between treatment groups was not significant (odds ratio 0.98 [95% CI 0·77-1.25]; p=0.85). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups (Remdesivir, 135 [33%] of 406 vs control, 130 [31%] of 418; p=0.48). Three deaths (acute respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial infection, and hepatorenal syndrome) were considered related to Remdesivir by the investigators, but only one by the sponsor's safety team (hepatorenal syndrome).

Interpretation
No clinical benefit was observed from the use of Remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support.

["Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that is intracellularly metabolised to an analogue of ATP, which inhibits RNA polymerase activity in some pathogenic coronaviruses. Remdesivir has shown evidence of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical models, both in vitro and in vivo, supporting its evaluation in COVID-19. ... mixed results have not led so far to a consensus on the use of Remdesivir for patients with COVID-19."

In this study, Remdesivir administration was well tolerated but was neither associated with a better clinical outcome at day 15 and 29 nor with a faster viral clearance. Scientists are still looking for an effective anti-viral compound, making vaccination even more important. - Mod.LK]

[5] Brain's response to COVID-19

With more than 18 months of the pandemic in the rearview mirror, researchers have been steadily gathering new and important insights into the effects of COVID-19 on the body and brain. These findings are raising concerns about the long-term impacts that the coronavirus might have on biological processes such as aging.

As a cognitive neuroscientist, my past research has focused on understanding how normal brain changes related to aging affect people's ability to think and move - particularly in middle age and beyond. But as more evidence came in showing that COVID-19 could affect the body and brain for months or longer following infection, my research team became interested in exploring how it might also impact the natural process of aging.

In August 2021, a preliminary but large-scale study investigating brain changes in people who had experienced COVID-19 drew a great deal of attention within the neuroscience community. [Douaud G, Lee S, Alfaro-Almagro C, et al. Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank. medRxiv 2021.06.11.21258690; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690]

In that study, researchers relied on an existing database called the UK Biobank, which contains brain imaging data from over 45 000 people in the U.K. going back to 2014. This means - crucially - that there was baseline data and brain imaging of all of those people from before the pandemic.

The research team analyzed the brain imaging data and then brought back those who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 for additional brain scans. They compared people who had experienced COVID-19 to participants who had not, carefully matching the groups based on age, sex, baseline test date and study location, as well as common risk factors for disease, such as health variables and socioeconomic status.

The team found marked differences in gray matter - which is made up of the cell bodies of neurons that process information in the brain - between those who had been infected with COVID-19 and those who had not. Specifically, the thickness of the gray matter tissue in brain regions known as the frontal and temporal lobes was reduced in the COVID-19 group, differing from the typical patterns seen in the group that hadn't experienced COVID-19.

In the general population, it is normal to see some change in gray matter volume or thickness over time as people age, but the changes were larger than normal in those who had been infected with COVID-19.

Interestingly, when the researchers separated the individuals who had severe enough illness to require hospitalization, the results were the same as for those who had experienced milder COVID-19. That is, people who had been infected with COVID-19 showed a loss of brain volume even when the disease was not severe enough to require hospitalization.

Finally, researchers also investigated changes in performance on cognitive tasks and found that those who had contracted COVID-19 were slower in processing information, relative to those who had not.

While we have to be careful interpreting these findings as they await formal peer review, the large sample, pre- and post-illness data in the same people and careful matching with people who had not had COVID-19 have made this preliminary work particularly valuable.

Early on in the pandemic, one of the most common reports from those infected with COVID-19 was the loss of sense of taste and smell.

Strikingly, the brain regions that the U.K. researchers found to be impacted by COVID-19 are all linked to the olfactory bulb, a structure near the front of the brain that passes signals about smells from the nose to other brain regions. The olfactory bulb has connections to regions of the temporal lobe. We often talk about the temporal lobe in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease because it is where the hippocampus is located. The hippocampus is likely to play a key role in aging, given its involvement in memory and cognitive processes.

The sense of smell is also important to Alzheimer's research, as some data has suggested that those at risk for the disease have a reduced sense of smell. While it is far too early to draw any conclusions about the long-term impacts of these COVID-related changes, investigating possible connections between COVID-19-related brain changes and memory is of great interest - particularly given the regions implicated and their importance in memory and Alzheimer's disease.

These new findings bring about important yet unanswered questions: What do these brain changes following COVID-19 mean for the process and pace of aging? And, over time does the brain recover to some extent from viral infection?
