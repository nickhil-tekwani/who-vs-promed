Dr. Kellon raised several questions regarding serological testing performed
on the 2 horses for California encephalitis in Louisiana.
The testing was performed at the Louisiana Office of Public Health Central
Laboratories Virology Section in New Orleans. Both of the equine sera were
single acute specimens collected from horses showing ataxia, depression and
anorexia. One animal was euthanized (Horse 1) and the other animal died
(Horse 2) within 24 hours after the specimens were collected. Both animals
had been stabled in the same part of the state, and became ill within a
1-month period.
Indirect fluorescent antibody assays was performed using cells infected
with Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis
virus (WEE), California Encephalitis virus Group (CE) and Saint Louis
Encephalitis virus (SLE). Titers were determined for both IgG and IgM
antibody subclasses. Note: The SLE infected cells used in this procedure
will show cross-reactions with all members of the Flavivirus group (West
Nile included) and the California virus group infected cells will show
cross-reactions with all CE group viruses. Additional testing is required
to identify a specific viral agent.
As previously posted, Horse 1 had no current vaccination history available.
This animal showed low variable IgG and IgM titers for all agents, with the
highest titer (1024) for CE IgG. This suggested that this animal may have
been exposed to a California Group bunyavirus.
The Horse 2 was vaccinated in April of 2000. This animal had an IgG titer
of 256 for CE, IgM titer of <64 for CE and titers of less than or equal to
64 for all other agents. This suggested that this animal may also have been
exposed to a California Group bunyavirus.
Because we had not recently seen CE activity in Louisiana equines and
because both animals were from the same part of the state and died within
such a short period of time, we asked the Centers for Disease Control,
Arbovirus Diseases Branch to test these specimens. The CDC performed serum
dilution plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) that confirmed both
animals showed evidence of exposure to California group bunyavirus.
During 1999-2000, we tested 1 090 equine sera collected throughout the
state. During this time frame, 89 cases of equine EEE infection as well as
2 human and >200 Emus EEE cases were confirmed by this laboratory. These 2
horses were the first to show any evidence of exposure to CE. It is not
possible to determine whether this indicates a past exposure or a current
infection based solely on, the testing conducted on these single acute
serum specimens. Due to the limited amount of specimen available,
additional testing is not possible.
The importance of these findings is that this is the first recent
indication of possible CE transmission occurring in Louisiana. We will
continue to look for evidence of CE activity and to work with the local
veterinary, medical and mosquito control professionals to access this
situation.
