In the last year [2017], more people in Rhineland-Palatinate [Germany], became infected with hantavirus than in 2016.

A total of 49 cases were notified (in 2017), as reported by the LUA Koblenz on [Thu 5 Jul 2018]. In 2016, there were 7 cases.

One source of infection is mouse droppings. The virus usually causes illnesses with flu-like symptoms: high fever, headaches, and abdominal and back pain. Additionally, infection can lead to kidney failure.

The virus is excreted in the saliva, urine, and faeces of small infected mammals, especially the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_). The virus can enter the human airways with dust. The disease mostly affects people working in the forest or walking in woodlands.

[Although the above report is for cases that occurred last year (2017), it would not be surprising for new cases to occur this year (2018). Hantavirus infections occur in various parts of Germany. Last year (2017), Baden-Wurttemberg state in southwest Germany reported an increase in hantavirus cases, especially since March 2017. A total of 441 hantavirus cases were reported up to June 2017, which was higher than in the previous 4 years. Although not stated in the above report, the hantavirus most likely involved in these cases is Puumala virus, with the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) as the rodent reservoir host. Puumala virus is endemic to southwestern and western Germany. The Puumala virus (PUUV) outbreaks in the past have been related to increases in the bank vole population. The vole population increases are due in large part to increases in beech tree mast (tree seeds) abundance, with PUUV outbreaks occurring a year after peak mast production. The above report does not indicate how relatively abundant bank vole populations are currently. Bank voles are widely distributed across Europe.
