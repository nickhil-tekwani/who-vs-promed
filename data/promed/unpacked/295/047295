A Nigerian medical doctor who contracted Lassa fever in Nigeria is being
treated at the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria, the Gauteng Department of
Health said on Wednesday [22 Apr 2009].

"The patient is under continuous observation and is receiving treatment in
the hospital's special isolation ward," said the departmental spokesperson,
Vusi Sibiya. According to the department's chief of operations, Dr Abdul
Rahman, the patient was flown from Abuja in Nigeria on Monday [20 APr
2009], for treatment of suspected malaria or septicaemia. "Following tests
Lassa fever was diagnosed and he was immediately admitted to the isolation
ward at Unitas hospital," said Dr Rahman.

Lassa fever is endemic in West African countries such as Nigeria, Guinea,
Liberia, and Sierra Leone but is very rarely found in South Africa. It is a
viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms that are similar to Marburg disease
and malaria. Its initial symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, sore
throat, muscle pains, and a general feeling of weakness. "Severe cases may
progress to show facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity and bleeding
from the mouth and nose," explained Dr Rahman.

Humans can contract Lassa fever from contact with infected animals. The
best known carrier of the Lassa virus is a rodent known as the multimammate
rat (_Mastomys_ species) that is commonly found in West African countries.
The rats shed the virus in their bodily excretions. The virus can also be
spread through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other
bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) there is no
epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Their
statistics show that up to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever are diagnosed in
West Africa every year and the fatality rate among hospitalised patients
varies between one per cent and 15 per cent.

In addition, Dr Rahman said, the pilot, 2 co-pilots and 2 paramedics who
accompanied the doctor on the flight from Nigeria had been placed under
quarantine as a precautionary measure. Dr Rahman explained that special
isolation precautions had been taken at Unitas hospital to contain the
disease and to protect health workers in the isolation wards who might be
most at risk. "These include the wearing of special protective clothing
such as masks, gloves and gowns and the sterilisation of equipment," he said.

Dr Rahman said early diagnosis of the patient was proof of the quality
laboratory services in the country which were able to make an early and
correct diagnosis of the disease. "It is also testimony to the excellent
relationship between the public health and private sectors, the latter
being responsible for transporting the patient," he added.

[The reports of deaths resulting from the epidemics of meningitis and Lassa
fever in Nigeria have been alarming. The campaign against these epidemics
must be fought collectively to achieve the desired result of overcoming
health hazards. With government bearing its own responsibilities,
communities and individuals must be alive to their own roles, which include
good personal hygiene, proper covering of foods, preventing access of rats
to the home, and discarding food eaten by rats. - Mod.FE

One can only speculate that the Nigerian doctor was treating one of the
Lassa fever patients referenced below as some of those outbreaks have
occurred in the Federal Capital Territories surrounding Abuja, the origin
of the plane flight. The ongoing nature of the Lassa fever outbreaks
provides a unique opportunity for teams of health professions to work
together to understand the epidemiology of Lassa fever better when
outbreaks occur. It would be interesting to use the results of human
serological studies to direct trapping of rodents. Such information would
require close cooperation of both public health and animal health but could
yield valuable results. The fact that cases originating in Nigeria have
occurred in both the UK and South Africa indicates again that outbreaks
like Lassa are indeed everyone's problem and cooperative efforts are
needed. - Mod.PC
