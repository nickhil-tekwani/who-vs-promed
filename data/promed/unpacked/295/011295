Comment on: "Mumps - Spain: (CA) Girona 20120331.1086759"
-----------------------------------
Spain's experience with vaccine-preventable disease is a paradigm for the success of immunization. Reports of measles, mumps and rubella in this country declined dramatically following the introduction of routine MMR in 1981 [1,2] -- see graph [3]: http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/MMR-Spain.png.

Mumps rates for the entire region have remained low since 2000, see graph: http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mumps-Iberia.png.

Seroprevalence surveys:

91.1 percent in Catalonia (1996)
92.1 percent of persons ages 17 to 36 in Barcelona (1992 to 1993)

Notable outbreaks:

1987 -- An outbreak (104 cases) was reported among school children in Castellon.
1992 (publication year) -- An outbreak (52 cases) was reported in Zaragoza.
1993 to 1994 -- Outbreaks (216 cases total in 19 outbreaks) were reported in Toledo.
1995 to 1996 -- An outbreak was reported in Leon.
1997 -- An outbreak (283 cases) was reported in an urban area in Andalucia.
1999 to 2000 -- An outbreak (33 cases) was reported at a school in Huesca.
2000 -- An outbreak (35 cases) was reported among 3-to-4 year old children in San Sebastian.
2005 -- An outbreak (145 cases) was reported in Almeria.
2006 -- An outbreak (63 cases) was reported at a school in Bizkaia.
2006 to 2007 -- An outbreak (1397 cases) was associated with a festival in the Navarre region.
