RESURGENT TB -- NEW WHO CAMPAIGN
================================

On March 24 the World Health Organization, collaborating with the
International Union Against Tuberculosis and other groups, will launch a
global campaign against the diseases, which kills almost 3 million people
each year. While 95% of the victims lived in developing countries, TB is
rapidly retracing its historial steps to countries with advanced economies
where once it was defeated by antibiotics, and has propagated
multidrug-resistant strains.
On the 21st in London, WHO Director General Takajima will hold a press
conference to release a status report on the epidemic. Since Robert Koch's
discovery of the bacillus that causes TB, about 200 million more people have
died, notwithstanding the success of antibiotic treatment.
