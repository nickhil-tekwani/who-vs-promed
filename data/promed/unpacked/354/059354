Foot & mouth disease: Global status 20020217.3574

From: Jee Yong Park <parkjy@nvrqs.go.kr>

I would just like to correct a fact concerning Foot & mouth disease:
Global status posted on 17 Feb 2002.
The whole of Republic of Korea was recognized on 19 Sep 2001 as having
recovered the previous FMD-free status without vaccination. (The
recognition of FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practiced for
the Island of Cheju had already been received on 31 May 2001).
I believe the FMD-free country (and zones) list you have posted is
partly from the 31 May 2001 posting, and there have been a few changes
to that list since then.
Since a large number of people do get their information from ProMED, I
thought this might need clarifying.
Keep up the good work!

[The OIE web page we referenced:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_fmd.htm>
is indeed the 31 May 2001 Declaration (simplified version), but it is
on a page that was updated on 15 Feb 2002, and the ROK is not shown
there in the list of Member Countries recognised as "FMD free
countries where vaccination is not practised", only the Island of
Cheju as "an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised." We
thank Jee Yong Park for the clarification. - Mod.JW
