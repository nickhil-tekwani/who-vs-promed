News of the response
Armed attack at clinics of the Catholic University of Graben (UCG)
--------------------------------------
- On Fri 19 Apr 2019, a Cameroonian epidemiologist deployed by the World Health Organization, Dr. Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, died of his injuries during an attack at clinics at the Catholic University of Graben, Butembo. Dr. Richard was the coordinator of the response in the Vutsundo health area. He was chairing a meeting with his team when 3 armed men burst into the room and opened fire on the team members. A local doctor and a driver were also injured in the attack. The attackers also burned vehicles and the yard built at the entrance of the hospital.

- The official WHO Communique [Fri 19 Apr 2019]. WHO Ebola responder killed in attack on the Butembo hospital: https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-04-2019-who-ebola-responder-killed-in-attack-on-the-butembo-hospital:

"Today, Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, an epidemiologist deployed by WHO in the response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was killed in an attack on Butembo University Hospital. Two other persons were injured in the attack but are believed to be in a stable condition.

"'I and all of WHO are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and brother Dr. Mouzoko. He put himself on the frontline to save lives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,' said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'We grieve with his family and friends at this very difficult time.'

"'This is a tragic reminder of the risks health workers take every day to protect the lives and health of others. We are outraged by this attack: health workers and health facilities must never be targets.'

"The attack took place during a coordination meeting being held at the hospital at that time.

"'We are assessing the security situation to ensure the safety of all patients, health workers and Ebola responders,' said Dr. Tedros. 'At the same time, we remain committed to continue supporting the Ministry of Health of DRC to end this outbreak as quickly as possible.'"

Tweet from Dr. Tedros: "Today we lost one of our very own: Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, an epidemiologist deployed in the #Ebola response in #DRC, during a hospital attack in Butembo.

[Our sincerest sympathy goes out to the family of Dr. Richard Mouzoko Kiboung. This is a very sad day particularly for the family, but also for WHO and the world, having lost a such a dedicated doctor. It is heartbreaking that workers are putting their lives on the line to help those in need of medical care, only to be killed for their effort. Such cold-blooded senseless acts must be stopped. - Mod.LK

2. AP reports that the attack was motivated by the belief that non-Congolese staff working for the #Ebola response brought the disease to the region. If so, that's a different motive than the earlier attacks at Katwa & Butembo.
3. The firebombing of the Katwa & Butembo #Ebola treatment centers in late February, early March seemed to be driven by economics -- people who were unhappy they weren't benefiting from the evidently well-financed response.

News of the response
Community leaders get more involved in raising awareness
---------------------------------------------
The customary chiefs of the Beni-Lubero territory, meeting within the National Alliance of Traditional Chiefs of North Kivu in Butembo, sent a message of sensitization to the population and recommendations to the teams of the response to put an end to the Ebola outbreak at home. Taking into account the seriousness of the situation, they asked the population to dissociate themselves from anyone who minimizes the Ebola disease, and to consider that Ebola is a disease that really exists. In addition, he asked the mothers and girls, who traditionally take care of the hygiene and care of the sick at home, not to throw stones at the teams of the response.

Two national deputies from Ituri province, Kambale Ezechiel Barnabas and Kakule Mupopolo Floribert, carried out a 3-day mission to Biakato, in Mandima health zone, to raise awareness and ask them to collaborate with the teams of the response. This locality has experienced a significant increase in confirmed Ebola cases in recent weeks because of the difficulty of the response teams in accessing the sick as a result of community reluctance. They closed their trip with a rally on Sun 14 Apr 2019 in the presence of the administrator of the territory during which they recalled the preventive measures to respect to stop the spread of the epidemic.

In Lubero, the Territorial Youth Council has launched a youth engagement to end the Ebola outbreak at home. Council members have put in place measures to support the efforts of the response teams, particularly community-based surveillance and hygiene compliance in their communities.

Glimmer of hope in Katwa and Butembo
----------------------------------
A panic has blown over the Katwa and Butembo areas because of the accelerated spread of the epidemic in the community following targeted attacks against the 2 ETCs in the city. Rising insecurity and violence against the response teams had prevented them from carrying out essential interventions to break the chain of transmission and slow the spread of the epidemic in the community, especially contact tracing, vaccination and decontamination of households.

However, Dr. Jean-Paul Mundama, president of the prevention committee in Butembo, is optimistic and notes with satisfaction the lifting of resistance in the most resistant homes of the city, such as Mutsanga and Wayene. Thus, the teams begin to discover the hidden patients in the community. If all public health interventions around confirmed cases and deaths are unhindered, the chain of transmission will be broken down, the number of cases will begin to decline and the epidemic can be controlled. Although the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in recent weeks may be worrying, the epidemic is actually concentrated in some well-defined health areas, and there has been no geographical spread of the virus. The epidemic has just resumed in areas that had already been affected because of patient mobility. The main outbreaks of the epidemic remain concentrated in the health zones of Katwa, Vuhovi, Masereka and Mandima.

Since the beginning of the vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 101 589 people have been vaccinated.

[2] Summary
- Wed 17 Apr 2019. Ebola infects 17 more in DRC outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/ebola-infects-17-more-drc-outbreak
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [17 Apr 2019] reported another double-digit rise in Ebola cases, as local leaders such as traditional chiefs and provincial representatives stepped up their efforts to convince community members to support the response efforts to end the outbreak.

All 17 of the newly confirmed cases are from the current epicenters -- Katwa (11), Butembo (4), and Mandima (2) -- according to the health ministry's daily report. The flurry of new cases moved the outbreak total to 1290, which includes 1224 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Also, health officials are still investigating 251 suspected cases.

In addition, 12 more people died from Ebola, 10 of them in their communities in Katwa, Mandima, and Butembo, exposing family members and neighbors to the virus. Two deaths occurred at Butembo's ETC. Outbreak deaths have now reached 833.

The surge of cases in the DRC over the past few weeks has triggered panic in Katwa and Butembo, the health ministry said. However, it added that officials see some glimmers of optimism, such as an easing of resistance in some of the most inaccessible areas of the city, such as Mutsanga and Wayene.

"Although the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in recent weeks may be worrying, the epidemic is actually concentrated in some well-defined health areas and there has been no geographical spread of the virus," it said, noting the main hot spots are Katwa, Vuhovi, Masereka, and Mandima. "The epidemic has just resumed in areas that had already been affected because of patient mobility."

In other response developments, the health ministry said customary chiefs from the Beni-Lubero area who took part in a national traditional chiefs meeting in Butembo sent a message to their local people and recommendations to outbreak responders, which focuses on stopping Ebola at the homefront. The youth council in Lubero has also launched a campaign to enlist young people in helping stem the spread of Ebola in people's homes.

They asked community members to distance themselves from anyone who minimizes Ebola and to accept that the disease is real. They also asked mothers and girls -- who typically care for sick people at home -- to avoid throwing rocks at the response teams.

Also, 2 national deputies from Ituri province went on a 3-day mission to Biakato in Mandima health zone, a town that has experienced an increase in confirmed Ebola cases in recent weeks, because response teams haven't been able to access sick patients due to community reluctance. They wrapped up their visit with a rally on 14 Apr 2019, and they reiterated prevention steps to stop the spread of the virus.

Sick doctor with more than 500 contacts
-------------------------------------
In its weekly situation report yesterday [16 Apr 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week's continuing rise in activity totaled 110 new cases, but it noted that transmission is still confined, mostly to Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, and Vuhovi.

Four more health workers are among the new cases, all from community health centers in the hot spots. Since the outbreak began, the virus sickened 89 health workers, 32 of them fatally. One of the patients is a medical doctor from Beni, who generated 534 contacts.

In other developments, outbreak partners including the International Organization for Migration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a workshop to develop a plan to reinforce screening at the airport in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/ebola-outbreak-grows-12-cdc-issues-new-hcw-advice
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today the health ministry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed another 12 cases of Ebola in an ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The cases raise the outbreak total to 1302.

Of the 1302 cases, 1236 are confirmed and 66 are probable. The ministry said the death toll has now reached 843. A total of 325 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Of the 12 new cases, 5 are in Katwa, 3 in Mandima, 2 in Vuhovi, and 1 each in Kalunguta and Beni. Ten deaths have also been recorded, including 7 community deaths. Community deaths raise the risk of transmission to case contacts, including funeral attendees.

The DRC also said the ring vaccination campaign with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues, with 102 505 people vaccinated since 8 Aug 2018, including 27 022 in Katwa, 22 289 in Beni, and 12 468 in Butembo.

In its 4th rapid risk assessment released during this outbreak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said there is still ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in both urban and rural settings.

"More EVD cases are expected in the coming weeks and a wider geographical extension is still possible given the prolonged humanitarian crisis in the region," the ECDC said, noting that since mid-March [2019], weekly case counts have increased to 52 to 73 cases per week.

Despite the ongoing transmission, the ECDC said the risk of spread to the European Union remains low.

Travel advice for US health workers
-----------------------------
Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations for all US-based healthcare and emergency response workers traveling to and from the outbreak region, including a pre-departure assessment for symptoms of the virus for any workers traveling from Ebola outbreak areas to the USA.

The CDC suggests that all people traveling to an Ebola outbreak zone understand the importance of self-monitoring for fever and symptoms 21 days after leaving the outbreak region.

Of note, the CDC said workers may opt to receive the Ebola vaccine as part of ongoing studies based at the National Institutes of Health. Employees should also be up-to-date on all travel vaccinations, and have access to personal protective equipment during their stay.

- Thu 18 Apr 2019. WHO Ebola DON 18 Apr 2019
[WHO, Disease outbreak news, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/18-april-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to increase this week; however, it remained confined to a limited geographical area within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This recent trend is likely attributable, in part, to past and ongoing security issues, unrest amongst certain local populations, and lingering community mistrust towards outbreak response teams. Improved case detection and response activities have been observed in previously inaccessible hotspots.

In 2019, 55 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 39% of the 143 health areas affected to date (see Table 1 and Fig. 2 at the source URL). During this period, a total of 249 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (124), Vuhovi (40), Mandima (28), Butembo (24), Beni (16), Oicha (6), Mabalako (5), Kalunguta (2), Masereka (2), Musienene (1), and Lubero (1).

As of 16 Apr 2019, a total of 1290 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 833 died (case fatality rate, 65%). Of the 1290 cases with reported age and sex, 56% (725) were female, and 28% (361) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89 (7% of total cases), including 32 deaths. To date, a total of 379 EVD patients who received care at Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

On 12 Apr 2019, the International Health Regulation (IHR) Emergency Committee convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss whether the EVD outbreak posed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and offer response recommendations. While the Emergency Committee and the WHO Director-General reiterated their serious concern at the recent rise in the number of cases and the high risk of regional spread, upon consultation with various technical experts and further review of available epidemiological data, it was concluded that the current outbreak did not constitute a PHEIC. For the complete WHO statement concerning the 12 Apr IHR Emergency Committee meeting, please see here (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-04-2019-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-for-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-on-12th-april-2019).

The ongoing vaccination efforts have produced some promising results this past week. On 12 Apr 2019, WHO and Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) published a preliminary analysis concerning the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine currently utilised in this outbreak (please see full report here: https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-ring-vaccination-results-12-april-2019.pdf?ua=1). The data suggested the vaccine demonstrated notable efficacy in preventing Ebola infections in vaccinated individuals compared with those who are unvaccinated. Between 2-4 Apr 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) convened a meeting to review the epidemiological data and offer further recommendations to the ongoing vaccination efforts. They urged the further expansion of those eligible for vaccination to include children older than 6 months and lactating women -- 2 populations observed to have especially high attack rates and high case fatality rates (please see https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2019/april/SAGE_April_2019_meeting_summary.pdf?ua=1&ua=1 for further highlights from SAGE meeting).

In light of the findings, WHO and partners are evolving the existing vaccination strategy on the ground. Along with intensifying contact tracing of cases and vaccinating their known immediate contacts, a greater emphasis is being placed on following up contacts of contacts and ensuring these at-risk individuals are adequately vaccinated against Ebola. Various approaches are being used at this time to vaccinate people at-risk, including:

- Site-by-site vaccinations at the places of residence and other locations previously visited by cases
- Simultaneous vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers (HCW/FLW) and others at increased risk working in healthcare facilities
- Pop-up vaccination, where those at risk are invited to an agreed-upon location, outside their place of residence
- Targeted geographic vaccination of villages if contacts, and contacts of contacts, cannot be clearly ascertained due to security constraints, but are invited to a previously agreed-upon site to be vaccinated.

Through these strategies, 23 operational vaccination teams have effectively closed previously observed gaps in the vaccination rings surrounding reported cases; rings are currently pending for 10 of the 257 cases confirmed during the period between 28 Mar and 6 Apr 2019. As of 16 Apr 2019, a total of 102 501 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of whom 29 720 were HCWs/FLWs. Outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, vaccination of HCWs/FLWs commenced in neighbouring Rwanda on 16 Apr 2019, with 176 HCWs/FLWs already vaccinated. It is expected that the vaccination strategy will be an effective means to slowing the spread of EVD.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts have also yielded some notable progress this past week. A revised IPC strategy with an operational work plan for February to May 2019 period has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The strategy and work plan are intended to guide the national coordination activities of the Ebola response's IPC Task Force, and the implementation of activities by the IPC commissions and partners at the subnational level. To support this operational shift, Risk Communication and Community Engagement research initiatives are being developed to better understand transmission pathways that can be addressed by the IPC coordination activities. Additional support will be provided by collecting feedback through community dialogue on how IPC can be better implemented at the community level.

While the EVD outbreak remains ongoing and the rise in number of cases is likely to continue in the following weeks, it should be noted that substantial progress has been made to adapt response strategies to the ever-evolving situation. Despite the multitude of challenges posed by having to mount a robust outbreak response in the demanding circumstances in which this EVD outbreak is currently taking place, WHO and partners are continuing to intensify all facets of the response efforts to curtail the further spread of EVD in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

- Wed 17 Apr 2019. ECDC rapid risk assessment: Ebola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri, DRC - 4th update
[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, edited]
https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/rapid-risk-assessment-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-north-kivu-and-ituri-0

This is the 4th update of a rapid risk assessment originally produced on 9 Aug 2018. This rapid risk assessment addresses the public health risk associated with the current Ebola virus outbreak in the DRC and its implications for EU/EEA citizens. It was triggered by an increase of EVD transmission in the affected areas over recent weeks, the persistent occurrence of new cases among contacts unknown at the time of EVD diagnosis, the occurrence of a substantial number of cases outside of the ring vaccination contacts and current challenges for the prevention and control of EVD.

Executive summary
As of 10 Apr 2019, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 1206 Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, including 1140 confirmed and 66 probable cases, resulting in an overall case fatality of 63%. Eighty-seven healthcare workers are among the confirmed cases, including 31 deaths.

Since mid-March [2019], the weekly number of cases has increased to more than 50, ranging from 52 to 73 cases. Viral circulation in the community is persistent, but the epidemiological situation varies among affected health zones. While the majority of the cases have been reported in urban settings, there are cases in rural health zones surrounding urban centres, suggesting transmission ongoing in these areas.

Despite the impressive mobilisation of EVD response actors, significant challenges remain in this complex setting, marked by a long-term humanitarian crisis and an unstable security context. Community resistance to Ebola response activities, suboptimal infection prevention and control practices in primary healthcare, incomplete contact tracing and follow-up, continuing nosocomial infections, delays in detection and isolation of new cases and community deaths leading to potential exposure of relatives to EVD continue to be among the main obstacles.

More EVD cases are expected in the coming weeks and a wider geographical extension is still possible given the prolonged humanitarian crisis in the region. Important cross-border population flows to and from neighbouring provinces and countries and adverse impact of security incidents and persistence of community reluctance and resistance hinders the implementation of EVD prevention and control measures.

The probability that EU/EEA citizens living or travelling in EVD-affected areas of the DRC will be exposed to the virus is low provided they adhere to recommended precautionary measures.

The most likely route of importation of the virus into the EU/EEA is through infected travellers from affected areas. Since the volume of travellers is small, there are no international airports in the affected areas with direct flights to EU/EEA Member States and exit screening is in place at Goma airport, the risk of EVD-infected people arriving in the EU/EEA is very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at local level.

Excerpts:
- DRC reaches 100 000 people vaccinated against Ebola in North Kivu and Ituri.
- The significant increase in new cases confirmed in recent weeks, particularly in active households in Butembo and Katwa, is partly explained by the temporary cessation of vaccination activities in March [2019] following the rise in violence against the teams of the response. Because of the problems of violence and safety, 45 vaccination rings could not be opened around confirmed cases.

[Devdiscourse, abridged, edited]
https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/international/482868-helping-hand-ebola-survivors-volunteers-to-clampdown-outbreak-in-congo

Wearing a disposable gown and gloves for protection, [JM] cradles a 2-year-old Ebola patient and offers the listless toddler teaspoons of brown soup. Most healthcare workers need a surgical mask, goggles, hooded coveralls, an apron, rubber boots and 2 pairs of gloves to avoid catching the virus that typically kills around half those it infects.

The outfits are hot, and in the stifling tropical temperatures of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, this limits the time they can spend with patients fighting for their lives in isolation units. But [JM] has antibodies in her system after she won her own battle against Ebola last year [2018], and she now has immunity.

The 33-year-old mother of 6 can spend entire days with patients at a treatment centre in the North Kivu town of Beni, offering a comforting presence among a crowd of faceless figures with names written on their suits in marker pen. [JM] is one of the dozens of survivors who are providing care -- and much-needed human contact -- to some of the littlest victims of the second-worst Ebola epidemic on record.

Of the more than 1150 confirmed and probable Ebola cases, 29% are children, according to figures from the World Health Organization. More than 800 people, including at least 248 under the age of 18, have died since the outbreak began in August [2018]. The outbreak is surpassed only by one in West Africa in 2013-2016, which is believed to have killed more than 11 000 people.

[JM] lost 10 relatives to the virus; 4 of those infected in her family survived. "It was as if Ebola had chosen my family," she said. She was admitted to the same treatment centre where she now works in September [2018] and stayed there for 21 days, battling horrific symptoms.

She is one of at least 23 former patients employed at the centre in Beni, which is run by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA).

Children are especially vulnerable to the virus because their bodies are less able to cope with the extreme fluid loss caused by diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and bleeding, doctors say. More than 2 of every 3 children sickened in this outbreak have died, according to WHO figures. Others were orphaned or left on their own when their parents went into treatment. [CK], age 40 years, had to place a child in care while she was being treated for Ebola in the nearby trading hub of Butembo. She now does shifts at a childcare facility operated by the United Nations children's agency UNICEF, taking turns with other survivors to sleep next to the babies' cots on mosquito-netted beds.

"We can't be caring for children all of the time, because you can only wear PPE (personal protective equipment) for one hour at a time. And it would scare ... children," said Trish Newport, the Ebola representative for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) in Congo's eastern city of Goma. "So to have survivors who can wear light protection and be with the children and bond with them, it's huge for us. We couldn't manage without them."

She believes that survivors benefit from the experience as well. "There's a lot of stigmatisation for them in the community," she said. But at the treatment centres, they are treated like heroes. Survivors also serve as educators and advocates for the centres in the community.

This is Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the 1st in the densely forested volcanic hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. Many are afraid to seek help from experts. Some believe the disease is part of a plot by foreign aid agencies to make money, others that Congo's former government was trying to kill off opposition supporters ahead of a December election.
