NAKURU, Kenya, 16 Jul 2001 (ENS) - Veterinary pathologists in Kenya have
identified heavy metals as the leading cause of massive deaths of flamingos
in 2 Rift Valley Lakes of Kenya, and warned that the scenic pink birds of
Lakes Nakuru and Bogoria remain threatened unless the lakes are cleared of
pollutants.
"The presence of heavy metals in the birds' tissue is alarming," cautioned
Dr. Gideon Motelin, a veterinary pathologist at Egerton University who last
month conducted a 3-day fact finding mission in the 2 lakes. Motelin is the
leading Kenyan researcher on flamingos. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)
acknowledges that Lake Bogoria is the "worst affected" but gave no data on
the number of birds that have died. Journalists have counted hundreds of
bird carcasses littering the shores of both lakes. But the wildlife agency
played down pollution as the cause of deaths. "If it's a question of
pollution, why is it affecting both Lakes? We could understand if it was
only in Nakuru but Bogoria is far away from industries," said Daniel Njaga,
a communications officer at KWS.
A preliminary report released by Dr. Motelin and Dr. Ramesh Thampy, a World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Rift Valley lakes specialist, says, "Detectable
levels of lead, zinc, mercury, copper, and arsenic have been found in the
birds' tissues and this threatens the very existence of the flamingos."
A group of scientists have been camping on the shores of Lake Bogoria
assessing the situation and brainstorming on how to conserve it as a
wetland site. But it is the continuing death of flamingos that kept the
entire team on its toes.
"We are concerned because this could be a catastrophe," said Motelin.
[While the concentration of individual elements may not be high enough to
cause death, he explained that "combinations of poisons could cause death,
as they affect different sensitive organs of the body. Some of the birds
had lesions in the spleen and others in the kidney. The lesions suggest
toxicosis as the cause of death and incapacity. If we are to arrest the
situation, pollution has to cease."
Experts warn that the level of pollution in Kenyan lakes is growing due to
collapse of sewage works in many urban centers and growth of industries,
the effluent of which flows into the lakes. The rise of horticultural farms
along most of the Rift Valley lakes have also caused fertilizers to run off
into the lakes.
Dr. Motelin said cadmium, a metal found in the birds' tissues, is
"dangerous as it replaces calcium in the bones, making them brittle. This
may be one of the reasons why birds are finding it difficult to coordinate
in the water. The birds have become weak and cannot manage to migrate from
different lakes without succumbing."
Flamingos can fly up to 300 kilometers in a day, and researchers also think
the deaths could be a result of "flying stress." Dr. Thampy says that the
clinical signs [found with the current birds resemble [those seen in
episodes in 1993, 1995 and 2000 when similar deaths occurred. He said the
current deaths began mid-May this year.
Lake Nakuru is 4 kilometers from the population center of Nakuru. "The
deaths subsided in early June only to resurface later," said Dr. Thampy.
"Though the death records are not as high as in the previous years,
stakeholders in the sector have to come up with a solution." The
preliminary report indicates that migration and breeding, plus
organochlorines are other cause of deaths. Although Kenya Wildlife Society
dismisses the allegation of pollution as the cause of death, Dr. Motelin
believes the birds ingested toxic chemicals at the Nakuru Lake.
Organochlorines find their way into Lake Nakuru through water systems from
nearby farms that use large quantities of fertilizers, pesticides, and
agrochemicals.
Compared to Lake Nakuru, the 290-square-kilometer Lake Bogoria is in a
comparatively clean condition and is away from industrial pollutants. The
flamingos fly the 60 kilometer distance between the 2 lakes regularly.
Organochlorines discovered in flamingo body tissues can enter Lake Bogoria
through River Sandai, which passes through farmlands in Laikipia district.
The toxic chemical DDT, which is banned in Kenya, is reportedly used in
Ethiopia.
"It is true that flamingos have a vast home range. Some of their feeding
sites in Ethiopia are close to factories, which could be discharging
harmful effluent," said Montelin.

[Lake Bororia's appearing 'clean' and being clean are very different
states. In general, control of agricultural chemicals in Africa is minimal
or less. Lake Nakuru is a very popular tourist site and if the flamingos
go, so will the income from tourists. - Mod.MHJ
