The Tunisian counter-terrorism agencies have revealed in their preliminary investigations that the envelopes delivered to politicians, journalists, and syndicate members contained the anthrax toxin. This was the 1st terrorist plot of its kind in the country, they added.

They continued, 20 public figures were targeted in this terrorist plot, including 10 prominent politicians, 7 journalists, and activists in syndicates and human rights.

Moreover, they said that the terrorist groups have shifted their tactics after security measures against them have limited their activity. For years, they have relied on armed attacks, but they are now forced to resort to poisoning their victims, said the security agencies.

President of the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT) Noureddine Taboubi and assistant secretaries Bu Ali Mubaraki, and Sami al-Tahiri were among the targets, revealed "high-ranking" Tunisian media sources.

Sufian al-Sulaiti, a spokesman for the counter-terrorism apparatus, affirmed that the agencies will listen in the upcoming period to the testimonies of 15 of the targeted figures. Furthermore, several terrorist group experts said that toxic substance letters is a method that has been adopted by several terrorist organizations in the past. They urged the need to amend strategies and derive lessons from foreign experiences, such as attacks in Afghanistan, in order to confront terrorism in Tunisia.

[Tunisia is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, with its capital Tunis facing the Mediterranean. For a description of the country and map, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis.

Exactly what has been found in these 20 letters is not clear. The title of the news report claims "anthrax", which is the disease, and the counter-terrorism agency claims they contained anthrax toxin. But there are various toxins which necessitate special preparation while anthrax spores are easier to culture. Normally these threat letters contain a harmless white powder in the hope of generating fear and stress. But this represents a bioterrorism attack on Tunisia, whatever the severity turns out to be.

Since 2005 there has just been one case of anthrax in Tunisia in a sheep in Tunis in September 2007. Nothing since. The country is essentially free of anthrax. One case, no deaths, suggests just a single positive diagnostic sample -- maybe a swab or blood sample -- with no other information other than it came from a "sick" sheep. So there would not have been any cultures on hand to use. We must await clarification. - Mod.MHJ
