Tularemia in Berlin -- 2 independent cases in travelers returning
from Central Anatolia, Turkey, February 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Schubert A, Splettstoesser W, Batzing-Feigenbaum J, et al]

Tularemia, though rare, has recently been increasingly reported in
Germany. Most cases are indigenous infections. This report describes 2
epidemiologically independent infections with _Francisella tularensis_
subspecies _holarctica_ detected in Berlin in February 2011 that were
acquired in central Anatolia, Turkey. In Turkey, there have been
repeated tularemia outbreaks since 2000 and the disease should
therefore be considered as a differential diagnosis in travellers
returning from that country.

Case description and clinical diagnosis
---------------------------------------
In March 2011, 2 travelers returning from Turkey, both in their 20s,
were diagnosed with tularemia in Berlin, Germany. Both had stayed
independently in Turkey between the end of 2010 and early 2011 to
visit their respective families in Yozgat, central Anatolia, 218 km
[136 mi] east of Ankara in the Ak mountains. The population of Yozgat
in 2008 was 71 768, the province counted 492 127 inhabitants (1).

Both patients had similar general symptoms including fever,
pharyngitis, otitis and cervical lymphadenopathy, but showed different
locations of the ulcerations characteristic of tularemia. Both
infections were characterized by slow and subacute clinical
progression.

Patient 1 stayed in Turkey between 25 Jul 2010 and 29 Jan 2011. Onset
of symptoms was on 15 Dec 2010. Patient 2 had been in Turkey from 24
Dec 2010 to 8 Jan 2011 and fell ill on 10 Jan 2011. The patients were
diagnosed in mid-February 2011, after their return to Berlin. Patient
1 was diagnosed with oropharyngeal tularemia, patient 2 with the
ulceroglandular form. The latter form is the most common expression of
tularemia. Typical symptoms are ulcerations at the inoculation site
linked with regional, often purulent inflammation of the [draining]
lymph nodes. The exact description of primary clinical symptoms is
very important to elucidate the transmission routes and further
epidemiological links (2,3). Further interviews with patient 2
revealed additional epidemiological information: the patient and one
of his siblings both fell ill on 10 Jan 2011, and a further sibling 2
days later. However, these patients remained in Turkey.

Laboratory confirmation
-----------------------
The detection of the pathogen by bacterial culture is difficult,
special media are needed and growth is generally slow. More sensitive
laboratory methods like PCR are only available in a small number of
specialized laboratories (2,3). Laboratory confirmation for the cases
was available on 4 Mar 2011. The German national reference laboratory
for tularemia in Munich could detect _F. tularensis_ subspecies
_holarctica_ (Jellison type B) via PCR in both cases. Specific DNA
sequences were detected in the purulent puncture material of affected
lymph nodes.

A serological diagnosis done previously in the hospital in Berlin for
patient 2 had shown IgG and IgM antibodies against _F. tularensis_
lipopolysacharides. The infection in patient 1 was not proved
serologically in the hospital, but was confirmed through specific
antibodies in the national reference laboratory.

Public health implications
--------------------------
After the diagnoses were confirmed, information was immediately
reported according to the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR)
to the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). At that time, no recent data were
accessible about the tularemia situation in Turkey. Data about
tularemia infections related to recent travel to Turkey or to
neighboring countries were not found.

Turkish citizens are one of the larger populations with migration
background in Germany. At the end of 2010 nearly 2 per cent of the
German population were Turkish (1 629 480 inhabitants) (4). In Berlin
at the end of 2009, 3 per cent of the population were Turkish citizens
(108 000 inhabitants) (5). In addition, an unknown number of German
citizens of Turkish origin still have intensive contacts with their
families in Turkey and frequently travel there. Therefore, the health
authorities in all 16 German federal states were informed on 8 Mar
2011 during the weekly epidemiological telephone conference (EpiLag),
since more imported infections in international travellers could not
be excluded.

To get further data about the situation in Turkey, but also to alert
other countries, the RKI informed the Turkish IHR focal point and the
WHO Regional Office for Europe about the infections. Furthermore,
information was sent to the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS)
of the European Union. On the national level the decision was made to
involve the German National Centre for Biological Security at the RKI
because the pathogen _F. tularensis_ is classified as a potential
biological risk agent [category A. - Mod.LL]. Overall, the risk of
further transmission and the threat to public health in Germany was
estimated as low.

Epidemiological considerations
------------------------------
In the past years tularaemia outbreaks in Europe were documented in
Norway (6,7), Sweden (8), Spain (9), and the UN Administered Province
of Kosovo in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999
(10). Parts of Turkey have been strongly affected by the re-emergence
of tularemia and a number of outbreaks have been published since 2000
(11-16). In Germany, tularemia cases are rare, however, increasing
numbers have been reported since 2007. Some travel-associated
tularemia cases have been reported in Germany (10 of 74 cases between
2001 and 2009), but only 1 case dating back to 2003 originated from
Turkey (17,18).

Through information exchange via the national German and Turkish IHR
Focal Points with the General Directorate of Primary Health Care in
the Turkish Ministry of Health, further details were provided about
the current situation in Turkey and possible sources of infection
(personal communication: Dr Tamer Sami Pelitli, 18 Mar 2011). More
than 100 tularemia cases were reported to the national reference
laboratories from central parts of Turkey, especially in the Yozgat
province in 2010. The cases had been confirmed serologically and
through PCR in 2 reference laboratories in Ankara and Bursa, Turkey.
Based on this information the Ministry of Health of Turkey has
implemented an action plan to fight the spread of tularaemia in 2010.
This action plan is focused on the rehabilitation of water systems. As
a promising result the number of reported tularaemia cases decreased
in 2011 compared with the previous years. After being informed by the
German IHR Focal Point about the 2 cases in Berlin, the Turkish
Ministry of Health started active surveillance work in the Yozgat
province, but has not yet detected new transmission risks for
tularemia.

In both cases from Berlin the source of infection could not be
identified conclusively. However, based on the available
epidemiological information, the most probable cause of the 2
infections is consumption of contaminated water during the stay in a
region of Turkey endemic for tularemia. Transmission has often been
associated with decentralized drinking water supply like cisterns and
insufficiently treated surface water (15). The clinical presentation
at least in one of the patients diagnosed in Berlin supports this
suggestion. Oropharyngeal tularemia is presumably related to oral
ingestion of the pathogen.

Clinical considerations
-----------------------
Due to the relatively unspecific general symptoms of tularemia and
the variety of the primary disease patterns (depending on the route of
infection) clinical diagnosis is not easy. Therefore, early suspicion
of tularemia depends on a precise medical history and epidemiological
data regarding in particular travel history, animal contacts,
occupation, and insect bites. The diagnosis should subsequently be
confirmed through sensitive biomolecular methods like PCR with direct
identification in blood, lymph node punctuates or wound swabs, and
specific serological tests, both of which are available in specified
laboratories.

Early diagnosis allows immediate therapy with effective antibiotics
like doxycycline or fluoroquinolones, which can be combined with
aminoglycosides in severe cases. Drugs used empirically in many cases
of lymphadenitis of uncertain origin are cephalosporins,
amoxicillin/clavulanate, and macrolides which, however, are not
effective against tularemia. Sometimes even surgical interventions to
eliminate a suspected tumour are performed during infection with _F.
tularensis_. In these cases, tularaemia is frequently diagnosed only
retrospectively by histopathological examination and/or by detection
of _F. tularensis_-specific antibodies.

Clinical physicians should currently be aware of possible infections
with _F. tularensis_ in travelers from some regions of Turkey. In case
of clinical signs suggestive of tularemia, effective diagnostic
methods should not be delayed, since diagnostic delay can easily
result in extended suffering of the patient. Besides addressing the
public health aspects of the disease, epidemiology plays a major role
in supporting the early and effective clinical diagnosis and treatment
of tularemia.

[_F. tularensis_ can be divided into 2 clinically significant
subspecies, _F. tularensis tularensis_ (also known as type A or
subspecies nearctica) and _F. tularensis holarctica_ (also known as
type B or subspecies _palaearctica_). Other much less clinically
relevant subspecies are also described.

Type A appears to be the most prominent type in North America,
primarily endemic in rabbits, and was involved in the Martha's
Vineyard (Massachusetts) pneumonic tularemia outbreaks. The infectious
dose to produce infection in humans to cause moderately severe disease
is as few as 50 bacilli and it is lethal to guinea pigs and rabbits.

Type B is found in Europe and Asia but also in North America. The
reservoirs include rodents, voles, muskrats, and beavers. An
infectious dose of 12 000 bacilli is much more likely to produce only
mild, self-limited disease in humans. It is not lethal in rabbits and
guinea pigs.

Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3).
