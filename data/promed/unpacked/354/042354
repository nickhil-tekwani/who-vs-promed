The species commonly found in South America is _D. pacificum_, not _D. latum_.
_T. saginata_ and _T. solium_ eggs are not easy to distinguish, but they
are easy to tell apart from _D. pacificum_ eggs with little training. The
same happens with the proglottids; they are not even alike.
For _D. pacificum_ the intermediate host is saltwater fish. Sea lions and
fur seals host the adult worm. South American sea lions and fur seals live
along the cost of Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay (southern
Brazil?). It will therefore be unlikely to find infected fish out of the
living range of the sea lions/fur seals.
_D. pacificum_ does infect humans, and is not uncommon among Peruvians
eating cebiche (our traditional raw fish dish). One reference is: Tropenmed
Parasitol. 1982 Mar;33(1):5-7.

The recent diphyllobothriasis outbreak reported in ProMED-mail
involving inhabitants of Sao Paolo [Diphyllobothriasis - Brazil (Sao
Paulo) 20050405.0983] emphasizes the risks related to the growing
popularity of raw fish dishes (sushi, carpaccio, etc.).
Diphyllobothriasis is certainly a re-emerging parasitic zoonose. We
recently carried out a European survey and we have been able to identify
dozens of cases in Finland, Sweden and in the French- or Italian-speaking
areas of the subalpine lakes (Dupouy-Camet J. & Peduzzi R. Current
situation of human diphyllobothriasis in Europe. Euro Surveill. 2004;9, 31-35).
Over 30 cases of diphyllobothriasis have been identified on the Swiss
shores of Lake Maggiore since 1990, and 70 cases on the Swiss and French
shores of Lake of Geneva between 1993 and 2002. We have found plerocercoid
larvae in 7 percent of 200 perch fillets from the Lake of Geneva. If the
precise identification of the genus Diphyllobothrium is quite easy for a
keen parasitologist by examining the proglottids, the species
identification is particularly difficult. Therefore we have developed a
molecular analysis on the Diphyllobothrium spp. genus by genotyping
different genes (COI, ITS1, rDNA 18S.). By this method, we are able to
identify proglottids or plerocercoids preserved in alcohol and this could
be helpful for the Brazilian colleagues.

[We are very grateful for the valuable comments. Apparently more
_Diphyllobothrium_ than _D.latum_ can infect humans, and the offer by
Professor Dupoy-Camet and Dr Helena Yera to perform genotyping will further
define the species and provide background data for further epidemiological
mapping of outbreaks or single cases. The information that _D. latum_ is
increasing in Europe had escaped ProMED's parasitic disease moderator, and
we are grateful for this information. - Mod.EP]
