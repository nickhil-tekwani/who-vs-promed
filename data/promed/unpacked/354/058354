[Rabies is endemic in Turkey.

"Rabid dogs are commonly found in Turkey. If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other mammal while in Turkey, there may be limited or no rabies treatment available.

"Consider rabies vaccination before your trip if your activities mean you will be around dogs or wildlife.

"Travelers more likely to encounter rabid animals include campers, adventure travelers, or cave explorers (spelunkers), veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologists, or laboratory workers handling animal specimens, visitors to rural areas.

"Since children are more likely to be bitten or scratched by a dog or other animals, consider rabies vaccination for children traveling to Turkey". https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/turkey. - Mod.CRD
