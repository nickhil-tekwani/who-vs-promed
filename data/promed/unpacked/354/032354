The NYC Health Department today [17 Oct 2018] is reporting 6 individuals with confirmed measles this month in the Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The initial case of measles was acquired by a child on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. The individuals with measles ranged in age from 11 months to 4 years. Of these children, 5 were unvaccinated prior to exposure, including 4 because vaccination was delayed and one who was too young to have received the vaccine. The 6th child had received one dose of the vaccine prior to exposure but was not yet immune. Complications include one child who was hospitalized with pneumonia and another child with an ear infection.

Meanwhile, health officials in Rockland County on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018] said there were 7 confirmed cases, and an additional 8 suspected cases being investigated involving a mix of adults and children. Rockland officials say 5 of the sickened can be traced to recent travel to Israel. Also, 2 additional cases are from exposure that occurred in the county.

Health officials have said anyone at locations in Rockland, Westchester and Bergen counties may have been exposed to the measles (see URL above for list of locations). To increase awareness about measles, the NYC Health Department will hold a meeting in Williamsburg with rabbis and elected officials tomorrow [18 Oct 2018], place ads in local newspapers and distribute posters to health care providers.

The 1st case in Rockland County of international travel was in late September [2018], and 2 more cases due to separate international travelers in early October [2018] are leading to more potential cases of measles among non-immune residents. County health officials offered a free vaccine on 11 Oct [2018] to residents who had been exposed. Now they are offering 2 more chances for a free vaccine.

"As we see more cases there is the potential for further exposure," said Rockland County Commissioner of Health Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert. "The Rockland County Department of Health continues to investigate these cases and will keep residents informed of any updates. I recommend that residents make sure they and their families are up-to-date on their measles vaccinations."

Measles is highly contagious, so anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting the disease. Individuals are considered protected or immune to measles if they were born before 1957, have received 2 doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, have had measles confirmed by a health care provider, or have a lab test confirming immunity.

YWN [Yeshiva World News] reported 2 weeks ago about the Menahel of Breslov Mosdos in Tzefas having been infected with the measles. He was listed in critical condition at the time of the news story [See ProMED-mail Measles update (61): Middle East ex Ukraine, Europe, USA 20181015.6090960]. There have been dozens of stories published by YWN in the past few months of measles alerts issued by authorities involving Frum people who have not been vaccinated.

[According to the NYC Health Department, if one person catches measles, 90% of that person's non-immunized close contacts will also become infected. Measles typically spreads through coughing and sneezing, and the virus can live for up to 2 hours in the air.

Although not as deadly as now-eradicated smallpox, which looks similar to measles in its early stage, many do not realize how serious measles can be. In the pre-vaccine era, roughly 6000 measles deaths were reported in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The vaccine was introduced in 1963, and measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000. But as vaccination rates have dropped, the disease has experienced a comeback, particularly in Orthodox and other ultra-religious communities, such as the Amish.

The number of parents against mandatory vaccines, known as anti-vaxxers, has also increased, especially in the western states. The LA Times estimates that 10% of children in private and religious schools in California go without protection from childhood diseases.

As of 8 Sep 2018, 137 cases of measles have been confirmed in 24 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC says.

A study by Dr. Jennifer B. Rosen published in the academic journal JAMA Pediatrics in August 2018 found that the 2013 New York measles outbreak, with 58 cases, also broke out among unvaccinated children within Orthodox Jewish communities in Williamsburg and Borough Park.

Of the 58 confirmed Brooklyn cases, 45 (78%) were unvaccinated because of parental refusal or intentional delay, and 12 (21%) were too young for routine measles vaccination.

Brazil's Health Ministry on Wed confirmed 2192 cases of measles, of which 12 have died. Most of the cases occurred in the northern region, in the states of Amazonas and Roraima, with 1776 and 330 cases, respectively. In addition to the confirmed cases, 7894 suspected cases are pending confirmation in these 2 states.

The health ministry highlighted that a large vaccination campaign is being carried out in the states where cases of measles were registered, with 13.2 million doses of vaccines shipped to those states since the beginning of the year [2018]. Brazil received a measles-free certification from the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) a few years ago. If the country does not manage to control the outbreak before February 2019, the certification may be rescinded.

In Sharhorod district, Vinnytsia region, there is a measles outbreak. Because of the high incidence in the villages Rakhny-Forest and Koesteren, 2 schools have stopped training. The measles outbreak was registered in the village of Rakhny-Forest in a secondary school. There on Wed 17 Sep [2018], 15 children were sick. Therefore, the local authorities decided to stop teaching in the school until 26 Oct 2018.

In addition, isolated cases of measles were recorded in the village of Koesteren. So, in one of the schools, restrictive measures were also introduced. However, in the laboratory center, there is no information about how long these measures will last.

"In Kapatiran, there are 6 sick children who are taught directly in school. In the locality as well as neighbouring villages also, there are cases of morbidity... In the village, there is an emergency situation," reported in the laboratory center.

In general, in the region of Vinnytsia in the past, there were 106 cases of measles, and this year [2018] -- already 1500 cases. In the Carpathian region, 3 rural schools were closed because of the outbreak of measles in the region.

At least 2 people have died of measles and 313 other cases have been reported in Mandera County since February [2018] when the disease was 1st detected, according to the county's health department. The disease has affected both children under the age of 5 and adults, leaving a child and an elderly woman dead.

Low immunisation
------------------
According to Mr. Mohamud Mohamed, the county's health minister, the region is still battling the epidemic in parts of Banisa and Mandera West sub-counties. "We have managed the situation in Mandera East, North, South and Lafey sub-counties through emergency immunisation, but the national government will support the fight in the remaining areas," he said.

Mr. Mohamed blamed the low immunisation cover in Mandera on the nomadic nature of the communities. "Locals in Mandera are always on the move with their livestock at the expense of medical attention, but we are following them into interior grazing fields for immunisation," said the official, adding that the low response from the national government and insecurity in Mandera were also to blame for poor immunisation coverage.

The disease was 1st detected in areas bordering Somalia and Ethiopia before spreading into the interior parts. Through the Rapid Result Initiative, the county aims at containing the epidemic completely within the next 2 months.

Cases spillover
------------
Mr. Ibrahim Hussein, the head of the disease surveillance department in Mandera, said the highly contagious disease was 1st reported in Mandera East back in February [2018]. "We recorded one death of a child in February [2018] in Mandera East and another of an elderly woman in Mandera North Sub-County, but enough intervention measures were set up then and successfully managed the situation," he said.

Since June [2018], the disease has hit Mandera West with 182 cases recorded mostly in the remote areas. "But our medical teams are on the ground carrying out intervention measures," he said.

Mandera North reported a measles outbreak in July and August [2018], recording 28 cases.

Mr. Hussein blamed low immunisation coverage in Mandera for the high spread of the disease. "In addition to low immunisation coverage, we suffer from a spillover from neighbouring Ethiopia and Somalia since they have poor health infrastructure," he said.

Low birth weight
-----------------
Vaccination prevents many cases of measles around the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 2.6 million people who have not had the vaccine die of measles every year. "We have a team of experts from the Ministry of Health in Nairobi camping in Mandera West assessing the situation before we can carry out mass vaccination," said Mr. Hussein.

Measles during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, early delivery, or low birth weight.
