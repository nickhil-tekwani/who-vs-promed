Mayaro virus (MAYV) has been detected in a 60-year-old male who recently returned from a vacation in South America that included a jungle tour in the Amazon basin. While this is the 1st confirmed Canadian case, there are published reports of MAYV infections in tourists and local inhabitants from this area (1).

The traveler departed for Lima, Peru, on 28 Feb 2018, spending 12 days visiting various cities and tourist destinations in this country. His jungle tour began at Puerto Maldonado, Peru, on 12 Mar 2018, lasting for 4 days in the Amazon basin, which included jungle hikes and boat trips. He reported being bitten by mosquitoes, describing those on his forearm as particularly painful. He flew back to Alberta, Canada, on [18 Mar 2018].

The following day he experienced rigors and chills, although he felt afebrile during these episodes. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed to arthralgias in the large joints of his knees, elbows, and ankles as well as the small joints of his hands, together with myalgias in his calves and quadriceps muscles and severe fatigue. He sought medical attention on 2 occasions, the first at his family physician's clinic the day after his onset of symptoms. At day 4 after onset he was seen by an infectious diseases specialist (ST) at a tertiary care facility, who noted a bilateral non purulent conjunctivitis, with a confluent, macular, erythematous rash on his chest, arms, and back, pharyngitis with no tonsillar involvement, no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, and no signs of meningismus. He did not take malaria prophylaxis, nor eat raw foods or drink raw milk during his jungle tour although he described 2 days of diarrhea after his onset of illness following his return that had since resolved. He travelled with his wife, who was asymptomatic, and reported no other sexual partners.

His CBC performed at day 2 after onset was mildly abnormal, specifically with a low white blood cell count 3.7 x10^9/L, but normal hemoglobin and no thrombocytopaenia. Thick and thin films were negative for malaria on 3 consecutive collections. His C-reactive protein was high at 39.2 mg/L (reference range less than 8 mg/L), although 4 weeks later it had declined to just above baseline. His urine showed mild haematuria and 1+ protein, although the liver enzymes and liver function tests were within normal limits. The infectious disease physician who saw him at day 4, assessed the etiology to be most likely arboviral, although he was prescribed doxycycline as precautionary coverage for leptospirosis, because of his exposure to contaminated water during his boating excursions.

Whole blood and serum were collected to test for arboviruses, leptospirosis, and other probable infectious causes of rashes and viral syndromes. Additionally, nasopharyngeal, eye, and throat swabs were collected to test for the respiratory viruses, viral causes of conjunctivitis and _Streptococcus pyogenes_, respectively; none of these yielded a positive result.

Laboratory investigations specific for an arboviral etiology commenced with a triplex PCR (2), specific for dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, on the acute serum collected at day 2 after onset, but the results were negative; serology results for these 3 agents were similarly negative. At day 19 after onset, a convalescent serum tested positive for CHIKV IgM and indeterminate for IgG. This result prompted the infectious disease physician to query whether a related alphavirus, such as MAYV, could cross-react in the CHIKV serologic assays, given the patient's recent travel and the earlier negative CHIKV PCR finding. Serologic cross reactivity has been previously described between related alphaviruses (3) as was noted in this case.

As a result, the acute serum collected at 2 days after onset was retested by a laboratory developed gel-based pan-alphavirus assay that allows for the detection of related alphaviruses. PCR amplification was carried out using primers targeting an 875 bp segment within the non-structural protein 4 (nsP4) gene, followed by sequencing of the amplicon and comparison to the non-redundant NCBI nucleotide database using BLAST analysis for the identification of MAYV. A sequence of 793 nucleotides was available for comparison and the closest match showed 98 percent identity with a human MAYV genotype D isolate from Peru in 2000. Coincidently, this genotype was also reported from a human case at this location in 2005 (4).

This case illustrates a number of interesting clinical points and diagnostic challenges associated with the identification of arboviruses in areas where multiple closely related viruses co-circulate. Mayaro virus and CHIKV are closely related alphaviruses and although MAYV is localized to South America and the Caribbean, CHIKV, in contrast, has seen a rapid extension in its geographical range, and is now widely prevalent in South and Central America and the Caribbean. As well there has been a broader tourist expansion into these eco-conservation areas bringing tourists into much closer contact with mosquitoes carrying these agents. Consequently it is usual to perform serologic panels that include DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in patients returning with a fever and rash. As in this case if the alphavirus gel-based molecular assay had not identified MAYV as the definitive etiology, the serology findings would classify this case as an acute CHIKV infection. This case also raises the distinct possibility that an unknown proportion of cases may have been or are misclassified as acute CHIKV infections and instead could be MAYV infections, especially if these persons have been to travel destinations where this agent circulates.

Clinically the signs and symptoms of CHIKV and MAYV infections are fairly similar, usually beginning with an acute febrile phase followed by a rash on the face and trunk, and shortly thereafter arthralgias involving the small and large joints that can persist for weeks. While this manifestation is less common in DENV and ZIKV infections, it has still been reported to occur in a number of cases. Hence, there are no clear clinical features that distinguish between these 4 agents, or define a MAYV infection definitively.

In conclusion, the laboratory confirmation of a MAYV infection in a returning traveler was a result of the local availability of advanced molecular assays, often not available in most diagnostic laboratories, together with the high degree of clinical suspicion and epidemiological findings.

[Although most of the reports of Mayaro virus infections come from Brazil, the virus is more widely distributed in the countries of the Amazon Basin, including Peru. As noted in earlier comments and underscored in the report above, because of the clinical similarities of Mayaro, chikungunya, and dengue virus infections, one cannot help but wonder how many MAYV infections in the South American tropics and perhaps in the Caribbean are incorrectly attributed to dengue or chikungunya virus infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation.

Mayaro fever is a disease that begins with a nonspecific fever and fatigue. A rash may occur over the body, accompanied by headache and joint pain. Because they are symptoms similar to those of chikungunya fever, the diagnosis must be made through laboratory tests. Laboratory diagnosis of Mayaro virus infection is made by serological methods -- IgM ELISA -- in cases of acute febrile syndromes after the 6th or 7th day after symptoms begin. To achieve effective surveillance of Mayaro virus infections, public health and hospital laboratories around tropical Americas, as well as in countries where travelers return from Mayaro virus endemic areas, will have to acquire the capability to conduct IgM ELISA tests. Test results will need to be compiled by Ministries of Health.

The transmission cycle of Mayaro virus is very similar to yellow fever virus, with primates as reservoir hosts and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments that the vectors inhabit. However, if _Aedes aegypti_ are efficient vectors of the virus, there is a real risk of spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle to an urban one with ongoing transmission. Are we seeing the tip of a large Mayaro infection iceberg?
