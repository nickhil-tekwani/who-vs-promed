HEPATITIS A, STRAWBERRIES - USA
===============================

Subject: Schools Alerted to Hepatitis A
>From various media sources
Strawberries that may have been tainted with hepatitis A virus were sent to
17 states, and as many as 9,000 youngsters and adults in Los Angeles may
have been exposed. In Michigan, where the only illnesses have appeared to
date, some 200 suspected cases of hepatitis A have been linked to the
strawberries.
Four-ounce fruit cups served last week in 18 Los Angeles public schools may
have been contaminated with the hepatitis virus, school officials said
Tuesday. There have been no reports of illness in Los Angeles, but health
officials plan to set up immunization centers to help avert an outbreak.
There is a 14-day incubation period for this disease and it is still early.
Tom Amontree, communications director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture
in Washington, said possibly tainted strawberries were sent to 17 states. He
said the states were asked to "put a hold" on the berries. The U.S.D.A.
distributed the berries as surplus food. California officials said the
strawberries were sent to schools in Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent letters to those
states, along with California and Florida, to check to see if they served
the berries. Iowa officials warned that about 300 of their state's schools
may have served the strawberries last week.
Bob Howard, a spokesman for the National Center for Infectious Diseases,
confirmed an ongoing investigation into the Michigan outbreak, which has
"strongly implicated" a single batch of strawberries.
The California Department of Health Services determined the strawberries
were grown in Mexico, then frozen and processed by [deleted] of San Diego
last spring. The agency said the strawberries were shipped for bulk
distribution to USDA-sponsored school lunch programs in December. [deleted]
has agreed to recall all the strawberries, according to the health agency.
There was no listing for the company in the San Diego area.

[While there is no reason at this time to doubt this event, the name of the
company has been deleted because the necessary actions have already been
taken to withdraw their product. It appears that the suspected product was
provided under very restricted circumstances and not sold in supermarkets.
If anyone needs to know the company's name, please check with your local
Public Health office or CDC. The place and cause for this claimed
contamination has not yet been revealed.
