I passed a copy of David Halverson's statement to Dr Les Sims, Senior
Veterinary Officer (Health), Hong Kong <simsgenl@HK.Super.NET>, for
comment. Les advises that:
"Hong Kong veterinary authorities are using HI
[hemagglutination-inhibition not agar gel. One set of tests on randomly
collected samples is being done in the mainland 5 days prior to arrival.
Only flocks that are well managed and have no evidence of disease are
allowed to be exported. Birds are examined clinically on the day of
departure and then tested again on arrival at the border. The test is
essentially an audit on the mainland results. In checking each consignment
we examine 13 cages thoroughly for evidence of sick birds (and count both
the total number of birds in these cages and the total number of cages --
to deter smuggling). If mortalities exceed predefined limits the
consignment will be held and birds will be tested using Directigen (rapid
group A antigen test - Becton Dickinson) on tracheal swabs from sick or
dead birds."

[I, for one, feel better, knowing that an agar gel test is not being relied
on for diagnosis. - Mod.CHC
