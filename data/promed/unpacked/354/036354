[During the 14th meeting of the Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe held in September 2019, Ukraine reported that the situation appears to have significantly improved in 2019 compared to 2018. A presentation of the ASF situation from 29 May to 10 Sep 2019 was presented and is available at http://web.oie.int/RR-Europe/eng/Regprog/docs/docs/SGE%20ASF14/D1_15_SGE_ASF14_PPT_Country_UA.pdf.

The following summary on ASF outbreaks and the animals affected during the last 3 years in Ukraine was obtained from the OIE WAHID database section called "Disease time-series analysis;" https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries. This section produces a time-series bar chart, by month, based on the immediate notifications and follow-up reports that are received.

Period of time / New outbreaks of ASF reported in Ukraine
Jan-Dec 2017 / 157
Jan-Dec 2018 / 147
Jan-Dec 2019 / 53

The section from where these numbers were obtained does not distinguish between domestic and wild swine. They are lumped together.
Total animals affected 2017:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic swine and wild boar/ 33 259 / 1265 / 1201 / 27 189 / 0

Total animals affected 2018:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic swine and wild boar / 24 247 / 899 / 844 / 17 534 / 0

Total animals affected 2019:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic swine and wild boar / 115 579 / 12 034 / 12 031 / 94 680 / 0

The significant increase in the number of animals affected in 2019 compared to 2017 and 2018 was due to one large commercial operation being affected in the region of Lviv, which involved 102 294 susceptible animals and 11 527 cases (see immediate notification report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=31450).
