The Secretary of Public Health Policy, Dr Monica Pusso, together with Dr Gustavo Eachavi, Associate Hospital Director, reported a case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. They reported that after [receiving] a serology report sent to the Pergamino hospital they confirmed the admission of [a] hantavirus [infection case], a 14-year-old hospitalized with pneumonia 14 days ago. Fortunately, the patient progressed favorably from an acute condition, since this aggressive virus [infection] has a high case fatality rate.

Dr Pusso explained that this virus is transmitted by a long-tailed mouse that is found in rural areas; inhabiting the countryside among the weeds, and in order to eradicate it, it is important to clean up all possible placs where the mouse is found such as grain storage areas, dark places, "because hantaviruses are not found in ventilated places with sunshine or cleaned with bleach and it is important not to co-habit with mice and to remove trash because this is sufficient," Pusso explained.

In order to calm the people, she stated that these are isolated and sporadic cases and in our city there have been 3 cases in approximately 30 years.

The municipal Zoonosis Department inspected the patient's home, located in a rural area, and carried out trash removal in the locality as a preventive measure.

Dr Echavi stated that, "this is a disease that begins with a fever, similar to a bad flu, and progresses rapidly to cardiopulmonary insufficiency; this patient was on a respirator for the past few days." And he mentioned and congratulated the work of the hospital team that acted rapidly and efficiently.

[The reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. For a change, the previous report this year [2017] indicated that the hantavirus involved was Buenos Aires hantavirus. In that previous case, of the 3 subtypes of Andes lineage virus, Lechiguanas and Plata were discarded and Buenos Aires was matched by the Molecular Biology Service of the Carlos Malbran Institute. The above case is likely due to infection by this virus.

Although the long-tailed mouse was mentioned as the rodent host in the above report, the rodent host of this virus has not been determined. The long-tailed mouse (pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), is the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus that is found in the Andean region of Argentina and Chile, much further west than Buenos Aires province.
