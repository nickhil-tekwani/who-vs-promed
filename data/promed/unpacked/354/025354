[Guinea's] health ministry said on Thu 9 Aug 2012 that 60 people have died of cholera and [the outbreak] is showing no signs of letting up. Officials have registered 2054 cases, with the capital Conakry and the south western city of Forecariah worst affected. 13 people have died in Conakry and 23 in Forecariah.

The NGO Medecins sans Frontieres [Doctors Without Borders] stated that it had increased the number of hospital beds to "soon reach 600 to prepare for the height of the outbreak." 2 other organisations, UNICEF and Action Against Hunger, have donated hygiene kits containing soap and chlorine to purify water. Guinean health authorities are also running local awareness campaigns in a bid to stem the outbreak.

Sierra Leone, Mali, and Niger have also been hard hit, with high levels of malnourishment as a result of a drought exacerbating the problem.

According to local authorities 10 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to a cholera epidemic. Cramped and unsanitary conditions in a displaced people's camp in the east [near Goma] have led to confirmed cases of the deadly waterborne disease. Thousands of people have fled to the camp to escape conflict in their homes, IB Times reports. A cholera outbreak spread through DRC in 2011, as well, killing hundreds in communities along the Congo River.

A makeshift clinic has been set up by doctors in the camp to care for the sick, while experts try to curb the spread of the disease, IB Times reports. Eastern Congo saw 18 552 cholera cases in 2011 resulting in 232 deaths.

[7] Cholera - Malaysia (Borneo)

The cholera outbreak in Bintulu can only be overcome if members of the public take their personal hygiene seriously, said health director-general Datuk Seri Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman. He said as of last Fri 3 Aug 2012, there were 624 suspected cases, while 110 patients had tested positive for the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ and were hospitalized.

"The transmission is still active and we are still reporting new cases. The public needs to cooperate and participate otherwise they will also be at risk. If you just leave the preventive measures to the government and Health Department, our activities are only confined to those who come in for health screening," Dr Hasan told a press conference after attending the Bintulu Hospital Health Carnival yesterday, 4 Aug 2012.

He strongly advised the public not to buy drinks with ice such as cordials because the water used to make the ice may not have been boiled. "We appeal to the public not to buy contaminated food. If the place is found to be dirty, please don't buy there because this is very clear, indicating that they are not good in their personal hygiene and don't care about health," he said.

On the latest outbreak, the 1st known patient infected by the disease was a Bintulu Regatta participant from a longhouse. It is believed that participants did not practise good hygiene and used water from Sungai Kemena that was already contaminated with bacteria from human waste. Dr Hasan added that hospitalised patients would be supplied with medicines for at least 3 days until their excrement samples indicated negative for bacteria.

Since the onset of monsoon 15 cholera cases have been confirmed in Kathmandu district. Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital has confirmed 14 cases, while one case is reported in Kanti Children's Hospital. Contaminated water is the main cause of cholera and diarrhoea in Kathmandu, doctors said.

The cholera patients, between 3 and 88 years of age, were from Teku, Tahachal, Kalimati, Swayambhu, Baneshwor, Rabibhawan, Dallu, Bhimsengola, Kalanki, and Pinglasthan in Kathmandu, the hospitals involved in the patients' treatment reported.

According to Dr Indra Prasad Prajapati, the hospital director, cholera cases have gone up in 2012 compared to corresponding periods in the preceding years. "Only 8 cases were reported in 2011 during this time," the director said and feared of focal outbreak if the number kept on rising. However, the epidemic could be limited to small focal area with people drinking the same contaminated water, Dr Prajapati said. He further said that 3 of the total cholera cases were based in Swayambhu.

Dr Prajapati said leakage of drainage pipes and water pipelines is mainly responsible for the contamination of water.
