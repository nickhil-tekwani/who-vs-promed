Cholera in Democratic Republic of the Congo
Up to 16 January 1998, a total of 1,242 cases of cholera had been reported
in a military camp situated 5 kmfrom Kisangani. Of these, 234 cases were
fatal (case fatality rate 19%). The outbreak had apparently started in
October 1997 but was not reported until 21 December. The population in the
camp was reported to be 4 000 in December and 3 000 in January but appeared
to be less after at least 2 000 soldiers had been transferred to another
military camp. The early warning system based on 23 sentinel sites in
Kisangani have reported an increased number of cases of diarrhoea among the
general population since the last week of December and a few cases of
cholera have also been notified among the civilian population north-west of
Kisangani during the second week of January. A cholera treatment centre
established in the general hospital in Kisangani by Médecins Sans
Frontières is treating about 300 patients at present, most of them with
cholera. The patients are in general young, between 12 and 18 years, and
30% of them are suffering from severe malnutrition.
