First Report of _Pythium irregulare_ on Lentils in the United States.
-----------------------------------------------------------
T. C. Paulitz, F. Dugan, and W. Chen, USDA-ARS, Washington
State University, Pullman 99163-6430; and N. J. Grunwald, USDA-
ARS, 24106 N. Bunn Rd., Prosser, WA 99350. Plant Dis. 88:310,
2004; published online as D-2004-0114-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 15 Dec 2003.
In late June and early July 2002, stunted, chlorotic, and partially
defoliated lentils (_Lens culinaris_ Medik.) were observed
throughout the lentil-growing areas of eastern Washington. These
symptoms were investigated in 2 fields near Garfield, WA and one
field near Genesee, ID. Cv. Mason was more affected than cv.
Brewer. Roots were dry and brittle with black discoloration in some
cases.
Isolates of _Fusarium oxysporum_ and _F. solani_ were obtained
from washed roots plated on water agar, but they were
nonpathogenic in greenhouse testing in pasteurized field soil and
peat-based growing mixes.
On 21 Apr 2003, volunteer lentils growing in the same fields showed
symptoms of root rot, and _Pythium_ oospores were observed in
the roots. _Pythium_ spp. were isolated by using a selective
medium (2).
Oospores were aplerotic, intercalary, 12.6 to 21 micrometers long x
11.2 to 18.2 micrometers wide, mostly smooth, and often formed in
chains. Isolates resembled _P. paroecandrum_ Drechs. and _P.
irregulare_ Buisman on the basis of morphological characteristics
(3), but DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region
were closer to _P. irregulare_ on the basis of a comparison with a
worldwide database of _Pythium_ sequences (C. A. Levesque,
personal communication). Isolates were deposited with the USDA-
ARS Western Regional Plant Introduction Station, Pullman, WA.
Four hyphal-tip isolates were tested in the greenhouse with
inoculum grown in autoclaved sandy loam amended with 1 percent
ground rolled oats. Experiments were performed twice in Thatuna
silt loam, first in pasteurized and then in nonpasteurized soil.
Inoculum was added to the soil at 500 CFU/g, and seeds were
planted on the same day. Each isolate was tested on cvs. Brewer
and Mason, with 5 replicates per treatment. Plants were grown in 4
plastic tubes 20.5 cm long (2 plants per tube) for 1 month at 16 to
22 deg C and supplemented with 14 h light per day. _P. irregulare_
was reisolated from infected roots in both experiments.
Damping-off, stunting, chlorosis, and root rot were observed in the
_Pythium_-inoculated treatments, which corresponded to symptoms
observed in the field in 2002. In pasteurized soil, only one isolate
reduced the whole, dry, plant weight of Brewer, but the other 3
isolates reduced the dry weight of Mason. All isolates reduced the
root dry weight of Mason in natural soil, but only 2 isolates reduced
the root dry weight of Brewer.
To our knowledge, _Pythium_ spp., but not _P. irregulare_, have
been reported previously from lentils (1). _P. irregulare_ also
causes root rot on winter wheat, which is rotated with lentils, and
this pathogen likely causes yield reduction in both crops.

[_Pythium irregulare and _P. ultimum_ are common pathogens that
affect many crops, causing damping-off diseases. Yield losses can
be very high, especially in soils with heavy moisture-holding
capacity. Prevention of diseases under field conditions is a priority,
but that is easier said than done -- because once infestation
occurs, oospores can remain viable for several years. Disease
management depends upon planting of high-quality seeds and
treatment of seed with approved fungicides. Infection of wheat by
_P. irregulare_ in the Pacific Northwest USA may be more
common than we know.
