After the discovery of a new case of African swine fever [ASF] in a wild boar found dead in the surveillance zone, the Walloon government has proceeded to expand the 3 protection zones. This has been announced by the Walloon minister of Nature and Forest, Ren√© Collin (CDH).

Collin has held emergency consultations in Gembloux on [Sat 16 Feb 2019] afternoon, including representatives from the Cabinet of Federal Minister for Agriculture Denis Ducarme. "The discovery leads to an extension of the buffer zone, the observation zone and the surveillance zone", says Collin. In concrete terms, the buffer zone to the north will be expanded by 2900 ha, the observation zone will be expanded east and west of the buffer zone.

In addition, the council chamber of Arlon on [Fri 15 Feb 2019] extended the detention of a 2nd suspect in the judicial investigation concerning ASF by one month. That has been communicated to the public prosecutor of the province of Luxembourg. The detention of the 1st suspected person had been extended on [Tue 12 Feb 2019].

So far, the judicial authorities have been very reluctant to make information available. At the request of the investigating judge in charge of the case, the public prosecutor's office still did not inform the parties on which grounds the 2 were arrested. Also the identity of both suspects is officially not yet known. Both were placed under detention mandate last week. Several house searches were carried out during that week. In the Gaume region, the ASF virus was discovered in wild boar in September 2018.

[According to the official web-site of Belgium's Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC), the total number of wild boars collected as of 15 Feb 2019 was 1473, including 1244 in the infected perimeter; the total number of boars found infected is 494.

The web-site further states that more than 30 km [approx. 19 mi] of fences were installed between Valansart and Aubange on the dividing line between the buffer zone and that of observation. The goal is to avoid the movement of wild boars between East and West and between North and South. However, it is not a hermetic enclosure, given the configuration of places (villages, road, etc). This particularly coercive device must prevent the spread of wild boar weakened by the disease.

Following the spread of the virus to the west, it was also decided to install 15 km [approx. 9 mi] of additional fences along the French border of the Orval Forest in Sommethonne.

In addition, a new fence has been finalized since 14 Feb 2019 along the roads Marbehan-Mellier, Mellier-Poteau de Mellier, Poteau de Mellier-Rossignol, surrounding the forest north of Orsinfaing.

A useful, interactive map, presenting 4 zones (Reinforced Observation Zone, Vigilance Zone, Kernel Zone and Buffer Zone) and the fences, is available at http://tinyurl.com/y4xufvls. - Mod.AS
