Rust Now in Central Alabama
---------------------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR] has been confirmed in a sentinel plot and a nearby
commercial field in Autauga County, Alabama, about 200 miles south of the
Tennessee border, the northernmost ASR confirmation in the U.S. so far this
year [2005].
Ed Sikora, a plant pathologist at Auburn University, stated on the USDA
rust web site that 5 infected leaves at the R6 growth stage were taken in
for testing on 18 Aug 2005. 2 lesions on 2 leaves in the plot were at the
R6 stage. During a scout about a mile from the sentinel plot, an ASR lesion
at the R3-R4 stage was observed on one leaf in an 18-acre commercial
soybean field.
Growers in south and central Alabama should spray a curative or curative
plus protectant fungicide, Sikora said. The weather is conducive to disease
spread, especially those areas with daily rain. Those in north Alabama
should wait to see whether the disease moves north before spraying.

[ASR is slowly spreading in the southern states. A review of the past week
is of special interest. See the 3rd link.
