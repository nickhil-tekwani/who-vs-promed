Late last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the nation now had 2 confirmed cases of monkeypox in children, following similar announcements in the Netherlands and Spain.

The detections likely reflect household transmission, the agency said, and are unrelated. One is a toddler from California, and the other is a baby who isn't a US resident but was tested while traveling through Washington, DC.

The CDC also said at least 8 cases in the US have been in women.

The 1st monkeypox case has been reported in Yukon, according to Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr Sudit Ranade.

"On Thursday, 21 Jul 2022, the 1st case of monkeypox was confirmed in the territory.

"Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) is conducting a thorough investigation into this case and the individual is in isolation. In this case, we understand that the exposure to monkeypox occurred outside of the territory.

As of 22 Jul [2022], the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has reported 681 cases of monkeypox in Canada.

[4] Bermuda: 1st report
Date: Sun 24 Jul 2022

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/bermuda-reports-1st-monkeypox-case-58966/


The Bermuda Ministry of Health reported its 1st confirmed case of monkeypox on Thursday [21 Jul 2022].

The patient is in isolation, and the Ministry of Health is investigating potential close contacts and will notify anyone who may have been exposed.

Acting Minister of Health, Jason Hayward, JP MP, said, "Monkeypox is rare, not life-threatening and Bermuda is well prepared to detect the disease and take suitable public health measures to prevent its spread. The Ministry of Health has provided guidance for primary care providers and the Bermuda Molecular Diagnostics and Research Laboratory (MDL) lab on sample handling. The Hospital also has appropriate isolation facilities to support treatment.

"The Ministry is also working with the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Our port health officials know how to screen and recognize possible cases and take appropriate action. Our healthcare professionals know how to identify, immediately isolate, and report cases to local and regional health authorities."

Monkeypox is a rare infection that's mainly found in parts of west or central Africa (often near rainforests but increasingly in some urban areas as well). It may take between 5 and 21 days for the 1st symptoms to appear. Usually, the virus causes flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, rash, and lesions on the face or genitals. Most people recover within several weeks without requiring hospitalization.

[5] United Kingdom: case definition update
Date: Mon 25 Jul 2022
Source: UK Health Security Agency
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-case-definition-updated-to-include-new-symptoms


The symptom list has been expanded to include a single lesion or lesions on the genitals, anus, and surrounding area, lesions in the mouth, and symptoms of proctitis (anal or rectal pain or bleeding), especially if the individual has had a new sexual partner recently. This will help both individuals and clinical professionals identify monkeypox symptoms.

The majority of people with monkeypox can safely manage their symptoms at home and there have been no deaths in the UK. Most people experience mild disease but it can cause a significant illness in some, requiring hospitalisation, including for severe pain.

Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections at UKHSA, said:

"We continue to see new diagnoses of monkeypox, passed on primarily through close or sexual contact.

"We have updated our case definitions to reflect the clinical presentations that have been seen during this outbreak. It is important to recognise that just one or 2 genital or anal lesions, or lesions in the mouth can be signs of monkeypox, especially if you have had a new sexual partner. If you think you have monkeypox, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.

"There is still a need to be cautious and stay alert for symptoms. For many people, symptoms can be mild but for some people, hospital treatment may be required."

Guidance and materials are being updated to reflect the new case definition and expanded symptoms list.

[The new definitions are:
"Possible case
-------------
A possible case is defined as anyone who fits one or more of the following criteria:
- a febrile prodrome* compatible with monkeypox infection where there is known prior contact with a confirmed case in the 21 days before symptom onset
- an illness where the clinician has a suspicion of monkeypox - this could include unexplained genital, anogenital, or oral lesion(s) (for example, ulcers, nodules) or proctitis (for example anorectal pain, bleeding)

*Febrile prodrome consists of fever ≥ 38°C, chills, headache, exhaustion, muscle aches (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), backache, and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).

Probable case
-------------
A probable case is defined as anyone with an unexplained rash or lesion(s) on any part of their body (including genital/perianal, oral), or proctitis (for example anorectal pain, bleeding) and who:
- has an epidemiological link to a confirmed, probable, or highly probable case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset
or
- identifies as a gay, bisexual, or another man who has sex with men (GBMSM)
or
- has had one or more new sexual partners in the 21 days before symptom onset
or
- reports a travel history to West or Central Africa in the 21 days before symptom onset

Actions on a possible or probable case
Test for monkeypox (using designated testing pathway [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-diagnostic-testing]).

Undertake additional contemporaneous tests to rule out alternative diagnoses if clinically appropriate and if not done already.

If admission of patient required for clinical reasons, admit to single room isolation at negative or neutral pressure at local hospital site with RPE PPE (with appropriate IPC arrangements).

Or, if patient not requiring admission for clinical reasons: self-isolation at home (based on assessment by the clinician and following UKHSA guidance).

Or, if patient not requiring admission for clinical reasons but self-isolation at home is not possible for social or medical reasons following clinician assessment: isolation in single room at negative or neutral pressure at local hospital site with RPE PPE [respiratory protective equipment - personal protective equipment] pending test result (prioritise probable cases).

Highly probable case
--------------------
A highly probable case is defined as a person with an orthopox virus positive result since 15 Mar 2022 and where monkeypox remains the most likely diagnosis.

Confirmed case
--------------
A confirmed case is defined as a person with a laboratory confirmed monkeypox infection (monkeypox PCR positive).

Action on a confirmed or highly probable case
All confirmed or highly probable cases should be assessed for the need for admission based on either clinical or self-isolation requirements. The NHS provides guidance on management of patients with confirmed monkeypox.

All confirmed or highly probable cases should be notified to the local health protection team by the clinician."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
An unprecedented outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in non-endemic countries has been recognised since 12 May 2022. More than 6000 cases have been identified globally with more than 1500 in the UK by July 2022. Transmission of MPXV is believed to be predominantly through direct contact with lesions or infected body fluids, with possible involvement of fomites and large respiratory droplets. Importantly, a case of monkeypox in a UK healthcare worker in 2018 was suspected to be due to virus exposure while changing bedding.

Methods
We investigated environmental contamination with MPXV from infected patients admitted to isolation rooms in the UK, to inform infection prevention and control measures. Surface swabs of high-touch areas in isolation rooms, of healthcare worker personal protective equipment (PPE) in doffing areas, and from air samples collected before and during bedding change were analysed using MPXV qPCR to assess contamination levels. Virus isolation was performed to confirm presence of infectious virus in key positive samples.

Findings
We identified widespread surface contamination (66 positive out of 73 samples) in occupied patient rooms (MPXV DNA Ct values 24.7-38.6), on healthcare worker personal protective equipment after use, and in doffing areas (Ct 26.3-34.3). Of 15 air samples taken, 5 were positive. Significantly, 3 of 4 air samples collected during a bed linen change in one patient's room were positive (Ct 32.7-35.8). Replication-competent virus was identified in 2 of 4 samples selected for viral isolation, including from air samples collected during the bed linen change.

Interpretation
These data demonstrate significant contamination in isolation facilities and the potential for aerosolisation of MPXV during specific activities. PPE contamination was observed after clinical contact and changing of bed linen. Additionally, contamination of hard surfaces in doffing areas supports the importance of cleaning protocols, PPE use, and doffing procedures.

[7] Japan (Tokyo): 1st report
Date: Mon 25 Jul 2022

https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/first-case-monkeypox-japan-detected-tokyo-ntv-citing-govt-source-2022-07-25/


Japan has detected its 1st case of the monkeypox virus in Tokyo, the capital's governor said on Monday [25 Jul 2022].

The infected person is a man in his 30s who returned from Europe and is currently in a hospital, Yuriko Koike told reporters.

"He has a rash, fever, headache, and fatigue. But at the moment, he is in a stable condition," a Health Ministry official told a separate media briefing.

The patient, a Tokyo resident, went to Europe late last month [June 2022] and had contact with a person who was later confirmed monkeypox-positive before returning to Japan in mid-July [2022], the official said.

The official did not elaborate on the nature of the contact and declined to specify the Tokyo resident's nationality.

The World Health Organization said on Saturday [23 Jul 2022] that the rapidly spreading monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency.

So far this year [2022] there have been more than 16 000 monkeypox cases in more than 75 countries and 5 deaths in Africa.

The virus spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions.
