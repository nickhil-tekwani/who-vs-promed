Hong Kong says man dies of pig-borne disease
-----------------------------------------------
A Hong Kong man who died in the hospital earlier in October 2005 had a
pig-borne infection due to _Streptococcus suis_, the territory's government
said on Mon 24 Oct 2005, citing lab tests.
The man was the 12th person from Hong Kong to be infected with the
bacterium in 2005, the government said in a statement. The disease has
killed around 40 people in mainland China. The 43-year-old, who had no
recent travel history, was admitted to the hospital on 13 Oct 2005. He died
on the same day, and his family was placed under medical observation, it
said. No further details were available.
Most of the more than 200 people reported to have caught the disease on the
mainland became sick after slaughtering, handling or eating infected pigs.
The new case could re-ignite a food scare that, in August 2005, prompted
the Hong Kong government to temporarily ban imports of pork from the
Chinese province of Sichuan.

[_S. suis_ human infection occurs in Hong Kong each year. Whether this case
reflects the underlying endemicity of this infection or was related to the
recent cluster of cases is unclear. It is not stated whether the individual
had direct contact with swine. Unless an increasing number of cases occurs,
the thread is cut. - Mod.LL]
