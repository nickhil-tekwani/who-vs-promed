Poliovirus Weekly Update As of 12 Dec 2018, World Health Organization
--------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 29
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 1
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: [98]
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2017: 96

Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)
- Papua New Guinea - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) and 2 cVDPV1-positive environmental samples

[Comments from the GPEI/WHO re: approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps that must be filled to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial, and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (e.g., due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc.), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high-risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritize technical assistance to those areas. Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus, be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of WPV1 has been reported from Nawzad district, Hilmand province, with onset of paralysis on [6 Nov 2018]. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 21.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week.

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 8.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. Twenty years ago, the entire country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralyzed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. There are 8 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [14 Oct 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response, to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 1 new case of cVDPV1 was reported this week from East Sepik, with onset of paralysis on [18 Oct 2018], bringing the total number of cases in 2018 to 26.
- 2 new cVDPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, both from Port Moresby (Capital City), collected on [23 Oct 2018 and 6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

[Confirmation of newly identified WPV (Afghanistan) and cVDPV (Papua New Guinea) continue to occur, with absolute numbers of cases reported in 2018 continuing to rise. In last week's report, there was a WPV case reported from Afghanistan, and 6 newly confirmed cVDPVs reported from Nigeria (4 cases) and the DRC (2 cases). Unfortunately, it would not be surprising to get delayed reports after 1 Jan 2019, of additional cases with onset dates in 2018.

[2] Pakistan - Positive environmental samples - media report
Date: Thu 13 Dec 2018
Source: Pakistan Today [edited]
https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/12/13/detection-of-polio-virus-in-environmental-samples-of-twin-cities-triggers-alarm/


In what could be dubbed as sheer negligence of the twin cities' [Islamabad and Rawalpindi] administration, poliovirus has been found in environmental samples of the 2 cities, which means that the immunity level of children in the area has fallen, and they are at a high risk of contracting the disease.

Although hectic campaigns were launched in Islamabad and Rawalpindi and the concerned administration vowed to eradicate polio, they have failed to achieve much. Although authorities persistently try to approach and convince more than 2500 parents in Rawalpindi and hundreds of parents in Islamabad, they do not allow health workers to administer polio drops to their children.

It is pertinent to mention here that the city administrations take environmental samples from the twin cities, particularly from Lui-Nullah and Islamabad site near Sabzi Mandi, on a monthly basis. The samples are taken on the 11th of every month and sent for laboratory tests. The presence of the virus is an alarming situation for the twin cities.

The Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hamza Shafqat told Pakistan Today that a hectic polio campaign has been launched that will make sure that children up to the age of 10 years are vaccinated after the virus was detected in the environmental samples.

In the federal capital, the district administration is responsible for making a strategy to administer polio drops to every single child under the age of 5 years in collaboration with the chief executive officer (CEO) for Health Authority, district health officer (DHO), World Health Organisation (WHO) coordinator, and other concerned authorities. The administration is also responsible for providing security to the polio teams. The lifesaving drops are administered to the children up to 10 years old with a special focus on sector I-9, I-10, I-11, I-12, H-11, H-12, H-13, Naseerabad, Chishtiabad, and Shams Colony.

In Rawalpindi, 13 union councils marked as sensitive due to the presence of positive polio environmental samples there would be focused on. These sensitive areas include union council 1-11, 22, and 33.

For this purpose, the district administration of Rawalpindi has constituted 2503 mobile teams, 5 fixed points, 120 transit points, and appointed 547 area in-charges who are to administer the polio drops.

It is important to mention here that the National Immunisation Campaign (NIC) in Islamabad had also found 5 positive environmental samples of polio in 2017.

According to the details, the administrations are following 4 steps to fight polio cases in the twin cities.

The 1st step is the routine immunisation by administering 5 injections to every newborn baby. This does not yield results, as only 50% of babies are given the shots. In the 2nd step, supplementary immunisation is given to the children at their doorsteps through various government-funded campaigns. The 3rd step is surveillance to check if the polio vaccination is working or not. And in the 4th step, special teams do mop-up campaigns and revisit areas in which the polio samples were found positive or cases were detected to ensure the eradication of polio.

However, one of the key loopholes observed by this scribe is the absence of staff tasked with the administering of polio drops to children by going to their houses. The polio teams in Rawalpindi were sitting in the DHO's office at 1:00 pm while they were supposed to be on the streets as part of the campaigns at that time.

The DHO, Tahir Rizvi, when questioned by Pakistan Today, curtly replied that the teams only go in the field in the morning.

[To clarify the above situation a bit, last week there were positive environmental samples for WPV1 found in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The significance of this is that there are individual[s] in the area[s] who are infected with the poliovirus and are shedding the WPV1 in their stools, which then result in positive environmental samples taken from sewage locations. The existence of this article shows how serious the country is in reaching the goal of interruption of transmission of the WPV and ultimate eradication of poliovirus worldwide. - Mod.MPP]
