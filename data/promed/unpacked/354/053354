Tests concluded that a food ingredient distributed by a Maryland company is the source of a salmonellosis outbreak that has sickened at least 58 Buncombe County residents. A culture starter for tempeh, a bean product popular in vegetarian cuisine, was found to have the same type of salmonellae that caused a county outbreak beginning as early as February 2012, lab work by the NC Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thu 10 May 2012.

The number of infected county residents increased by 3 from 55 reported Tue 8 May 2012. Other people who visited or otherwise had connections with Buncombe County have also been sickened by the rare type of the bacterium, which has a longer incubation period than more common types.

The Rockville, MD, company, Tempeh Online, sold the starter culture to Smiling Hara Tempeh, which made the meat substitute.

Federal regulators have been involved, and the Buncombe County Health Department said it is continuing to investigate.

On Thu May 2012, Buncombe County Department of Health received final test results from the NC Department of Public Health laboratory confirming that the unopened bag of culture that was added to the tempeh tested positive for the matching strain of _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B linked to the current disease outbreak.

The FDA is already involved in tracing the origin of the ingredient to identify source of contamination as well as the potential for other outbreaks in the USA.

NC Department of Public Health reports 63 cases, which includes cases in NC and other states; however there is a slight delay in reporting.

[It appears that the source of the outbreak strain of _S._ Paratyphi B, probably the d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java), has been identified as the starter culture. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the possibility of additional cultures in other states related to the same source. - Mod.LL
