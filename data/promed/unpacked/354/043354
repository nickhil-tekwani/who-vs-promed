There is a reasonably documented precedent for environmental changes
possibly contributing to malaria transmission in montane regions of East
Africa (see J Trop Med Hyg 1993;96:337-345). The National Institute of
Medical Research in Amani, Tanzania is located in the dense highland
rain forests of the Eastern Usambara Mountains. The institute was
established in these highland rain forests by German colonists at the turn
of the century because at that time there was no malaria transmission in
the area. Despite regular investigations, the first sporozoite-positive
vectors in the Amani area were only described in 1972-3 (0.09% of dissected
_An. gambiae_ and _An. funestus_ females). However, rates of
sporozoite-positive _An. gambiae_ and _An. funestus_ have increased to over
11%
in 1980. Simultaneously, the rate of human malaria cases in the area have
dramatically increased, from being rare and sporadic to occurring
year-round. Potential factors include deforestation (causing standing
water needed for vector breeding).
I would wonder how much logging was being carried out in the newly-endemic
regions described by CNN.

I am not so sure how plausible the global warming ideas are in regard to
the increasing range of malaria in the PNG highlands. I know that for
Telefolmin, at any rate, malaria was extending its range upwards when I
first arrived there 24 years ago. At the time local mission medicos seemed
to think the major issue was increased contact with lowlanders (cops and
government staff) who were infected, providing good hosts for the local
natnats [mosquitoes.

Jeffery Hii of James Cook has been involved in mosquito surveys in the
Western HIghlands Province in 1996 and 1997, as a result of a malaria
epidemic there. His contacts are:

Jeffery is ex-PNG IMR [Institute of Medical Research entolomology.
There is anecdotal evidence for malaria moving up slope or higher in altitude
over the last 100 years. South of Tari in the Higigio Valley there are areas
of abandoned fields, ditched, now covered either in forest or tall grass.
These areas were being abandoned in the 1930s. Ivan Champion describes them.
He attributes the abandonment to fighting. Hulis now say [it was disease.
It is
possible land degradation contributed, because the Huli applied technology
better suited to higher areas of better soil and lower rainfall. However,
this valley was main trade route from Lake Kutubu to the Tari Basin and
beyond.

I have no data, but when I worked with health officials in Eastern Highlands
and Western Highlands provinces in September 1995 (on something other than
malaria), they said that they were seeing cases of malaria at altitudes
where they had not seen malaria before and were certain that there had been
a change. They felt that warmer weather contributed but could not rule out
increased travel into or out of the Highlands as a factor.

I have no information on the recent reports of malaria epidemics at new
altitudes, but its worth pointing that for the main PNG Central Highland
area there is a wealth of information for surveys in the 1940s and 1950s
(and of course later) when the first epidemiology was done (as it was also
in Irian Jaya): and before the start of the 20-30 years of spraying
programme (which I think ended in many places in the 1980s?). This early
information crucial for contextualising the recent information, I should
think.
Peters' work [ref. below reports that in the Wahgi Valley at 1500 m
malaria was highly unstable with severe seasonal epidemics usually
following the main rainy season (i.e April-July): infections rising from 5%
usually to 25% during regular seasonal rises and up to 70% in major
sporadic epidemics (also in Irian Jaya). Parasite rates even at 1900m were
up to 4% in parts of Chimbu Province in the 1950s.
Some references: (but for a major early listing of the full literature, see

and human biology of Papua New Guinea. Faringdon/Goroka, PNG IMR Monograph

[So it appears that malaria may have been present in the PNG highlands 60
years ago, but was not present in the then Tanganyika highlands at the
turn of the century. Since global warming was not a factor 60 years ago,
then malaria may have been able to reach higher altitudes due to other
factors, which could account for its reappearance at such levels in recent
years - Mod.JW
