Suspected Acute Haemorrhagic Fever Syndrome in The Republic of The Congo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO Update: A three-person team from the Congolese Ministry of Health and
WHO that is currently investigating 6 suspected cases including 5 deaths of
acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest region
(see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/june/12june2002.html>) have
traced 40 human contacts of the 6 suspected cases. No new cases have been
reported since the last death on Thu 6 Jun 2002. The investigation has been
hampered by the lack of community cooperation and increased emphasis will
be placed on social mobilization activities.

The epidemiological pattern of this cluster and the clinical signs of the
suspected cases were consistent with the previous outbreak
(<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/april/9april2002.htm>l) of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the area, but since no samples have been
collected, there has been no laboratory confirmation.

[Contrary to the Agency report posted on ProMED-mail as "Ebola hemorrhagic
fever - Congo Rep: confirmed 20020613.4492" on Thu 13 Jun 2002, the recent
outbreak of suspected acute hemorrhagic fever in the Cuvette-Ouest region
of the Republic of The Congo has NOT been confirmed as Ebola hemorrhagic
fever by laboratory diagnosis, although the characteristics of the outbreak
are consistent with such a diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
