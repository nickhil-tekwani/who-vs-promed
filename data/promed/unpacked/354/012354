Researchers have sounded a warning over the much-feared disease glanders, saying the global horse trade from at-risk regions had the potential to re-establish it in countries that have previously eradicated it.

The recent rise in cases of glanders in horses, in combination with worldwide horse trading, might pose a new risk for human infections, they said.

Glanders is a disease known from ancient times. It was recognized as a malady of equines by Hippocrates and Aristotle. It is a life-threatening, notifiable zoonotic disease which is fatal to both animals and humans. It is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_.

Signs of glanders include lung lesions and ulceration of mucous membranes in the respiratory tract. The acute form results in coughing and fever, followed by septicaemia and death within days. In chronic cases, nodules form the skin and in the nasal passages, eventually ulcerating. Death can result within months, with those surviving acting as carriers.

The only known reservoirs of _B. mallei_ are single-hooved animals, particularly horses. Chronically infected horses can be asymptomatic but may remain highly infectious.

Due to its high mortality rate and the small number of organisms needed to establish infection, it is regarded as a potential biological warfare or bioterrorism agent.

It is highly infectious and can be transmitted by aerosol, causing invasive fatal disease in combination with resistance to multiple antibiotics.

Due to its rareness, little is known about outbreak dynamics of the disease.

In the more economically developed countries, glanders has been eradicated through large-scale culling.

In developing countries, economic and cultural circumstances may hinder culling of asymptomatic animals and enable the persistence of glanders, the researchers said.

There are regions in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America where it remains endemic, infecting the likes of horses, donkeys, and camels. These areas provide reservoirs for the re-introduction of glanders into countries previously listed as glanders-free, they said.

In recent years, several outbreaks occurred in horse populations in Asia, the Middle East (Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria), Africa, and South America (Brazil).

Because of the recent rise in cases in multiple countries, glanders has regained the status of a re-emerging disease.

Researchers from Germany, the United States, Dubai, and Austria set about investigating an outbreak among horses in Bahrain in November 2010, using genetic analysis.

They applied high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing to _B. mallei_ isolated from infected horses and one infected camel.

The results were compared to samples obtained from an outbreak in the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in 2004, and put in context based on previously published _B. mallei_ data.

The researchers, whose findings have been published in the open-access journal, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, found that the samples from the outbreak in Bahrain separated into 2 distinct clusters, consisting of 5 and 4 strains each.

The evidence in the Bahrain outbreak across both years pointed to 2 independent but simultaneous introductions.

The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to _B. mallei_ isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than other _B. mallei_, which they said was suggestive of repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources.

"The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE _B. mallei_ populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains," they reported.

"Our analyses demonstrate that not one, but 2 strains likely caused this outbreak, and that these strains probably came from a similar geographic region via importation of infected animals.

"Even with careful monitoring, the global trade of animals from glanders-endemic regions can re-introduce and possibly re-establish this disease in animal populations of countries that have previously eradicated it," the researchers said.

Officially, Bahrain was free of glanders until an outbreak in the north that began in April 2010. Horses imported from Syria via Kuwait were suspected of introducing it and all equines in the area were quarantined and tested. By September 2010, the outbreak was considered to be resolved.

However, in January 2011 the disease reoccurred in the same region of the country.

More than 6700 horses and 250 donkeys -- all of the equine population in this region and about 80 percent of the total horse and donkey population in Bahrain -- as well as 3 camels presenting with clinical symptoms were screened for glanders at the OIE Reference Laboratory in Dubai.

In these investigations, 50 horses and one camel tested positive. _B. mallei_ was isolated from 8 horses and the single, positive camel. These were analyzed along with 15 isolates from the 2004 outbreak in the UAE.

Using genetic testing, the scientists showed that the strain from the camel was genetically closely related to _B. mallei_ strain known as Dubai 7 that was isolated from a horse during the contained outbreak of glanders in a quarantine station in the United Arab Emirates in 2004.

That, and other results from genetic testing of various _B. mallei_ isolates from both events -- the 2004 UAE outbreak and the 2010-11 Bahrain outbreak -- provided evidence that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by 2 different _B. mallei_ strains, suggesting 2 independent introductions.

It may, they said, be indicative of a similar geographic source that has yet to be identified.

"Animal importation records suggest Syria and Kuwait as possible sources. This is strongly supported by the fact that one of the necropsied horses in Bahrain quarantine came directly from Kuwait."

The researchers said that outbreak dynamics and natural genetic variability of _B. mallei_ were not well understood due to the rarity of the disease.

"This outbreak provided a unique opportunity to understand outbreak dynamics as they occurred in a region that was previously free of _B. mallei_, and well monitored with records of animal importations," the researchers reported.

"The failure of initial eradication efforts in 2010 is evidence for the need for continued surveillance and abatement measures even after all animal cases appear to be cleared.

"All animals imported from known or potentially endemic regions should be routinely tested for glanders prior to importation. Repeated testing during quarantine is also recommended as infected animals may be asymptomatic and serologically negative."

Some of the research was funded by the US Department of Homeland Security. It had no role in the study design or analysis work.

[Charles Nicolle, the French pioneer of modern epidemiology, ranked infectious diseases in 3 categories, namely diseases of the past, the present, and the future. Prior to the mechanization of military tools, horses were the most efficient means for the cavalry; their health status was hence of paramount importance. Among the most feared contagious diseases, glanders occupied the 1st rank. Thus the importance of this disease in the past, leaving alone its zoonotic potential as human glanders cases were frequently reported. In the 1970s and 1980s, only a few glanders pockets subsisted and they were located mainly in Iran, Iraq, and other neighboring countries.

However, as mentioned in the present source article, globalization and, as a corollary, the increase in horse trading have brought this neglected zoonosis back into the scene and it is now considered as a re-emerging disease. Since the year 2000, at least 12 countries spread over the MENA region (Middle East/North Africa: UAE, Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria) and other parts of the world (such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia, USA, and Brazil) have reported equine cases. In one circumstance (Bahrain) camels were concerned, and in another, cats were found infected (Iran), while in the USA, a human case was observed (in Maryland). Brazil seems to be the most affected country worldwide and it may be that, besides the known Middle Eastern disease "cauldron", a new one has established itself in South America. Progress was accomplished in terms of glanders diagnosis and, besides the mallein test, which remains the gold standard, a competitive ELISA test was proposed in replacement of the CFT [complement fixation test], whose specificity is considered as low. However, in order to swiftly test equines that travel long distances from potentially infected zones, for example to participate in horse races, it would be more than useful to set up a pen-side diagnosis test. - Mod.AB
