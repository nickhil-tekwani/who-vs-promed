Hemophiliacs Face Variant CJD Scare
------------------------------------
Doctors are trying to trace hemophiliacs treated by the [UK National
Health Service who may have been exposed to [clotting factor 8 derived
from blood plasma from a donor later found to have been infected with
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - the human form of mad cow disease.
Counselling has been arranged for patients and their families, while
efforts are made to establish whether they received the [potentially
infected [factor 8 preparation. The Department of Health says there is no
evidence that vCJD has ever been transmitted through blood or blood
products and any link is theoretical. But hemophiliacs concerned they may
have received affected blood are advised to contact their general practitioner.
Labour peer Lord Morris, Honorary President of the Haemophilia Society,
asked in the House of Lords how many people may have been affected and what
services had been offered to patients. The Junior Health Minister Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath, in a written Parliamentary reply, said that: "There was no
centrally held information on the number of hemophiliacs who received
clotting factor made from plasma donated by the donor. Haemophilia Centre
Directors were notified in December 2000 of the batch numbers of the
clotting factor and are in the process of identifying the recipients from
their patient records," he said.
The UK Haemophilia Doctors Association, in consultation with the Department
of Health, has agreed a policy of giving all hemophilia patients
information about the incident and offering them a choice to know if they
or their children received the implicated clotting factor." Lord Hunt
stated that in 1998 the government stopped using UK plasma in the
manufacture of blood products as a precautionary measure against the
theoretical risk that vCJD could be transmitted in this way.
The Haemophilia Society has told its members that the donated plasma would
have been used in 1996 and 1997 before the 1998 crackdown, when the
government also required the company involved, Bio Products Laboratory, to
source plasma from the USA and not the UK. A spokesman said that: "The
company has stated that this particular donor's plasma has gone into a tiny
percentage of the products distributed before 1998. There have been no
reported cases of vCJD among the hemophilia community." A Department of
Health spokesman stressed that the department itself was not involved in
trying to trace those who might have been affected. He emphasized that:
"The laboratory which produced this batch of blood products is informing
doctors of the batch numbers involved so they can trace patients who will
have received blood products from that batch. There is no simple test for
variant CJD and no treatment for the disease."

[There is no evidence for transmission of vCJD via blood or blood products.
The risk is theoretical but, because of the long incubation period of vCJD,
uncertainty will remain. Genetically engineered factor 8 has been available
in the UK for 4 years, but because of its expense it has been provided only
for treatment of children by the National Health Service. - Mod.CP
