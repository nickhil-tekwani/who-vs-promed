Cases of rat urine disease on the rise in Singapore
-----------------------------------------------
By Dominic Nathan
Cases of a rare disease spread by rat urine and which has caused four
deaths here in the five years up to 1997, are on the rise.
It is called Leptospirosis and preliminary Health Ministry figures show
that for the first eight months of this year, there were 14 cases.
There was an average of about nine cases a year between 1993 and 1997,
which had a total of 44 cases.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease spread mostly through the urine
of rats and other rodents.
Associate Professor Vincent Chow from the Microbiology Department at
the National University of Singapore said the disease is uncommon in
Singapore because of good sanitation.
A person can be infected by contact with contaminated water, wet soil
or vegetation. Cuts or open wounds make it easier for infection to
occur. Prof Chow said that it takes about 10 days for symptoms to
show up. Initially, it may be mistaken for the flu as the symptoms
include fever, chills, headache, severe muscle ache and cough. There
may also be a rash, neck stiffness and mental confusion. Within two
weeks, it can develop to jaundice, meningitis and liver and kidney
failure, he added.

It can be fatal but, if detected early enough, it can be cured with
antibiotics.
The organism itself or antibodies can be detected in a blood test.
The bacteria can also be detected in the in the cerebrospinal fluid
or urine of an infected person. It is kept in check here with good
sanitation and checks on rodent infestation.
The Environment Ministry said that only 5 per cent of the market and food
centres here were found to have a problem with rats. ENV also checks
the sea ports and airports here and attends to public calls about
rats. Rats carry fleas and mites that transmit diseases like plague
and murine typhus. Rat droppings carry salmonella organisms which can
cause food poisoning.
Last year, the ministry carried out 138 checks of various places and
found rats in half the cases. In the first nine months of this year,
ENV found rats 16 per cent of the time, which is 35 out of the 211
places.
