Cassava brown streak disease is the main constraint to cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) production in Mozambique. A survey was undertaken in 1999 in Zambezia and Nampula provinces; disease incidences in some fields reached 80% to 100%, and many of the main cassava cultivars were affected.

A total of 120 leaf samples showing virus-like disease symptoms such as chlorosis, yellow spotting, deformation, mosaic, wilting, leaf curling and necrotic lesions were collected from 15 plant species. Using RT-PCR to amplify partial coat protein nucleotide sequences, we detected for the 1st time the occurrence of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in 2 non-cassava perennial wild plant species -- _Zanha africana_ (velvet-fruit zanha; tropical fruit tree, family Sapindaceae) and _Trichodesma zeylanicum_ (camel bush; herbaceous species, family Boraginaceae) -- that occur widely within and near cassava fields in Nampula, Zambezia, Niassa and Cabo Delgado provinces. In addition, we also detected CBSV and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV) in _Manihot carthaginensis_ subsp. _glaziovii_, a wild cassava relative. These findings were verified in biological assays through mechanical inoculation of CBSV to _T. zeylanicum_, albeit at low rates of infection.

Phylogenetic analysis clustered the CBSV isolates from the non-cassava plant species with those from cultivated cassava, with high sequence homology among CBSV (91.0%-99.6%) and with UCBSV (84%-92%) isolates. These results provide definitive evidence of a wider host range for CBSV and UCBSV in Mozambique, indicating that these viruses are not restricted to cultivated cassava. Our findings are key to understanding the epidemiology of Cassava brown streak disease and will aid in the development of sustainable management strategies for the disease.

[Cassava brown streak (CBS; also called root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ (UCBSV; both genus _Ipomovirus_). It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20% to 80% have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70% have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The viruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and are spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting and vector control. However, these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

Recent outbreaks of CBS disease appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). CBSV is a particular threat to new crop varieties developed with resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643).

Identification of the alternative hosts from unrelated plant families for CBSV and UCBSV reported above is an important finding because they may have an impact on the epidemiology of CBS disease. For CMD, at least one of the viruses (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an unrelated alternative host (soybean). However, further work seems to be needed to determine whether viral strains in the different hosts are the same and to what extent these species can therefore serve as pathogen reservoirs. Alternatively, if different virus strains are found to have different host specificity, these strains may still provide a potential threat of mutating into new crop-affecting strains.
