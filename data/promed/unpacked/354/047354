South Kyrgyz town quarantined over anthrax outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
The town of Aksy [actually Semet village in Asky region] in southern
Kyrgyzstan, along with the surrounding district, has been quarantined
following an anthrax outbreak that has infected at least 5 people,
the country's health ministry said.

The disease spread after meat from an infected cow that had been
slaughtered without a veterinary inspection was sold to locals, the
ministry's press service told RIA Novosti. "According to data from
the national center for dangerous infections, anthrax infection has
been confirmed for 5 residents of the Aksy district following tests,"
the press service said. All of them are currently in a satisfactory
condition. Another 12 patients, who had come into contact with the
infected people, are being examined and are receiving prophylactic treatment.

Communication submitted by
Promed-Mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland

[This confirms the prior tentative diagnosis for these 5 people. As a
week has passed since that report I think we can assume that this
human outbreak is over except for mainly watch just in case. I am not
sure what it means to quarantine a human Kyrgyz population but I
suspect that the veterinary inspection of the local markets has been
ramped up as well as the medcal clinics being on the lookout for any
further cases. Unless something significant occurs this thread is
cut. Unfortunately this oblast is notorious for anthrax so we can
confidentially expect further cases in other rayons. - Mod.MHJ]
