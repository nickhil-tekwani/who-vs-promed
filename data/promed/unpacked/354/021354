Taiwan said on Friday it had destroyed 134 cattle suspected of being
infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and ordered island-wide
vaccination of some 600 000 cloven-hoofed animals to try to stop the deadly
disease.
Council of Agriculture officials said the destroyed cattle included 132
milk cows and 2 farm cows at 2 southern feedlots. It was the first reported
outbreak since July 1999, when the council slaughtered 158 cows suspected
of infection.
Council officials dismissed worries the deadly virus could attack humans
through milk consumption, saying there was no risk in drinking milk or
eating other dairy products.
They said owners of the feedlots in the southwestern county of Yunlin
reported in mid-January some of their cattle bore the symptoms of FMD, and
after inspection, agriculture experts found at 2 cows which had developed
full-blown cases of the disease.
The cattle were found to have been attacked by the so-called "Jinmen
O-Type" virus, they said. Unlike the "Taiwan O-Type", which only attacks
hogs and develop full-blown symptoms in 2 or 3 days, "Jinmen O-Type" can
spread to other hoofed animals and stay in the infected animals for 3 years
before killing them, health officials said. The virus would not attack
people, they said.
