[After circulating in countries in Asia, H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A was introduced into Europe during the winter of 2014-15. During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged.

Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 the European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds.

Mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) have been naturally infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 and H5N8, with similar pathological consequences. - Mod.PMB
