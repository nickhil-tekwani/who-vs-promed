A total of 4 people died and more than 70 others were hospitalized as a result of anthrax or anthrax outbreaks in Momba district, southwestern Tanzania, a local health official said Thursday [10 Jan 2019]. Anno Maseta, a doctor in Momba district, confirmed that 78 Nzoka patients had been infected with the disease and that 4 of them had died. "So far, 4 people have died from bacterial disease; the remaining 74 are receiving treatment," he said.

According to Juma Irando, District Commissioner of Momba, the district management is currently working on measures to combat the anthrax epidemic, a highly infectious and deadly bacterial disease in mammals, particularly cattle and sheep, causing cutaneous ulcers or a form of pneumonia. Some patients, admitted to the Nzoka village dispensary in the district, confirmed that they had eaten meat from a dead cow that had been the victim of the disease. [SS], one of the people with the disease, said, "I started to feel bad just hours after eating meat and the doctors confirmed that I had anthrax."

[Songwe region is a region of Tanzania created on 29 Jan 2016 from the western half of Mbeya region. Its capital is Vwawa. It is divided into the town of Tunduma and the districts of Ileje, Mbozi, Momba and Songwe. It is in southwestern Tanzania and abuts Malawi. Isongole is the main entry point into Malawi. The East African Rift runs through the region. See Wikipedia for map of the area: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwe_Region.

The young man interviewed, SS, is lucky to have survived. The onset of gastroenteric anthrax is quick -- it can be just a few hours after consuming the contaminated meal -- and then kills before a diagnosis can be made. The disease is mainly seen in the national parks: For example, in the past 3 years, 2015-2017, there have been 11 outbreaks in Arusha, 3 in Kilimanjaro and a multiple hippo outbreak in Iringa, with single outbreaks in Dodoma (16 cattle) and Pwani (one pig). The sporadic rural nature of the disease means that it is poorly appreciated and stupid mistakes are made, such as this butchering and sharing of a sick cow. - Mod.MHJ
