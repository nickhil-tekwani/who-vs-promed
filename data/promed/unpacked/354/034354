Unknown Epidemic Kills 56 People in Angola
------------------------------------------
The deaths of 2 nurses working at the same Huige province hospital from an
unknown illness has generated World Health Organization (WHO) interest, as
56 people have died in Angola with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks.
The issue took on nation-wide proportions with the news that a nurse died
from the same symptoms during the funeral of her colleague.
A medical source from Huige hospital told journalists they have termed this
illness gastric hemorrhage. It begins with fever symptoms for 2 days and
then the patient begins to cough up blood, falls into a coma, and dies
within 4 days, he explained.
The source stressed the WHO has already shown interest in this rare illness
that "we don"t know how to face."
Local radio stations urged the population in the region to take extreme food
and hygiene precautions as the factors that triggered the epidemic are still
unknown.

[The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic fever in Angola would include
more "common" etiologies such as leptospirosis, yellow fever, malaria,
Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever and dengue among others.
The more "exotic" viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, Lassa & Marburg
have not been reported from Angola. In December 1995, ProMED-mail reported
suspected cases of Ebola virus infection in Angola which, according to the
21 Dec 1995 posting (see below Ebola - Africa 19951221.1305) "Regarding
Angola, results were also negative for a series of viruses, including Ebola
and haemorrhagic fever." Hence, a definitive diagnosis was not given at that
time.
In 2003 (see refs below) there was a suspected case of hemorrhagic fever in
an individual with history of onset of illness and travel including Zimbabwe
and Angola (the 2 postings had conflicting stories as to whether it was an
Angolan travelling to Zimbabwe or a Zimbabwean travelling to Angola); again
the results of testing ruled out the presence of the known viral hemorrhagic
fever agents. "The samples tested negative for [several haemorrhagic fever
viruses; including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever virus and Rift Valley fever virus],"
In 2001 there was a report of undiagnosed deaths in a hospital in Luanda,
the etiology of which is still not known to us at ProMED-mail.
As a geographical reminder, while the viral hemorrhagic fevers such as
Ebola, Lassa & Marburg have not been reported from Angola, Lassa fever is
endemic in West Africa to the north of Angola, Ebola has recurrently
appeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the
Congo to the north of Angola, and Marburg was reported in backpackers
travelling through Zimbabwe to the southeast of Angola.
The above newswire is highly suggestive that this unknown illness may have a
nosocomial aspect to it with the report of the deaths of 2 nurses caring for
patients with this disease. As a reminder, the viral hemorrhagic fevers
have been notorious for enhanced nosocomial transmission as the practice
of "universal precautions" in these areas is hampered by lack of supplies
such as gloves, masks and other barrier methods that protect health care
workers from possible infectious body fluids of patients.
More information on this outbreak and results of epidemiologic and
laboratory investigations would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
