An illness that has been decimating US honeybees for more than 3 years
probably isn't caused by a single virus, but by multiple viruses that
wear down the bees' ability to produce proteins that can guard them
against infection, according to a new study.

"We may not have the smoking gun," University of Illinois entomologist
May Berenbaum, the study's main author, told The Scientist, but "we
found the bullet hole."

Cells taken from bees that had succumbed to colony collapse disorder
(CCD) were cluttered with ribosomal RNA fragments, suggesting that the
bees had trouble translating genetic material into functional
proteins, Berenbaum and her colleagues report today (24 Aug 2009) in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"This is an elegant piece of work that weaves together data on host
gene expression, microflora and observations of others into a coherent
and compelling story," W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University researcher
who was not involved with the study, wrote in an email to The Scientist.

Berenbaum and colleagues at the US Department of Agriculture screened
thousands of transcripts in the guts of bees from both healthy and
CCD-stricken colonies from the east and west coasts of the US.

CCD bees had several unusual RNA fragments resulting from broken,
malfunctioning ribosomes. Multiple infections with a family of viruses
called the picorna-like viruses, which seem to especially afflict CCD
bees, could cause the appearance of such RNA fragments as they
overwhelmed ribosomes and limited the cells' ability to manufacture
functioning proteins. Bees that are not able to make proteins cannot
mount effective responses to viral or bacterial infection or respond
to dietary shortages, Berenbaum said.

Although the study didn't uncover a single cause for CCD, said Dan
Weaver, a Texas-based apiculturist who was not involved with the
research, it "provides some hints and suggestive evidence that maybe
there's a general impairment of bees' ability to cope with pathogens
at a basic regulatory step."

Berenbaum said that CCD may not be the result of one particular
pathogen or environmental factor, but rather may occur when multiple
viral infections overwhelm the bees' translational machinery. Bees may
be able to handle one or 2 viral infections simultaneously, but not 3
or 4. "You can recover from a gunshot wound," Berenbaum said, "unless
someone is kicking you in the head at the same time."

While apiculturists like Weaver would rather have a single pathogenic
cause of CCD in hand, the disorder, which has caused widespread bee
mortalities in the US since 2006, appears to be more complex than
that. "It would be better if we had more definitive evidence of what
exactly is going on," Weaver said. "I think that would be everyone's
fervent hope. But so far, that hasn't materialized."

Berenbaum's study does, however, rule out some of the previously
suggested theories for the cause of CCD. For example, the screen
failed to turn up elevated expression of pesticide response genes in
CCD bees. "The pattern we saw was inconsistent with pesticides as a
cause," said Berenbaum, adding that this will probably not stop some
in the honeybee business from blaming pesticide manufacturers for the
disorder [Germany, among others have banned some pesticides to protect
the bees. - Mod.TG]. Interestingly, the screen also failed to find
increased expression of immune response genes, suggesting that the
bees were not able to mount effective responses to the pathogens
attacking their colonies.

In addition to the ribosomal RNA fragments, Berenbaum's screen
revealed a suite of other transcripts, at least one of which resulted
from viral infection, which corresponded to CCD. Berenbaum said that
she hopes researchers can use these characteristic transcripts and
ribosomal RNA fragments to develop a way to rapidly identify bees
struck with CCD. "At the very least, we have markers that we think are
a reliable and objective indicator of CCD," she said. "Ultimately, we
can have a quick assay that would allow a more objective analysis of
CCD."

Weaver welcomed the idea, but lamented the pace at which scientists
are able to fully understand CCD. "I'm happy that we're making
progress," he said. "It's just painfully slow."

[While the research is exciting, and we may be on the path to
protecting the bees, it is difficult to understand how the scientists
knew the DNA they were working with was from a CCD bee and not a bee
that was deceased from other causes. - Mod.TG]
