The Turkish livestock industry, recently on the agenda because of price
hikes in meat imports, is now facing further difficulties in containing
foot and mouth disease (FMD). FMD, a highly contagious disease, has been
diagnosed in more than 700 areas all around Turkey since the beginning of
the year [2010]. Due to this situation, livestock markets, where animals
are bought and sold, are being closed one after another. In the last 3
months, the livestock markets in nearly 40 areas have brought down their
shutters because of FMD. The damage the disease is wreaking on the
livestock sector can now be expressed in terms of millions of Turkish Liras.

According to data from Turkey's FMD Institute, operating under the auspices
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, FMD has already caused a
15 per cent to 20 per cent loss of efficiency in the dairy industry and a
10 per cent loss in the meat industry, in addition to the deaths of animals.

Breeders, already concerned over meat imports, said animal sales have
halted since the spread of FMD and many markets have begun to close, adding
that the problem is intensifying immediately before the Feast of the
Sacrifice, or Kurban Bayrami as it is known in Turkey. Mustafa Demir, head
of the Turkey's Red Meat Producers Union, said producers can not find
livestock because of the disease, adding that he is visiting the plateaus
of Ardahan, a northeastern city, to find animals. Current vaccinations
against FMD have not solved the problem because the virus mutates, Demir said.

FMD has been seen in more than 700 areas in Turkey, representing an
increase of 300 per cent compared with the same time last year [2009], said
Saban Aydemir, general coordinator of the Turkish Veterinary Medical
Association, or TVHB. Noting that FMD is also seen in large farms, as well
as livestock markets and villages, Aydemir said: "Most large farms hide the
existence of the disease as they are trying to protect their commercial
standing. Provincial Agriculture Directorate teams are aware of the
existence of the disease, but they do not want to highlight the quarantine
implementations."

Turkey has spent nearly 45 million euros [USD 57 million] in the struggle
against FMD so far, said Tahsin Yesildere, head of the Istanbul Chamber of
Veterinary Surgeons, or IVHO. "But the disease could not be removed, as we
were not able to get to the root of the problem," he said.

Even though the FMD has been seen in many parts of the country, the issue
has returned to the agenda after Vural Gorener, the founder of Banvit, a
leading poultry company based in Bandirma in the northwestern province of
Balikesir, said: "There is not even one village from Edirne to Kars that
does not have FMD."

disease in a country where FMD is endemic. It also demonstrates the hazard
to neighbouring countries, particularly in Europe, where FMD vaccination is
not practised. - Mod.AS
