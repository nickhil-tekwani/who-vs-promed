As of 12 Noon today, 29 Jun 2015 there have been a total of:
1041 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
460 deaths
577 recoveries, and
4 currently active cases

In the past 24 hours there has been
1 newly confirmed case
0 newly reported deaths
0 newly reported recoveries

[the reported case fatality rate is 44.2 percent]

[This is now the 2nd presumably sporadic case of MERS-CoV infection in individuals in Riyadh. The previously reported cases in Riyadh were reported on 14 Jun 2015, 5 Jun 2015, 18 May 2015, and 4 cases reported on 11 May 2015. All 7 cases had denied a history of contact with other cases, 2 reported contact with camels and ingestion of camel's milk. Hence, of the 9 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Riyadh since the beginning of May 2015, 7 would be considered sporadic cases. All but one of the cases gave a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, it would be of interest to know if they sought medical attention for their pre-existing co-morbidities during the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

It is also noteworthy to mention that there have not been reports of newly confirmed cases in Hufoof for the past 4 days -- 24 more days of no newly confirmed cases in Hufoof and transmission will be considered interrupted.

Omani man now free of MERS virus
-------------------------
The 75-year-old Omani man who was being treated at a hospital in Thailand after contracting Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has been declared free of the deadly virus, the Public Health Ministry said on Sunday [28 Jun 2015].

Acting permanent secretary Surachet Satitramai said the latest test on the man found no sign of the virus and his condition had improved, although he still could not walk.

The Omani man is the only confirmed Mers case in Thailand and was treated for the infectious disease at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi, where his condition was described as "satisfactory", according to Dr Surachet.

His condition has improved considerably, with better kidney function and increased lung capacity.

The man arrived on [15 Jun 2015] for treatment of his heart condition at Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok. His MERS-CoV infection was confirmed on [18 Jun 2015].

When asked if he would be allowed to move to a recovery room to continue receiving heart treatment, Dr Surachet said: "I have no idea about the man's treatment plan."

Prasert Thongcharoen, a virologist who serves as an adviser to the Disease Control Department, said doctors and health personnel from leading medical universities will meet today to discuss the man's condition and whether he can leave a special treatment room and move to a recovery room.

Three relatives of the Omani man and 156 others considered at high risk of contracting Mers who have been quarantined are in normal health, Dr Prasert said. They will continue to be monitored as part of a 14-day quarantine until Thursday [2 Jul 2015], he added.

20 people in contact with MERS patient get all-clear
------------------------------------------------------------
More than half of the 36 people who had close contact with the only confirmed MERS patient in Thailand left state-run medical facilities Monday [29 Jun 2015] after being given the all clear following a 14-day observation period.

The confirmed MERS patient, a 75-year-old man from Oman, is recovering.

The 36 people quarantined either sat near the Omani man on a flight to Thailand, are medical workers or taxi drivers.

"We managed to track down all 36 people with a high risk [of contracting the deadly disease]. Lab tests and surveillance show they have not got MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome," Public Health Minister Dr Rajata Rajatanavin said Monday [29 Jun 2015].
