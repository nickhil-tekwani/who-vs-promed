Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections linked to fresh express sunflower crisp chopped salad kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. This investigation includes illnesses in Canada recently reported by the Public Health Agency of Canada. This outbreak is caused by a different strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 than the current outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from the Salinas, California, [USA] growing region.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people in the USA and Canada are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 9 Dec 2019, a total of 8 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 3 states.

State / Ill people
------------------
Minnesota / 4
North Dakota / 1
Wisconsin / 3
----------------
Total 8

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 5 Nov 2019, to 15 Nov 2019. Ill people range in age from 21 to 91, with a median age of 32. Among ill people, 63% are female. 3 of the 8 ill people have been hospitalized, including one person who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Information collected to date indicates that Fresh Express Sunflower Crisp chopped salad kits are a likely source of this outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started. Of 7 ill people with information available, all seven (100%) reported eating any leafy green in the week before their illness started. 6 ill people reported eating or maybe eating a Fresh Express Sunflower Crisp chopped salad kit.

The investigation is ongoing to determine which ingredient in the salad was contaminated. Romaine lettuce is one of the ingredients in the salad kit, but we do not know yet if this outbreak is related to a current outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from the Salinas, California, growing region. Preliminary information indicates that romaine lettuce in the salad kits eaten by some of the sick people likely came from the Salinas growing region. CDC is concerned that these kits may still be in some homes. If you have any of these salad kits in your home, throw them away.

CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

Public Health notice: Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections linked to Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why you should take note
------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _E. coli_ infections occurring across 5 eastern provinces. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to PHAC.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Many of the individuals who became sick reported having eaten Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits before their illnesses occurred. The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that additional sources could be identified.

On 8 Dec 2019, the CFIA issued a food recall warning [https://inspection.gc.ca/eng/1575846136193/1575846136974] for Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Kit, 315g packages, UPC Code: 0 71279 30906 4, beginning with lot code Z. These products have a best before date up to and including 07DE19 and were sold in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

For more information on the recalled product, please consult the CFIA's website [https://inspection.gc.ca/eng/1575846136193/1575846136974].

Canadians are advised not to eat the recalled product or any Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits sold in 315g packages, UPC 0 71279 30906 4, beginning with lot code Z, and best before date up to and including 07DEC19. Retailers and food service establishments are advised not to sell or serve these products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using these products.

The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If additional products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary
---------------------
As of 8 Dec 2019, there are 16 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 illness linked to this outbreak in the following provinces: Ontario (10), Quebec (1), New Brunswick (3), Nova Scotia (1), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1). Individuals became sick between 5 Nov and 22 Nov 2019. 4 individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 11 and 73 years of age. The majority of cases (62%) are female.

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated because of an increase in reports of _E. coli_ O157 illnesses.

Who is most at risk
-------------------
_E. coli_ O157 is more likely to cause severe illness than other strains of _E. coli_. Pregnant women, those with weakened immune systems, young children, and older adults are most at risk for developing serious complications.

Most people who become ill from an _E. coli_ infection will recover completely on their own. However, some people may have a more serious illness that requires hospital care or causes long-lasting health effects. In rare cases, some individuals may develop life-threatening complications, including stroke, kidney failure and seizures, which could result in death. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

What you should do to protect your health
-----------------------------------------
Check to see if you have any Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits in your home. If you do, follow this advice:
- do not to eat recalled products or any Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits sold in 315g packages, UPC 0 71279 30906 4, beginning with lot code Z, and a best before date up to and including 07DEC19;
- throw these products out immediately and properly wash and sanitize any containers that were used to store these products before using them again;
- if you have any Fresh Express brand Sunflower Crisp Chopped Salad Kits without the original packaging and are unsure of whether these products are included in this advice, do not eat them. Throw them away just to be safe;
- wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds immediately following contact with any of the recalled products;
- do not prepare food for other people if you think you are sick with an _E. coli_ infection or suffering from any other contagious illness causing diarrhea.

What the Government of Canada is doing
--------------------------------------
The Government of Canada is committed to food safety. The Public Health Agency of Canada leads the human health investigation into an outbreak, and is in regular contact with its federal, provincial, and territorial partners to monitor the situation and to collaborate on steps to address an outbreak.

Health Canada provides food-related health risk assessments to determine whether the presence of a certain substance or microorganism poses a health risk to consumers. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducts food safety investigations into the possible food source of an outbreak. The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians as new information related to this investigation becomes available.

This ongoing outbreak of EHEC O157 appears to be a different O157 organism than the recent one and is involving both the USA and Canada. It remains unclear what ingredient in the salad packages will be implicated. - Mod.LL]
