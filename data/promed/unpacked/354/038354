Meningitis, meningococcal - New Zealand (03) (not yet archived)]
The vaccine referred to by Dr. Werthein is an outer membrane protein vaccine.
It has been tested in Cuba, Chile, and Norway (not Iceland). The Norwegian
field trial reduced the incidence of group B disease among school children by
only 53% (Lancet 1991;338:1093). Results were somewhat better in Chile and
Cuba. However, the outer membrane protein vaccine is serotype specific so
that its utility in New Zealand would depend on the serotype responsible for
disease there.
[It is stated to be type B, see: 970708204915 - Mod.JW]
