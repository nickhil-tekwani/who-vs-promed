Summary
- ENE-Covid19 is a comprehensive longitudinal study of population-based sero-epidemiology, whose objectives are to estimate the prevalence of infection by SARS Cov2 by determining antibodies against the virus in Spain and evaluating its temporal evolution. The results presented today [Thu 2 Jul 2020], for the 2nd round, refer to the reading of the IgG band of the rapid test.
- In the ENE-Covid second round (18 May to 1 Jun 2020), 63 564 participants were recruited in the national sample and 3355 in the island-specific study, not included in this report. The participation rate among eligible individuals has been 66.5% (improving the 1st round 63.7%), and considering only the people who have been contacted reaches 76.1% (it also represents an improvement of 2 points compared to observed in the 1st round: 74.9%).
- The improvement in the participation rate reflects, on the one hand, a high adherence to the study (95% of the participants of the 1st round have accepted to participate in the 2nd) and the incorporation of 5847 participants who were not present in round 1. As many as 87.9% of the participants have agreed to provide a blood sample (55 854 samples in the national study and 3106 more in the island-specific study) .
- The estimated prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov2 in Spain is 5.2% (95% CI: 4.9%-5.5%). Slightly lower for men 5% (95% CI: 4.6% -5.4%) than women for 5.4% (95% CI: 5.0% -5.8%). In relation to age, the prevalence is lower in babies, children and young people, with moderate differences in it among the rest of the older groups. In relation to the diagnosis or COVID19 by PCR, 80.5% of the participants who reported having had a PCR + more than 2 weeks ago presented IgG antibodies.
- In possible suspected cases, the prevalence increases with the number of symptoms and is particularly high in those who report anosmia (40%). 2.8% of the participants without any symptoms presented IgG antibodies, which implies that about one 33% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic.
- Although the national prevalence is 5.2%, there is a marked geographic variability similar to that observed in round 1. In the provincial maps the central grouping stands out again of provinces with prevalences equal to or close to 10% in the Madrid environment. In relation to participants from round 1, initially negative and who have converted, the overall percentage is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% -0.9%), highlighting a percentage close to 2% in √Åvila, Valladolid and Palencia, and 1.5% in Madrid, Soria and Gerona.
- In relation to the municipal size, we observed very similar prevalences to the 1st round in all cases, except for a slight increase in the large cities (more than 100,000 inhabitants) that have gone from a prevalence of 6.4% (95% CI: 5.8-7.1) to 6.8% (95% CI: 6.2-7.4).
- The map of possible cases with COVID19 symptoms in the last 2 weeks (people with 3 or more symptoms compatible with COVID19 or with sudden loss of smell) shows lower prevalences than those observed in the 1st round. Only the provinces of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Granada, Madrid, Toledo and Las Palmas are around 1%.
- These results must be considered provisional since they do not have the information that will provide the determination of IgG anti SARS-CoV2 antibodies measured by immunoassay.
- This study is the result of the effort of many professionals and the trust and generosity of more than 60 000 participants who have understood the interest of providing time, information and samples to learn about the situation of the COVID19 epidemic in our country.
- The chosen rapid test (Orient GeneIgM / IgG, from the company ZhejiangOrient Gene Biotech) has, according to the manufacturer, a sensitivity of 88% and 97% to determine IgM and IgG respectively, and a specificity of 100%. In reliability studies carried out for ENE-Covid19, a sensitivity of 73% and 79% respectively for IgM or IgG, with a specificity of 98% for IgM and 100% for IgG, was reported.
- The study also includes an epidemiological survey with background information and symptoms related to Covid19. In the report we used as a definition of a possible case of COVID19 the concurrence of 3 or more symptoms described in COVID19 patients or the sudden presence of anosmia. A recent case of COVID19 is considered to be a person who reports the presence of these symptoms in the last 2 weeks.

[ENE-Covid19 is a large population-based sero-epidemiological longitudinal study, whose objectives are to estimate the prevalence of SARS-Cov2 infection by determining antibodies against the virus in Spain, in each of the Autonomous Communities and in each province. , providing information by age and sex, and assessing changes in prevalence over three separate waves over time.
This report includes preliminary results obtained in the second round of the study, which has taken place in the 2 weeks between 18 May [2020] and 1 Jun [2020]. To facilitate comparison with round 1, the results of that round are included in the tables.
There are detailed tables on the data analysis as well as Figures on the provincial map of IgG anti SARS-CoV2 Antibodies in round 2 and provincial map of participants with sero-conversion against SARS-CoV2 in round 2 (IgG-round 1 and IgG + round 2). As more and more planned sero-prevalence studies area conducted in the effected countries , much needed information on the immune response to COVID-19 in exposed populations will become available, thereby guiding control measures including vaccination strategies-Mod.UBA]

[2] FDA: EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) for Antigen diagnostic test
Date: Mon 6 Jul 2020
Source: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) press announcement [edited, abridged]
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issued-emergency-use-authorization-point-care-antigen-test


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a COVID-19 antigen diagnostic test, the BD (Becton Dickinson) Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2. This is the 2nd antigen test the FDA has authorized for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This test is authorized for use in laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) for high, moderate, or waived complexity testing, meaning it can be used in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation. Emergency use of this test is limited to authorized laboratories using the BD Veritor Plus Analyzer Instrument.

"Expanding America's testing capabilities is the result of partnership and ingenuity between the federal government, private sector and academia. Today's authorization is another achievement of that work. Antigen tests play an important role in the overall response against COVID-19, including as a point-of-care test that can potentially scale up to test millions of Americans quickly," said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. ...

[The 8 new confirmed cases in the last 24 hours were all imported and no cases were reported from Beijing. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 6 Jul 2020, there have been 336 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 6 in Liaoning (2 new cases in last 24 hours), most likely associated with this outbreak. Other provinces including Sichuan Guangdong and Inner Mongolia autonomous region also warrant monitoring.

There were 15 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and 2 new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 36 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 17 new cases. According to a press release, the newly reported cases announced today [6 Jul 2020] involve 12 males and 5 females aged between 3 and 78. Except for the 1283rd case, all had travel history during the incubation period. The webpage mentions a total 1286 cases [1285 confirmed and one probable case] https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/06/P2020070600681.htm.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2; many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 44 cases with 1 new death, compared with 48 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (5 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 84 consecutive days. There were 20 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (7), Gwangju (6), Seoul (3), Incheon (2), and Daejeon (2), and 24 imported cases -- airport quarantine (16), Gyeonggi (6), Jeollabuk (1), and Deagu (1). There were 10 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/.

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 63 newly confirmed cases from 5 Jul 2020 are available at the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 419 and 420. There are analyses of the country-wide situation including the newly confirmed cases and listings of current ongoing clusters. A total of 3 of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, 1 related to an elementary school, 1 related to an office building, 1 related to a nursing home, 1 related to an apartment complex and 1 linked to a Sauna facility.

The (presumed) location of infection acquisition of the 24 new imported cases are: America (6), Europe (1), and Asia excluding China (17) (Kazakhstan=13; Philippines=3; Pakistan=1).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from previous 3 day's message).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +137 cases and +30 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (4 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +400 cases and +15 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (53); Emilia-Romagna (31), Tuscany (19) and Veneto (14) are the 4 provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 62 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 46 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran rose to 243 051 on Monday [6 Jul 2020]. Meanwhile, Qatar's infections crossed the major threshold of 100 000.

Iran, the hardest-hit country by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East region, reported 2613 new cases, bringing the total number of infections to 243 051. The pandemic has so far claimed the lives of 11 731 Iranians, up by 160 in the past 24 hours. A total of 204 083 coronavirus patients have recovered, with 3201 still in critical condition.

Iran has reintroduced some restrictions to parts of the country amid the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, including shutting down libraries for at least one week in the capital Tehran. Sports clubs and complexes, ceremony halls and cinemas in high-risk zones were also closed again for at least one week.

[As of 6 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 243 051, including 11 731 deaths, an increase of 2613 cases and 160 deaths since 5 Jul 2020. The numbers of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing.

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths. And the need to re-implement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 040 833, including 132 979 deaths, an increase from 2 982 928 cases and 132 569 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 214 371 cases as of 13:30 EDT (GMT-4) on 5 Jul 2020 (+519 from 5 Jul 2020), including 18 611 confirmed deaths (+28 since 5 Jul 2020) and an additional 4607 probable deaths https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page.

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Washington, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but one of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 882 to 14 210.

A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 38% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive tests out of 37 258 821 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been a consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 60.6% of the global newly reported cases and 60.1% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 46.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 30.8%, Mexico 5.6%, Colombia 3.2%, Chile 2.9%, Peru 2.8%, and Argentina 2.1%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2; while they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, this week the USA has dominated with the proportion represented by Brazil decreasing. Other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region such as Mexico, Peru and periodically Chile, Colombia, and Argentina.

The European region reported 8.4% of the global newly reported cases and 8.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 39.0% of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.2%, Ukraine 8.0%, Turkey 6.7%, Israel 4.7%, Kyrgyzstan 3.5%, UK 3.0%, Azerbaijan 3.1%, Romania 2.3%, and Armenia 1.9%. The case numbers for France, Spain, and Sweden are not available in today's [6 Jul 2020] update. The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8.6% of the global newly reported cases and 11.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 20.3% of the regional newly reported cases followed Pakistan by 19.0%, Iran 14.5%, Iraq 12.1%, Egypt 6.9%, Oman 6.1%, UAE 3.8 %, and Kuwait 3.6%. Multiple countries are very active in the region, the same countries with some changes in the order since yesterday (5 Jul 2020); Egypt moved to number 5 in the daily case numbers.

The African region reported 6.5% of the global newly reported cases and 5.5% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 66.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon 10.8%, Ghana 5.3%, Nigeria 4.1%, Algeria 3.3%, Kenya 2.3%, Madagascar 1.6% and Mauritania 1.3%. South Africa and Nigeria (surpassed by Cameroon in last 24 hours) are usually numbers 1 and 2, and other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day. Of note is that South Africa is now reporting over 8000 cases in last 24 hours.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.19% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 81.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 8.5%, Singapore 4.5%, Australia 2.9%, South Korea 1.5%, and China 0.47%. The Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases with Japan at number 2. Other countries, including Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 14.3% of the global newly reported cases and 13.6% of global deaths. India reported 83.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 9.4%, Indonesia 5.5%, and Nepal 1.0%, the same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. The Africa region is slowly increasing their representation in terms of increased case reporting.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 6 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
[In the table above, NA is "not applicable;" those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 11 733 222, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 3.04 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.9% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.62 million cases represents 13.8% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as India, Mexico, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Spain), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.9%). A global total of 540 140 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6752 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, Peru, Spain, Chile, the UK, Mexico and Iran at number 10. China remains at number 22. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Colombia, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 3171 to 50 586.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region unchanged for the past 5 days. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 each from the African and Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.UBA]
