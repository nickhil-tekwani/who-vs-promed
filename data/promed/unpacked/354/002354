[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 307 037, with 81 054 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 225 983 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 187 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 31 250 cases when compared with the data on 20 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 6557 of the newly reported cases, the USA for 6590 cases, and Spain for 3986 of newly reported cases, The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 73.6% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA is accelerating rapidly as more testing has become available. A global total of 13 069 deaths have been reported, 9808 outside mainland China.

For the 24th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by mainland China. Mainland China went 3 days without any locally transmitted cases until today (21 Mar 2020) when there was a positive case associated with contact with an imported case; South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering in the 100 plus or minus 50 cases. Cases in the USA are escalating very rapidly and Europe's rise is equally daunting. It would be interesting to see an epidemic curve by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

[The big news, this is now day 4 with no newly confirmed, locally acquired cases in Wuhan or Hubei province, China in the past 24 hours, but there is a mysterious single case that was reported from outside of Hubei. There are 46 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours, 45 of whom are importations from overseas travel, but there is one addition with no information provided. A media report (http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202003/22/WS5e76c9cfa310128217280fca.html) mentions that the case was from Guangdong province and was epidemiologically linked to a recent imported case. The location of origin of the original imported case was not specified, but the imported cases from 21 Mar 2020 came from UK, Thailand, Spain, France, the Philippines, and Turkey.

According to the report above, a total of 81 054 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 46 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (20 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 6 deaths were reported, 5 (83.3%) of them in Hubei province. 48 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. Macau reported no additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Of the 46 newly confirmed cases, 45 were imported cases into China representing 97.8% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Guangdong (7), Beijing (13), Shanghai (14), Fujian (4), 2 each in Jiangsu, and one each in Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Sichuan, bringing the total number of imported cases to 314.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 98 cases and 2 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (20-21 Mar 2020) when there were 147 newly confirmed cases. Over the past few days, the case count has oscillated from below to above 100 newly confirmed cases per day Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 72.1% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 14.1% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, Daegu reported 43.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Gyeonggi with 16.3% of the newly confirmed cases. Looking at the graphics on the English language website from 22 Mar 2020, one can see how the cumulative curve of reported cases seems to be approaching a plateau In Daegu and to a slightly lesser extent in Gyeongbuk, but is still very much continuing a fairly rapid daily climb in Seoul and Gyeonggi (see https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030 for tables and graphs. There is a table showing the age specific fatality ratios, showing similar data with what was seen in China. Ages 80 and older had a 10.5% fatality ratio; 70-79, 6.2%; 60-69, 1.5%; 50-59, 0.4%; 40-49, 0.1%; and 30-39, 0.1%. There were no reported deaths in the 0-29 year olds, with almost 2400 confirmed cases in the 20-29 year old age group.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases coming from Europe (and I would suspect they are beginning to notice a similar trend in people coming from the USA). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. Obvious concerns re: initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 53 578 cases, including 4825 deaths, up from 47 021 cases and 4032 deaths reported on 20 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 20 and 21 Mar 2020 was 6557 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5986 newly confirmed cases between 19 and 20 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (25 515), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (6705), and Venice (4617), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 69.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 20 610 cases, 1556 deaths

Iran's death toll from the coronavirus [COVID-19] outbreak rose by more than 100 to 1556 on Saturday [21 Mar 2020] and the total number of people infected now exceeds 20 000, a health ministry official said.

Iran, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic outside China, had on Friday [20 Mar 2020] reported a death toll of 1433 and a total number of confirmed infections of 19 644.

The total number of people diagnosed with the disease stood at 20 610 on Saturday [21 Mar 2020], health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state TV. Jahanpur warned that coronavirus cases would rise steeply unless people refrain from traveling during the 2-week Iranian New Year holiday, which started yesterday [20 Mar 2020].

"If people take it lightly and think that the coronavirus outbreak is over, and if urban and inter-city traffic and gatherings in resorts and natural parks increase ... then in 1 to 2 weeks we will see a new peak of the disease," he said according to the semi-official ISNA [Iranian Students News Agency] news agency.

President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday [21 Mar 2020] that social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak, including travel restrictions, will apply for only 2 to 3 weeks, expecting the crisis to ease by then. Iran "has to do everything necessary to return economic production to normal," he said in comments broadcast on state TV. He also accused "counter-revolutionaries" of plotting to shut down economic production.

[In the 24 hours from 20 to 21 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 19 644 to 20 610 an increase of 966 newly confirmed cases but 21.9% less than in the previous 24 hours (1237). The number of deaths has also increased from 1433 to 1556 an increase of 123 deaths in the 24 hour period, a 17.4% decrease in daily deaths reported from the previous 24 hours (149). It is a 1st observation, but we can hope this is a starting trend.

As I mentioned yesterday (21 Mar 2020), the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus.

Overview
--------
The US Health Weather Map is a visualization of seasonal illness linked to fever -- specifically influenza-like illness. The aggregate, anonymized data visualized here is a product of Kinsa's network of Smart Thermometers and the accompanying mobile applications. Kinsa is providing this map and associated charts as a public service.

The map shows 2 key data points: (1) the illness levels we are currently observing, and (2) the degree to which those levels are higher than the typical levels we expect to see at this point in the flu season. (Details on how we calculate this are available in our technical approach document.) We believe this latter data point -- which we're calling "atypical illness", may in some cases be connected to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note: We are not stating that this data represent COVID-19 activity. However, we would expect to pick up higher-than-anticipated levels of flu-like symptoms in our data in areas where the pandemic is affecting large numbers of people. Taken together with other data points, we believe this data may be a helpful early indicator of where and how quickly the virus is spreading.

[Our thanks to William Coxe Jr for sharing this link with us. A visualization using ILI (influenza-like illness) surveillance data as a surrogate means of following atypical ILI activity. In checking the daily reports by country, the USA started reporting more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.

Comparing this map with the map put out by Florida today (21 Mar 2020) https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-florida-coronavirus-cases-by-the-numbers-20200320-4dnircjpyjbl5g44ihlep6dpou-htmlstory.html#nt=standard-embed, I looked at Polk County (inland from Pinellas county on the Gulf Coast, midway up the state), the US Health Weather map identifies Polk county as having had an outbreak of atypical ILI, currently 3% above expected rates, with an increase starting around 4 Mar 2020, peaking on 19 Mar 2020, and dropping off precipitously since 19 Mar 2020. In contrast the Florida state statistics show 10 positive tests out of 171 specimens received, with 21 still pending. What isn't available is the date of the specimens and the date of onset of illness of people who submitted specimens for testing to compare and see if there may have been a "missed" outbreak when testing wasn't available. - Mod.MPP]

[6] USA FDA approves point of care test
Date: Sat 21 Mar 2020
Source: Washington Post [abridged, edited]

The Food and Drug Administration late Friday [20 Mar 2020] approved the 1st coronavirus test that can be conducted entirely at the point of care for a patient -- and deliver results in 45 minutes. The FDA granted "emergency use authorization" to Cepheid, a California company that makes a rapid molecular test for the coronavirus. The turnaround time for Cepheid's product is far shorter than for the tests being used, which are typically sent to centralized labs that may not return results for days.

The FDA authorization is for use in "patient care settings," including doctors' offices, but the test initially will be used primarily by hospitals and emergency departments, the company said.

As COVID-19 cases proliferate, fears are growing that hospitals will become overwhelmed by patients seeking tests or care. David Persing, Cepheid's chief medical and technology officer, said in an interview that the test will "help alleviate the pressure" on health-care facilities by helping doctors find out quickly whether a patient has the disease and select the appropriate treatment.

"This is not a test for the worried well," he said, but rather a tool for doctors to quickly assess patients suspected of having COVID-19. The specimen can be collected either by a nasal swab or by a saline wash using a small catheter. Neither is particularly comfortable, but the advantage of the wash is that it doesn't require swabs, which are in short supply, Persing said. "We need alternative collection methods," he added.

To further ease pressure on hospitals, the administration has said it is exploring at-home test kits. But so far, the FDA stressed Friday [20 Mar 2020], it has not approved any testing at home. It warned consumers to avoid "unauthorized, fraudulent" test kits. William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said the newly authorized test could be "extremely helpful" by reducing delays in getting results.

But he said the key to how much benefit a test like this provides depends on "how accurate it is on both positive and the negative" results. The test, like Cepheid's existing strep and flu tests, does not require confirmatory tests, Persing said.

The coronavirus test is designed to operate on the company's automated GeneXpert Systems. There are about 23 000 of those systems throughout the world, of which 5000 are in the United States, according to the company.

The firm plans to begin selling the test at the end of the month [March 2020]. Persing declined to say how many tests initially will be produced but said the goal is to make millions in the next few months.

[A rapid POS (point of service) test is definitively needed globally, given the volume of people presenting for testing and the shortage of tests that have been available.

According to the FDA approved package insert for this test, "The performance of this assay with other specimen types or samples has not been evaluated." Hence the sensitivity and specificity of this test is not known. But the package insert warns to use clinical judgement if the result is negative but the clinical picture is compatible.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Six new countries/territories/areas (African Region [2], European Region [1], Region of the Americas [1], South East Asia Region [1], and Western Pacific Region [1]) have reported cases of COVID-19.

- WHO has updated the case definitions. The full guidance document can be found at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov) and in Case Definitions below.

- WHO regional directors of Europe, the Western Pacific, and Africa called for global solidarity to fight COVID-19. Ensuring international cooperation, investing in health, and engaging communities are keys to effectively tackle the pandemic. The full briefing can be found at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/3/global-solidarity-across-countries-and-continents-needed-to-fight-covid-19.

- Updated technical guidance on critical preparedness, readiness and response; advice on the use of masks; infection prevention and control; and laboratory testing can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance.

- OpenWHO is constantly updating and adding online open courses for COVID19 as a resource for health professionals, decision-makers and the public. As of 20 March, more than 500 000 learners have already enrolled. COVID-19 resources are hosted on 2 learning channels: one for courses in official WHO languages (https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19) and a 2nd for courses in additional national languages (https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19-national-languages).

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [12:00 AM 20 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 266 073 (32 000) / 11 184 (1344)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside `the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 181. This includes 16 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 59 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 9 from the Southeast Asia region, 19 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 44 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 34 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 23 950 new cases and 1101 deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Germany accounting for 30.6% of newly confirmed cases, Italy for 25.0% of newly confirmed cases and Spain for 11.8% of newly confirmed cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. It would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
