The Epidemiological Surveillance of Rio Claro confirmed on Monday afternoon, 24 Nov 2014, a death from spotted fever in the municipality. The victim was 46 years old and was possibly contaminated in the region of the Mata Negra ["Black Forest", near Araras, Sao Paulo state], where he was fishing. The death was registered on 25 Oct 2014.

Blood samples were sent to the Adolfo Lutz Institute, in Sao Paulo, and the result, reported on 19 Nov 2014, confirmed the diagnosis. The possible location of the exposure is near the rural area of the Mata Negra, where there are many capybaras, which are animal hosts of star ticks, the transmitters of the disease.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. The number of non-fatal cases of the infection is not stated for 2014.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
