Citrus Canker Found At UF Research Facility, Will Halt Numerous Experiments
---------------------------------------------------
Citrus canker [CC], one of the most destructive diseases affecting
Florida's $9 billion citrus industry, has been found in a University of
Florida citrus research grove at UF's Indian River Research and Education
Center [IRREC], near Fort Pierce.

The discovery, confirmed Thu [27 Jun 2005] by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, will likely
require officials to destroy all citrus trees in IRREC's groves, halting
all citrus research projects there, said Brian Scully, director of the
center and a professor of horticulture with UF's Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, or UF/IFAS.

According to Scully, "CC, though contained, [it] will take [us] several
years to recover, but ultimately this setback will offer us a fresh start
and improved groves in which to conduct research. However, we will continue
to conduct our collaborative research in commercial groves with the
cooperation of private industry."

The disease, caused by bacteria in the genus _Xanthomonas_, can affect all
citrus varieties, including grapefruit, oranges and tangerines, which are
grown at IRREC, Scully said. Trees affected by the disease develop small
brown lesions on leaves, stems and fruit. CC eventually reduces tree
productivity if left unchecked.

IRREC employees discovered the outbreak during a voluntary grove
inspection, he said. UF/IFAS officials immediately reported the discovery
to the Division of Plant Industry, which is responsible for the state's
Citrus Canker Eradication Program.

UF/IFAS will cooperate fully with DPI to address the situation, said Jimmy
Cheek, UF senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources.
Mapping efforts by the Citrus Canker Eradication Program will establish the
extent of the infection and determine which groves will be affected.

State citrus canker eradication procedures require the destruction of all
infected citrus trees that are found, as well as any citrus trees located
within 1900 feet of infected citrus trees, Scully said. These measures
minimize the risk that the highly contagious disease will spread to other
sites.

Currently, 6 IRREC faculty and their collaborators from other UF/IFAS
facilities are conducting more than 2 dozen experiments in the research
groves, some using trees planted 30 to 50 years ago, he said.

Citrus research efforts at IRREC emphasize plant breeding, entomology,
pathology and virology, soil and water science, plant nutrition and
irrigation and post-harvest physiology, Scully said.

"It is difficult to quantify the loss in terms of time, monetary value and
the potential impact that our research findings have on the statewide
citrus industry," Scully said.

In addition, citrus research programs at the USDA Horticultural Research
Laboratory adjacent to IRREC are vulnerable to the effects of the CC
infection in the IRREC groves, said Harold Browning, statewide coordinator
for UF citrus programs in teaching, research and extension.

Scully believes the disease did not reach IRREC via human activity. "Our
facility has been strictly following the precautions recommended by the
Division of Plant Industry and used by growers," he said.

The bacterium that causes CC can spread on air currents, in rainwater, and
on people, animals, plants and farm equipment, Scully said.

Ongoing canker sanitation and decontamination efforts will be stepped up at
UF's other citrus research units, including the Citrus Research and
Education Center in Lake Alfred and the Southwest Florida Research and
Education Center in Immokalee, said Browning, who directs the Lake Alfred
center.

According to Browning, "there is no reason to suspect that CC would have
reached other IFAS facilities by way of the Indian River Research and
Education Center, thanks to the many safeguards we have in place," Browning
said. "But with canker in many areas of the state, ongoing vigilance is
necessary."

UF/IFAS citrus researchers statewide have been developing plans to react to
a canker find that involved UF/IFAS research plantings, Browning said.

[As Scully states, valuable citrus research material had to be destroyed,
but officials know that new plots will be generated. It is essential that
research and development activities vital to the Florida citrus industry be
maintained to provide improved citrus varieties.
