[Confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection
continue to be sporadic in occurrence. This 7th Chinese case (and 3rd
death) is the 1st human case of H5N1 avian influenza reported from
the southern province of Fujian. In accordance with recent precedent,
it is likely that the diagnosis will be accepted by WHO without
referral to a reference laboratory. The other 6 confirmed Chinese
human cases have been recorded in Anhui (2 cases), Hunan, Guangxi,
Liaoning, and Jiangxi. A map and description of the 34 administrative
regions of China can be accessed at
