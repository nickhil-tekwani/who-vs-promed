This morning I spoke with the owner of the ranch near San Angelo, Texas. He has owned the ranch for barely one year and it seems it had been through multiple owners before he bought it. He knew of no history of anthrax on this ranch.

The outbreak started around 13 Jul 2012 and by a week ago, 27 Jul 2012, he had lost 48 ewes and 2 bucks. He has DorpxCroix hybrid hair sheep. Initially he thought it was due to plant poisoning complicated by intestinal parasites and reacted accordingly and moved the flock into a pen, treated, and handfed them. But deaths continued. He took one carcass to his veterinarian and samples therefrom ended up at College Station where a diagnosis of anthrax was made [and the outbreak defined as involving one sheep.]

He promptly moved the flock out of the pen and onto a distant pasture 2 miles away where they were treated with LA200 and 24 hrs later were vaccinated. There have been no further deaths. He is presently organising the incineration of the carcasses, many of which have been fed upon by vultures. Other than these deaths the sheep are in excellent condition and from what he says maybe a bit fat.

The cause of the outbreak remains unclear. They had had adequate rains from the New Year up until June since when it has been hot and dry. There was an inch or so of rain in the middle of the outbreak. During May and June his neighbour had heavy equipment working the soil in the field adjoining his sheep. Speculatively this had disturbed an old grave and during the dry weather contaminated soil was blown across onto the sheep grazing -- remember, sheep nibble; they don't rip the grass out of the ground like cattle. This would explain the explosive numbers.

The owner necropsied the 1st dead sheep and as a result has 2 inflamed lesions on his right arm; one of which is now black. He confirmed that they itched but were not painful. He is on antibiotics. I advised him to switch to doxycycline.

One thing of many that came out this discussion was that his GP was prescribing 60 days of Cipro for any and everyone who had been on the ranch while the sheep were being moved and the carcasses collected up. This is excessive, to say the least. There is zero risk of pneumonic anthrax when handling sheep carcasses. Cutaneous lesions occur when infected blood gets into a cut or one is bitten by a fly. Washing your hands and face is adequate in most circumstances and 60 days of Cipro can result in medical problems. If a real exposure has occurred or lesions are developing, 10 days of doxycycline does a first class job of cleaning it up.
