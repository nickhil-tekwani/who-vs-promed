The moderators note "The other reports of WNS have not indicated the wing issue. The description here seems different. We will be anxious for the report identifying the cause of the wing discoloration. - Mod.TG]

[The question being raised here is whether this is a manifestation of the WNS not previously described or if this is a different syndrome.

The moderator and editorial decision has been made to keep this report under the ProMED-mail thread of WNS, with concerns about further geographic expansion within North America. - Mod.MPP]"

Wing issues are a well-established element of _Geomyces destructans_ infection. There have been published wing-scoring indices available for several years as researchers noted wing damage early on. In fact, affected animals coming onto rehabilitation or research settings have been observed to suffer severe degradation of wing membranes even if they appear relatively healthy on intake and have no outward signs of fungus. Here is a paper that discusses the action of the fungus and the subsequent wing damage: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/135.
