DENGUE FEVER - AUSTRALIA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) (02): CORRECTION

The cited ABC news report in ProMED-mail posting Dengue fever -
Australia (NT): Mosquito control 20040314.0709 indicates incorrectly
that there is dengue activity in the town of Tennant Creek, Northern
Territory, Australia.
The correct situation is that _Aedes aegypti_ has indeed been
discovered there, and there are efforts being led by Peter Whelan to
eliminate it, but there is no activity of dengue virus/es.
