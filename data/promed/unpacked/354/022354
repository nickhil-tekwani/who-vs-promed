Taiwan's 2nd human case of novel influenza A virus H1N2v has been confirmed in a 7-year-old girl, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said yesterday [6 Dec 2022].

The CDC on Monday [5 Dec 2022] evening issued a news release saying that it received a report in October [2022] about a girl infected with an influenza A virus, but the hospital could not identify the variant. The CDC said it conducted genome sequencing on a sample and determined it to be H1N2v, marking the 2nd case ever found in Taiwan.

The girl -- who lives in central Taiwan -- on 24 Sep 2022 developed a fever, muscle soreness, loss of appetite, coughing and a runny nose, and was taken to a hospital with a high fever on 26 Sep 2022, when she tested negative for COVID-19 but positive for influenza A, Chuang said. A doctor diagnosed the girl as having the flu and prescribed antiviral drugs, Chuang said, adding that she returned home that day and gradually recovered.

H1N2v is a low-pathogenic subtype of swine influenza A virus, which occasionally infects humans, who mostly have mild symptoms, he said, adding that the 1st known case was reported in a 5-year-old girl in central Taiwan in April last year [2021].

Since 2011, there have been at least 45 cases of human infection with H1N2v reported worldwide, with the majority having direct exposure to pigs or a contaminated environment, he said.

Six close contacts of the 2nd Taiwan case were tested, but all were negative for the virus and for antibodies against it, Chuang said, adding that after discussions with experts, the CDC believes it to be a sporadic case, similar to those reported overseas.

No person-to-person spread of H1N2v has been confirmed, he said, adding that the Council of Agriculture tested pigs at the farm near where the girl lives, but the virus was not detected.

Asked if H1N2v could cause severe symptoms in humans, Chuang said most cases have had mild symptoms, including the 2 girls in Taiwan, but some human infections with novel avian influenza A viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N9, can cause more severe symptoms. The severity of illness also depends on whether the strain has drug resistance, he said.

[This is the 2nd case of H1N2v reported from Taiwan; the 1st case was reported in April 2021.

This case was diagnosed as seasonal influenza based on a positive test for influenza A (the subtype/variant could not be identified) and recovered following treatment with antiviral drugs. The case was confirmed on genome sequencing, and this highlights the value for genomic surveillance in early identification and reporting of novel or emerging pathogens.

Influenza A virus subtype H1N2 (A/H1N2) is a subtype of the species influenza A virus. It is currently endemic in pig populations and is occasionally seen in humans.

Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." They also can be denoted by adding the letter "v" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been reported.

The viruses generally do not cause more severe illness than other influenza viruses, but could present a risk of transmission to others or severe illness to people at risk.

The human cases of H1N2 were first identified between December 1988 and March 1989 in 6 cities across China. Nineteen H1N2 isolates were identified during this time, but no further spread occurred. During the 2001 to 2002 flu season in the northern hemisphere, H1N2 was identified in the United States, Canada, France, Romania, Ireland, Latvia, Oman, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.

As this virus subtype is no longer in circulation in humans, it is important to strengthen integrated surveillance of animal and human influenza viruses for early detection and response. - Mod.UBA
