Preliminary data shows a 75 percent increase in cases of syphilis from 2020 to 2021, said George Walton, program manager for sexually transmitted diseases at the Iowa Department of Public Health. Walton said syphilis cases are rising among different demographics than the disease typically presents in.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the majority of syphilis cases in the US are among men who have sex with men. Within the state, Walton said there have been more syphilis diagnoses among women.

"We have seen an increase, for the persons that have been diagnosed, more individuals that are self-reporting drug use, so that is likely a factor as well," Walton said. "But I would say there is no one single population or single factor that is contributing by itself to the increase -- it seems to be a combination of factors."

While data from 2021 are not yet available, there were 140 more cases of syphilis in Iowa in 2020 than in 2019, according to the state's surveillance data [https://idph.iowa.gov/Portals/1/userfiles/105/2020a%20surveillance%20data%20for%20website.pdf]. In 2020, over 80 percent of syphilis cases in the state were among men.

"My colleagues and I across the country speak to one another, and everybody that I've spoken with in other states are seeing increases, particularly in syphilis," he said. "That's very noticeable, but the rate of increase here in Iowa seems to stand out a bit more."

Cases of congenital syphilis, when the disease is passed from a pregnant person to their fetus, have also spiked dramatically this year [2021], Walton said. "We'll finish the year with at least 10 that meet the case definition, which may not seem like a lot, but just to put that in perspective, last year we had 1, and in 2013, we had 3, and that was a big, high number. So, to have 10 in a single year is significant." Cases of congenital syphilis have risen nationwide as well, according to the CDC. In 2020, more than 2000 cases were reported, the highest level since 1994.

Johnson County Public Health offers rapid syphilis testing, which is now available for anyone who wants to be tested, Edel said. "It used to be that we were only able to offer rapid syphilis testing to select folks, so folks who were showing symptoms or had a potential exposure," she said. "Now, we're able to open that eligibility requirement up and offer syphilis testing to everyone, and that's because of what our state is experiencing in terms of syphilis rates." Johnson County Public Health takes walk-in appointments for STD testing, Edel said, adding that the testing program is free and doesn't require ID or insurance.

The current CDC guidelines for syphilis testing are that anyone who has symptoms of syphilis, or a partner who has been recently diagnosed with the disease should be tested, in addition to routine testing pregnant women, and men who have sex with men. "As we've seen increases in Iowa and we've seen increases in other parts of the US, we're trying to promote and encourage testing further, because ... there are additional populations that have not been as affected in the past who are affected now," Walton said. "Essentially, we're trying to promote that being more of a routine test for folks who are sexually active."

[Johnson County (pop., 152 854 in 2020, is located in the US state of Iowa; Iowa City (pop., 74 828 in 2020), is the county's seat and where the University of Iowa, a public research university with 33 000 students, is located.

In the United States, the number of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis among women and the number of reported cases of congenital syphilis have increased every year since 2012. Texas ranks the highest among US states for congenital syphilis in 2019, with 138.2 cases of congenital syphilis per 100 000 live births; Iowa ranks 43rd among US states, with 2.6 cases per 100 000 live births (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/tables/40.htm). Other states with rates of congenital syphilis above the national average (48.5 cases per 100 000) in 2019 are in the South and Southwest, including Texas (138.2), New Mexico (117.8), Nevada (114.7), Louisiana (111.4), California (94.3), Oklahoma (85.6), Florida (64.8), and Arkansas (56.0).

Men are disproportionately affected by syphilis, accounting for 83% of cases of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in 2019; almost 57% of men with P&S syphilis in 2019 are men who have sex with men. Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, accounting for only about 17% of cases of P&S syphilis in 2019, rates in women have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 30.0% during 2018-2019 and 178.6% during 2015-2019, suggesting heterosexual syphilis an emerging epidemic (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm#Syphilis). Illicit drug use has been a recurrent theme in reports of P&S syphilis in women and mothers of infants with congenital syphilis. - Mod.ML
