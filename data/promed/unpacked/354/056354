[The outbreaks are occurring at the southern tip of Viet Nam, where
the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. Most of the 32
outbreaks are located in Ca Mau province, with only 3 outbreaks in
Hau Giang province and 6 in Bac Lieu province.
A couple of items of interest are contained in this first OIE
follow-up report. The original report filed on 19 Dec 2006 cited 2
outbreaks on farms covering a period of 13 days. This report cites
32 farms in 28 days, so the rate of spread has increased. Also, the
apparent morbidity and mortality rates, apparent case fatality rates
are relatively high and yet not all the susceptible population (13.22
percent) can be accounted for in a way that ensures a very low
likelihood of transmission. Obviously, this situation is concerning
and bears close watching by both the animal and public health
communities in both these and neighboring provinces. Hopefully, the
2 groups of officials are working together in a seamless fashion. - Mod.PC]
