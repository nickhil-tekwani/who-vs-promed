Spread of Artemisinin Resistance in _Plasmodium falciparum_ Malaria. E.A. Ashley et al. N Engl J Med. 2014 Jul 31;371(5):411-23.
--------------------------------------------
Background
Artemisinin resistance in _Plasmodium falciparum_ has emerged in Southeast Asia and now poses a threat to the control and elimination of malaria. Mapping the geographic extent of resistance is essential for planning containment and elimination strategies.

Methods
Between May 2011 and April 2013, we enrolled 1241 adults and children with acute, uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an open-label trial at 15 sites in 10 countries (7 in Asia and 3 in Africa). Patients received artesunate, administered orally at a daily dose of either 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 4 mg per kilogram, for 3 days, followed by a standard 3-day course of artemisinin-based combination therapy. Parasite counts in peripheral-blood samples were measured every 6 hours, and the parasite clearance half-lives were determined.

Results
The median parasite clearance half-lives ranged from 1.9 hours in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 7.0 hours at the Thailand-Cambodia border. Slowly clearing infections (parasite clearance half-life over 5 hours), strongly associated with single point mutations in the "propeller" region of the _P. falciparum_ kelch protein gene on chromosome 13 (kelch13), were detected throughout mainland Southeast Asia from southern Viet Nam to central Myanmar. The incidence of pretreatment and post-treatment gametocytemia was higher among patients with slow parasite clearance, suggesting greater potential for transmission. In western Cambodia, where artemisinin-based combination therapies are failing, the 6-day course of antimalarial therapy was associated with a cure rate of 97.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 90.9 to 99.4) at 42 days.

Conclusions
Artemisinin resistance to _P. falciparum_, which is now prevalent across mainland Southeast Asia, is associated with mutations in kelch13. Prolonged courses of artemisinin-based combination therapies are currently efficacious in areas where standard 3-day treatments are failing.

Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failure in Cambodia. Saunders DL et al. N Engl J Med. 2014 Jul 31;371(5):484-5.
--------------------------------
Increases in treatment failures, parasite clearance times, and piperaquine IC50 values only 3 years after widespread introduction of dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine suggest rapidly emerging resistance to both the artemisinin and the piperaquine components.

Given that there are few currently available alternative therapies, improving diagnosis and follow-up, rotating drug regimens, and developing nonpharmacologic approaches [are key] to preventing malaria drug resistance.

[The 2 recent studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 31 Jul 2014 clearly demonstrate that resistance against artemisinins and also the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination is spreading and increasing. The artemisinins are the last major group of antimalarials available, and increase in treatment length means increasing cost of treatment and probably lower compliance.

A major driver of resistance is substandard drugs and insufficient dosing where treatments are sold as individual tablets, and thus full treatment is not taken due to increased cost with an increasing number of tablets.

ProMED has previously argued that an important instrument in preventing a further development and spread of artemisinin resistant malaria is to provide treatment free of charge, just as HIV treatment is provided free of charge supported by the Global Fund for HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Only by proving free treatment is it possible to ensure adequate dosing of drugs with the required quality. - Mod.EP]
