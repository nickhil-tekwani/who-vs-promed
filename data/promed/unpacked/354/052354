Seventh New York and first New Jersey Resident Confirmed to Have West Nile
Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: A 43-year-old man has become the first person in New Jersey to
contract the mosquito-born West Nile virus that killed seven people in the
New York area last summer, State Health Officials said on Friday. The man,
who's name was withheld, is recovering at his home in Jersey City. New
Jersey State Health Department spokesman Dennis McGowan said the man fell
ill 6 Aug 2000 and was hospitalized on 10 Aug 2000. The patient went home
the next day, and blood samples taken to test for the virus were sent to
the Federal Centers for Disease Control. Officials confirmed the result on
Friday.
On Friday, 1 Sep 2000, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that a
61-year-old Staten Island man had become the seventh person in the city
this year to test positive for the virus. The man became ill on 4 Aug 2000
with muscle weakness and encephalitis, was admitted to a local hospital on
6 Aug 2000 and released on 11 Aug 2000. The New York State Department of
Health received test results on Thursday confirming the man ad contracted
West Nile virus.
This year in the United States no-one has died from the disease, which has
been found in infected birds from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Since July,
New York City has been conducting an aggressive insecticide spraying
campaign throughout the city.

Hudson County Resident Tests Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: A 43-year old Jersey City man has tested positive for the presence
of West Nile virus (WNV). Serum and spinal fluid samples tested positive in
the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services laboratories, and
the result was verified today by the Federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). Additional confirmatory test results from the CDC
will be available in the next few weeks. Until now, WNV had only been
detected in New Jersey in birds and mosquitoes. The [patient was admitted
to Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus earlier this month with
symptoms consistent with WNV infection - a fever greater than 100 degrees,
muscle weakness, headache and lethargy. He has since been discharged from
the hospital and is home recovering. He was most likely bitten by an
infected mosquito in mid- to late-July.
"This finding underscores the importance of our statewide surveillance and
mosquito control activities, and the key role physicians play in
recognizing and reporting the symptoms of West Nile virus infection to
public health officials," Grant said.
WNV, [a flavivirus, is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito that has
picked up the virus by feeding on an infected bird. WNV is not directly
transmitted from birds to humans or from person to person. WNV infection
generally causes no symptoms or just mild, flu-like symptoms; however, the
elderly are at higher risk of more severe disease. "The best way to fight
West Nile virus is through comprehensive mosquito control," said Department
of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Shinn. "New Jersey, through
the county-based mosquito control programs, has been aggressive in both
surveillance and mosquito control efforts. Historically, these efforts have
kept adult mosquito populations low, helping to reduce the risk of human
infections. The use of crows and chickens as sentinels for WNV has enhanced
the ability of local officials to make well-informed decisions about where
and how best to focus mosquito control activities.
To date, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 19 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. In addition to
the one positive result, tests for 5 individuals have been negative and the
other test results are pending. These individuals either had symptoms
and/or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited
most of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows with the virus
have been discovered.

[These reports bring the total of human cases to 8; 7 in New York (6 in
Staten Island and one in Brooklyn), and one in Jersey City, the first case
outside the New York City area. The most recent 3 cases are all younger
than first 4 cases and infection appears to have occurred after the
initiation of mosquito control procedures. -Mod.CP
