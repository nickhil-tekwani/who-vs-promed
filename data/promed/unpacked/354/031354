[The TSE archive of the VLA can be accessed at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla/science/science-tse-arc-intro.htm>.
It includes an application form and instructions, as well as the following
comments regarding the review process: "All requests to the Archive are
subject to review by the Independent Archive Advisory Group (IAAG). IAAG
provides an external review to ensure all requests are dealt with fairly.

IAAG consists of 6 researchers from the UK, France and Germany. Officials
from Defra, the Food Standards Agency and the European Commission oversee
the group". - Mod.AS]

I wish to make you aware of another oral BSE challenge trial that is
currently being performed on the Island of Riems in Germany. See attached
web-link for details. So it seems that at least 3 such trials are being
performed in various countries. We all hope that the outcome will be better
-- that is, antemortem, BSE tests.

[For our subscribers' convenience, we reproduce the relevant text from the
said website, kindly forwarded by Dr Kittelberger:

"BSE Research in Germany: A large scale study into the pathogenesis of BSE
has recently started in Germany. Since December [2002] the 1st cattle have
been brought into a special BSE infection unit of the Federal Research
Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals (BFAV) on the Island of Riems. The
first 28 animals will be infected with the BSE agent by Dr Martin Groschup
and his staff of the Institute of Novel and Emerging Infective Agents at
the BFAV. After a further 6 weeks another 28 animals will be brought to the
Island of Riems and after a quarantine of 4 weeks they will also be
infected. The BSE material will be given orally.

British scientists have supported this infection trial in providing more
than 5 kg brain tissue from BSE cattle. The study aims to research the
course of infection from the start of the infection until the outbreak of
the disease. The goal is to get samples from animals that are definitively
infected by the agent and to provide this material to other researchers
from the German TSE Research Platform working on the pathogenesis of the
disease and other important BSE-related research. The pathogenesis study is
a crucial pre-requisite for the development and evaluation of BSE tests, in
particular for the development of a test applied in the living organism.
The duration of the study will be approximately 5 years".

From another source <http://www.bionity.com/news/d/34061/>, dated 22 Jan
2004, it appears that during the 1st year of this trial, 9 out of the 56
challenged calves have been sacrificed and 38 000 specimens collected. It
will be interesting to obtain information on the layout of this long-term
challenge trial and about observations available so far. - Mod.AS]
