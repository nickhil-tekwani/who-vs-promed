Guam mumps outbreak update
--------------------------
As of Mon 3 May 2010, there have been 142 confirmed or probable mumps cases
recorded on Guam as a result of the current ongoing outbreak, with 71
additional suspect cases still under investigation.

Only 2 cases have required hospitalization (both had co-morbidities) and
there have been no mumps-related deaths thus far.

83 per cent of confirmed and probable cases have been in children under 18
years of age, the highest number of cases (44) occurring in the age group
11-13.

[The mumps epidemic continues to spread. The number of confirmed or
probable cases of mumps on the island of Guam has increased to more than a
142 cases from the 5 cases reported initially on 25 Mar 2010.

The majority of cases have been children, which is unexpected since Guam
law requires all students entering school to submit proof of immunization
that includes 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It
may be that the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is less immunogenic that
the measles and rubella components and 2 doses are not sufficient to
provide complete protection. Alternatively perhaps the law is not being
enforced.

Guam is located in the western north Pacific Ocean, and is the largest and
southernmost island in the Mariana Islands archipelago. A map of Guam can
