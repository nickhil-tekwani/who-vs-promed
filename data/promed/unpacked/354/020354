Turkey: 41 Diagnosed with Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Governor of the central Turkish province of Yozgat announced on
Thursday [28 Jul 3005] that 41 people have been diagnosed with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the province, one of whom has
died. Izzettin Sevgili was quoted by the Anatolia News Agency as saying
that CCHF virus [infection] is prevalent in the towns of Cekerek and
Kadisehir in the province. Local health teams have taken all necessary
measures to prevent spread of the disease.
CCHF is a viral hemorrhagic fever [transmitted] by tick bite, with a high
mortality rate. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe
and Asia. The disease was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and given
the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the
pathogen causing Crimean hemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible
for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place
names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus, according
to the official.

[One of the founders of ProMED-mail and a current Associate Editor, Jack
Woodall, contributed to the discovery and characterization of the Congo
isolate of CCHF virus.
CCHF virus can be transmitted to humans directly by tick-bite, by
nosocomial spread in hospitals, or by blood-borne transmission during the
slaughter of domestic animals. Cases arising by transmission from ticks are
usually sporadic, whereas clusters of cases can be indicative of
blood-borne transmission associated with the slaughtering of animals
(mainly sheep which normally do not exhibit signs of disease). The linkage
of the cases with 2 specific towns suggests the latter mode of transmission
may be the more likely. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
