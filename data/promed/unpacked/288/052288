1st Report of Wheat dwarf virus in Winter Wheat in Finland.
A. Lemmetty and E. Huusela-Veistola, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Plant
Protection, FIN-31600 Jokioinen, Finland. Plant Dis. 89:912, 2005;
published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0912B. Accepted for publication 17
May 2005.
During June and July of 2004, several diseased plants in winter wheat
(_Triticum aestivum_ L.) were reported by agricultural advisers in the
southern and southwestern coastal area of Finland. The plants showed
extreme dwarfing, various yellowing symptoms, and reduced or no heading.
The damage varied considerably.
Yield loss estimates in direct-drilled winter wheat fields were
approximately 20 to 40 percent and in worst cases as much as 100 percent. A
few leafhoppers (_Psammotettix alienus_ Dahlb.) were collected from the
field with sweep nets and yellow traps.
Roots and symptomatic leaves of winter wheat and the leafhoppers were first
tested using a commercial polyclonal antibody (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany)
specific for Wheat dwarf virus (WDV). For the leaf and root samples,
routine double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(DAS-ELISA) procedures were used. 5 leafhoppers per sample were homogenized
with the extraction buffer provided. The homogenate was centrifuged and the
extract was evaluated using DAS-ELISA (2). The highest absorbance values
were obtained from leafhoppers suspected to be viruliferous. The mean
values varied from 1.002 to 1.990 after incubation in the substrate for 2 h.
The absorbance values of several leaf samples exceeded the virus-positive
threshold but were lower than those of the viruliferous leafhoppers. The
virus was not detected in roots. Low absorbance values of virus-positive
plants were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers
specific for WDV (1). Total DNA extracts (DNeasy Plant Mini Kit; Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) from symptomatic leaves were tested using puRe Taq
Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The PCR
amplicon was the expected size (1201 bp). The high absorbance value of the
leafhoppers showed that the leafhoppers were carriers of the virus.
These results confirmed that the causal agent of dwarfing and yellowing
symptoms in winter wheat was WDV (genus _Mastrevirus_, family _Geminiviridae_).

[In Sweden, Wheat dwarf geminivirus virus (WDV) is periodically an
important pest on wheat. It is transmitted by the insect _Psammotettix
alienus_, family _Cicadellidae_. The genetic diversity among
wheat-infecting isolates of WDV was found to be low throughout Sweden and
Europe, while WDV isolates infecting barley were distinctly different. WDV
was also identified in samples of wild grasses and the insect vector. WDV
spreads in Bulgaria, the former Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, and the
former USSR; found, but with no evidence of spread, in Sweden.
