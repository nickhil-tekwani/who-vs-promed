From: Fran√ßois Moutou <f.moutou@alfort.afssa.fr>

Having be away the last days of August, I just saw today the 28 Aug 1999
message regarding a BSE case in France on a cow born in Switzerland. The
moderator, MHJ, added to the message that we had previously imported cases
from the UK into the country. This is not correct. All our previous BSE
cases were native from France and this one is really the first on an
imported animal.
The AFSSA (ex CNEVA) is the French National Agency in charge of the
epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of BSE in France. This is why I
sent you this correction.
