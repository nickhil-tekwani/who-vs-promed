[Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariant is considered a viral infection caused by variants of OsHV-1.

OsHV-1 is the aetiological agent of a contagious viral disease of Pacific cupped oysters, _Crassostrea giga_, also affecting other bivalve species. The virus was sequenced from infected Pacific oyster larvae collected in France in 1995. As this specimen was the 1st to be described (through complete genome sequencing),it can be considered as the reference type.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, chapter 2.4.9 "Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariant" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.4.09_INF_OSTREID_HERPES_FINAL.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013).

The OIE Aquatic Code, chapter 1.3. "Diseases listed by the OIE" identifies the infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariant as an emerging disease, listed according to the article 1.2.3. http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.1.3.htm.

For further information on this article, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 1.2 "Criteria for listing aquatic animal disease" http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.1.2.htm#article_1.1.2.3.

_Crassostrea giga_, is an oyster native to the Pacific coast of Asia. It has become an introduced species in North America, Australia, Europe, and New Zealand http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster.

Description: The shell of _Crassostrea giga_ is solid, inequivalve [has unequal sides/valves], is extremely rough, extensively fluted, and laminated; left (lower) valve is deeply cupped, its sides sometimes almost vertical; the right (upper) valve is flat or slightly convex, inequilateral; beaks and umbones are often overgrown; tending to be oblong in outline but often distorted and very irregular. The shape of the shell varies with the environment. Colour is usually whitish with many purple streaks and spots radiating away from the umbo. The interior of the shell is white, with a single muscle scar that is sometimes dark, but never purple or black http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Crassostrea_gigas/en. - Mod.CRD
