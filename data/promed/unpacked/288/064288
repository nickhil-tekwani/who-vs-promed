Health authorities in the northern Chilean region of Atacama ordered
a ban on collecting shellfish after detecting amnesic toxin in a
section of coastline of the area, official sources reported today [26
Dec 2008].

"So far no people have been affected," said Regional Secretary of
Health Pilar Merino, who said that the area at risk is located near
the Sugar Loaf, about 1000 km [about 620 miles] north of Santiago
[the capital].

The toxin is, according to experts, also known as domoic acid,
produced by some varieties of plankton consumed by shellfish, in a
similar way to other poisons in the so-called red tide. When the
toxin is consumed by humans it can cause gastrointestinal and
neurological problems and short term memory loss, as it damages
hippocampal cells and in the most severe cases can lead to death.

Pilar Merino said, according to laboratory tests, a concentration of
20 micrograms per gram [of body weight] of shellfish toxin is fatal
for mice, and [shellfish] samples from the Sugar Loaf area had concentrations
of up to 198.5 micrograms per gram. [The safe threshold for ingestion
by humans has been set at 20 micrograms per gram. - Mod.JW.

When people ingest it, the authority said that [the symptoms] can
start with vomiting and diarrhea, and later neurological symptoms,
then "it erases the hard drive, i.e., it erases short-term memory and
can lead to death when the intake is abundant," he said.

Merino said that the toxin is not eliminated by cooking the seafood,
so the only useful measure is not to eat bivalve mollusks from areas
where the toxin has been detected.

Neurobehavioral effects of harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins: A
critical review. J Int Neuropsychol Soc 2005;11: 331-338:

Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) was 1st recognized in 1987 in
Canada after an outbreak of seafood poisoning due to consuming
mussels contaminated with domoic acid. Of the 107 cases identified,
50-75 percent reported vomiting and abdominal cramps, 43 percent
headaches, and 25 percent memory loss. 19 cases were hospitalized
with serious neuroloigcal dysfunction, of which 3 died in the
hospital and another 3 months later (1).

A subsequent study (2) examined the neuropsychological performance of
14 of the most severely affected outbreak victims (10 men and 4
women, average age 65 years). The clinical descriptions included
coma, ophthalmoplegia especially 6th cranial nerves palsy, and double
vision. There was neuromotor involvement evidenced by hemiparesis,
transient hypereflexia and Babinski sign, chronic atrophy of distal
muscles and mild weakness, hyporeflexia, and loss of distal
sensitivity to pain and temperature change. At least 5 patients
experienced seizures in the hospital, and there were chronic seizure
disorders reported for up to 4 months. Neuropsychological evaluations
were conducted 4 to 6 months after intoxication, with findings
suggesting that 12 of the 14 patients displayed short term memory
loss with others cognitive functions relatively preserved.

Atacama is 1 of the 15 regions of Chile and is located in the central
part of the country and can be found on a map at:
