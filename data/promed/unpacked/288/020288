Despite the international tuberculosis scare set off by an Atlanta
lawyer's travels, tests of hundreds of airline passengers indicate
that nobody caught the disease while flying with him to and from
Europe, health officials from the US and Canada said Tuesday [27 Nov
2007].

"I'm relieved that the results came back that way," said Andrew
Speaker, the Atlanta man who traveled abroad for his wedding and
honeymoon after being diagnosed with a drug-resistant form of
tuberculosis. Andrew Speaker has been back in Georgia since July
[2007] and remains on antibiotics, though he is no longer considered
potentially contagious. "I hope that brings a sense of peace and
closure for the people who may have been concerned," he said.

According to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), about 250 US passengers aboard a 12 May [2007]
Air France flight from Atlanta to Paris have had TB tests. None,
including 25 sitting nearest to Speaker, appear to have been infected
during the flight, the data show.

Canadian health officials, responsible for investigating Speaker's
return flight from Prague, Czech Republic, to Montreal on 24 May
[2007], also have found no evidence Speaker spread the disease. "We
are 6 months out now from the time of exposure and there still
continues to be no evidence of transmission," said Dr. Tom Wong,
director of the community acquired infections division of the Public
Health Agency of Canada. The Canadian agency has focused on the 29
passengers seated nearest Speaker on the Czech Air flight, Wong said.
All have been assessed and there is no evidence any of them were
infected during the flight. "That's reassuring to us," Wong said. In
general he said, if people who have been around a TB patient haven't
tested positive for TB exposure within 6 months "it is strongly
predictive that there won't be any development of active
tuberculosis."

Several passengers on the Czech Air flight have sued Speaker for
possibly exposing them to the disease. Anlac Nguyen, the Montreal
lawyer who filed the suit, did not return a call.

On 29 May [2007] CDC officials held a press conference to announce
they had put an unidentified man into enforced federal isolation and
urged that passengers aboard the 2 trans-Atlantic flights be tested
for TB. The long duration of the flights made transmission a
possibility for those sitting near him, although they noted the risk
was slight.

CDC officials at the time said the agency was taking the unusual and
public actions, including issuing the 1st federal isolation order
since 1963, because the man had extensively drug resistant
tuberculosis called XDR TB. This meant that the disease was very
difficult to treat, did not respond to most antibiotics and, as a
result, could be deadly.

The announcement set off an international health scare and media
frenzy, along with congressional investigations. The incident raised
questions about why officials with the Fulton County Health
Department and the Georgia Division of Public Health hadn't stopped
Speaker from traveling to Greece for his wedding and why CDC didn't
take action to stop him from fleeing Italy and going back to the
United States.

The man was later identified in press reports as Speaker; and later
testing by a renowned TB hospital in Denver revealed he never had XDR
TB, but rather a more treatable, yet still serious, form of the
disease called multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). CDC officials have
said both MDR and XDR TB require the same public health response.

Officials at the hospital, National Jewish Medical and Research
Center, have said Speaker was at very low risk of transmitting the
disease because he had no cough or any other outward symptoms. TB
bacteria are spread through droplets from coughing, sneezing, or
speaking. Speaker only learned he had the disease by chance: when he
underwent a chest x-ray for an injury.

While in Denver, Speaker underwent cutting-edge antibiotic treatments
and also had surgery to remove an infected area of one lung. He's
been back in Georgia since July [2007] and remains on antibiotics,
though he is no longer considered potentially contagious. "I feel
like I've always felt," Speaker said Tuesday [27 Nov 2007]. "I feel
fine."

While it appears nobody was sickened, the Andrew Speaker TB case
pointed out gaps in the handling of a potentially infectious patient
by local public health officials. Here are some actions the Georgia
Division of Public Health and the CDC say they are taking:

Georgia Division of Public Health
---------------------------------
- Educating county health officials that state law allows them to
immediately isolate or confine a TB patient who refuses to follow
their advice. The division is creating educational materials for all
county health directors and county attorneys and will conduct
training at an April [2008] meeting.
- Changing the forms given to Georgia's approximately 500 TB patients
each year to make them more specific about the restrictions placed on
their travels.
- Strengthening the division's rules and regulations to require that
all samples that test positive for drug-resistant TB be sent to the
state lab.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
------------------------------------------
- Formalizing procedures for ensuring faster and better communication
with other government agencies, including those at local health
departments and at the US Department of Homeland Security.
- Developing better, faster tests to determine whether tuberculosis
is resistant to drugs.
- Completing construction and testing of a new USD 1.2 million
portable isolation unit that could be used in the future to transport
a person with an infectious disease aboard the CDC jet.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[This news release indicates that apparently tuberculosis was not
transmitted to passengers who flew to and from Europe with the US
patient infected with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in May 2007.

It was anticipated that the probability of transmission of
tuberculosis would be low for several reasons. First, the patient was
not coughing and microscopic examination of stained smears of his
expectorated sputum failed to show tubercle bacilli, which indicated
that he was unlikely expelling infectious droplet nuclei of his
respiratory excretions, the usual mode of transmission. In addition,
he apparently had failed to transmit tuberculosis to his wife,
despite close contact.

Moreover, according to the WHO
(<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf>),
all large commercial jet aircraft provide approximately 20 air
exchanges per hour during cruising, with lower amounts during descent
and on the ground (the recommended rate for hospital isolation rooms
for patients with TB is 6-12 exchanges per hour). Also according to
WHO, jet aircraft built after the late 1980s, and a few adapted older
aircraft, recirculate up to 50 percent of cabin air. However, this
air is passed through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters
before re-entering the passenger cabin, which remove 99.9 percent of
particulate matter, including particles the size of tubercle bacilli.
The recirculated air is mixed with outside conditioned air from the
engine compressors and then reintroduced into the passenger cabin. At
cruising altitude, outside ambient air is virtually free of
microorganisms. Air enters and leaves the cabin at approximately the
same seat row, with little front to back airflow, thus limiting
spread of airborne particles to the section in which the patient is
seated. In the only report of probable passenger-to-passenger
transmission, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection was identified
for only a few passengers seated in the same section of the aircraft
as the infected passenger.

WHO
(<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf>)
suggests that passengers on flights 8 or more hours in duration who
are seated in the same row and the 2 rows ahead and behind the index
patient, as well as cabin crew members working in the same cabin
section, should be contacted for determination if transmission of
tuberculosis has occurred by means of medical assessment, tuberculin
skin testing (TST), or interferon-gamma release assays, chest
radiography; contact should be maintained for at least 3 years.

The CDC recommended that all co-passengers be tested for TB (as of 17
Jul 2007, 99 percent of US passengers were contacted by CDC),
although Canadian public health officials focused on 29 passengers
who sat near the MDR TB patient on a 24 May 2007 Czech Air flight
from Prague to Montreal.

The process used to assess tuberculosis infection following exposure
is complex
(<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf>).
TST is a useful tool for identifying individuals who have been
infected with the tubercle bacillus, although it does not indicate
whether the infection was acquired recently or at some time in the
remote past. Although the news release does not say, some of the
passengers likely gave a history of a positive TST and were not
re-tested and others were likely TST positive on initial testing,
either because of BCG vaccination or latent tuberculosis acquired
years before as a result of residence or birth in countries in which
TB is endemic. However, neither BCG nor prior infection is believed
to reduce their risk of reinfection. In the United States, an
estimated 4-6 percent of the total population is TST-positive. In
developing countries, the estimated prevalence of _M. tuberculosis_
infection among the general population ranges from 19 percent (in the
WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region) to 44 percent (in the WHO Western
Pacific Region).

Because usually it takes 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of tuberculosis
infection for the immune system to react to tuberculin, to identify
those who have been infected by their recent airplane exposure, but
tested negative during the initial screening, a repeat TST is
required 8 to 12 weeks post-exposure. The news release does not state
the number of such individuals. In addition, some individuals who
initially do not react to tuberculin may be TST negative either
because of immunosuppressive medication, such as corticosteroid, or
concurrent infections, such as HIV infection. These individuals are
at high-risk for the development of tuberculosis disease. Again, the
news release does not state the number of such individuals.

Some individuals who are initially TST negative, become positive on
retesting 8-12 weeks later. These "converters" are assumed to have
been recently infected by the tubercle bacillus. However, some
individuals may be initially negative because their tuberculosis
infection was so remote that their reactivity to tuberculin waned
over many years; yet if now retested one or more weeks later, the TST
may become positive. This so called "boosted" reaction may be
mistakenly confused as a TST conversion. From the news release,
presumably there were no converters. If the second TST remains
negative and the individual remains healthy, the individual is
assumed not to have become infected. - Mod.ML]
