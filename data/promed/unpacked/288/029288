[1] Cholera - Uganda (Arua District)

The authorities in Arua municipality have closed Hope Kebir primary school following a cholera outbreak in the area. The school is located among heavily crammed settlements in Kenya ward, Oli division where sporadic cholera cases have been reported since October 2012.

Norah Fathu, the municipal principal health inspector said they found out last week [week of 19 Nov 2012] that 2 cholera patients were sharing a latrine with the children from the school located less than 10 meters away from their house. The school is housed in a building where the landlord rents out some rooms to accommodate other tenants. "This literally put the lives of the children in danger and we advised the education department to close the school," she said.

The latest outbreak brings to 32 the number of cholera patients treated at both Oli health centre IV and Arua hospital since October 2012. 2 of the patients died while another is still being treated in the hospital.

However, the municipal principal education officer Joachim Ozimati told journalists in his office on Thursday [22 Nov 2012] that Hope Kebir was one of the 8 unregistered primary schools operating in the municipality that were earmarked for closure early in 2013. The school had over 130 children in the nursery and 92 in the primary section which has classes only up to primary grade 3.

Ozimati said the school will remain indefinitely closed until the proprietors meet the minimum benchmarks including constructing proper classrooms and separate latrines for boys, girls, and the teachers. He advised schools that do not have capacity to handle both nursery and primary sections to limit themselves to one section until they acquire the necessary facilities for expansion.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Osun State)

A pregnant woman and her mother-in-law have been killed by cholera in Ede, Osun State while about 42 people have been hospitalized as a result of the outbreak of the disease. The outbreak of cholera disease was recorded in Ede North and South local government areas of Osun state and is also said to have been responsible for the death of some other residents of the town.

A resident of the town who works with a Non-Governmental Organization known as Eminent Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation told Daily Trust that about 42 people have been placed on admission at various hospitals in the town. It was gathered that the recent outbreak of the disease was the fall out of indiscriminate disposal of refuse by the people of the 2 councils. Some of the patients are being admitted at the Muslim hospital, Prime hospital, and Rombay Hospital all in Ede.

The Tarkwa Government Hospital has recorded an increasing number of cholera cases from certain parts of the Tarkwa Nsueam Assembly. No deaths have been recorded yet. Victims who normally visit the hospital for treatment on the outbreak come mainly from areas such as Akyempim, Old Town, Cyanide, Bankyim, Nkamponase, and Esuoso.

Briefing the Ghana News Agency on the current situation of the epidemic on Wed 14 Nov 2012, the Municipal Disease Control Officer, Mr Ebenezer Tetteh said a total of 140 cases had been recorded since the disease was detected 2 weeks ago. He said his outfit was putting up the necessary measures to contain the outbreak and cited poor sanitation in the constituency as the major contributory factor. Mr Tetteh said to curb the situation, which had become a yearly affair, the Assembly and the environmental department should create an appropriate dumping site for refuse to be properly disposed.
