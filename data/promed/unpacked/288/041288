In updates today [1 Jul 2021] from 2 of the World Health Organization (WHO) regional offices, African officials said the speed and scale of the 3rd wave of COVID-19 is something they haven't seen before, while European officials warned that conditions are ripe for another wave in the months ahead.

Cases in Africa rose 25% last week, led by faster spreading variants, putting illness levels almost at the peak of the 2nd surge. Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, the WHO's African regional office director, said numbers are doubling every 3 weeks. She added that the Delta (B1617.2) variant has been reported in 16 countries, including 9 that are experiencing surges. In South Africa, which is reporting half of the region's cases, the Delta variant is dominant, and in Uganda, it made up 97% of sequences samples. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Delta accounted for 79% of sequenced samples.

Deaths in Africa also rose last week, by 15% compared to the previous week. Moeti said two-thirds of severe illnesses in people younger than 45 were due to the Delta variant. And with hospitalizations rising, Moeti said officials estimate that the demand for oxygen is 50% greater than the peak of the 1st wave. Against the backdrop of a dramatic surge, vaccine supplies have dried up, and only 1.2% of the population is fully vaccinated, she said. "We are grateful for the pledges made by our international partners, but we need urgent action on allocations. Africa must not be left languishing in the throes of its worst wave yet."

At a separate briefing today [1 Jul 2021], Hans Henri Kluge, MD, MPH, who leads the WHO's European regional office, said the continent's 10-week drop in cases is over, with illnesses rising 10% last week, fueled by increased social mixing, travel, gatherings, and eased restrictions. He said the rise is taking place in a rapidly evolving setting, with the Delta variant becoming more common and much of the population still unvaccinated, despite intense efforts.

He predicted that the Delta variant will be dominant by August [2021], with 63% of the population still waiting for their 1st vaccine dose and at a time when most of Europe will be restriction-free.

Half of seniors are still unvaccinated, and 40% of health workers still lack protection, Kluge said, saying that the levels are unacceptable. "With these figures, nowhere is the pandemic over, and it would be very wrong for anyone -- citizens or policy-makers -- to assume that it is," he added. Kluge said his warnings aren't meant to discourage Euro 2020 fans or summer vacation travelers, but he urged people to take precautions, such as wearing masks, especially indoors and in crowds, getting vaccinated, and ensuring that the most vulnerable people are immunized first.

In related developments, concerns are rising in Europe about COVID-19 spread related to attending Euro 2020 soccer matches. For example, Scotland reported nearly 2000 cases linked to travel to London for Scotland's game with England, according to the BBC (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57667163). Finland reported 300 infections in soccer fans, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus/euro-soccer-tournament-under-fire-for-helping-spread-covid-19-idUSKCN2E74HT).

More global headlines
- In Southeast Asia, Indonesia today [1 Jul 2021] reported another single-day high for cases, with 23 836 new cases reported and the country unveiling new emergency measures, which include shutting nonessential businesses. Also, Malaysia has tightened restrictions for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas, as the country's cases remain stubbornly high.

- Three states in Australia -- where nearly half of the country is on lockdown due to Delta-fueled outbreaks -- reported new cases, according to Reuters. They include New South Wales, Queensland, and Northern Territory.

- Japan appears poised to extend restrictions in Tokyo, where cases are rising again ahead of the Olympics.

- Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the WHO, and their COVAX partners today [1 Jul 2021] called on regions and governments to recognize all fully vaccinated people who have been immunized against COVID-19 with vaccines that have been assessed as safe and effective by the WHO. Some are only recognizing a subset of the vaccines for access to travel and other activities, which the groups say exacerbates inequities.

- The global total today [1 Jul 2021] climbed to 182 420 108 cases, and 3 950 309 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[We have now seen a number of instances where large crowds at sporting events have led to a spike in cases. This does not bode well for the Olympic Games in Japan that are scheduled to start this month (July 2021). But Tokyo is considering extending its curbs -- Olympics Tokyo may extend coronavirus curbs into Games period -- which will be helpful in controlling spread.

[2] CIDRAP News & Perspectives: mRNA vaccines, Novavax

The few adults who receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine but still become infected have a milder, shorter illness and lower viral RNA loads than their unvaccinated peers, finds a real-world US study yesterday [30 Jun 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107058).

The journal also features a UK study confirming that the Novavax vaccine offers 90% overall effectiveness and protects against the highly transmissible and potentially more deadly Alpha (B117) SARS-CoV-2 variant (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107659).

In the 1st study, a team led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Team tested 3975 coronavirus-naive healthcare workers, first responders, and other essential workers who received one or 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine or were unvaccinated from 14 Dec 2020 to 10 Apr 2021. The study took place in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, and Utah.

Of the participants, 3179 (80%) received at least one dose by the end of the data-collection period, while 2686 (84%) were given 2 doses. Of the vaccines, 67% were Pfizer and 33% were Moderna, while the brand name wasn't recorded in less than 1%.

In total, 204 (5%) tested positive for COVID-19, of whom 5 were fully vaccinated, 11 were partially vaccinated, and 156 were unvaccinated. The 32 remaining participants had an undetermined vaccination status and were excluded from the analysis.

In fully vaccinated participants, adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76%-97%), falling to 81% (95% CI, 64%-90%) in the partially vaccinated group. Fully or partially vaccinated participants had a 40% lower average viral RNA load (95% CI, 16%-57%) than the unvaccinated group, a 58% lower risk of fever (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 01.8-0.98), and a shorter illness (-6 days of symptoms, -2 days spent sick in bed; 95% CI, 0.8-3.7).

Three-quarters of those who received at least one vaccine dose had detectable viral RNA loads for one week, whereas detectable RNA lingered longer in 72% of the unvaccinated cohort. The researchers say this means partial or full vaccination lowers the risk for viral RNA detection longer than one week by 66%.

"If you get vaccinated, about 90% of the time you're not going to get COVID-19," study coauthor Jeff Burgess, MD, MPH, said in a University of Arizona Health Sciences news release. "Even if you do get it, there will be less of the virus in you and your illness is likely to be much milder" (https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uoah-cvr063021.php).

The genomes of 93 viruses were sequenced, revealing 11 coronavirus variants of concern or interest (Epsilon [B1427 and B1429]), 9; Alpha, 1; and Zeta [P2], 1). Ten such variants were identified among partially or fully vaccinated participants, 3 of them (30%) Epsilon, compared with 7 of the 70 viruses (10%) found in the unvaccinated group.

Among the coronavirus-infected participants, 26% required medical attention, including 3 unvaccinated participants who were admitted to the hospital. No deaths were reported. Most study participants were women (62%), aged 18-49 years (72%), White (86%), and non-Hispanic (83%), with no underlying medical conditions (69%).

If the study's results are confirmed after further data collection, the researchers wrote, "the overall results [would] support that mRNA vaccines not only are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection but also may mitigate the effects of breakthrough infections -- a finding that is especially important to essential and frontline workers, given their potential to transmit the virus through frequent close contact with patients, coworkers, and the public."

The 2nd study, led by researchers from the Vaccine Institute at the University of London, was part of an ongoing phase 3 trial of the Novavax recombinant nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine. The study involved 14 039 participants aged 18-84 years at 33 sites in the United Kingdom from 28 Sep to 28 Nov 2020 (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107659).

The newly released results come on the heels of the company's 14 Jun [2021] announcement of 90% overall vaccine efficacy (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/novavax-covid-vaccine-90-effective-phase-3-trial).

Participants were assigned to receive 2 doses of the Novavax vaccine or a placebo in a 1:1 ratio 21 days apart. Of all participants, 27.9% were 65 or older, 48.4% were women, 94.5% were White, 2.9% were Asian, 0.4% were Black, and 44.6% had a chronic illness. Ten vaccinees and 96 placebo recipients tested positive for COVID-19, with symptom onset 7 or more days after the 2nd injection, for an 89.7% vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 80.2%-94.6%).

In a post hoc analysis, the vaccine showed 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3%-93.5%) efficacy against symptomatic infections caused by the Alpha variant and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8%-99.5%) efficacy against symptomatic infections from other strains.

Solicited adverse local and systemic reactions, while more common in the vaccine group than in placebo recipients, were mainly mild and lasted no more than 2 or 3 days; few serious adverse events (0.5%) occurred in either group. Two deaths occurred, one in the vaccine group and one in a placebo recipient, both of whom died of COVID-19 complications.

The researchers said that although their study was not powered to evaluate vaccine efficacy against all SARS-CoV-2 strains, the results are reassuring. "In particular, the efficacy estimate of 96.4% against the non-B.1.1.7 strains (the majority of which were the prototype strain) is similar to the efficacy of 95.0% reported against this strain for the [Pfizer vaccine] and the efficacy of 94.1% for the [Moderna vaccine]," they wrote.

[3] Delta variant: dangers
Date: Thu 1 Jul 2021

The coronavirus can cause serious problems without triggering severe infections. Because people can develop long COVID without ending up in the hospital, could Delta still cause long-term symptoms even if vaccines blunt its sting?

New variants are still emerging. Lambda, the latest to be recognized by the WHO, is dominant in Peru and spreading rapidly in South America.

Many nations that excelled at protecting their citizens are now facing a triple threat: They controlled COVID-19 so well that they have little natural immunity; they don't have access to vaccines; and they're besieged by Delta.

[Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge, said:] "The more infections are permitted, the more probable immune escape becomes."

If that does happen, when would we know? This is the 1st pandemic in history in which scientists are sequencing the genes of a new virus, and tracking its evolution, in real time -- that's why we know about the variants at all. Genomic surveillance can tell which mutations are rising to the fore, and lab experiments can show how these mutations change the virus -- that's how we know which variants are concerning. But even with such work "happening at incredible speed," [Emma Hodcroft, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern, said], "we can't test every variant that we see."

Even if a virus eludes one person's set, it might be stymied when it jumps into a new host. "I don't think there'll suddenly be a variant that pops up and evades everything, and suddenly our vaccines are useless," said Gupta. "It'll be incremental: With every stepwise change in the virus, a chunk of protection is lost in individuals. And people on the edges -- the vulnerable who haven't mounted a full response -- will end up bearing the cost."

If that happens, vaccinated people might need booster shots. Those should be possible: The mRNA vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer should be especially easy to revise against changing viruses. But "if we need boosters, I worry that countries that are able to produce vaccines will do so for their own populations, and the division around the world will become even greater," Maria van Kerkhove, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the WHO, told the author.

The discussion about vaccine-beating variants echoes the early debates about whether SARS-CoV-2 would go pandemic. "We don't think too well as a society about low-probability events that have far-reaching consequences," [Maia Majumder, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, said]. "We need to prepare for a future where we are doing vaccine rollout again, and we need to figure out how to do that better."

In the meantime, even highly vaccinated nations should continue investing in other measures that can control COVID-19 but have been inadequately used -- improved ventilation, widespread rapid tests, smarter contact tracing, better masks, places in which sick people can isolate, and policies like paid sick leave. Such measures will also reduce the spread of the virus among unvaccinated communities, creating fewer opportunities for an immune-escape variant to arise. "I find myself the broken record who always emphasizes all the other tools we have," van Kerkhove said. "It's not vaccines only. We're not using what we have at hand."
