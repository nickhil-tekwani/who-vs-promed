Fireblight: weather increases risk of infection
-----------------------------------------------
The risk of fireblight infection in orchards in
Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is regarded to be very high by
the relevant authorities. The bacterium _Erwinia
amylovora_ was able to proliferate and spread
well due to the weather. After overnight dew or
rain open flowers of pome fruit trees may become infected.

For commercial orchards, Baden-Wuerttemberg
therefore approved, at the end of April 2010, the
use of antibiotics for fireblight control. Use of
these compounds is, however, only allowed for
commercial fruit producers or tree propagators.

For private gardens or in organic farming, only
cultural measures may be used to prevent
fireblight. These include intensive monitoring of
trees, immediate removal and destruction of
infected plants, severe pruning of infected
shoots, no contact between infected plant
material and healthy trees, and especially the
disinfection of cutting tools. During flowering,
when plants are particularly vulnerable, it may
be useful to take steps to improve plant vigour.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia
amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive
disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many
varieties of pear, quince, and apple are
susceptible, although the level of susceptibility
may vary with cultivars. Only members of the
_Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family
_Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many
cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known
host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera.

The name of the disease is derived from the
symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they
were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend
forming black hooks, cankers appear on branches
and trunks, and trees invariably die. The
bacteria are highly infectious and are spread by
insects, wind, water, mechanical means, and on
plant material (including budwood). They enter
the host plant through wounds. Since they
overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs
infected during the previous season, the amount
of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are
increased following years with high fireblight
levels. This scenario is likely in BW where
fireblight was already a concern in 2009
(ProMED-mail post 20090501.1643), and the risk is
reported above to have been increased even
further by current weather conditions.

Disease management may include monitoring,
cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen
reservoirs), and copper sprays. Currently the
most effective control is by application of
streptomycin during flowering, but the use of
antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to
strict regulations. Certain cultivar/rootstock
combinations may provide some protection.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas
and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant
strains are a major concern in Europe, the Middle
East and northern America. The pathogen has been
placed on the quarantine alert list of the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). In
the southern hemisphere, fireblight has so far
only been reported from New Zealand. In
Australia, a fireblight incursion with imported
fruit is being regarded as a major threat to
national pome fruit growers (ProMED-mail post
20070625.2046, and see link below). The
importation of plant material, including fruit,
from any country with endemic fireblight would,
over time, poses a considerable risk of
establishment of the pathogen. This would lead to
enormous costs for eradication attempts as well
as the loss of Australia's fireblight-free
status, which would prohibit valuable exports to
fireblight-free countries in Asia.
