Multiple horses on a Gallatin county property have been diagnosed with equine infectious anemia, or EIA, the state's Department of Livestock announced [Thu 26 Oct 2017].

The infected animals were discovered when they tested positive on a screening required for horses moving across state lines, the agency stated.

The preliminary results were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture-APHIS National Veterinary Service Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

Follow-up tests on other horses at the property are underway, according to the Livestock department. The agency has also contacted all horse owners within 200 yards of the affected herd about potential exposure.

Also known as swamp fever, EIA is a potentially fatal viral disease of horses spread by biting insects. No vaccine or treatment is available for the disease, which is characterized by fever, depression, progressive weakness, weight loss, edema (fluid under the skin or in body cavities) and anemia. Not all horses show signs of illness, however, these animals serve as carriers capable of transmitting the disease.

Owners of infected horses have few options, such as placing the animals under lifetime quarantine or donation them for EIA-related research.

In Montana, EIA was last diagnosed in 2011 in Carbon County.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture Animal [KDA] Health Division on [Wed 25 Oct 2017] announced 2 more horses in Finney county have tested positive for equine infectious anemia [EIA].

According to a press release from the KDA, a premises under official quarantine of EIA in Finney County presented all horses for the 60-retesting protocol.

"2 horses, which were previously EIA-negative, tested positive at this retest," the release reads. "Both confirmed EIA-positive have been humanely euthanized. Both horses had been maintained on the premises under the official quarantine since [11 Aug 2017], pending the 60-day retest."

According to KDA officials, specific locations of infectious areas are not released per KDA policy.

All other horses from this premises will remain under official quarantine for an additional 60 days pending a negative EIA test, according to the release.

In August [2017], the Kansas Animal Health Commissioner was notified that a horse near Garden City tested positive for EIA after a routine Coggins test -- a blood test for horses -- according to the KDA website. This initiated follow-up testing of all horses on the index premises, which resulted in the discovery of 5 additional EIA-positive horses, and one horse tested positive for equine piroplasmosis (EP).

According to the KDA, all horses on the premises have been humanely euthanized.

"All horses within a 0.5-mile surveillance zone surrounding the index premises were tested," the site says.

There are more than 40 exposed horses on 6 different premises where EIA-positive and EP-positive horses were found, all of which are under official quarantine pending retest.

All confirmed EIA-positive horses had recently been on the index premises, which was an unsanctioned, unofficial horse racing facility in Finney County.

"Everyone one of these confirmed positives, both the EIA and the equine piroplasmosis, were on that index premises at one time or another in the recent months," Dr Justin Smith, state animal health commissioner said during an EIA public information meeting in Garden City in September [2017]. "There was a huge connection between the horses. It was basically an unsanctioned race horse facility they were all on."

The unsanctioned race horse facility is located in rural Garden City, Smith said previously.

Since the discovery of EIA in southwestern Kansas in August [2017], a total of 15 horses have been humanely euthanized. Overall, 9 horses in Finney county tested positive for EIA and 3 with EP; 2 in Kearny County tested positive for EIA and one horse in Haskell County tested positive for EP.

EIA is an incurable, infectious disease caused by a virus that can affect horses, donkeys, asses, and other equine species. This disease does not affect humans, according to the KDA.

According to the KDA, the virus destroys red blood cells and is spread through blood-to-blood contact, not through close proximity or casual contact. Clinical signs of EIA include fever, anemia, and edema. Affected horses may not show symptoms. All infected horses, including those which are asymptomatic, are carriers of the disease.

The virus can be transmitted from an infected equine to a "clean" equine by biting flies, the use of unsterilized or contaminated medical instruments, or through a blood transfusion.

EP is a tick-borne disease that effects horses, mules, donkeys, and zebras.

Euthanasia is what is recommended for horses that test positive for EIA or EP.

More than 1,00 horses have been tested for EIA since August [2017], almost double when comparing it to 2016, which had 887.

Kansas has had 9 positive horses in the last 10 years; 3 in 2007, 2 in 2008, and 4 in 2016, according to the KDA.

The KDA has established an EIA page on the KDA website at http://www.agriculture.ks.gov/EIA, where any future positive cases resulting from this investigation will be posted. The public will be notified of updates to that webpage via the KDA Twitter account, @KansasDeptofAg.

[The state of Kansas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5412369,23568. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/kansas-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a noncontagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the inapparent, chronically infected carrier. This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show, or event, or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

"No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine are available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 meters) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used.

"All equids shipped across state lines in the USA must be tested for EIA with a negative result within 12 months before transport. All equids sold, traded, or donated within a state must have tested negative for EIA no more than 12 months before change in ownership and, preferably, no more than 60-90 days. All equids entering horse auctions or sales markets are required to have a negative test before sale, or the horse must be held in quarantine within the state until the test results are known."

It is indeed a shame there is no vaccination available for this disease.
