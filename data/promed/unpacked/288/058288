The Oregon Department of Agriculture has confirmed that a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain has been found in the Pacific north west. According to officials, the Eurasian strain called H5N1 is highly contagious and deadly. It is found in domestic poultry.

If you raise chickens or domestic poultry, officials said to be aware of this novel disease, practice biosecurity, and track any unusual cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these viruses have been found in the US.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January [2022] in the Atlantic coast of North America now has reached the Pacific coast. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the findings of infected wild birds first in Nebraska, Missouri, and now Oregon show that the virus is quickly moving westwards.

It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB
