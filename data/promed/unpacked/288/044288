The paper by Tamai et al (actually a letter to the New England Journal
of Medicine, 1992, Vol 327(9), 649) has been widely discussed in the
past, and has been resurrected again in current discussions. The
discussions then and now have centred on a pregnant woman suffering
from CJD, the investigation of various tissues and secretions, and the
finding of CJD agent in her colostrum [injected intracerebrally into
mice -- 2/10 mice positive at 611 days, first passage, 5/10 mice
positive at 202 (plus or minus 32) days, second passage.
Since May 1996 I have been aware of relevant information that I have
until now regretfully been unable to disclose publicly because it was
given to me in strict confidence. I have now received permission to
disclose it.
The Japanese realised back in May 1996 that there were possible
deficiencies in the paper. An unofficial translation of a Japanese
Ministry of Health and Welfare paper, with additional explanation,
indicated that there was a realisation that cross-contamination may
have occurred. As a first step the Japanese were going to re-evaluate
all their original data. It was stated that they may even repeat the
work using samples which have been retained in the laboratory, which
would take some 2 to 3 years.
It was as a result of this that the Japanese (and the Germans who were
aware of the Japanese doubts about the validity of the data) did not
contest the WHO position that bovine milk is safe; that conclusion was
not challenged at the WHO Consultation in Geneva in May 1996.
Until further information is available, the colostrum findings of the
1992 paper must be regarded as inconclusive.
I have written to Dr Tamai enquiring if he can provide more up-to-date
infomation on any subsequent work.
