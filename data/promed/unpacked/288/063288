As many as 70 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported in southern Congo, the Congolese Ministry of Health and Population announced Monday [27 Aug 2018] in a statement.

Among the prevention measures is vaccination against yellow fever for all travellers entering or leaving the country, the statement added.

"These 70 cases of yellow fever were reported in the health districts of Mongo-Pokou, Lumumba, Mvou-Mvou, Ngoyo and Tsama-Dzassi, a border district with the Republic of Angola in the departments of Kouilou and Pointe-Noire," according to the statement signed by the Minister of Health and Population, Jacqueline Lydia Mikolo.

"We invite the Congolese population and our development partners to get involved in the fight against yellow fever, which is a deadly disease," the Minister said.

[This outbreak is fairly widely distributed geographically across 5 health districts. The dates on which these cases were diagnosed are not given, so we do not have a picture of the timeframe of this outbreak. There no an indication of whether any of these 70 cases resulted in deaths. It is difficult to assess the risk of an ongoing outbreak without knowing the proportion of the unvaccinated population in the areas where the cases occurred. One hopes that a vigorous vaccination campaign will be initiated as soon as possible. Yellow fever outbreaks can quickly get out of hand, as occurred in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016-2017. - Mod.TY
