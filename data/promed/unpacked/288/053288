Locals of Jhapa's eastern VDC [village development committee], Bahundangi, have been worried with the outbreak of rabies there for the past one week.

More than half a dozen cattle including cows and buffalo have been so far killed in wards 1,2, 4, and 6 of the VDC due to rabies, while it has also affected other livestock and stray dogs.

The rabies outbreak created havoc in the VDC after a rabid dog bit domestic cattle in the 1st week of December [2012], according to the District Livestock Service Office.
