Illinois state health officials reported Tuesday [23 Aug 2022] an individual who tested positive for Heartland virus. The patient, described as an "older person who resides in a rural area of Jackson County," is the 3rd reported case in Illinois (Kankakee County and Williamson County, both in 2018).

"As people continue to enjoy summer activities like hiking and camping, it is important to take precautions against ticks," said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. "Remember to wear insect repellent when in tick habitats and check for ticks immediately afterwards."

Heartland virus was first identified in 2009 when 2 Missouri farmers who had been bitten by ticks were admitted to a hospital. Almost all individuals with Heartland virus have been hospitalized. Although most people infected have fully recovered, a few older individuals with medical comorbidities have died. There are no vaccines to prevent Heartland virus infections.

More than 50 cases of Heartland virus disease have been reported in the Midwest and southern United States since 2009.

Signs and symptoms of infection are like those of other tickborne diseases and can include fever, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and diarrhea. Most people have reported becoming sick about 2 weeks after being bit by a tick. And while there is no treatment, doctors can treat some of the symptoms.

If you have been bitten by a tick and think you may have Heartland virus or another tickborne illness, visit a health-care provider. Other tickborne illnesses Illinois residents have been diagnosed with include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and tularemia.

Ticks are commonly found on the tips of grasses and shrubs. Ticks crawl -- they cannot fly or jump. The tick will wait in the grass or shrub for a person or animal to walk by and then quickly climb aboard. Some ticks will attach quickly, and others will wander, looking for places like the ear, or other areas where the skin is thinner.

The best way to prevent infection with Heartland virus or other tick-borne illnesses is to prevent tick bites. Simple tips to avoid tick bites include the following:
- Wear light-colored, protective clothing: long-sleeved shirts, pants, boots or sturdy shoes, and a head covering.
- Treat clothing with products containing 0.5% permethrin.
- Apply insect repellent that contains 20% or more DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 on exposed skin for protection that lasts several hours.
- Walk in the center of trails so grass, shrubs, and weeds do not brush against you.
- Check yourself, children, other family members, and pets for ticks every 2-3 hours.
- Remove any tick promptly by grasping it with tweezers, as close to the skin as possible, and gently, but firmly, pulling it straight out.
- Wash your hands and the tick bite site with soap and water.

[The occurrence of another Heartland virus infection in southern Illinois is not surprising. There have been 2 previous cases in Illinois. There is no mention in the above report of the condition of the infected individual nor details of the situation where the person became infected other than it was in a rural area. Although the probable tick involved in transmission of the virus is not mentioned either, in a previous study [see citation below] in Illinois a Heartland virus-positive pool of adult male lone star ticks (_Amblyomma americanum_) was found at 2 locations, 439 km (273 mi) apart, suggesting widespread distribution in Illinois.

Heartland virus is more widely disseminated than in the states where human cases have been documented. There is evidence of its presence in wildlife in a broader area. As noted previously, a variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found signs that the Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes, and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, the serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 animals were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2110.150380). Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18% of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23966016/). These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response. - Mod.TY
