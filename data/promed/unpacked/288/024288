Nearly 10 000 ducks that died of bird flu at farms near Guangzhou's Panyu
district had been vaccinated against the disease, sparking fears that the
deadly H5N1 virus may have mutated.
According to Guangdong Animal Epidemic Prevention Center director Yu
Yedong, the 9800 ducks that died at Sixian village had been vaccinated. But
he added that the 1st vaccination could only be 65 per cent effective,
while a 2nd shot would have made it 90 per cent. He believed the birds were
infected after the 1st shot. The deaths led to a mass culling of 32 600
ducks on Friday [14 Sep 2007] in an attempt to contain the outbreak.
Health workers have been spraying disinfectant on every passing vehicle and
duck farms around the village. Panyu health official Yang Bingyou said all
poultry within 5 km of Sixian village had been registered and quarantined
and disinfection measures enforced.
Initial tests on the ducks were positive for a strain similar to the H5N1
virus. Samples were sent to the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory for further tests.
The outbreak has triggered fears in Hong Kong that the virus may have
mutated. Dr Ho Pak-leung, an infectious diseases expert at Hong Kong
University, said there were worries the virus had mutated or the vaccine
had not been effective. Lo Wing-lok, another infectious diseases expert,
called for a ban on the import of ducks from areas around Panyu.
Hong Kong Bird Watching Society chairman Cheung Ho-fai said migratory birds
from Panyu are likely to carry the virus to the territory, although
previous H5N1 cases in Hong Kong had been found to be unrelated to
migratory birds.
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said it will monitor
the situation and step up inspections at local poultry farms. Hong Kong New
Territories Poultry-Culture (geese and ducks) Mutual Aid Association
chairman Kwok Chi-yau said the outbreak has led to a 20 to 30 per cent drop
in poultry sales.

China confirms bird flu, says food supplies safe
------------------------------------------------
BEIJING, Sept 18 (Reuters): China on Tuesday sought to reassure consumers
already spooked by a slew of food scandals that poultry was safe to eat
after officials confirmed the first H5N1 bird flu outbreak since May.
The Ministry of Agriculture said on its website <http://www.agri.gov.cn/>
late on Monday that 36 130 ducks had been culled following the outbreak in
Panyu district of the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, not far from Hong Kong.
"All areas which have bird flu outbreaks have to stop trade in live poultry
across the board, and shut wet markets," Zhou Bohua, director of the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce, told a news conference in Beijing.
His department, along with the Health Ministry and other government bodies,
all worked together to cull birds and make sure slaughter houses were
regulated, he said. "For pork, poultry and other sensitive foods which have
a close relationship with people, there is supervision carried out at every
step of the way to guarantee product quality in the market," Zhou added.
The Agriculture Ministry said the Guangdong bird flu strain was confirmed
as a subtype of the H5N1 strain by the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory, but that there was no reason to panic. "At present, the
epidemic has been bought under effective control," it said, adding that
there had been no other reports of outbreaks in the nearby area.
In Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post quoted a Guangzhou official as
saying more than 100 000 birds were to be destroyed in the next few days to
prevent bird flu from spreading. "We would rather kill 100,000 ducks
wrongfully than miss even one (that has the virus)," Su Zequn, vice mayor
of Panyu county's Sixian village, told the newspaper. It also quoted Yu
Yedong, the director of the Guangdong Animal Vaccination Centre, as saying
that although almost all poultry in the province had been vaccinated, it
took at least 21 days for vaccines to create enough antibodies in birds.
On Monday, Hong Kong suspended chilled and frozen duck and geese imports
from Guangdong province following China's announcement that poultry there
was suspected to be infected with H5N1.
China's last poultry case of the virus was in May, in the central province
of Hunan. With the world's biggest poultry population and millions of
backyard birds roaming free, China is at the centre of the fight against
bird flu. There have been 25 human cases, including 16 deaths, from the
virus in China and dozens of outbreaks in birds that have led to the
culling of millions of fowl.

[Earlier media reports from China mentioned duck plague as the suspected
cause of the recorded duck mortality in Panyu; probably, this misdiagnosis
was inspired by the supposition that the affected ducks were immune to
avian influenza.
As rightly suggested by Dr Yu Yedong, initial single vaccinations confer
partial immunity only; one may add, a short lived immunity, unless booster
vaccination is carried out at the prescribed timing.
Various other reasons may lead to vaccine failure. To try to analyze them,
it would be of help if the date of vaccination, the age of the ducklings,
the type of vaccine used and the mode of its application were available. -
