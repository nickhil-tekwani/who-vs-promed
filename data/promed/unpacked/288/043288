In response to this posting, the Meat and Livestock Commission [MLC in UK
make the following observations.
When reading the latest stories outlining the theories of Professor John
Collinge, it should be borne in mind that: The prion used by Prof Collinge
in his experiment with hamsters and mice was a form of scrapie, not BSE.
The research does not contribute any new knowledge [regarding prion
diseases which have been known in the form of scrapie for more than 250
years. It has long been recognized that there may be risks from
sub-clinical BSE and that is why organs known to harbor the disease in
infected animals are removed from all cattle entering the human food chain
and destroyed. Similar precautions are also in place with sheep. Extensive
testing has been carried out on sheep in UK and no BSE has been found.
Tests have also been carried out on pigs. In one, highly infected material
was fed to pigs and they failed to succumb to the disease. The tissues of
these pigs were also tested and no evidence of infection could be found. No
meat and bonemeal - or any other mammalian remains - have been fed to any
livestock in the UK in the past 4 years.
The Acting Chairman of SEAC [Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
Professor Peter Smith, has said the controls recommended by the Committee
with respect to the protection of both human and animal health have always
been on the basis that there were likely to be undetected cases of
infection in both cattle and human populations. They have been accepted and
adopted by Government.

[It is correct to state that the experiments reported by Hill et al., did
not feature the BSE prion. This was neither implied nor stated in the
previous post. The experiments conducted by Professor Collinge's group
raise legitimate concerns about the transmission of prions between species.
In their paper, now published in PNAS, these workers report that a strain
of (scrapie-derived) hamster prions thought to be non-pathogenic for
conventional mice initiated prion replication to high levels in such mice
without producing clinical disease. Furthermore prions pathogenic in both
mice and hamsters were produced. Perhaps the most significant conclusion
from these experiments is that: "Current definitions of the species
barrier, which have been based on clinical end-points, need to be
fundamentally reassessed". The paper is now in print: Hill AF, Joiner S,
Linehan J, Desbruslais M, Lantos PL, Collinge J.
Species-barrier-independent prion replication in apparently resistant
species. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2000; 97(18): 10248-53.
