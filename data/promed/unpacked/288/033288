Ferret study underlines persistent threat of swine flu viruses
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Korean-US research team has identified an H1N2 strain of swine influenza capable of killing ferrets and spreading among them by respiratory droplets, underlining the continuing threat of swine flu to humans amid a wave of swine-origin flu cases in Americans exposed to pigs at agricultural fairs. The researchers exposed groups of ferrets, which are considered the best animal models for human flu, to 4 swine flu viruses isolated in Korea -- 2 H1N2 and 2 H3N2. One of the H1N2 isolates caused severe or fatal illness in the animals and spread to other ferrets housed nearby without direct contact, according to the scientists' report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/08/31/1205576109.abstract) [Abstract reproduced below. - Mod.CP].

In addition, when the scientists analyzed the virus in the ferrets that were infected secondarily, they found that it had 2 mutations and was able to spread even more readily to other ferrets. The findings come 3 years after another swine-origin flu virus, the 2009 H1N1 strain, triggered a pandemic, which the authors say marked the broadest known spread of a swine-origin strain in humans.

Richard J Webby, PhD, a co-author of the study, said the newly identified virus, dubbed Sw/1204, is closely related to swine H1N2 viruses in the United States. Experts say the H1N2 subtype is fairly common in swine, and a few swine-origin H1N2 infections, called H1N2v, have been identified in humans in recent years, including 4 cases in people who were exposed to pigs at the Minnesota State Fair in August 2012 [see ProMED-mail post Influenza (85): USA: (MN) swine H1N2 influenza, human cases 20120911.1290389].

Another swine-origin virus, variant H3N2, or H3N2v, has infected nearly 300 people in the United States this summer [2012], most of whom exhibited pigs or were otherwise exposed to pigs at county and state fairs. 16 patients were hospitalized, and one person, a woman who had preexisting health problems, died [see ProMED-mail posts Influenza (82): USA A(H3N2)v, first human death 20120901.1276404, and earlier].

Webby, who is with St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis [Tennessee], said Sw/1204 probably represents only a minor threat to humans, because it is related to the 2009 H1N1 strain, and therefore anyone who was exposed to the latter would have "considerable immunity" to it.

Still, the findings show the continuing pandemic potential of reassortant swine flu viruses, the researchers say. The authors write that, because swine flu surveillance is "abysmal," it is unclear whether swine flu subtypes other than H1N1 could spread among humans and cause serious illness. Their aim was to assess the zoonotic potential of representative Korean "triple-reassortant" H1N2 and H3N2 viruses that are related to North American strains. "Triple-reassortant" generally refers to flu viruses that contain genes from avian, human, and swine flu strains.

Webby said it is very unusual for a swine flu virus to cause severe illness in ferrets and that swine flu viruses typically don't spread easily among ferrets, either. By comparison, ferret experiments with the 2009 H1N1 virus showed that it generally was not lethal, though it did cause a few cases of severe illness, he told CIDRAP News. "I'd say the generalization is that the pandemic virus was a bit more able to cause disease in most [animal] models than the average swine virus," he said. Concerning the potential risk of Sw/1204 to humans, Webby said, "I think this particular one, the threat is fairly minor because it's a not-so-distant cousin of the pandemic virus itself, so anyone who was exposed to the pandemic virus would have considerable immunity to this particular strain."

Webby said the H1N2 viruses used in the study are "quite closely related" to swine H1N2 strains in the United States. "The viruses in Korea were likely imported from the US," he said. "We've done some risk assessments on some viruses circulating in the US and haven't seen any phenotypes with the properties of this [Sw/1204] virus."
Although the study generated a mutant H1N2 virus that spread more easily among ferrets while maintaining its virulence, Webby said the study did not violate the voluntary moratorium that leading flu researchers announced in January [2012] on studies involving the generation of H5N1 avian flu viruses with increased transmissibility in mammals.

Abstract
--------
"Efficient worldwide swine surveillance for influenza A viruses is urgently needed; the emergence of a novel reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009 demonstrated that swine can be the direct source of pandemic influenza and that the pandemic potential of viruses prevalent in swine populations must be monitored. We used the ferret model to assess the pathogenicity and transmissibility of predominant Korean triple-reassortant swine (TRSw) H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses genetically related to North American strains. Although most of the TRSw viruses were moderately pathogenic, one [A/Swine/Korea/1204/2009; Sw/1204 (H1N2)] was virulent in ferrets, causing death within 10 days of inoculation, and was efficiently transmitted to naive contact ferrets via respiratory droplets. Although molecular analysis did not reveal known virulence markers, the Sw/1204 virus acquired mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) (Asp-225-Gly) and neuraminidase (NA) (Ser-315-Asn) proteins during the single ferret passage. The contact-Sw/1204 virus became more virulent in mice, replicated efficiently in vitro, extensively infected human lung tissues ex vivo, and maintained its ability to replicate and transmit in swine. Reverse-genetics studies further indicated that the HA225G and NA315N substitutions contributed substantially in altering virulence and transmissibility. These findings support the continuing threat of some field TRSw viruses to human and animal health, reviving concerns on the capacity of pigs to create future pandemic viruses. Apart from warranting continued and enhanced global surveillance, this study also provides evidence on the emerging roles of HA225G and NA315N as potential virulence markers in mammals."

The Korean-US research team has identified an H1N2 strain of swine influenza capable of killing ferrets and spreading among them by respiratory droplets, underlining the continuing threat of swine flu to humans amid a wave of swine-origin flu cases in Americans exposed to pigs at agricultural fairs. However, according to Richard Webby, "the original pig virus is probably still circulating in Korea, and no one is known to have caught it. Either it doesn't do the same thing in people, or it just hasn't got loose." This could be because a strain with the same H1 surface protein circulated before 2009, making those exposed to it immune. But this effect will disappear over time as that virus no longer circulates (New Scientist 11 Sep 2012 http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22257-threatwatch-swine-flu-evolves-under-the-radar.htm). These experiments are reigniting the debate over the risk associated withe genetic manipulation of the transmissibility of influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
