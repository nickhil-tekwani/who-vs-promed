The [3rd] victim of collective food poisoning, which occurred in Ouarzazate a few days ago, died last [Fri 16 Jun 2017]. The father, who had escaped _Clostridium botulinum_ (botulism) poisoning because he was travelling, lost his wife and 2 daughters. The girl, who has been in a coma for more than 2 weeks, was buried in Meknes yesterday [Sun 18 Jun 2017]

The causes of the intoxication have not yet been clearly defined despite the analysis of all foods consumed by the victims.
