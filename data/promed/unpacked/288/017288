Non-travel associated babesiosis
----------------------------------
On 18 Aug 2000, the New York City Department of Health issued the following
alert to health care providers in New York City.
The New York City Department of Health is currently investigating 3 cases
of babesiosis in New York City residents who deny travel to known endemic
areas. The only common travel history in these individuals was to northern
Westchester County, an area not previously considered to be endemic for
_Babesia microti_. Highly endemic areas in the greater New York City region
include Suffolk County (especially Fire Island and Shelter Island) and
portions of Connecticut and New Jersey. The vector for _B. microti_ is
_Ixodes scapularis_, the tick which also transmits the agent of Lyme
disease (_Borrelia burgdorferi_) and ehrlichiosis. _I. scapularis_ is known
to be present in significant numbers in Westchester county.
Infection with _B. microti_ may be asymptomatic or present with clinical
symptoms ranging from a mild, brief illness to severe disease,
characterized by acute high fever (up to 40 degrees C) with chills,
weakness and diaphoresis. Other symptoms may include headache, nausea,
arthralgias, abdominal pain and depression. Laboratory studies may reveal
anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis and renal insufficiency. Severe cases
may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
hemolytic anemia. Patients at risk for severe disease include older
individuals, those with a history of splenectomy or immunodeficiency and
possibly males or those presenting with hepatitis on initial evaluation.
Therapy for patients (when indicated) is a combination of clindamycin and
quinine, but treatment failures are reported and alternative regimes have
been proposed in the literature.
Health care providers are encouraged to consider babesiosis during the late
spring to early fall in patients with fever and a compatible clinical
syndrome, especially in those patients at higher risk for severe disease.
As the geographic distribution of babesiosis expands, patients may still be
at risk for acquiring the disease even in the absence of a travel history
to known endemic regions. Health care providers should initially perform a
Giemsa or Wright stained blood smear to look for ring forms (which closely
resemble _Plasmodium falciparum_) and tetrad forms within red blood cells
in patients with an unexplained febrile illness, especially if accompanied
by anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis or renal insufficiency. _Babesia_
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests are available to assist
with the diagnosis if necessary. Confirmatory testing, including a review
of blood smears and _Babesia_ PCR, is available at the New York City Bureau
of Laboratories.
Preventive measures to avoid babesiosis include:
1) avoiding tick-infested areas when possible
2) wearing light-colored clothing that covers arms and legs
3) tucking pant legs into socks
4) applying diethyltoluamide (e.g., DEET) to skin and permethrin to clothing.
5) performing daily checks of skin for ticks

[Tick-borne diseases like borreliosis and babesiosis seems to be slowly
spreading into new areas. The reservoir for _Babesia microti_ is mice and
deer. The period of peak transmission is during June. It appears that a
blood film for microscopy must now be standard in every patient with
unexplained fever who has visited Westchester County and adjacent areas.
