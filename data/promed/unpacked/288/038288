The Capital Development Authority's Directorate of Health Services
(DHS) have diagnosed 10 barbers with HIV/AIDS and 52 with hepatitis
in the city during the last 3 years, Daily Times has learned.
Officials said DHS inspectors carried out regular visits to the
salons under the Municipal Bylaws and asked the employees working
there for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis tests. They said around 650 people
working at barbershops in the capital visited the DHS laboratories
during the last 3 years and that of them, 10 were positive for
HIV/AIDS and 52 for different types of hepatitis. They said the
remaining barbers did not carry any diseases. Officials said the DHS
inspectors visited 195 salons in 2006 and fined owners of 55 salons
because their workers were not tested for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
Under the laws, DHS gives 7 days to owners of unsanitary salons to
carry out these tests on their employees. In case the instructions go
unheeded, fines are handed down to salon owners.
But as the fines are generally found to be very low, barbers ignore
these notices and carry on their businesses in a manner that poses
serious threats to the health of their customers. A salon worker said
that going to DHS laboratories for AIDS and hepatitis tests consumed
a lot of time, as they were located far away. "This affects the
business, and, therefore, barbers prefer to pay small fines," he
said. He proposed the DHS arrange mobile tests for barbers. DHS
charges Rs 240 [USD 6] for these tests as compared with Rs 1000 [USD
25] being charged by private laboratories. When contacted, CDA Deputy
Director (DHS) Dr Mahmood Arshad told Daily Times that the DHS did
not allow barbers who were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis to
continue to work.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[The number of hepatitis cases since the previous report from
Islamabad in 2006 has increased slightly, and the number of HIV/AIDs
cases is quoted in this press report for the 1st time. Comparison of
the data is difficult because the periods covered are not identical,
but it would seem that the incidence of sexual and blood-borne
infections among barbers in Islamabad has not diminished despite the
systematic system of surveillance and control of the profession. - Mod.CP]
