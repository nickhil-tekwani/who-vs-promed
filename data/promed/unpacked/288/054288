WHO is collecting data on leptospirosis
---------------------------------------
The term leptospirosis covers a group of spirochaetal zoonoses with many
different presentations, which are often confused with meningitis,
encephalitis, and influenza. Many cases are asymptomatic, but liver and
kidney damage may be severe and fatal. These diseases occur worldwide,
often in workers who are exposed to livestock, wild animals, and water
exposed to animal urine, but increasingly among water sports enthusiasts.
The International Leptospirosis Society held its first meeting in 1996, at
which delegates lamented the lack of data on morbidity and mortality, and
decided to find out what was going on. Questionnaires were sent out, in
collaboration with the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations Collaborating Centre for Reference and
Research on Leptospirosis, Western Pacific Region, and the results have now
been published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record. The report's tables
include data from several European Union countries, which are summarised
here.
The cumulative incidence (per 100 000 population, but over varying periods
of time) ranges from 0.084 in the United Kingdom, 0.22 in Italy, 2 in
France, 8.92 in Belgium, & 22.5 in Portugal, to 23 in the Netherlands. Most
countries reported that 80% to 90% of cases were male, but the proportion
was lower in Portugal (61.4%). Cases of all ages were reported, but middle
aged cases were commonest.
Several animal hosts were identified: rats, pigs, wild boar, cattle,
horses, mice, buffaloes, sheep, shrews, foxes, hedgehogs, and dogs. Several
serogroups were mentioned.
