Newcastle disease kills 150 birds at Jallo park
-----------------------------------------------
Punjab Wildlife Department director General Syed Iftikhar Husain Shah told Dawn on Tuesday [6 Mar 2011] that some 150 birds had died at Jallo Wildlife Park due to a viral disease called Newcastle.

Shah said the disease had no treatment, however, he had appointed 3 vets at Jallo Wildlife Park. A vet was already working at Jallo and 2 had been transferred from Lahore Zoo and Lahore Zoo Safari. "We are trying our best to fight the disease," Shah said.

The official said healthy birds had been separated from the affected ones and the Lahore region office director had been transferred to Jallo Wildlife Park.

On the other hand, an official at Jallo Wildlife Park said about 190 birds had been killed by the disease. The official said about 20 birds died on Tuesday [6 Mar 2011] alone. This disease hit the park around Feb 22 [2012], but it became severe from Feb 29, the official said. Affected birds were being given supportive medicines, he added.

It may be mentioned that the Jallo Wildlife Park has a rich collection of birds, pheasants and peacocks and it supplies these species to other zoos and parks of Punjab under an exchange programme.

According to wildlife experts, sending and receiving of birds under the exchange programme must be watched to stop the contagious disease from spreading to other parks and zoos.

In January last the disease killed about 40 birds at the Lahore Zoo Safari Park.

[Virtually all birds are considered susceptible to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV; Fam. Paramyxoviridae). NDV has been classified into 5 pathotypes based on clinical signs in infected chickens, designated: a) viscerotropic velogenic, b) neurotropic velogenic, c) mesogenic, d) lentogenic or respiratory and e) subclinical enteric. There is not enough information in the report to be able to assign the virus in question to one of these categories, and it is unclear if there was a confirmatory diagnosis. There is also a lack of detailed information about the species affected.
