According to a Malaysian newspaper (The Star, Friday June 5, 1998), 28
babies have died in Taiwan and doctors estimated that at least 200,000
children, mostly aged below five, have been infected over the past week
across Taiwan. According to the Department of Health there, more than 100
newborn babies were being treated in intensive units. Taiwan local
newspapers said 26 of the 28 deaths were killed by combinations
(complications?) spawned by the enterovirus type 71 (EV 71). Among the
major combinations were pulmonary oedema and septicemia.
The clinical description of the cases in Taiwan is very similar to the 4
fatal cases of brainstem encephalomyelitis seen in the University Hospital
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and reported in ProMED in 1997. Unfortunately,
autopsy specimens were not available in Taiwan to confirm the involvement
of the brainstem. EV 71 was isolated in stool and throat swab specimens of
some cases.
In Malaysia, we have been monitoring the circulation of EV 71 since the end
of the outbreak in 1997. EV 71 was not isolated since November but it has
made a reappearance in May 1998 in children with hand-foot-mouth disease.
So far, there has been no severe case reported and surveillance is on-going.
Countries in the region are warned of the potential spread of this virus,
especially in those with summer just around the corner.
We have offered to share our experience with Taiwan and to any other
country which may face this problem in the future.

The following translated information was obtained from the Internet.
There is a radical change in approach to management of EV71 infection.
Chang Hua Christian Hospital has concluded, after studying information from
various sources, that their earlier approach has probably been mis-directed
because it is now thought that the cause of death in infants suffering from
fulminant EV encephalitis is brain stem disorder, and not heart failure
from myocarditis. Patients in the hospital who have been managed with this
new approach have shown improved response. This approach has been accepted
by the Infection Control Unit of the Department of Health which has
informed the various hospitals accordingly for their consideration.
Pang-chi Hospital Director informed the press this afternoon that
conventional teaching states that patients with encephalitis die from
cardiac and respiratory failure. But analysis of the 19 cases in his
hospital suggests that brain stem disorder is probably the cause of death.
Clinical response has also lend further support to this proposition. He
further pointed out that MRI study of their 3 most recent cases have shown
definite brain stem pathology. Furthermore, a search on the Internet has
come up with report of clinico-pathologic findings of 4 similar cases in
Malaysia last year. The report stated presence of pathology in the brain
stem but not the heart. This information has collaborated well with their
own findings. Thus the radical change in management approach. He further
added that the traditional teaching of encephalitis-myocarditis culminating
in respiratory failure means that the treatment would be intravenous
infusion. Whereas this outbreak's involvement of brain stem means that the
fluid infusion may aggravate brain oedema and worsening clinical condition.
Thus the hospital has now adopted fluid restriction and has found
significantly better result. He states that after consultation with Prof.
Ho, they are now grading the patients into 5 stages. Patients who, on being
as having reached graded stage 3, are treated promptly and appropriately
would show significantly better prognosis for survival. The Infection
Control Unit has circulated the criteria for the grading and a reminder for
the need for a close vigilance to all hospitals and clinics in the Island.
COMMENTS
The above article is extremely important for those involved in outbreak
investigations and Taiwan should be congratulated for coming to grips with
the situation in the following areas:
1. Outbreaks involving high mortality, especially in young children, can
become very emotional and frightening. Confusion reigns as the cause of
death is uncertain in the early period. This was experienced in Malaysia in
1997 and now in Taiwan.
The Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) was able to sieve through all the
conflicting data and concluded that the cause of death was brain stem
encephalitis and not myocarditis and suggested a new approach of management
which improved the prognosis for survival.
2. Post-mortem is extremely important in outbreak investigations. However,
due to cultural and religious sensitivities in most Asian countries,
permission is seldom, if ever, given.
MRI was used in Taiwan to show definite brain stem pathology. This is an
important finding and all countries facing the potential spread of this
virus should take note.
3. The aetiological agent or agents should be able to support the clinical
findings. The mere isolation of the agent is not sufficient proof and does
not meet Koch's postulate. Moreover, the pathological findings should be
able to support clinical diagnosis.
Despite the isolation of other enteroviruses such as Coxsackie and the
initial clinical confusion of myocarditis, the Department of Health in
Taiwan came forward strongly to clarify the issue and confirmed the cause
of death as brain stem encephalitis caused by EV71 and this was supported
by the MRI findings.
4. The radical change in treatment based on clinical staging of the disease
has led to better survival rate. We hope that Taiwan will share with the
rest of the world the criteria of staging and the method of management.

with respect to management of these illnesses. - Mod.CHC
