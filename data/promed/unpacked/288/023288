More than 140 people fall ill after eating anchovies
----------------------------------------------------
More than 140 impoverished villagers, including children, were treated in
hospital over the weekend after eating apparently contaminated anchovies in
the southern Philippines, officials said on Mon 18 Jul 2005.
Complaining of severe stomach ache, headache, and vomiting, the villagers
were brought by truck and jeeps to a small hospital in Upi town, in
southern Maguindanao province, starting on Sat 16 Jul 2005, Upi Mayor Ramon
Piang said. About 80 remained in the hospital on 18 Jul 2005, including 20
who were seriously dehydrated. Tents were set up outside for some patients,
because the hospital only had 10 beds, Piang said.
Among those hospitalized were a number of vendors who sold the cheap fish
called "bolinao", which may have been contaminated at sea or while being
handled in the local market, Piang said.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding this outbreak.
Certainly it is possible that the etiology of the outbreak could be a
poisonous substance acquired during handling; however, the fish and the
symptoms are consistent with so-called scombroid fish poisoning.
Although scombroid poisoning is commoner in nations with a warm water
fishing industry, the illness occurs worldwide. The most commonly
implicated fish species are scombroid dark meat fish (such as tuna,
mackerel, skipjack, bonito, marlin) and non-scombroid species, such as mahi
mahi (dolphin), sardine, yellowtail, herring, anchovy and bluefish.
Although rare, cases of whitefish scombrotoxism also have been reported.
The disease is caused by the ingestion of fish that have not been
adequately cooled after the action of bacterial histidinase produces
histamine. The syndrome is probably best referred to as histamine fish
poisoning, since, as mentioned above, not all cases are due to the
spiny-finned fish of the family known as _Scombridae_. Most patients
present within 15-60 minutes of toxin ingestion. The patient may note a
sharp metallic, bitter, or peppery taste to the fish and describe its
appearance as honeycombed. Patients taking isoniazid (INH) or monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may have more significant reactions because of
histaminase blockade in the GI tract.
Symptoms of histamine fish poisoning include skin flushing (typically on
the upper half of the body), headache (severe and throbbing), nausea and
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps or epigastric pain and palpitations.
Respiratory distress and chest tightness are rare, but bronchospasm and
hypotension may occur. - Mod.LL]
