Bluetongue type 6 probably vaccine virus
----------------------------------------
The EU reference laboratory in the United Kingdom has determined that
the bluetongue virus, detected in 4 animals in the Netherlands,
corresponds with a South African vaccine virus strain. The applied
measures remain provisionally in force. Animals within the
containment zone are further examined for bluetongue.

Vaccines based on modified live viruses contain a live but attenuated
virus. Some of these viruses can still be transmitted from animal to
animal. In general, such viruses will cause no disease or just slight
clinical signs. It is unknown how the animals became infected by this
vaccine virus. The live vaccine against BTV-6 is not registered in
Europe. There is no connection with the BTV-8 vaccine applied in the
Netherlands, which is based upon an inactivated (killed) virus.
Possibly, an illegally imported live virus vaccine has been used
somewhere within the wide radius of the affected farms.

Further investigation
---------------------
As directed by Minister Verburg of Agriculture, Nature and Food
Quality (LNV), the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA)
and the General Inspectorate of the Ministry started on Tue 28 Oct
2008 an investigation into the origin of the infection. In addition,
field research is conducted within the closed area to establish the
extent of the spread of this vaccine virus.

Measures
--------
Following consultation with the European Commission, Minister Verburg
has decided to maintain the existing measures for the time being. A
containment zone of about 50 km [30 miles] has been declared around
the infected holdings. Transport of animals from the containment zone
for slaughter within the country is permitted, provided no outbreak
has been confirmed on the holding of origin for at least 30 days. For
breeding and production animals, stricter rules apply. Such animals
may only be transported after being kept in vector-free conditions
and following a negative test. Their export is prohibited. This means
that pregnant breeding and production animals, which must be
vaccinated before insemination, cannot be exported. Exports from
other parts of the Netherlands are allowed, under the same conditions
currently required for the transportation of animals from the
containment zone to other parts of the Netherlands.

[The following information on the live-attenuated BTV vaccine is
available in the web-site of the producer, Onderstepoort Biological
Products (OBP); see "Bluetongue vaccine" at
<http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/prods/41.htm#>:

"A freeze-dried polyvalent vaccine containing live attenuated
bluetongue virus strains for the prophylactic immunisation of sheep
against bluetongue.

The vaccine is presented as a series of 3 separate injections with
different serotypes of bluetongue virus in each bottle. The bottles
are marked A, B and C and must be injected in the following sequence:
A, 1st; B, 3 weeks later; and the bottle marked C 3 weeks after B. If
necessary, this interval can be longer but never shorter than 3
weeks. It is necessary to inject the full series, A, B and C in order
to get the widest possible protection."

The above user's instructions are intended for the South African and
Namibian markets.

Details on the contents of the different 3 bottles are available in
the paper "The use of vaccination in the control of bluetongue in
southern Africa" by B. Dungu, T. Gerdes and T. Smit (2004),
Veterinaria Italiana, 40 (4), 616-622.

According to the said paper, bottle A includes BTV serotypes 1, 4, 6,
12, 14. Bottle B includes serotypes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11. Bottle C
includes the serotypes 2, 5, 7, 13, 19.

Results of the epidemiological investigations are anticipated with
great interests. - Mod.AS]
