Ohio State University's [OSU] Roger Bender said much of the wheat
crop is struggling. "Many days of rain during the flowering period
allowed for head scab infestation, which dramatically reduced our
yield and quality."

An OSU report says wheat in some portions of Ohio is experiencing
upwards of 60 percent incidence of head scab. The fungal pathogen
also produces mycotoxins, most notably vomitoxin, in the grain that
can be unsafe for livestock if consumed in high levels. To avoid any
health problems in animals, OSU are advising growers to test the
grain for vomitoxin levels before any of the feed or grain by-product
is destined for consumption.

The head scab infestation and another disease, stagonospora, [were]
favored [by] the weather conditions experienced this [2010] spring.
Due to the diseases, Bender said most of the wheat in the area will
be used for livestock feed, rather than the preferred milling wheat
for pastries. "It may be the highest level of head scab infestation
that a lot of people have ever experienced," Bender said.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease (current species
classification see link below). FHB causes yield losses of up to 45
percent in small grain crops and reduces the grade of harvested
grain. The disease is favoured by humid conditions during flowering
and early stages of kernel development. Symptoms include premature
bleaching of infected spikelets, production of orange, spore-bearing
structures at the base of the glumes, and visibly affected kernels.
During wet weather, there may be whitish fungal growth on infected
heads in the field. The fungi may also cause seedling blight.

Depending on the fungal species or strains involved, as well as on
environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, scab
infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins. The
produced mycotoxins include, for example, DON (vomitoxin), which can
affect stock and may lead to reduced feed consumption or feed
refusal. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected because of
toxin levels. Disease management includes timely fungicide
applications and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.

A new strain producing much higher concentration of DON is emerging
in North America (see ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211), but it is not
clear which strain is involved in Ohio.

Stagonospora glume blotch is caused by 2 fungi now classified as
_Phaeosphaeria avenaria_ f.sp. _triticae_ and _Phaeosphaeria
nodorum_. It is considered part of the septoria disease complex of
small grain crops. Symptoms on wheat include blotches on both leaves
and glumes reducing the photosynthetic ability of the host with up to
50 percent yield losses reported on susceptible varieties. Spores can
be spread by infected plant material, wind, water and mechanical
means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown
crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments
aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3
leaves of the crop canopy (which sustain the ears), removal of
inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.
