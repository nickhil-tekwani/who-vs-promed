[1] Cholera - Mozambique (Sofala Province)

The Mozambican Ministry of Health has confirmed that cholera has spread to the central province of Sofala with, to date, 260 cases, but no deaths. The figures for Sofala released at a Maputo press conference on Mon 29 Mar 2015 are that between 1 and 14 Mar 2015, there were 129 cases in the Sofala district of Caia, 91 in Nhamatanda, and 40 in the provincial capital, Beira.

Beira Municipal Council, however, flying in the face of the medical evidence, has denied there is any cholera in the city, claiming that the people hospitalised have only been suffering from severe diarrhea.

At a Beira press conference on Thu 26 Mar 2015, the Sofala provincial director of health, Chico Sande, reacted to the council, pointing out that the health authorities relied on laboratory analyses of samples of fluids taken from the patients. These proved the presence of the bacterium that causes cholera (which goes by the scientific name _Vibrio cholerae_). Exactly the same laboratory analyses had proved the presence of cholera in Caia and Nhamatanda.

[2] Cholera - Malawi (Nsanje District)

Cholera continues to haunt people in Nsanje, with latest reports indicating that cholera cases have hit 159, and that the outbreak has also spread to the area of Chief Mbenje. District Environmental Health Officer (DEHO) Veronica Mkukumira told Malawi News Agency Monday afternoon, 30 Mar 2015, that the situation was slowly getting out of hand. Mkukumira revealed that Kalemba and Sorgin health facilities which are in the area of Chief Mbenje have already treated 1 and 3 cases respectively.

"Things are getting out of hand as 27 cholera cases have been treated within the week bringing the numbers to 159 from 132 last week [week of 23 Mar 2015]. However the District Health Office is working around the clock fighting the cholera epidemic through health talks as well as cholera sensitization campaigns," she said.

On Mon 30 Mar 2015, the NGO, Churches Action in Relief and Development-CARD rescued the District Health Office with a donation of medical supplies including chlorine and oral rehydration salts (ORS) to help control the situation. Mkukumira was hopeful that such interventions would help control the situation. She hailed CARD for complementing government's efforts in controlling the outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Haiti (national)
Date: Sat 28 Mar 2015

Statistics released by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) indicate an increase in the number of cases of cholera seen in the beginning of 2015. Indeed, during the first 9 epidemiological weeks (from 1 Jan 2015 to 28 Feb 2015), 7833 suspected cases (4149 in January 2015 and 3684 in February 2015 compared to 1629 in January 2014 and 1259 in February 2014) and 72 deaths were recorded.

Moreover MSPP indicates that a 20 communes area already on red alert where over 440 cases seen have already been recorded for the 10th epidemiological week (from 3 to 9 Mar 2015). The situation is much more critical in the communes of Port-au-Prince (65 cases), St Marc (60 cases), Cabaret (47 cases), and Tabarre (40 cases).

The Ministry of Health warns that with this rise of new cases, the support structures hospitalize nearly three times more cases than in 2004 (600 in 2015 against less than 200 in 2014).

This situation raises concerns on the side of the international community, which fears a significant resurgence of the disease during the next rainy season, which begins in May in a context of under-funding and reduced humanitarian activities on the ground. In terms of responses, the agencies of the UN system through the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), UNICEF etc... and its partners have intensified the prevention and response activities to curb the epidemic. Awareness activities, decontamination of houses, distribution of chlorinated products and oral serum were held in affected communities.

However, control strategy against the epidemic in Haiti gives positive results. National and international collaborative efforts have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of people affected by cholera in the last 3 years. Each year, the number of cholera cases has been reduced by more than half and the fatality rate is below 1 percent the target rate set by the national plan for the elimination of cholera to 2015. As Haiti enters the rainy season, the prevention and rapid response efforts to alerts should be intensified.

Note that since 2010, more than 730 000 Haitians have been affected by cholera that caused more than 8700 victims [deaths]. During the same period, the Dominican Republic has reported more than 32 000 cases of cholera and 480 victims in total.
