I would like to take part in the discussion launched by Dr. Lachlam Forrow
regarding the American medical students' arrival in the Albert Schweitzer
hospital in Lambarene. I have been the medical director of this hospital
since October 1996. As usual, last year we were visited by two medical
students from USA and Switzerland, respectively. We were also joined by
several French students in the course of their apprenticeships in various
medical fields.
During the Ebola epidemic in Gabon our hospital undertook all possible and
necessary measures of prevention and precaution. We organized classes and
seminars for all staff, acquired most of the essential safety material
(namely through Dr. Forrow's generosity and assistance), instituted a medical
expert team of three doctors to set diagnosis for a possible Ebola
breakthrough [outbreak?] and secured temporary isolation premises. We were
especially concerned for the safety of our students and assistants - as much
it is possible under these circumstances.
Furthermore, as the Medical Director of this hospital I am also a member of
the Anti-Ebola Regional Committee headed by the Regional Health Director. On
this level as well, significant steps were introduced for immediate reaction
in case of Ebola [disease] detection in this region. Therefore, close
cooperation was inaugurated between the Regional Hospital and the Albert
Schweitzer hospital and a doctors' committee was organized with the aim of
reacting accordingly in case of emergency. Until now the said committee has
not positively identified a single case of Ebola in the region, contrary to
the ProMED-mail statement that we had one patient. I felt the urge to write
these details in order to shed more light and provide you with a correct
picture of what is being done with our modest funds and potential. I must
stress that medical students' welfare was, currently is, and in the future
will remain one of our main concerns.
