Kuwait confirms 5 more bird flu cases in chickens
-----------------------------------------------
Kuwait confirmed on Sunday [1 Apr 2007] 5 more cases in chickens of
the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, bringing to 101 the total number
of infected birds in the Gulf Arab country this year.
The new cases were chickens from a 4th farm in the southern region of
Wafra, where most of the bird flu infections have been found, said
Health Ministry official Ahmed al-Shatti.
He said no human infections were found after more than 500 people who
had been in contact with the birds had been tested.
Kuwaiti authorities have culled some 1.5 million birds, out of which
1.1 million were at 3 farms in Wafra near the Saudi border,
representing almost 60 percent of the country's egg hens. The
measures are hitting Kuwait's egg production, since the culled 1.1
million layers account for 88 percent of local egg needs, according
to the agricultural and fish resources authority. Kuwait has 16
broiler and layer farms.
The government has pledged to compensate farmers and bird owners for
the culling, with local daily al-Seyassah saying 15 million dinars
(USD 51.81 million) will be paid in total.
The country has closed down the zoo and poultry shops in residential
areas and banned the import of live birds.
Kuwait had reported a case of bird flu in a flamingo in 2005.

Scare over bird flu in Abbottabad
------------------------------------
The Abbottabad Cantonment Board has directed poultry shop owners to
close down their businesses after traces of bird flu were found in
the district. It also directed people to cull birds in their houses
and bury them if they found traces of the disease in them.
Sources said a large number of chickens and other birds were found
dead in different poultry farms a few days ago and after confirmation
of reports from the health department, the cantonment board issued
the above directives. It also directed chicken sellers to close
their shops and advised people not to buy poultry products until
precautionary measures were adopted.
