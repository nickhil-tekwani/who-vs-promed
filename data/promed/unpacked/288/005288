A 2-month-old Hong Kong-born infant who lives in China has contracted
a mild strain of bird flu, a health official said Tuesday [30 Dec
2008]. The baby girl, who contracted the H9 strain of avian influenza,
is currently isolated at a local [Hong Kong] hospital and is in stable
condition, Thomas Tsang, controller of Hong Kong's Center for Health
Protection, told a news conference. The baby lives with her family in
the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen but recently visited a hospital
in Hong Kong after showing symptoms, Tsang said. He said health
officials in the southern Chinese Guangdong province are trying to
determine how she caught the virus.

Tsang said Hong Kong has recorded 4 previous human cases of H9
infections. All patients have fully recovered. The case came weeks
after 3 dead chickens tested positive for bird flu in Hong Kong,
prompting the city to suspend poultry imports for 21 days and begin
slaughtering 80 000 birds [see ProMED ref. (117) below. - Mod.JW]

Hong Kong's biggest bird flu outbreak was in 1997, when the more
virulent H5N1 strain jumped to humans and killed 6 people. Bird flu
has killed at least 247 people worldwide since 2003, according to the
World Health Organization.

Hong Kong on Tuesday [30 Dec 2008] confirmed that a 2-month-old baby
girl was infected with the H9N2 bird flu strain, the 5th human case in
the city since 1999, a government health official told reporters. [She
fell ill in Guangdong province on the mainland -- see [1] above. -
Mod.JW]. Thomas Tsang, controller for the Centre of Health Protection,
said: "Today, the Centre for Health Protection confirmed one human
case of influenza H9N2 infection affecting a 2-month-old baby girl,"
adding the infant was in stable condition.

While countries around the world may be preparing for a possible H5N1
bird flu pandemic, a team of researchers said in August 2008 that H9N2
also poses a threat to humanity. H9N2, a virus seen mostly in birds,
has previously infected at least 4 children in Hong Kong, causing mild
illness, and is found in birds, pigs and other animals in Europe and
Asia.

A team of scientists from the University of Maryland, USA, St. Jude's
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and elsewhere tinkered with
the [H9N2] virus and tested it in ferrets, animals whose biology is
very close to humans when it comes to flu. A single mutation made H9N2
more virulent and pathogenic, and also helped it transmit more easily
from one ferret to another, they reported in their study published in
the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE. They also mixed H9N2
with an H3N2 virus, a type of influenza virus that causes seasonal flu
in people. Scientists believe that if a human or animal is infected
with 2 strains of flu at the same time, this "reassortment" can happen
in nature. The reassorted virus was easier for the ferrets to catch
and transmit.

There are hundreds of strains of avian influenza viruses, but only 4
-- H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2 -- are known to have caused human
infections, according to the World Health Organization.

[In 1999, an influenza A (H9N2) virus was isolated from 2 patients
(aged one and 4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong
Department of Health. Both girls recovered fully. This was the 1st
occasion that an H9N2 virus had been isolated from humans in Hong
Kong, although influenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from
ducks and chickens for several years previously.

The most recent human case occurred in March 2007, again a mildly ill
child. In each instance, there was no further spread of infection.

The current case is distinct from the others in that the child became
ill in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen prior to hospitalization
in Hong Kong.

Other avian influenza viruses have been isolated from human patients,
notably the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997 and subsequently
worldwide, and H9N2 (and H5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the
more extensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands earlier in 2003.
On these occasions, only the H5N1 viruses caused severe disease in
humans. No evidence of transmission of H9N2 virus among humans was
observed.

Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding the exposure of these
children to H9N2 virus infection have not been recorded. There is no
indication that the current case is any more severe than the
preceding cases. Further information regarding the present case is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
