More than 5600 measles cases were reported during the week ending 11 Aug [2019] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), including 141 deaths, from 23 of the 26 provinces of the country, according to the latest published data.

Since the beginning of the year [2019], 155 460 total measles cases have been recorded. 1/3 of the health zones in the DRC have reported confirmed measles outbreaks. A nearly 2% case fatality rate, or 2953 deaths, has been reported. Nearly 60% of cases reported in 2019 have been notified from Tshopo, Lualaba, Kasai, and Haut-Lomami provinces.

Earlier this month [August 2019], the World Health Organization reported that globally in the 1st 6 months of 2019, reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006. There have been almost 3 times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year [2018].

Measles cases have been confirmed in more than 50 schools in the Auckland region since the beginning of this year's [2019's] outbreak. There have been 778 cases confirmed in the region as of Saturday [31 Aug 2019], with 19 new diagnoses since Friday [30 Aug 2019], the Auckland Regional Public Health Service said.

Medical officer of health Dr William Rainger said it was seeing 18-20 new cases per day, which had been constant for the last week. The majority of the cases were in south Auckland and in children under age 5 and young people between 15 and 29.

"Some of these people have been very, very unwell, however there have been no deaths as of yet," Dr Rainger said.

The ministry modified its standard MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination catch-up advice this week. Under its new recommendations, babies as young as 6 months may now be vaccinated for measles at their doctor's discretion if parents have concerns about their potential exposure.

Demographics also played a part. "We have a lot of pacific families, and it's a relatively young population as well, both of which we are seeing increasing numbers compared to the total number of cases," Dr Maria Poynter from the Auckland Regional Public Health service said.

Measles cases increased by 962% in Negros Occidental in 2019, according to the provincial health office. At least 828 cases and 5 deaths were reported from 1 Jan - 3 Aug [2019] compared to only 72 cases during the same period last year [2018].

Provincial health officer Ernell Tumimbang said 54% of the patients have no vaccination against measles.

Negros Occidental Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson said the increase in the number of measles cases is not considered alarming. He said the provincial government is more focused in its campaign against dengue.

37 people have died of dengue in the province since January [2019].

[5] Update: surge in cases
Date: Thu 29 Aug 2019
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/29/lives-at-risk-from-surge-in-measles-across-europe-experts-warn


The dramatic surge in measles across Europe is putting lives at risk, experts have said, as official figures showed the number of cases in the 1st half of 2019 outstripped that for the whole of last year [2018].

Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed nearly 90 000 cases and 37 deaths were reported across 48 of the 53 countries in the WHO European region in the 1st 6 months of 2019.

There were 84 462 cases in the region in the whole of 2018, with 44 175 by the end of June that year [2018]. In 2016 there were only 5273 cases.

Ukraine appears to be particularly affected, with more than 54 000 cases and 18 deaths in the 1st 6 months of 2019.

There are other signs that progress on measles has deteriorated. Early this month [August 2019] the UK lost its "measles-free" status, which Public Health England said was down to the recent boom in cases and the lengthy presence of one particular strain.

In the 1st 6 months of 2019, 489 cases of measles were reported in the UK, 69 of which have been confirmed as imported from abroad.

The new report adds that 3 other countries -- Albania, Czech Republic, and Greece -- have also had their measles elimination status removed.

"Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning," said Dr Gunter Pfaff, the chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC), which produced the report. "If high immunisation coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily, and some will tragically die."

Andrew Pollard, a professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford University, said the report was a wake-up call for Europe. "The loss of our status tells us that we have lost control of immunisation against measles," he said, although he added that the situation was salvageable and not as bad as it was in the 1960s, before a measles vaccine was available.

Some countries have shown improvements: Austria and Switzerland have gained measles-free status, while Belgium and Kazakhstan are experiencing an interruption in endemic transmission, which needs to last for 36 months for a country to be deemed measles-free.

But overall the number of countries judged to have eliminated the disease fell from 37 to 35 between 2017 and 2018.

Prof Martin Marshall, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs, decried the latest figures. "It is disheartening to see these findings at a time when we and other countries across Europe were on the way towards completely eradicating measles, a potentially deadly but entirely preventable disease," he said. "We talk a lot about the unvaccinated and the people not taking the vaccine, and the risks to them and to their children, but actually the biggest risks are in those who can't be vaccinated," said Pollard. "They absolutely rely on society to make sure that the virus is kept away and to protect them and also potentially to save their lives."

According to the latest statistics, covering 2017/2018, just 87.2% of children in England had both doses of the MMR vaccine by their 5th birthday, a fall from 87.6% the year before [2016/2017].

Across the European region as a whole, the WHO says there is 91% coverage of full immunisation. A 2017 study said that a 5% drop in coverage could result in a 3-fold increase of measles cases.

The WHO has revealed it is developing a strategic response plan for the whole region, as well as focusing on specific countries including Ukraine. Since May [2019] it has classed the circulation of measles in Europe as a grade 2 emergency.

Experts say inadequate vaccination rates are linked to the anti-vaxxer movement, which has been fuelled by false claims over the safety of the MMR vaccine.

"It is clear that we are still suffering from entirely debunked claims around MMR that were perpetuated in the '90s and are now resurgent on social media and other online platforms," said Marshall.

This month [August 2019], Boris Johnson urged parents to make sure their children were vaccinated and said social media companies needed to do more to combat the spread of misinformation. Some platforms have already taken action: Pinterest announced on Wednesday [28 Aug 2019] that it had tightened its rules to fight vaccine myths.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said vaccines were estimated to save at least 2 million lives a year.

"Social media platforms are the way many people get their information, and they will likely be major sources of information for the next generations of parents. We see this as a critical issue and one that needs our collective effort to protect people's health and lives," he said, adding that governments must also build health systems that could be trusted and respond to parents' concerns and needs.

[6] Loss of measles-free status

Measles cases are surging in Europe and have been reported from 4 countries previously considered to have eliminated it, including the United Kingdom, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Urging the European countries to step up vaccination efforts, the WHO on Thursday [29 Aug 2019] said based on 2018 data, measles is no longer considered eradicated in the UK, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Albania.

The UK reported 953 cases in 2018 and 489 for the 1st 6 months of 2019. In the same periods, Greece reported 2193 and 28 cases, Albania [reported] 1466 and 475, and the Czech Republic [reported] 217 and 569.

In the 53 countries of Europe, 90 000 measles cases were recorded in the 1st half of this year [2019], already more than that for all of 2018, said Siddhartha Datta, from the WHO's regional office for Europe.

"Each of these countries are examples that have extremely high national vaccination coverage. So these are not examples of countries that have particularly weak systems," said Kate O'Brien, director of the WHO's Immunization Department. "This is the alarm bell that is ringing around the world: being able to achieve high national coverage is not enough; it has to be achieved in every community, and every family for every child," she said.

Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease that can kill or disable children, is considered eliminated when there is no endemic disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area. While the disease is highly contagious, it can be entirely prevented through a 2-dose vaccine, but the WHO has in recent months sounded the alarm over vaccination rates.

Most regions in the world are experiencing an increase in the number of cases of measles, the WHO said.

Nearly 365 000 cases have been reported globally this year [2019], the highest figure since 2006, said WHO, noting that they represent only a fraction of the 6.7 million suspected cases.

Measles caused an estimated 109 000 deaths in 2017, the WHO's most recent figures show.

The biggest outbreaks are raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo (155 460 cases), Madagascar (127 454 cases), and Ukraine (54 246 cases), it said.

The United States has recorded 1215 measles cases across 30 states in its worst outbreak since 1992, federal health officials said on Monday [26 Aug 2019].

"Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning," warned Gunter Pfaff, the head of the WHO's European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination. "If high immunisation coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily, and some will tragically die," she added.

Health experts say the virus has spread among school-age children whose parents declined to give them the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease.

Trust in vaccines -- among the world's most effective and widely used medical products -- is highest in poorer countries but weaker in wealthier ones where skepticism has allowed outbreaks of diseases such as measles to persist, a global study found in June [2019].

The resurgence of measles is partially to blame on the so-called "anti-vax" movement, which spreads false claims that vaccinations are the cause for, among other things, autism. As a result of this campaign, many people, especially in the US but also in Europe, choose not to vaccinate their children against measles, decreasing the vaccination rate and endangering people around them.

A 2018 Gallup institute study showed that 33% of people in France and 21.5% in Switzerland did not consider measles vaccines to be "safe." In comparison, Bangladesh and Rwanda had the highest levels of confidence, with nearly 100% considering them to be safe.

"Misinformation about vaccines is as contagious and dangerous as the diseases it helps to spread," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement this week.

Brazil's Health Ministry said Thursday [29 Aug 2019] that a 42-year-old man died from measles in Sao Paulo. He was not vaccinated against the disease.

Nearly all the measles cases recorded this year [2019] in Brazil are in the state of Sao Paulo, where health authorities have confirmed 2457 cases.

Brazil received a measles eradication certificate from the Pan American Health Organization in 2016, but the disease returned in January 2018 from people immigrating from Venezuela.

Measles cases also have surged in Europe and parts of the United States. Health authorities blame that on people refusing vaccines.

The Pan American Health Organization says Brazil recorded more than 10 000 cases of measles with 12 deaths last year [2018].

There's a "reasonable chance" that the US will soon lose its status as a country that has eliminated measles. That's according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The World Health Organization considers a disease eliminated from a country or region if it has gone at least 12 months without continuous spread of said disease. (This is different from disease eradication, which is when a disease is completely stamped out globally. Humans have only managed to eradicate 2 diseases: smallpox and rinderpest, which infects cattle and other ruminants.)

The US triumphantly declared measles eliminated in 2000 after spending decades tenaciously working to promote widespread vaccination. (The CDC had originally hoped to have it eliminated by 1982.) And in 2016, the WHO declared measles eliminated from the Americas altogether. WHO's Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO) celebrated the news with announcements titled, in part, "Bye, bye measles!"

But now -- after a global resurgence of the highly infectious viral illness, spurred partly by misinformation and vocal anti-vaccine advocates -- both of those achievements are close to being undone.

Massive outbreaks of measles ignited late last September [2018] in New York. The disease has continued to spread in flare-ups around the country, sickening a total of 1215 people since the start of 2019. This week [week of Mon 26 Aug 2019], the CDC reported 12 new cases from the week before. Experts expect the weekly case counts will rise with the start of school, and they're bracing for a stinging defeat.

"We're embarrassed. We're chagrined," infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University told CNN.

Messonnier echoed the feeling, telling CNN: "It certainly is incredibly frustrating and upsetting to the public health community that we may lose measles elimination status, because we do have a safe and effective vaccine."

The US wouldn't be alone in its humiliating defeat. Earlier this month [August 2019], the WHO determined that the UK had lost its measles-elimination status, which it had won only in 2017.

"Losing our 'measles-free' status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated," Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at Public Health England, said in a tweeted statement.

Schaffner and others in the public health community blame vaccine misinformation as well as themselves for the losses, saying that they were not fast and effective enough to protect the public. "I think this was not our finest hour," Schaffner said.

In a statement released today [Wed 28 Aug 2019], WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the problem of vaccine misinformation directly.

"Misinformation about vaccines is as contagious and dangerous as the diseases it helps to spread," he said in the statement. While he urged governments to strengthen health services, he called upon social media platforms and the private sector in general to help in the fight. "I call upon them to do more to filter out misinformation and inaccuracies that prevent people from achieving health and well-being."

In April [2019], the World Health Organization reported that worldwide cases of measles in the 1st 3 months of 2019 were 300% higher than those in the 1st 3 months of 2018. In 2017, the most recent year for which there's complete data, measles caused close to 110 000 deaths.

[Rockland County] has documented a total of 312 measles cases since the outbreak began in October [2018] [revised total]. On 20 Aug [2019], the total was 296. But none of the newly documented cases included current measles cases, Rockland officials said.

"These are historic cases," said Rockland County spokesman John Lyon. "Just to bring everyone up-to-date on the full extent of the outbreak."

The 16 documented cases occurred between early February and mid-May [2019], Lyon said. Blood tests collected months after the illness confirmed measles. "This is just another example of the diligence of the team at (the Rockland County Health department) and shows the level of detail they look for when investigating cases," Lyon said Tuesday [27 Aug 2019].

Worldwide and nationwide, measles rates have increased. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 1215 cases have been confirmed in the United States this year [2019], as of 22 Aug [2019]. Cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/24/disneyland-measles-new-zealand-teen-exposure


A teenage girl from New Zealand sick with measles visited Disneyland and other popular tourist stops across southern California earlier this month [August 2019], possibly infecting others, local government health officials warned. The alert comes amid the worst outbreak of measles in the US in a quarter of a century, with more than 1200 cases reported across 30 states since October 2018, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is looking to identify others who are at risk for measles and may have been exposed to a non-resident measles case that traveled to Los Angeles county while infectious," the health department said in an advisory.

The Orange County Health Care Agency said the girl was in southern California from 11-15 Aug [2019]. [See URL for locations and times where exposure to measles may have occurred. - Mod.LK]

So far in 2019, a total of 16 measles cases have been reported among Los Angeles County residents, and 11 infected people are known to have traveled through the county.

The CDC said earlier this week [week of Mon 26 Aug 2019] that there had been a 1.8% increase in the number of cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly virus in the US between 8-15 Aug [2019].

The disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission for at least a year. CDC officials say the US risks losing its measles elimination status if the current outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.

[Fortunately, this exposure has not led to a situation like that in 2014-2015, when measles surfaced at Disney theme parks in December and spread to a half dozen U.S. states, Mexico, and Canada. The outbreak sickened 147 people in the U.S., including 131 in California. There were no deaths. In the Canadian province of Quebec, 159 people were sickened. Most belonged to a tight-knit religious community with a low vaccination rate. - Mod.LK]

WHO director-general statement on the role of social media platforms in health information

Misinformation about vaccines is as contagious and dangerous as the diseases it helps to spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes Pinterest's leadership in protecting public health by only providing evidence-based information about vaccines to its users. We hope to see other social media platforms around the world following Pinterest's lead.

Misinformation about vaccination has spread far and fast on social media platforms in many different countries, including during critical vaccination campaigns like those for polio in Pakistan or yellow fever in South America.

Social media platforms are the way many people get their information, and they will likely be major sources of information for the next generations of parents. We see this as a critical issue and one that needs our collective effort to protect people's health and lives.

The truth is, vaccines work. Smallpox has been eradicated, thanks to vaccines, and vaccines have brought us to the brink of eradicating polio. Rates of many other diseases including measles have been dramatically reduced, thanks to the lifesaving power of vaccines.

Vaccines are one of the most powerful innovations in the history of public health and one of the best investments in a healthier, safer world. WHO estimates that vaccines save at least 2 million lives every year. Countless more children avoid debilitating diseases, prolonged hospital stays, and time out of school.

At the same time, a social media response -- while absolutely necessary -- is just one part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring broad trust in vaccination; this also requires substantive efforts by governments in building health systems that are worthy of that trust and respond to parents' needs and concerns.

Ultimately, there is no health for all without vaccines for all. I look forward to seeing the private sector more fully embracing the #healthforall mission and making lifesaving health information more readily available to their users. And I call upon them to do more to filter out misinformation and inaccuracies that prevent people from achieving health and well-being. #VaccinesWork
