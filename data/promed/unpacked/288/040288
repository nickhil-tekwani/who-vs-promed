The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has instructed 81 provincial directorates to stop lumpy skin disease (LSD) vaccination. Gülay Ertürk, President of the Veterinarians Association, stated that there is currently uncertainty regarding the allegations and said, "Normally, there is no disease from the vaccine. The vaccine is given to strengthen the immune system of the animal. But if there is any problem with the content of the vaccine and the conditions it is in, it is possible to talk about such things only in those cases," he said.

In the news published in the Milli Gazete with the signature of Sadettin Inan, it was claimed that the BVD [bovine viral diarhea] virus was involved in the LSD (capripox) vaccine, which is one of the mandatory vaccines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which was applied during the spring months, and that this situation was concealed by the Ministry.

Harun Seçkin, General Director of Food and Control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, sent a letter to the provincial directorates of agriculture today [Tue 12 Apr 2022] with the code 'rush'. The letter, addressing "LSD and FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] vaccination," includes the following: "Within the scope of the animal diseases control program carried out by our Ministry, vaccines for both diseases are applied simultaneously for protection against LSD and FMD. I would like to request that the vaccination be limited to the FMD vaccine application until the 2nd instruction is being sent by our General Directorate and that the use of LSD vaccination should be stopped throughout your province.

Gülay Ertürk, President of the Veterinarians' Association, said that the non-mandatory BVD vaccine was administered for a disease that spreads rapidly among animals, progresses with diarrhea, and causes low productivity.

Ertürk said that lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a contagious skin disease (pox) seen in cattle and it is mandatory to report it. Ertürk stated that the LSD vaccine should be given in the spring months and usually administered by veterinarians working in the public sector. Cattle not suitable for vaccination are vaccinated in autumn. There is no such vaccination requirement for other BVD," he said.

Ertürk stated that there is currently uncertainty regarding the allegations and that they are waiting for the explanations from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. He added: "Normally, there is no disease from the vaccine. On the contrary, the vaccine is made to strengthen the immune system of the animal and not get sick. But if there is any problem with the content of the vaccine and the conditions it is in, it is possible to talk about such things only in those cases. There are things that we don't know about BVD and LSD at the moment," he said.

[Both LSD and BVD are OIE-listed cattle diseases. LSD, caused by a capripox virus, mostly insect-borne, was initially restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. Since the start of the current century it has been spreading widely in Eurasia. Vaccination against this disease has become compulsory in many of the affected countries being the most effective control and prevention measure. Only live-attenuated vaccines are available commercially.

BVD is caused by a pestivirus which is closely related to classical swine fever (CSF) and ovine border disease (BD). Animals that survive in-utero infection in the first trimester of gestation are almost always persistently infected. BVD is less invasive than LSD and the application of its vaccines is mostly voluntary.

Pestiviruses are long known as potential contaminants of biological products produced in bovine or porcine cells or manufactured via processes using animal-derived raw materials such as bovine serum. Contamination of live animal vaccines with pathogenic viruses is a serious hazard requiring the full attention of those (in-plant and external/official) bodies responsible to assure the safety of biologicals. As indicated in OIE's manual (chapter 3.04.12, Lumpy Skin Disease), addressing safety and efficacy test procedures, each master seed must be tested to ensure its identity and shown to be free from adventitious viruses, in particular pestiviruses, such as border disease (BD) and bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus. Similarly, serum used in the growth or maintenance medium must be free from contamination with pestivirus.

The production of different viral vaccines within the same plant may be related to such contamination, particularly when there are gaps in the prescribed biosecurity in the plant.
