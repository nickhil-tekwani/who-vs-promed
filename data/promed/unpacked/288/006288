On [5 Feb 2018] the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition, through the Coordinated System of Rapid Information Exchange (SCIRI), learned of the existence of [a 39-year-old man; see 20180209.5618781] in the Community of Madrid affected by meningitis as a result of food intoxication by _Listeria monocytogenes_, presumably associated with the consumption of soft milk sheep cheese made by the company Ohian Txiki Koop located in the Basque Country. The affected [person is recovering] favorably.

The allegedly involved cheeses are the following: Gutizia, a raw sheep milk cheese; Txuria, a soft cheese from raw sheep milk; and Beltza, a lactic cheese-curl of raw sheep's milk.

The manufacturer has distributed these products to the autonomous communities of Madrid, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. As of [7 Feb 2018] there is evidence that there has been a small redistribution of a few units from Madrid to Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha, Castile and Leon, Extremadura, Galicia, Valencia, and Portugal.

The removal of all batches of raw soft-ewe sheep milk cheese is being carried out.

This information has been communicated through the national alert network to the competent authorities in the autonomous communities who are carrying out the appropriate actions, as well as to the competent Portuguese authorities through the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.

As a precautionary measure, people who have any of these products at home are advised to refrain from consuming them. If they have consumed them and present any unusual symptoms, it is recommended that they go to a health center.

Has the cause of the meningitis in the 39-year-old in Spain been determined, and is more known about the patient? _Listeria_ would seem to be less likely in a patient this age unless they were immunocompromised. A more likely cause of meningitis related to the consumption of unpasteurized cheese in an immunocompetent 39 year old would be _Brucella_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Irene Lai and Allen Lenoir for providing their contributions.

Dr Lenoir is correct. As I stated in my moderator comments (see 20180209.5618781), listeriosis affects mainly pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and adults with impaired immune systems. Invasive disease, like meningitis, due to _Listeria monocytogenes_ would be uncommon in an immune competent 39-year-old man, but certainly invasive disease in apparently immunocompetent non-elderly adults has been reported (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6428282, https://ojs.library.dal.ca/DMJ/article/download/3793/3465, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771898/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22760149, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0b1e/3e311e79f55e4e80c82eee5a4c9512cea0a1.pdf).

More information on the 39-year old man in Madrid who developed _Listeria_ meningitis would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
