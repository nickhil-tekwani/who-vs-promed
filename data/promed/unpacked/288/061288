Indonesia has cleared 6 members of a family hospitalised with bird
flu symptoms, a health official said on Sat 22 Dec 2007, in a case
that has raised concerns over potential human-to-human spread of the
disease. It also comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO)
investigates a suspected case of limited human-to-human transmission
of the H5N1 bird flu virus in Pakistan. The 6 Indonesians from a
small village in Banten province, just hours from the capital
Jakarta, had been suffering from high fever after more than a dozen
sick ducks died in their backyard.
Two sets of laboratory tests showed the 6 admitted to a hospital in
Jakarta on Fri 21 Dec 2007 did not have the H5N1 virus, said Nyoman
Kandun, director-general of communicable disease control at
Indonesia's health ministry. "Clearly, it's not a cluster. We do not
even have a confirmed bird flu case here," Kandun said by telephone.
Authorities treat cases where family members living together show
symptoms of bird flu with particular care since it could point to
human-to-human transmission of the virus.
Although bird flu remains mostly an animal disease, experts fear the
virus could mutate into a form that passes easily from person to
person, triggering a global pandemic in which millions could die.
Indonesia has had the highest number of human infections globally
with 115 confirmed human cases of bird flu, out of which 93 have been
fatal. The largest known cluster of human bird flu cases worldwide
occurred in May 2006 in the Karo district of Indonesia's North
Sumatra province, where as many as 7 people in an extended family died.
Pakistan said last week 8 people had been infected since late October
[2007], including a veterinarian involved in culling whose 2 brothers
died. A WHO team has investigated the outbreak and international
laboratory results on samples taken are expected at the weekend. The
WHO suspects there has been only limited human-to-human transmission
in Pakistan, but international test results are pending, David
Heymann, WHO assistant director-general for health security and
environment, said on Friday [21 Dec 2007]. He said no new suspected
human bird flu cases had emerged in Pakistan since 6 Dec 2007,
signalling there had been no further spread.
Millions of people in Indonesia, a complex archipelago comprising
thousands of islands and hundreds of languages, live in close
proximity to poultry, keeping backward fowl for eggs and meat to
supplement their income. Since H5N1 resurfaced in Asia in late 2003,
the virus has killed 209 people in 11 countries, according to the WHO.

[The suspected cluster of cases in Banten province on the island of
Java (see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (173): Indonesia

confirm H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in any of the 6
patients. - Mod.CP]
