[With this official report, Egypt joins the growing number of countries infected with HPAI H5N8, and the 1st country in the African continent to notify this subtype.

The coot (_Fulica atra_) inhabits a large part of Eurasia, from the Iberian Peninsula and Scandinavia to India, China, Japan and eastern Siberia. It is known also in Australia and in north western Africa. In a large part of Europe, it is sedentary; the populations of the north and north east of the continent are wintering in south western Europe, in the Balkan Peninsula, and in North Africa.
