Missouri now has its first confirmed case of a virus that affects hooved livestock, including horses and cattle. The Missouri Department of Agriculture says that Missouri state veterinarian Dr Steve Strubberg announced the state's first case of vesicular stomatitis in a horse in Newton County on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020]. Missouri is the 7th state to confirm the virus this year [2020].

The Missouri Department of Agriculture is urging horse owners to monitor their livestock closely and call their veterinarian if symptoms arise. Vesicular stomatitis is a contagious, non-fatal virus that primarily affects horses and cattle by causing a fever and vesicular lesions. The virus has not yet been confirmed in Illinois.

In its 7 Jul 2020 situation report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed Montgomery County as newly infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), with one confirmed positive equine premises. Since the previous situation report on 2 Jul [2020], officials have confirmed 9 new premises as positive and identified 4 new suspect equine premises.

Counties with new VSV cases include
- Butler (4 new confirmed positive premises -- 3 equine and 1 cattle -- and 1 new suspect equine premises);
- Cowley (1 new confirmed positive cattle premises and 2 new suspect premises, 1 equine and 1 cattle);
- Greenwood (1 new confirmed positive and 1 new suspect premises, both equine);
- Montgomery (1 new confirmed positive equine premises); and
- Sedgwick (2 new confirmed positive equine premises).

Previously VSV-infected or suspect premises that have been released from quarantine include the following counties:

- Butler (13)
- Cowley (1)
- Sedgwick (3)

Veterinarians quarantine and monitor premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Background
Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2-3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot and mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has now been confirmed in 10 counties in Kansas, according to the Kansas Department of Agriculture. The KDA's Division of Animal Health says they continue to respond to the outbreak, which began in south-central Kansas in mid-June [2020].

Counties impacted by the virus include Butler, Chase, Cowley, Greenwood, Marion, Miami, Montgomery, Morris, Sedgwick, and Sumner with more than 60 premises having tested positive. KDA is also awaiting laboratory results from symptomatic animals in other counties.

The premises with confirmed case of VSV in horses have all been quarantined along with any premises with animals showing clinical signs consistent with VSV. At this point, over 70 premises have been released from quarantine.

"As this VSV outbreak continues, we ask all owners of horses and other livestock to monitor your animals for signs of VSV and be in communication with your veterinarian if you see anything of concern," Dr Justin Smith, animal health commissioner said. "You can help slow the spread of this virus by taking aggressive steps to limit exposure to insects, the primary source of infection, and by keeping your horses separate from other horses that may be infected."

VSV has also been confirmed in Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Animal health officials strongly encourage all livestock owners and veterinarians to call the animal health authority in the destination location for the most current import requirements prior to travel.

More information on VSV, treatment, reporting, and regulations can be found at <www.agriculture.ks.gov/VSV>.

[Vesicular stomatitis shows no signs of diminishing its hold on the USA. Unfortunately, the USDA and other sources have not informed us of the serotype of these outbreaks. It is likely that a mixture of strains is responsible. - Mod.TG
