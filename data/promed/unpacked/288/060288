Comment
-------
In a study reported by ProMED, a test for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) gave no (false) positive result among 5000 US blood donors, the unspecificity thus being zero. As a rule of thumb, the upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of that unspecificity would be 3 in 5000, or about 3000 in the about 5 million blood donations donated in Germany each year. The rate of true positives is very close to zero because blood donors are selected against a risk of vCJD by questionnaire. Before starting large scale screening one should very carefully think what to do with this possible number of false positives and what catastrophe for the donor (and the blood donation system) this might create.

[The current situation is that the number of cases reported in the UK is 176, of whom all 176 have died. Results from modelling the underlying incidence of diagnoses and deaths indicate that the epidemic reached a peak in about the year 2000, when there were 27 diagnoses and 28 deaths, and has since declined to a current incidence of about 1 to 2 diagnoses/deaths per year. There is evidence that the epidemic curve is skewed with an extended tail. Looking at onsets shows similar results with evidence of an extended tail. An analysis that looked at deaths by birth cohort (pre-1970, 1970s, 1980s) showed that the shape of the epidemic differs between cohorts, mainly due to the fact that deaths of individuals born in the 1980s were only seen from 1999 onwards. It is important to note that although a peak in cases has been passed, it is possible that there will be future peaks, possibly in other genetic groups. To date, however, there is no evidence of a 2nd wave [See: James W Ironside and Mark W Head, Prion disease update (01) 20140221.2292526].

There is also the possibility of ongoing person-to-person spread as seen with 4 cases of transfusion association vCJD infection to date, who received blood in 1999 or earlier from donors who were later diagnosed with clinical vCJD. A total of 3 of these individuals developed vCJD (1 diagnosed in 2003 and 2 in 2006), whilst the 4th died from causes unrelated to vCJD, but was found on post mortem examination to have abnormal prion protein present in the spleen and a lymph node [See: in ProMED-mail archive number 20140221.2292526].

However, at the very least, this report will provide some assurance for the population of the United States that it is unlikely to have been directly exposed to CJD infection. - Mod.CP]
