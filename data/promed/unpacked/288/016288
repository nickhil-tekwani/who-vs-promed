Measles outbreak in north eastern Bulgarian village
---------------------------------------------------
A total of 17 people diagnosed with measles have been admitted to the
infectious disease ward of a hospital in the north eastern town of Silistra
between 3 and 24 May 2009, announced Dr Teodora Nacheva, director of the
Infectious Diseases Unit of the Regional Inspectorate for Public Health
Preservation and Control in the municipality of Silistra.

The focus of the epidemic is in the north eastern village of Poroyno,
municipality of Dulovo. 10 people from the village have been admitted to
hospital. At the weekend 7 more children from the village were admitted.

A small family focus has been formed in the town of Dulovo as 3 children
from one family are infected with measles [virus]. All infected people are
of Roma origin. Most of these children do not have a general practitioner
and no one [knew] their immunization status. Roma communities are very
mobile, with great migration, low hygienic and health culture, which helps
the development of the disease among their community, the doctor said.

[The Roma people, often referred to as gypsies, are a heterogeneous ethnic
group who live in many countries of the world but primarily in Europe.
While the term gypsy is often attached to anyone leading a nomadic life,
the Roma share a common biological, cultural, and linguistic heritage that
sets them apart as a genuine ethnic group. This outbreak appears to be
confined to members of a Roma community in north eastern Bulgaria who have
escaped routine measles vaccination.

The municipality of Dulovo can be located near the border with Romania in
