The Oregon Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Laboratory detected a presumptive positive equine infectious anemia horse during routine Coggins testing on [Tue 29 May 2018]. Confirmatory testing by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratory is in progress. ODA is proceeding with preliminary disease control actions.

The presumptive positive horse is a 7-year-old quarter horse mare currently housed at the Grants Pass Downs on the Josephine County Fairgrounds, ODA reported [Fri 1 Jun 2018]. A quarantine has been issued and follow-up tracing and testing for high-risk contact horses is underway. The presumptive positive horse originates from a farm in southern Oregon. There is no known history of interstate travel.

"There has been excellent cooperation with owners, facility managers and other officials," the agency said.

All horse owners are encouraged to establish good biosecurity practices such as avoiding sharing needles and syringes among horses. Concerned owners should contact their veterinarian to discuss EIA testing details.

[A puzzler especially as our records lack any prior Oregon cases, but it is still just a "suspect." We await news of confirmation, or not.
