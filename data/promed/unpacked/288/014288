A U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA advisory panel voted on Friday to
approve a new vaccine against the often deadly diarrhea and vomiting caused
by rotavirus[es, the cause of many childhood infections. The vaccine, to be
sold under the name RotaShield, prevents the most severe effects of
infection, which kill up to a million babies and children each year
worldwide. Makers Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics, a division of
American Home Products, hope the vaccine will become one of childhood's
routine inoculations. They recommended it be given orally to infants at two,
four and six months of age.
Roger Glass, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), told the panel that rotaviruses were responsible for
55,000 hospital stays a year and anywhere between 150 and 300 deaths a year
in the United States. Probably every child in the United States become
infected with the virus at some point but only a few become ill, Glass said.
The total cost of illnesses from the virus came to $1 billion a year. "A
rotavirus vaccine would have a significant impact," Glass told the panel,
whose advice is usually followed by the FDA.

In three trials done in the United States and Finland, the vaccine worked to
prevent severe illness in between 70% and 91% of cases, but the vaccine
prevented milder episodes of sickness in only 66-68% of cases in the United
States and was only 39-40% effective against all rotaviruses. However,
panel members said they were impressed that the vaccine prevented the most
severe, and dangerous, episodes. "Vaccine efficacy is solid for severe
rotavirus gastroenteritis, and that's what we should be worried about," said
committee member Herbert DuPont of St Luke Episcopal Hospital in Houston.
The panel voted that it seemed mostly safe to give with other childhood
vaccines but asked for other studies. The National Institutes of Health and
CDC would decide how widely the vaccine should be given; the American
Academy of Pediatrics also takes a leading role in deciding such issues. "If
approved by the FDA, Wyeth hopes to get the vaccine to U.S. children by the
fall of 1998 rotavirus season," said Wyeth-Lederle President Ronald
Saldarini. He would not discuss pricing. "Developed countries may pay more
for a vaccine to subsidize less developed countries," he said, adding that
the company had applied in Europe and Latin America for approval.
