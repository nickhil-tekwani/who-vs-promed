Rhode Island: 9 shellfishing sites closed
--------------------------------------------
As of 19 May 2007, The [Rhode Island] State Department of
Environmental Management (DEM) has closed 9 ponds and marshes to
shellfishing. The decision was announced yesterday after 8 bodies of
water were found to have the same characteristics as a pond where a
shellfish sample tested positive for norovirus and other evidence of
[fecal] contamination. The areas, which are adjacent to shellfish
growing sites that have been approved for shellfish harvesting, are
not routinely evaluated, said Angelo Liberti, chief of surface water
protection for the DEM.
The [bodies of water] include Quicksand Pond and Briggs Marsh in
Little Compton; Maschaug Pond in Westerly; Cards Pond and Trustom
Pond in South Kingstown; Wesquage Pond in Narragansett; Nag Pond on
Prudence Island; Goose Neck Cove, north of Ocean Avenue in Newport;
and Sapowet Creek in Tiverton.
The DEM will be developing a plan to reopen the areas, but does not
yet have a timetable for doing so, Liberti said.

[Detection of noroviruses in fresh and salt water can be a sensitive
indicator of fecal contamination. There is enhanced risk of
transmission of gastrointestinal illness because of the ability of
filter feeding organisms (shellfish) to concentrate particular
material from their environment and by the preference of some diners
to consume shellfish in an uncooked or partially cooked state. The
ban on shellfishing introduced in Rhode Island is a prudent measure
until the source of contamination cab be identified and eradicated. - Mod.CP]
