FROGEYE LEAF SPOT, SOYBEAN - ARGENTINA

During January and February [2009], many soybean crops -- mainly
varieties of the short and intermediate height groups -- were
attacked by frogeye leaf spot in various regions of the country.

The province of Cordoba is the epicenter, with many fields severely
infected by this disease. The "unexpected outbreak is in the south
eastern part of the province, and never before has it had such a
serious effect. The high temperatures and rainfall have contributed,
together with the susceptibility of the varieties and the [presence
of] inoculum, so that the epidemic was unleashed," says an Aapresid
[Argentinean No-till Farmers Association] report. Thus, many company
experts and [farming] consultants, are "setting up tests to check the
effectiveness of control with fungicides, especially in soybeans in
2nd crops," said one of the specialists.

The symptoms of this disease usually occur after flowering, but
become more evident from R3 [growth stage]. Frogeye is recognised by
small circular patches of 1 to 5 millimeters [on leaves] in the form
of an eye. They are characterised by a grey necrotic centre
surrounded by a reddish brown halo, but without chlorosis. The
absence of a yellow halo around the lesion distinguishes frogeye from
other diseases.

[Frogeye leaf spot is caused by the fungus _Cercospora sojina_, which
can infect leaves, stems, and seeds of soybean. The pathogen is found
worldwide but is only problematic under warm, humid conditions.
Significant yield losses of 10 to 50 percent are commonly associated
with frogeye epidemics. The fungus is spread via infected plant
material and can also be seed borne leading to inferior seed quality.
It is most likely to become a problem if infected seed is planted or
if infected residue of a previous soybean crop serves as a source of
inoculum (thus the expectation above that the disease may be more
difficult to control in 2nd crops). Disease management includes use
of disease-free seed, planting of resistant varieties, crop rotation,
tillage, and fungicide applications.

It is also mentioned elsewhere in the source that a serious frogeye
epidemic "caused havoc" in the province of Tucuman several seasons
ago, but that the disease had not been reported from the south of
Cordoba province before. Apparently all regions are concerned about
the health of this 2008-2009 season's soybean crop and expect lower
than normal yields.

The system of soybean growth stages divides plant development into
vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) stages. The vegetative stages are
numbered according to how many fully developed trifoliate leaves are
present. The reproductive (R) stages begin at flowering and include
pod development, seed development, and plant maturation. The stages
can overlap. R3 refers to the stage of early pod formation.
