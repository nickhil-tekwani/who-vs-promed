A 50-year-old woman from Pattiwala village in Kanth tehsil of Moradabad district [Uttar Pradesh state] died in a private hospital in New Delhi on Thursday [29 Jan 2015]. Doctors said she had contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a disease caused by the bite of ticks in domestic or wild animals. This is the 4th patient in the country to succumb to this disease; 2 [Crimean-]Congo fever deaths were reported from Rajasthan [state], and one in Himachal Pradesh [state] in the last month.

A special van with scientists brought the body home to Pattiwala village on Thursday. Doctors accompanying the body wore special masks and aprons. The van was taken straight to the cremation site, and the general public and members of the woman's family were not allowed near it.

Moradabad chief medical officer (CMO) Sanjeev Yadav said, "[Crimean-]Congo fever is generally transmitted by the Hyalomma ticks. The outbreak of illness is attributed usually to handling infected animals."

Dr Tanveer Ahmad Khan, a private practitioner in Rampur, said, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus belonging to a group called Nairovirus. The virus infects wild as well as domestic animals like sheep and cattle through tick bites. Humans are infected when they come in direct contact with blood or tissues from infected animals or bites of infected ticks. Crushing an infected tick may also result in infection."

Dr Khan said people who work with livestock or in slaughter houses and veterinary hospitals are at risk of infection.

Doctors at the Moradabad district hospital said the 50-year-old woman had complained of high fever on 1 Jan [2015]. She was referred to Delhi for treatment by local doctors. Doctors at the private Metro Hospital in New Delhi informed authorities at the National Institute of Communicable Disease, New Delhi, of her disease.

The patient's blood samples were sent to the laboratory of the communicable disease institute. CMO Sanjeev Yadav said, "The laboratory test results confirmed [Crimean-]Congo fever."

Kanth circle officer Rahul Kumar said, "The sealed coffin was transported by the special ambulance service of the National Institute of Communicable Disease, and the body was brought under supervision of scientists and doctors. No relative was allowed to touch the body."

Last week, cases of [Crimean-]Congo fever were reported from a private hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. One patient died of a then unknown viral haemorrhagic fever. Two days after that death, 2 male nurses who attended to that patient in the ICU also contracted the mysterious viral haemorrhagic fever. Both died, one at the same hospital and the other at AIIMS, New Delhi, where he was shifted for treatment. There are reports that other staff at the Rajasthan hospital are now being treated in Ahmedabad for similar symptoms.

To prevent spread of this virus, people exposed to animals, even those going on treks, should wear protective gear to avoid tick bites. Hospital staff should also take precautions while treating patients with the disease.

Private Rampur practitioner Dr Anil Kumar Jain said the outbreak could be easily controlled with proper hygiene and infection control measures.

"The virus is transmitted through ticks in animals, but often does not produce disease in the animals. But about 40 per cent of humans who contract the virus are killed by it," Dr Jain said.

He said that typically, after a 1- to 3-day incubation period following a tick bite or about 6 days after exposure to infected blood or tissues, flu-like symptoms appear. These might resolve in a week, Dr Jain said.

He said that in 75 per cent of cases, signs of haemorrhage appear within 5 days of the onset of illness. Patients usually begin to recover after 9-10 days, though the infection could result in death in some cases.

The CCHF virus has earlier been reported from Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Pakistan.

[Although CCHF cases have been reported from several states in India, especially in the northwest of the country, this is the 1st report from Uttar Pradesh that ProMED-mail has posted. The way in which this and previous CCHF virus infections in India were acquired this year (2015) is not stated. As noted in the above report, the virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, as was the likely situation in the 2 cases of the nurses that the report and earlier ProMED-mail post mention. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. Since these cases of the nurses turned out to be CCHF virus infections, fatalities among medical staff in the hospitals indicate that barrier nursing and personal protection have not been adequate. The health authorities in the above report are aware of this risk.

The CDC states, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent."
