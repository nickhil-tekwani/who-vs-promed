According to the World Health Organisation
(<http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>) the
endemic area for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) spreads from
Alsace-Lorraine in the west to Vladivostok and northeastern regions
of China in the east, and from Scandinavia to Italy, Greece, and
Crimea in the south. TBE also is endemic in North Japan, where the
virus has repeatedly been isolated from blood samples of sentinel
dogs, ticks, and rodent spleens. TBE is a serious acute central
nervous system infection, which may result in death or long-term
neurological sequelae in 35-58 percent of patients. The fatality rate
associated with clinical infection is 0.5-20 percent. The proportion
of cases involving subclinical infection varies between 70 percent
and 98 percent. Symptomatic infection occurs in all age groups.

The agent is the TBE virus (TBEV), a flavivirus that is transmitted
to humans by the bite of a tick. Eight species of ticks have been
identified that can transmit TBEV. The chief vectors are _Ixodes
ricinus_ in Europe and the western part of the Russian Federation,
and _Ixodes persulcatus_ in the eastern part of the Russian
Federation. The Komsomolskaya Pravda report copied above includes a
good photograph of a tick vector of tick-borne encephalitis virus. - Mod.CP]
