Even as Assam continues to battle COVID-19, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases are also on the rise in the state.

According to the Union Health Ministry, Assam registered 435 AES cases and 80 deaths and 212 JE cases and 39 deaths till September this year [2021]. During this time, 3595 AES cases and 133 deaths and 447 JE cases and 51 deaths have been reported across the country. Assam accounts for 60.15% and 76.47% of the total AES and JE deaths in the country, respectively.

Japanese encephalitis is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India.

Dr Lakshmanan S, mission director of National Health Mission (NHM), Assam, told India Today, "Japanese encephalitis in Assam is an endemic disease, and 2 years back, Assam had reported maximum JE and AES cases and deaths."

He further added, "The state government has taken up a series of steps to control JE and AES cases and fatalities in the state. We have started JE vaccination in the state."

He said that JE vaccination is going on in 99 different development blocks in Assam. "The vaccination drive is going on in multiple districts of the state. We have launched JE vaccination drive to vaccinate 47 lakh [4.7 million] people of above 15 years of age," he said.

The Assam government has launched a massive JE vaccination drive from October [2021], and it is the 1st such vaccine covering people between the ages of 15-65 years. Earlier, the vaccination was done only for children aged between one and 15 years.

Last year [2020], the Union government allowed JE vaccines for people from 15-65 years of age.

Dr Lakshmanan S said that this vaccination drive is going on in parallel with COVID-19 vaccination drive in the state.

"Only thing is that we have to keep 28 days gap between the 2 vaccines. We have distributed more than 22 lakh [2.2 million] mosquito nets across the state up to February 2021. This year [2021] we have not yet started mosquito net distribution. We have also identified hotspots and taken measures in areas where most cases are reported. All medical colleges, district hospitals have the facilities to identify AES and JE cases," the mission director of NHM Assam said.

According to reports, till September this year [2021], 1043 AES cases and 21 deaths and 86 JE cases and 2 deaths have been reported in Uttar Pradesh; 637 AES cases and 16 deaths and 14 JE cases and one death reported in West Bengal; and 458 AES cases and 2 deaths and 32 JE cases and 2 deaths reported in Jharkhand.

Between 2014 and 2020, more than 2400 people lost their lives due to AES and JE infections in Assam. According to reports, Assam recorded 525 deaths due to JE and AES in 2014, 395 in 2015, 279 in 2016, 265 in 2017, 277 in 2018, 514 in 2019 and 147 in 2020.

The mission director of NHM Assam said that most JE and AES cases have been reported from 13-14 districts of the state.

[Assam has been a state of very active JE virus transmission in recent years and currently a state with the most AES and JE cases in India. Although the previous report from Assam indicated a decline in JE and AES cases, the above case numbers clearly indicate that cases of JE and AES continue and are increasing currently. The planned ambitious JE vaccination campaign should be helpful in reducing cases of JE disease.

As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible JE, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr T Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption. A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. - Mod.TY
