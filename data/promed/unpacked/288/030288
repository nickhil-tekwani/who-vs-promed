At the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), 3 patients believed to have Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) -- one later confirmed -- died at Pims in April and May this year [2014], Pims spokesperson Dr Ayesha Eshani said.

A senior physician sharing details about the most recent CCHF patient, said a man, an Afghan national, tested positive for CCHF and died late on Wednesday [21 May 2014]. According to his travel history, he came to Peshawar [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province] from Afghanistan and then traveled to Islamabad, where he fell ill and was admitted to Pims.

The physician added that 2 other patients were suspected of having the disease. The Pims administration has started monitoring their staff to ensure that none of them has been affected by the viral disease.

[It is not clear from this report if the confirmed CCHF case mentioned above acquired his infection in Afghanistan or in Pakistan. The other 2 suspected cases presumably were infected at unnamed locations in Pakistan. No details of the circumstances of exposure to CCHF virus are provided, nor are the details concerning the 2 suspected cases.

As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140418.2413017, CCHF virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. Cases occur with some frequency in Pakistan. CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. CCHF virus can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days, suggesting that the confirmed case above acquired the infection in Pakistan.
