Health officials Friday said the number of reported cases in New York
state's deadly _E. coli_ epidemic had reached 1013, making it one of the
country's worst such outbreaks. Two people have died and 65 have been
hospitalized since the start of the epidemic late last month.
Among those suffering were nine children recovering from a severe kidney
ailment associated with the bacteria. At Albany Medical Center Hospital,
five children remained in serious condition and four were in fair
condition. "All nine children suffer from Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
and have been on dialysis on-and-off since they were hospitalized," said
medical center spokesman Greg McGarry.
Investigators have traced the epidemic to contaminated well water at the
upstate Washington County Fair Aug. 28-29. Water contaminated by manure
seeped into a non-chlorinated well from a nearby dairy barn after a
torrential downpour.
State health officials have ordered six upstate fairgrounds to disinfect
their wells and to monitor them before and during any events in the future.
In 1993 Washington state had 500 confirmed cases and four deaths because of
undercooked hamburger meat at a restaurant. So far New York has only 122
confirmed cases but the number has been climbing daily.
