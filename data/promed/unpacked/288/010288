14 Suspect Cases of Mad Cow Disease in Belgium
--------------------------------------------------------------
BRUSSELS: Belgian Health officials have identified at least 14 suspect
cases of mad cow disease. These discoveries were made during the
first week of systematic examinations of cattle in the country,
the Ministry of Health said today.
Another suspected case [of BSE was reported in the north of Denmark, said
the Danish Authorities.
The French Ministry of Agriculture stated that approximately 20 000 tests a
week are being conducted, with 19 laboratories taking part and an
additional 40 [laboratories expected to join in the effort. [The MOA
officials did not give figures on the results of the exams. Obligatory
testing of cattle older than 30 [months was decreed by the Ministers of
Agriculture of the European Union as part of the effort to reduce fears
related to the spread of [BSE. No animal will be permitted to enter the
food chain until it has been tested for BSE.
The suspect cases of BSE in Belgium were sacrificed and the farms from
which they came have been closed.

Germany to Slaughter BSE Cattle
---------------------------------------
German officials say the government is about to introduce the compulsory
slaughter of cattle to try to eradicate mad cow disease, or BSE. It's not
yet clear whether only herds already affected will be destroyed, or whether
all cattle considered to be at risk will be slaughtered.
Officials say the new measures would replace the current system under which
each German state decides its own policy on culling herds. The
developments coincide with demonstrations by German farmers, who want
government help with hundreds of thousands of unsold cattle.

Italy Fears First BSE case
---------------------------
The Italian Health Ministry said it had detected the country's first
suspected case of BSE, or mad cow disease, in Italian cattle on
Saturday.
The suspect cow, from a farm near Brescia in the northern Italian region of
Lombardy, was slaughtered only 2 days ago and the animal had shown none of
the symptoms of the disease before it was sent to the
slaughterhouse. Samples of tissue from the animal are now being sent to
another laboratory in Turin for further analysis. Final confirmation of
whether Italy has joined the EU countries afflicted by BSE will only be
available on Tuesday.
The Italian Government ordered compulsory testing for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in cows over the age of 30 months last November [2000
in line with tough new European Union regulations.
Italian Health Minister Umberto Veronesi reassured consumers there was no
threat to public health. He told a news conference: "We are not 100% sure,
and even if it was the case, it would be the first time an Italian-born cow
had contracted the disease."
Italy discovered 2 cases of BSE in cattle imported from Britain in
1994. Until now, Italy had been one of the few countries in Europe not to
have reported any home-grown cases. Approximately 600 tests were carried
out in 2 government laboratories in the north of Italy, where most of the
country's dairy farms are located. All test results were negative.
[Some years ago my friend and colleague Roger Eddy informed me that one of
his farmer clients had imported an Italian heifer which Roger later
diagnosed with BSE; it was confirmed. So I have suspected for some time
that Italy was going to join the EU BSE-surprised club. - Mod.MHJ

MADRID: Bull breeders and veterinarians urged the government on Wednesday
to begin testing fighting bulls, Spain's national symbol, for BSE. They
want to ensure that meat from bulls killed in the ring -- prized as a
delicacy by some Spaniards -- has not been tainted by the brain-wasting
disorder which is linked to the deadly human equivalent, new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
"We will not put bull meat on the market which has not been tested," Juan
Pablo Jimenez Pasquau, president of the Union of Fighting Bull Breeders,
told Reuters. More than 4000 bulls are killed in bullfights in Spain each
year and they are all sold to the public as meat, he said. Untested
beef is eligible for a "purchase for destruction" scheme, under which
farmers are paid to have older cattle destroyed if no tests are available.
Bull fighting associations want compensation payments of around 60 000
pesetas (US$340) for each bull incinerated, and they plan to meet with the
Agriculture Ministry next week to discuss their concerns.
[Considering the effects of this disease, it is somewhat hard to imagine a
clinically affected animal performing lethally in an arena. One must
presume that the Spanish authorities are concerned with apparently healthy
preclinical bulls. - Mod.MHJ

British research has confirmed a total of 87 cases of mad cow disease in
cats in the 1990s.
To reassure Finnish pet owners, it has been pointed out that British beef
is not used in Finnish cat food. It is not known how many pets in the
other European countries have been found to have the disease, but according
to Nina Saren at the Finnish ministry of agriculture and forestry, there
have been several cases. [However, only Britain has had a relatively active
surveillance programme for FSE. - Mod.MHJ
The disease has also been confirmed in felines in zoos, Saren said. In
Finland, there have not been any confirmed or suspected cases of BSE
in animals at the Korkeasaari zoo in Helsinki, reported Helsingin Sanomat,
a Finnish daily newspaper.
In Norway, [one cat has reportedly contracted the disease after eating
British beef, but in Finland the risk is said to be close to
nonexistent. VPG Finland, Master Foods Oy and Friskies Finland Oy, 3 major
pet food manufacturers, have said that in Finland the meat used for pet
food comes from the same animals as the meat for human consumption.
[This is not to say that FSE is absent from Europe. When the disease did
not taper off as expected in the UK, it was found that British cat food
manufacturers were using imported miscellaneous beef scraps from the
Continent. As ever, if you don't have clinical veterinarians and pathology
facilities actively looking for a condition, the threshold number of cases
needed for a diagnosis (NND) gets to be large. - Mod.MHJ

WASHINGTON: Hundreds of animal feed producers are violating rules intended
to keep mad cow disease out of the United States, prompting the government
to warn on Thursday that companies must shape up or expect shutdowns, even
prosecution. The food supply remains safe despite the violations because
no cases of mad cow disease have been found in U.S. cattle, the Food and
Drug Administration said. [This last statement is debatable. - Mod.JW
The livestock industry in 1996 voluntarily banned sheep and certain other
animal parts from U.S. feed. The next year, the FDA formally banned any
proteins from cows, sheep, goats, deer or elk -- animals that get similar
brain-wasting diseases -- from feed for cows, sheep or goats. Poultry or
pigs can still eat those proteins, but feed must be labeled "do not feed to
cows or other ruminants" and companies must have systems to prevent
accidentally mixing up the feeds.
Of 180 renderers -- companies that turn slaughtered animals' parts into
meat and bone meal -- that handle risky feed, 16 percent lacked warning
labels and, worse, 28 percent had no system to prevent feed mixups.
Of 347 FDA-licensed feed mills that handle risky feed, 20 percent lacked
warning labels and 9 percent lacked mixup-prevention systems.
Of 1593 unlicensed feed mills that handle risky feed, almost half lacked
warning labels and 26 percent lacked mixup-prevention systems. (FDA only
licenses mills that add medications to feed.)
States are helping FDA inspect the companies, and hundreds are left to
inspect. But [Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director of the FDA's Centers for
Veterinary Medicine, pledged Thursday that every company will be inspected.
The American Feed Industry Association said it supported the FDA's
enforcement of the rules, saying most companies inspected so far are complying.

[I need not remind members that absence of reports is not the same as a
true absence of disease. - Mod.MHJ
