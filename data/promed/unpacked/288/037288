Fever Ticks Confirmed on a Live Oak County Premises
---------------------------------------------------
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) confirmed the presence of cattle fever ticks on a Live Oak County premises on 30 Nov 2016. The infested premises is located approximately 110 miles outside of the Permanent Fever Tick Quarantine Zone.

The fever ticks were discovered on a bull when evaluated by a local veterinarian and identified at the TAHC State-Federal Laboratory. The infested premises has been placed under quarantine and all cattle on the premises have started treatment for fever ticks. TAHC is conducting an epidemiological investigation to determine the source of the fever ticks and trace outs from the premises.

A Control Purpose Quarantine Area (CPQA) has been established for systematic inspection of livestock and wildlife hosts in the portion of Live Oak County surrounding the infested premises. Producers located in the identified CPQA are being contacted by TAHC and USDA personnel.

Premises located within the CPQA are subject to movement restrictions, systematic inspections and potential treatment in accordance with the regulations in Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 41 Fever Ticks.

With the addition of Live Oak County, there are now 4 CPQAs outside of the Permanent Fever Tick Quarantine Zone, located in Jim Wells, Kleberg and Willacy counties. At present, there are approximately 450 000 acres under various types of fever tick quarantine outside of the Permanent Quarantine Zone, including a Temporary Preventative Quarantine Zone in Cameron County.

"When producers observe ticks on their livestock, it is imperative that they contact their local TAHC Livestock Inspector or region office, USDA Inspector, private veterinarian, or local AgriLife Extension office to arrange for collection and submission of tick samples to the TAHC laboratory in Austin, Texas," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC Executive Director. "This will help ensure the parasites are not cattle fever ticks.

Cattle fever ticks, known scientifically as _Rhipicephalus (formerly _Boophilus) annulatus_ and _R. microplus_ are a significant threat to the United States cattle industry. These ticks are capable of carrying the protozoa, or microscopic parasites _Babesia bovis _or _B. bigemina_, which cause the disease commonly known as cattle fever. The Babesia organism attacks and destroys red blood cells, causing acute anemia, high fever, and enlargement of the spleen and liver, ultimately resulting in death for up to 90 percent of susceptible naive cattle.

[It is sad news to learn there is another county that has been found to be infected.

Treatment of animals on infected premises is important to help eliminate this pest which can be so devastating to the livestock industry. The state and the federal authorities offer a few options.

It important to understand the life cycle of the fever tick to understand why eliminating this pest is important.

Fever Tick Lifecycle
The female cattle fever tick will attach to a single animal and will remain on it for the duration of her life. Cattle fever ticks become infected with the protozoa once they consume blood from an infected animal. When the tick reproduces, the protozoa will then pass on to its larvae. The fever tick larvae will then pass on the protozoa to cattle they attach to.

Option 1: Scheduled Dipping
The 1st option involves a prescribed schedule of dipping the cattle on the premises every 7 to 14 days for 6 to 9 months. The dipping schedule is based on the fever tick's life cycle. The cattle from a quarantined pasture are sprayed on the ranch or trucked to an authorized dipping vat, where they are treated under the supervision of a TAHC or USDA inspector, who must certify that 100 percent of the herd was treated. The animals are returned to their pasture, where more ticks will climb aboard before the next scheduled dipping. This procedure is repeated again and again to "clean" the pasture of ticks during the minimum 6 to 9 month quarantine period.

Option 2: Vacating Premises
The 2nd option for eliminating the fever tick operates on the principal of "starving out" the tick, by removing the hosts. This approach, known as "vacating" the pasture, can be a more economical option for some ranchers as it cuts the costs of repeatedly rounding up, transporting and dipping cattle. This option begins with dipping the cattle on a 7 to 14 day schedule. The cattle must have 2 consecutive tick-free inspections and dippings before the herd can be moved to a new, tick-free pasture. The tick-infested pasture is then left empty, or vacated, for 9 months. However, this starve out method is ineffective in areas where wildlife populations exist because wildlife can serve as hosts and feed the cattle fever tick.

Option 3: Injectable Dectomax (Doramectin)
The 3rd option for treatment is a ready-to-use injectable. Dectomax is given on a 25-28 day schedule for the 6 to 9 month quarantine period.

This treatment option has been proven to be effective against the fever tick. It also relieves the stress of dipping and/or moving cattle from their premise, reduces the number of times that cattle must be gathered during the quarantine period by about one-half, resulting in substantial costs savings for the rancher when compared to a dipping schedule. Dectomax has a 35-day pre-slaughter withdrawal period and should not be used in dairy cows 20 months of age or older or in calves to be processed for veal. Dectomax has been developed specifically for cattle and swine. Use in dogs may result in fatalities.

The USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service- Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are working together to find new, effective and cost-efficient ways to better manage ticks. This includes feeding ivermectin-treated molasses and implementing the use of a tick vaccine for cattle. It also includes improved management of fever ticks on deer.
