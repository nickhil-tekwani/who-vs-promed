White-nose syndrome, the deadly fungus that has killed millions of bats in the eastern U.S. and Canada, has been found in bats in northeastern Minnesota's Soudan Underground Mine.

Several hundred bats have been found dead near the main entrance to the mine since January [2016], and a sample sent to a federal wildlife laboratory confirmed the cause was white-nose syndrome.

It's the 1st time bats have been confirmed as dying from the disease in Minnesota.

The fungus was 1st detected in the mine in 2013, but scientists say it often takes 2 to 3 years for the disease to start killing bats.

In eastern caves and mines where bats spend the winter, called hibernacula, entire colonies have been wiped out in less than a year.

White-nose syndrome was 1st observed in 2006 in a cave in upstate New York. The disease has reduced bat populations by as much as 71 percent in states where it has struck, and in some cases killed nearly 100 percent of the bats in caves where the fungus has appeared. It's possible some species could become "functionally extinct" within a few years, according to Jeremy Coleman of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The disease now has been found in 27 states and 5 Canadian provinces.

The northern long-eared bat this year [2016] was formally placed on the endangered species list as threatened, offering federal protection for one of the species most affected by the disease. Little brown bats also are hard hit.

"Minnesota has 7 species of bats, 4 of which hibernate during the winter and are at greatest risk of contracting the disease," said Gerda Nordquist, a bat expert and mammalogist in the DNR's [Department of Natural Resources] Ecological and Water Resources Division.

It's not clear how the disease has spread so quickly, but it's believed that it was transmitted both between bats and from one cave to another in the footwear or clothing of people who visit caves.

"We've been following the recommended procedures to try to protect the bats from white-nose syndrome," said Jim Essig, park manager at Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park, in a statement Wednesday [9 Mar 2016]. "Now that it's here, we will continue to do everything we can at our parks to prevent human transport of fungal spores to other sites."

White-nose syndrome is named for the fuzzy white growth of fungus observed on the faces of infected bats. Those infected die from the disease, which causes wounds to the wing tissue as well as dehydration and starvation. It often 1st shows up as unusual behavior, such as flying during the day in summer or leaving caves during their usual winter hibernation, when no bugs are present for them to eat.

That appears to be what happened in Soudan, where bats would normally never leave the mine in winter when no bugs are present to eat.

Bats can live more than 30 years in the wild but have a very low reproductive rate, which means it is very difficult for populations to rebuild after the disease hits, Nordquist said.

Experts say they are considering options to try to keep the disease out of specific caves, but once it enters it is impossible to eradicate.

The loss of bats, the only flying mammals, is considered troubling because bats play an important role in many ecosystems. A single bat can eat more than 1000 mosquitoes in a single night. Bats are considered important agriculturally because of the huge number of insects they can keep away from crops, and in forested areas for reducing the number of tree-damaging bugs.

White-nose syndrome is not known to pose a threat to humans, pets, livestock or other wildlife.

The fungus also has been detected in Forestville/Mystery Cave State Park in southeastern Minnesota but bats have not been found dead there as of yet.

Nordquist encourages anyone who sees a sick or dead bat to submit a Bat Observation Report. DNR staff reviews these reports and additional follow-up or testing is conducted as needed.

Research continues to better understand white-nose syndrome, and scientists are beginning to see promising results that could eventually help treat and recover affected bats, but so far nothing has been found to stop or even slow the bat disease that is spreading across North America.

Last May [2015] the U.S. Forest Service and partners released bats in Missouri that had contracted white-nose syndrome last fall but were treated with a bacterium over the winter and survived. The treated bats will be monitored to see if they remain healthy. Early results show promise at thwarting the disease and even reducing it in infected bats, although researchers haven't figured out how to treat more than a few bats at a time.

In another study, University of California-Santa Cruz researchers in April [2015] published the results of laboratory studies that showed how bacteria found naturally on some bats inhibited growth of the fungus that causes the disease.

It's not clear how the bacteria works or why some bats have it and others don't.

Not all of the news is bad. In one Vermont cave where a quarter-million bats died a few years ago from white-nose syndrome, a few bats have returned. Scientists are trying to find out why they survived when others couldn't.

Meanwhile, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin confirmed the disease kills bats by causing their bodies to overheat, burning energy too quickly and at a time -- in winter -- when no insects are present to replace the lost calories.

Researchers also are working to find fungicides that might kill white-nose syndrome. And scientists at UC San Francisco and Brown University recently figured out the likely way that white-nose syndrome breaks down tissue in bats, opening the door to potential treatments.
