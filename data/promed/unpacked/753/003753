Re: Avian influenza (110): Viet Nam, vaccination
--------------------------------------------------
I want to congratulate Dr. Dung for these open words clarifying the
Vietnamese policy on vaccination to control AI by vaccination.
We really do hope that the Indonesian authorities can adopt the
Vietnamese vaccination policy rather than to follow the [current]
vaccination policy using DIVA [Differentiating Infected form
Vaccinated Animals] vaccines.
I am not aware that the DIVA diagnostic system has been used
elsewhere, apart from Italy.
Since there is no commercial and user-friendly DIVA diagnostic kit
available, it is [questionable] to apply DIVA vaccines, as antigenic
match to the existing H5N1 virus in the field is not given here.
It should be clearly pointed out, especially by the virologists, that
neuraminidase protein, besides hemagglutinin protein, is a
neutralizing factor and contributes to a better protection if both
proteins are homologous to the field virus.
At the current stage, the virus is endemic in the field, not only in
Indonesia, but also in many Asian and African countries, including
Viet Nam and China. Why is the OIE [World Organization for Animal
Health] just pointing at Nigeria, Egypt, and Indonesia? We should be
fair to accept that we have to live with the H5N1 virus for a longer
time. It is unlikely that we can eradicate the virus.
Thus, the ultimate goal at present is to reduce the viral load in the
field to prevent new outbreaks and, hence, human fatalities. To reach
this target we need to have vaccines that have good potency and good
efficacy. We can only reach both if antigenic mass (together with a
good adjuvant) and antigenic match are given.
The vaccine manufacturer should stop seeing these poor countries as a
dumping ground to sell vaccines that have not even 80 percent
homology to the existing field virus.
Excessive usage of vaccine strains antigenically distant to the local
H5N1 virus will cause incomplete protection and the field virus will
escape from vaccine pressure and drift further away from the vaccine
used. Data from China and Indonesia has shown this.
China has adjusted the existing reverse genetic H5N1 vaccines
(Goose/Gd/96) with a 2nd reverse genetic H5N1 based on a Shanxi H5N1
strain. Indonesia's H5N1 viruses has established into subclades in
different regions or islands.
[The UN Food & Agriculture Organization] FAO/OIE should clearly
recommend the usage of homologous H5N1 reverse genetic AI vaccines to
help these countries to control AI. We have enough experience in AI
vaccine failure due to antigenic mismatch, and it is clearly not an
issue of failure in vaccine application like in Viet Nam.

[The comments above from Dr Teguh Y. Prajitno, Indonesia, and the
detailed observations of Dr Do Huu Dung from Viet Nam (ProMED-mail
20070712.2225) deserve serious consideration.
In Europe, where the infection load is low, general vaccination is
banned and wide scale serosurveillance is applied in order to
maintain the "disease free" status for export considerations, the
DIVA H5N2 vaccine has been advocated for selective use, mainly in
zoos. It has been reportedly used in several zoos (such as,
Rotterdam, Dubai, Israel) and -- probably on small scale -- in
holdings of rare poultry breeds and hobby-birds, particularly when
these cannot be kept indoors. Results of vaccination trials in zoos
have been published (refs 1,2).
Large-scale vaccinations with H5N2 vaccine have been carried out in
several heavily H5N1 infected countries (such as, China, Egypt, Indonesia).
A list of 39 avian influenza vaccines, produced in 8 countries (China
15 vaccines; France 5; Netherlands 3; Pakistan 4; Mexico 7; USA 3;
Italy 1; Germany 1) has been compiled by FAO's Emergency Prevention
System for Transboundary Animal Diseases (EMPRES) and is available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/vaccine_producers.htm>
Of the 39 vaccines, 22 include H5N2.
