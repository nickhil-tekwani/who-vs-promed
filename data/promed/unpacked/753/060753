[As posted by Michael Coston (editor) Avian Flu Diary (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/) no. 10 638, "The 'household cluster' among expat workers living in Riyadh continues to expand, with a 6th case (and 2nd to be listed as a 'secondary household contact') announced today [19 Oct 2015]. The 1st 4 cases were described as sharing a 3-room apartment with 32 other young women, and all worked for a private contractor providing cleaning services to Princess Nora University.

"The MOH released a statement late last week [week of 12 Oct 2015] assuring that there were no MERS-CoV cases reported amongst students [see ProMED mail MERS-CoV (144): Saudi Arabia, 2 new cases, Nora Univ no student cases 20151018.3724154]. There is no indication how the index case in this cluster was exposed to the virus.

"All remaining residents of this household are reportedly under home quarantine. Given the close quarters, more cases would not be unexpected.

"Apparently unrelated to this cluster, the MOH also announced another primary case in Riyadh, involving a 61-year-old female listed in critical condition. No details on her exposure are provided."

S Korea to miss tourism targets due to MERS
-------------------------------------------
The South Korean tourism industry is expected to take a severe [hit] from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak this year [2015], as foreigners shunned the nation during the summer season following the 1st case in late May [2015], data showed Tue [20 Oct 2015].

The number of inbound travelers is expected to drop 4.6-9.6 percent on-year in 2015, causing a loss in the country's tourism revenue, which will range from 881.5 billion (USD 784.6 million) to 1.9 trillion won [about USD 1.7 billion], according to data by the Korea Culture & Tourism Institute (KCTI). ... -- more
