The people of Nipa in Southern Highlands are warned not to touch, eat or sell any meat from pigs that have died there mysteriously.

The general public travelling to Hela has also been warned not to buy any pork sold at roadside markets.

Nipa Station Department of Primary Industries officer Justin Kiap has received confirmation of the death of more than 100 pigs. "This is new and I cannot really tell what caused the deaths," Kiap said.

Villagers at Nipa said the pigs died without showing any signs of sickness or diseases.

They are calling on the Department of Agriculture and Livestock or any other government department to send a team to Nipa to investigate.

The areas which have lost pigs are Egenda wards 1, 2, 3 and Shumbi ward 1 and 2.

The villagers are calling on the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority [DDA], the provincial government and the national government to help identify the cause of death.

Councillor Peter Hurum and local leader Pip Songuro said it was the 1st time people had seen pigs dying like that. They said they had never experienced or seen pigs dying in large numbers in the area before and it was a new case.

Former Nipa-Kutubu DDA chief executive Robin Pip confirmed the incident yesterday [15 Apr 2019], saying he witnessed the deaths but could not tell the cause because it was happening everywhere. He has called on their authorities to investigate.

[In February 2007, about 1000 pigs reportedly died from an "unidentified disease" in the Southern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea (PNG). When the deaths of 3 women became known as well, the event found its way to the frontpages of "The National", the same PNG newspaper from which the current report has been derived. ProMED-mail's RFI (20070221.0641) led to a response received from PNG's Chief Veterinarian, Dr Ilagi Puana who indicated that the event in pigs, "in some parts of the highlands provinces of Papua New Guinea (PNG)" was investigated and "anthrax was diagnosed based on history and clinical symptoms." He also remarked that "Anthrax in pigs in PNG has only been reported and diagnosed in village and wild pigs, never reported, or diagnosed in commercial piggeries in PNG". Subscribers are encouraged to refer to his entire response (20070305.0781).

At the time, it was not clear if the said diagnosis was laboratory confirmed.

Sudden mass mortality in livestock may also be caused by other agents, including chemicals. African swine fever (ASF), which may cause mass mortalities in domestic and wild swine, should be excluded as well. ASF is likely to be manifested by some clinical signs, even if their duration is short.

The location of the event in Nipa may raise the possibility of suspecting the zoonotic Nipah virus; however, infections by Nipah virus in pigs are generally subclinical or mild, though fulminating infections and sudden death have also been seen. In general, mortality is low except in young piglets.

Final diagnosis of the current event is anticipated. In case anthrax is confirmed, this becomes a serious public health issue. - Mod.AS
