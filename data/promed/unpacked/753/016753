------------------------------------------------------------
[Section 4.8 Mongolia from the paper follows].

PPR presence was first reported in the country in August 2016, when several outbreaks were observed in western Mongolia (Khovd region), possibly as a result of uncontrolled animal movements across the border with China. After a large-scale vaccination campaign was conducted in the region from 10 to 30 Oct 2016, involving more than 4.6 million sheep and 5.8 million goats from 5 different provinces, this initial outbreak was believed to have been contained. However, PPRV emerged in susceptible wildlife populations, leading to mortality events in saiga antelopes (_Saiga tatarica mongolica_), Siberian ibex (_Capra sibirica_), Argali (_Ovis ammon_) and goitered gazelles (_Gazella subgutturosa_). In particular, the mass die-offs observed in saiga antelopes in 2016-2017, which caused the loss of around 80% of a population that was already critically endangered, are considered the most important instance of the potential impact of PPR on wildlife.

Full genome phylogenetic reconstruction was used to infer the times of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) viruses and indicated that PPRV was circulating undetected in Mongolia for at least 6 months before the 1st reported outbreak in August 2016 and that wildlife was likely infected before livestock vaccination began. Since 2018, sporadic outbreaks of the disease have occurred in livestock in the central and south-eastern parts of Mongolia, with the last one being reported in April 2022. However, the current epidemiological scenario in the country is unclear, and it is difficult to establish whether these events originated from endemic PPRV circulation or from cross-border reintroductions.

A PPR eradication strategy is in the process of being updated, but reportedly, field activities lack a long-term strategic approach and are also hampered by resource and budget constraints. According to the assessment made in 2017, Mongolia was in the 1st stage of the stepwise approach.

[Mongolia is one of the countries covered by FAO/WOAH's PPR GEP (Global Eradication Programme), launched in 2016, which aims to eradicate the disease by 2030. GEP's strategy is based upon a technical stepwise approach (stage 1 to stage 4). The affected countries have been grouped into 9 regions in which their progress is said to be assessed in regional roadmap meetings. Mongolia belongs to the Central Asia/West Eurasia (CA/WE) regional group. CA/AE's group last meeting was held virtually in October 2021, assessing the phase, on the roadmap, attained by the 13 regional countries. Mongolia's phase (no 1, "assessment") has not changed since 2017.

Following the October 2021 meeting, FAO's experts have compiled and authored the above review of the regional PPR epidemiological situation after the 1st phase of PPR GEP (2017-2021), and the status of control and eradication activities in each country. The paper was submitted to 'Animals' on 29 Jun 2022, and published on 10 Aug 2022. The authors indicated: "The considered area spans from Eastern Europe to East Asia and features remarkable variability in terms of both PPR presence and enacted control efforts. The achievements and constraints encountered at regional and national levels are discussed, thus providing useful data for tailoring the next steps of the eradication programme to the peculiarities of the region."

Mongolia reported to WOAH, in August 2021, a PPR outbreak in the Omnogovi province which borders on the northern boundary of China (20210908.8654872). The event was declared resolved in October 2021. In April 2022, 3 new outbreaks were reported to the WOAH, of which one recurring in Omnogovi while the others in Tov and Dundgovi, both in central Mongolia (20220424.8702814).

According to the recent information from Mongolia's Minister of agriculture (20221122.8706844), at present 7 out of Mongolia's 21 provinces are affected by PPR. This means a wide spread of the highly infectious disease since April 2022, warranting an official follow-up report.
