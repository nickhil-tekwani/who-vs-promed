"Two cases of boars positive for African swine fever were detected between Meix and Sommethonne [Gaume municipality, Luxembourg province, Wallonia region]", a few hundred meters from the French border, confirms Ren√© Collin, the Walloon Minister of Agriculture. It is therefore outside the buffer zone, which will be extended over part of the 'enhanced observation area', to the southwest. A meeting with the French authorities is scheduled for Thu 10 Jan 2019.

[RTBF is a Belgian public-service broadcasting organization serving the French-speaking community in Wallonia and Brussels.

On 24 Dec 2018, ProMED-mail cited a media report, informing that on 17 Dec 2018, a carcass of a boar was found "not far from Gerouville", and that the carcass was tested and found positive for ASF (see 20181224.6222340). Gerouville is situated outside the buffer zone.

On 25 Dec 2018, the case in Gerouville was reported by the Belgian authorities to the OIE (follow-up report 14), stating that the date of start of this outbreak was 14 Dec 2018 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=29051).

On 27 Dec 2018, a spokesperson of the Walloon government's Ministry of Agriculture denied the information on the case in Gerouville, claiming that Belgian local authorities had released inaccurate information. This denial was published by ProMED on 3 Jan 2019, accompanied by the following comment/RFI:

"In view of the discrepancy between the denial published by the media and the OIE report, a clarification by Belgium's authorities is warranted. Accurate, updated information on the actual site of Belgium's most western ASF-infected boar is essential on both sides of the French/Belgian border" (see 20190103.6241296).

The current statement by Wallonia's Minister of Agriculture, confirming the Gerouville case, means that an ASF-infected wild boar was found outside the buffer zone as early as 14 Dec 2018. The distance between Gerouville and the French border is about 1.7 km (map at https://goo.gl/maps/uhcsu9zm5Mv).

Experts estimated that ASF was expected to advance between 1.2 and 3.0 km [about 0.75-2 mi] per month. - Mod.AS
