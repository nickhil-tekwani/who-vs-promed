Health authorities in northern Australia are on alert for a possible
outbreak of the potentially fatal disease Australian encephalitis,
following record flooding across the continent. Unprecedented rains last
month left many central Australian communities stranded, creating swamps
in the desert where virus-carrying mosquitoes could be breeding, warned Mr.
Peter Whelan, an entomologist with Territory Health Services. The last
nationwide outbreak of Australian encephalitis, in 1974, claimed 13 lives
and followed heavy rain in central Australia.
Health officers have been spraying insecticide in Alice Springs to head off
an outbreak of the disease, which attacks the nervous system and has a 30%
fatality rate. In Queensland, as floods continued to wreak havoc following
Cyclone Steve on Sunday, authorities were also concerned about dengue fever.
"[Dengue's] the sort of disease that can rapidly escalate - it's also
potentially fatal," said Dr. Scott Ritchie, a medical entomologist with
Queensland Health.

[Tourism and other groups in Australia who feel impacted by use of the term
"Murray Valley encephalitis" (caused by Murray Valley encephalitis, a
flavivirus) like to use the euphemism "Australian encephalitis" instead.
They also include illnesses caused by Kunjin (a West Nile-like) virus in
"Australian encephalitis", so it is not possible to determine what the
Northern Territory authorities mean in this report. Could eastern equine
encephalitis OR western equine encephalitis be acceptably called "American
encephalitis"? I don't think so.
In any event, the mosquito population density in northern Australia and in
Queensland are worrisome to the experts whose job it is to keep an eye on
such things. It is remarkable that there is a need for insecticide
spraying in the area of Alice Springs, as dry a place as I have ever seen.
Further, and more detailed reports (such as comparative population
densities, increased field infection rates, and disease occurrence) are
welcome and needed. - Mod.CHC]
