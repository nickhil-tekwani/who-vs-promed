888 people are infected with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Italy, 46 of whom have recovered and 21 died. These are elderly people with other pathologies. In this regard, it will be the Higher Institute of Health to confirm today [28 Feb 2020] whether people died from coronavirus or from previous diseases.

345 and 64 hospitalized patients with symptoms are in intensive care, while 412 asymptomatic are in fiduciary home isolation.

The number of people infected in the individual regions is as follows:
531 in Lombardy,
151 in Veneto,
145 in Emilia-Romagna,
19 in Liguria,
11 in Piedmont,
8 in Tuscany,
6 in the Marche,

Iran on Friday [28 Feb 2020] reported 8 new deaths from coronavirus, raising its toll to 34, as the number of infections jumped again in the Islamic republic, one of the worst-hit countries. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 143 cases had been detected over the past 24 hours, increasing the total of confirmed infections to 388.

Among the new cases, 64 were in Tehran while the number of provinces hit by the outbreak rose to 24, Jahanpour said. "We are currently in a phase in which infections are increasing," he said, predicting that the situation "will continue for some days, even weeks". It is the highest number of new cases for a single day since Iran announced its 1st confirmed infections on [19 Feb 2020] in the Shiite shrine city of Qom. Jahanpour said 73 people with the infection had left hospital over the past few days.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki announced Friday [28 Feb 2020] that all schools would be closed from Saturday [29 Feb 2020] to Tuesday [3 Mar 2020] "We have a very difficult week ahead of us," he told state television. State TV said Friday [28 Feb 2020] that parliament would be closed until further notice, due to the epidemic.

Iran has the highest death toll from the virus outside China, where COVID-19 1st emerged. One of Iran's 7 vice presidents, Massoumeh Ebtekar, and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi are among several senior officials who have been infected. On Wednesday [26 Feb 2020], Iranian authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected infections.

[5] Comment re: What is the denominator?
Date: Fri 28 Feb 2020
From: Steven Berger [edited]
<steve@gideononline.com>


Since the 1st cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 were reported in China, we have all been confronted by death and case-fatality statistics, which are both misleading and inaccurate. As of this morning, 2837 from a total of 83 774 reported cases of COVID-19 were fatal. Public Health professionals, the lay public, and politicians will conclude that this disease carries a "mortality rate" of 3.4%. Relatively few realize that "only" 1.4% of patients treated outside of Mainland China have died of COVID-19: 0.7% of passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 0.5% of patients in South Korea, etc.

One explanation for these discrepant case-fatality statistics is related to demography. Patients reported by official sources have a higher mean age and prevalence of underlying chronic disease than the general Chinese population (or international travelers). Case-definition, variation in quality of care, genetic and nutritional factors might also explain higher fatality rates among Chinese patients. Indeed, several of the patients who died of COVID-19 outside of Mainland China have also been Chinese Nationals.

A fundamental error in all of this could be related to the term, "reported cases." How many infections in China are asymptomatic or sub-clinical? If, for example, only one-in-10 individuals who acquire infection by SARS-CoV-2 are sufficiently ill to visit a clinic or hospital, the true case-fatality rate decreases from 3.4% to 0.34% A seroloprevalence survey in the general population could easily determine the true impact of this disease.

This week, details of an antibody assay for SARS-CovV-2 infection were reported in Journal of Medical Virology. [1] The authors state that the procedure detects both IgM and IgG antibodies within 15 minutes, with a test sensitivity and specificity of 88.86% and 90.63%, respectively.

Beyond the search for vaccines and effective anti-viral agents, an immediate remedy for much of the uncertainty regarding COVID-19 will be a comprehensive serological survey of populations in affected areas. Tested individuals should be questioned regarding recent travel, occupational contact, and relevant symptoms which may have occurred during the preceding 2 months.

If a high background sero-prevalence rate exists among people in Wuhan (or China as a whole) COVID-19 becomes little more threatening than other "new strains of flu" that we deal with each year.

[I couldn't agree with Dr. Steve Berger more. We are sorely missing information on a closer approximation to the "true" denominator, which would be the number of infected individuals, as opposed to our using the denominator of "reported cases." As Steve mentions, the cases that come to the attention of the health sector are usually those with more symptomatic disease. We do get a glimpse of the mild and asymptomatic infections when we test their close contacts, but the cases we see are most likely the tip of the iceberg, and we do need to know the size of the bottom of the iceberg under the water. Serologic testing has been awaited, and cross-sectional serologic surveys of communities known to have had fairly extensive transmission of the virus should be done sooner rather than later, for the eventuality that antibodies wane with time, especially with milder and asymptomatic infections, as observed and reported with a cousin coronavirus responsible for MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome).

Many thanks to Steve for contributing this commentary, and hopefully serosurveys will be getting underway in the close future.

A. USA, California, and Oregon cases without epidemiologic links

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/28/coronavirus-live-updates/?p9w22b2p=b2p22p9w00098


Breaking: 2nd coronavirus case of unknown origin confirmed in California, indicating virus is spreading in the state.

The patient is a 65-year-old person from Santa Clara County, with no known history of travel to places hit hard by the outbreak, and no contact with a known case of the virus. Santa Clara is about 90 miles from Solano County, where the 1st case of community transmission in the United States was confirmed this week.

Breaking: Oregon health officials on Friday [28 Feb 2020] reported a coronavirus case of unknown origin. The patient is from Washington County, with no known history of travel to places hit hard by the outbreak, and no contact with a known case of the virus. There have been 2 other community transmission cases identified in California. This is the 1st coronavirus case in Oregon.

[The identification of 3 cases without identifiable epidemiologic links strongly suggests that we are moving into the stage of "seek and ye shall find." Changing the case definition to eliminate the requirement for known contact with people in or recently from known areas of viral circulation will probably result in an ever growing number of confirmed cases identified. That prior case definition worked well in the early stages of this epidemic, but more recently against identifying community transmission outside of known case contacts, leading to a bias for "don't look and it ain't there" results. The silent transmission into these communities speaks for the likelihood of more mild clinical presentations and subclinical infections breaking the directly identifiable epidemiologic links. - Mod.MPP]

Today [28 Feb 2020], Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed a new positive case of COVID-19 in Toronto. This is the 8th case in Ontario. Ontario's 1st 3 cases are all resolved, with each of those patients having 2 consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

After arriving in Toronto on [20 Feb 2020], a man in his 80s presented himself at Scarborough Health Network's General Hospital's emergency department on [27 Feb 2020] with a travel history to Egypt. As per established infection prevention and control protocols, the patient was cared for at the hospital using all appropriate precautions, including being isolated as he was tested for COVID-19. The man was discharged home the same day feeling well and, per protocols, went into self-isolation where he remains. Throughout his travels, the man wore a mask. Toronto Public Health is actively engaged in contact tracing and case management.

At this time the virus is not circulating locally, however given the global circumstances, Ontario is actively working with city and health partners to plan for the potential of local spread. The province continues to carefully monitor this situation and encourage residents to stay informed by regularly reviewing credible information sources.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
-----
- Five new Member States (Belarus, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Nigeria) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.

- The WHO-China Joint Mission, which was conducted from 16 through [24 Feb 2020], has published its findings. The full report can be found at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf.

- WHO has updated the guidance on Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)). This document includes revised surveillance case definitions for COVID-19. It is also accompanied by a revised Case Reporting Form, line listing template, and data dictionary.

- Table 2 in this Situation Report, "Countries, territories or areas outside China with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths," has been simplified and now includes transmission classification. See Table 2 footnotes for additional information.

- As of [27 Feb 2020], there are 36 117 (26 403 in Hubei and 15 826 in Wuhan) cases who have recovered from COVID-19 in China.

- Under the International Health Regulations (2005), States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic shall notify WHO of the public health rationale of those measures within 48 hours of their implementation. As of [27 Feb 2020], 41 States Parties are officially reporting additional health measures. More information can be found in the Subject in Focus.

Subject in Focus: Update on additional health measures.
As of [27 Feb 2020], 41 States Parties have provided to WHO official reports on additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic under Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005), of which 14 are small island developing states. Seven States Parties provided updates on the measures they have previously reported on. 11 of the 41 States Parties are now reporting such measures against countries other than China. No trade restrictions have been reported to date. Table 1 presents a summary of additional health measures officially reported to WHO under Article 43 from [6-28 Feb 2020], by WHO region [available at source URL].

The majority of these measures are related to denial of entry of travelers originating from China or from countries reporting ongoing transmission of COVID-19, quarantine requirements for foreigners, self-isolation of returning nationals, and visa restrictions. The public health rationale for these additional health measures is mainly linked to vulnerabilities (e.g., lack of capacity for diagnostic and response, small island states context) in receiving countries, and the uncertainties about the virus transmission and disease severity.

Preliminary analysis of countries reporting cases that have imposed restrictive measures suggest that such measures may have delayed the importation of new cases but did not prevent the importation of the disease. WHO has emphasized to Member States that additional measures should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in duration, and reconsidered in light of the evolution of the outbreak and the constant advancements of knowledge about the virus and the disease.

WHO has published updated advice for international traffic, and continues to recommend against the application of any travel or trade restrictions in relation to the current COVID-19 outbreak.

WHO continues to engage with travel and tourism international organizations and industry associations to enable compliance with the IHR on avoidance of unnecessary interference with international traffic. Joint statements have been issued by WHO in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Documents/Circular%20Letter%20No.4204-Add.2%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20Imo-Who%20On%20The%20Response%20To%20The%20Covid-19%20Outbreak%20(Secretariat).pdf and UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2020-a-joint-statement-on-tourism-and-covid-19---unwto-and-who-call-for-responsibility-and-coordination, and will shortly be issued in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.
Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined) ***Cases identified on a cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China continues to grow and is now 51. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 23 countries from the European region, 4 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 10 countries from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 countries from the Americas region, and 2 countries from the African region. There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 4691 including 67 deaths.

At the same time, the daily number of reported cases and fatalities reported by China keeps decreasing from levels that were 2000-3000 cases daily to less than 500 cases per day.

It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
