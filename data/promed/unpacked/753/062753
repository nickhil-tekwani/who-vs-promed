Urban Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire - WHO Update 3
-------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 12 Sep 2001, the Ministry of Health has reported 143 suspected
cases in the entire country, with 27 suspected cases in Abidjan. The
Ministry of Health is currently carrying out vaccination campaigns using
existing national vaccine stocks in the areas of Abidjan where cases have
been identified. WHO is working closely with UNICEF and Aventis to dispatch
the crucially needed vaccine to supply the mass vaccination campaign in
Abidjan. The campaign will cover the city's 3.5 million population and will
begin on Mon 17 Sep 2001. Already 200 vaccination teams have been trained
and all vaccine sites identified. The international team will be assisting
the Ministry of Health to implement this campaign.
WHO advises travellers to Cote d'Ivoire to be aware of the risk of yellow
fever and to ensure that they are vaccinated, a requirement of the
International Health Regulations.
