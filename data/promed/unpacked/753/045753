--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known on this topic?
Implementing community mitigation strategies, including personal protective measures persons should adopt in community settings, social distancing, and environmental cleaning in community settings, during a pandemic can slow the spread of infections.

What is added by this report?
During [26 Feb 2020-1 Apr 2020], community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing) in the metropolitan areas of Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, and New Orleans declined, decreasing with each community mitigation policy issued and as case counts increased.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Public policies to increase compliance with community mitigation strategies might be effective in decreasing community mobility; however, more information is needed to assess impact on disease transmission.

Community mitigation activities (also referred to as nonpharmaceutical interventions) are actions that persons and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases. Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (such as handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (such as, maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces. Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available. Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation. The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity. This report presents initial data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; and New York City, New York to describe the relationship between timing of public policy measures, community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing), and temporal trends in reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Community mobility in all 4 locations declined from [26 Feb 2020] to 1 Apr 2020], decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased. This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.

When a novel virus with pandemic potential emerges, community mitigation strategies often are the most readily available interventions to slow transmission. CDC-recommended community mitigation interventions for COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are based on evidence for other viral respiratory illnesses and emerging data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and epidemiology, including groups at highest risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (1,2).

Public policies to implement social distancing include emergency declarations, bans on gatherings of certain sizes, school closures, restrictions on businesses, and stay-at-home or shelter-in-place of residence orders. These strategies can substantially disrupt daily life; therefore, the intensity of their implementation should align with progression and severity of disease (1). Understanding the timing and potential impact of policies designed to increase compliance with mitigation strategies will assist in guiding modification of those policies over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increasing the understanding of when and how to fully implement these strategies in future outbreaks where community mitigation is required.

Data from [26 Feb 2020-1 Apr 2020] were examined from the core metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of Seattle, San Francisco, and New Orleans, and from the 5 boroughs of New York City (3). These areas were selected because each had substantial numbers of reported COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the US epidemic (4). For each locality, the following data were analyzed: 1) types and timing of public policies issued to promote community mitigation interventions at the national, state, and local government levels; 2) cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases; 3) average 3-day percentage change in reported cases; and 4) community mobility.

The types and timing of public policies issued were collected by using Google Alerts and targeted Google searches for news media coverage of state and local COVID-19 orders and proclamations, followed by searching state, county, parish, and city government websites to locate official copies of each order. Confirmed cumulative COVID-19 case count data were collected from USAFacts (4), which aggregates data on cases by date of report from CDC and state- and local-level public health agencies. The 3-day average percentage change in cumulative case count was calculated after the cumulative case count was greater than 20 and is presented to describe more completely the trend in the epidemic growth rate. Community mobility was defined as the percentage of personal mobile devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, and watches) leaving home, using publicly accessible data from SafeGraph, a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from mobile devices (5). The percentage leaving home measure is the inverse of the SafeGraph "completely home" metric, an indicator that a device has not moved throughout the day beyond approximately 150 m (492 ft) of its common nighttime location. The average number of devices included in daily reporting was 80 095 in New Orleans (6.4% of population); 336 783 devices in New York City (4.0% of population); 163 981 devices in San Francisco (3.6% of population); and 177 027 devices in Seattle (4.8% of population).

In each of the 4 locations, a combination of state and local community mitigation policies was issued ([Table Public policies ordering COVID-19 community mitigation interventions and dates of issuance -- four U.S. metropolitan areas, [26 Feb 2020-1 Apr 2020] available at the source URL above]). All 4 metropolitan areas were in states that declared a state of emergency and put local limits on mass gatherings, although these varied by numbers of people allowed and, in some cases, changed over time. All 4 issued school closure and stay-at-home orders at state or local levels, and 3 parishes in the New Orleans MSA were the only areas in this study to implement a curfew.

In addition to state and local policies, which were implemented beginning in March [2020], on [16 Mar 2020], the White House announced the 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines for persons to take action to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This national action was extended for an additional 30 days on [30 Mar 2020].

Timing of community mitigation policies in relation to the increasing cumulative case counts of COVID-19 varied by locality ([Figure Selected community mitigation interventions,* cumulative COVID-19 case counts, average 3-day percentage change in case counts, and percentage leaving home -- four U.S. metropolitan areas, [26 Feb 2020-1 Apr 2020] available at the source URL above]). In all 4 metropolitan areas, an emergency declaration was the 1st policy issued, before large increases in cumulative cases. Stay-at-home orders were the last mitigation policy to be issued in all areas except for the New Orleans MSA, where a curfew in 3 of 8 parishes was issued after the stay-at-home order. In all 4 metropolitan areas, the percentage of residents leaving home declined as the number of policies issued increased ([Figure same as above; available at the source URL above]); in all 4 localities the percentage leaving home was close to 80% on [26 Feb 2020], and by [1 Apr 2020] the percentage leaving home was 42% in New York City, 47% in San Francisco, 52% in Seattle, and 61% in New Orleans. Overall, across the 4 areas, emergency declarations (the 1st policies issued) did not result in a sustained change in mobility; however, declines in mobility occurred after implementation of combinations of policies (such as limits on gatherings or school closures) and after the White House 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines were implemented. There were additional declines in mobility following stay-at-home orders in all 4 locations. The average 3-day percentage change also varied by locality, with some variation across the 4 metropolitan areas during the 1st 2 weeks of March [2020], followed by a decline and leveling in the last 2 weeks of March [2020]. These changes also follow the issuance of a set of policies and rapid decline in mobility mid-March [2020].

Discussion
----------
During [26 Feb 2020-1 Apr 2020], as cumulative cases increased and community mitigation policies were implemented, community mobility declined in 4 US metropolitan areas. With the exception of emergency declarations, which were implemented as cases increased in other regions and internationally, these policies were implemented during the period when case counts were increasing in each location, but the timing in relation to cumulative case counts varied. Public policies to increase compliance with social distancing, including limits on mass gatherings, school closures, business restrictions, and stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders appear to be associated with decreases in mobility. Policies related to specific locations or community organizations (such as mass gatherings, schools, restaurants, and bars) were often implemented within 1 or 2 weeks of mid-March [2020], likely a result of increased awareness and concern about the potential scope of the outbreak in the absence of mitigation. This awareness and concern also likely impacted the public, potentially leading to further decreases in mobility. Thus, the potential impact of interventions on mobility as well as this increased awareness of community spread of disease appears to be cumulative over time. Monitoring adherence to community mitigation strategies through mobility measures could improve the understanding of the types, combinations, and timing of policies that are associated with slowing the spread of COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases. Finally, there appear to be very early indications of potential impact of policies and social distancing on later changes in cases. There are likely a variety of contributors to these changes, including public health efforts to contain spread and individual efforts to increase personal protective practices. However, both policies related to community mitigation and social distancing, operationalized here as community mobility, could have contributed to these changes.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. 1st, these data suggest temporal correlations between issuance of public policies to increase mitigation strategies and rising case counts, on one hand, and decreases in mobility, on the other as well as 1st indications that these changes might impact growth of infections. The trends suggest an association but cannot prove causality. 2nd, although mobile device data can be used to understand movement within a community, the characteristics of those persons using these devices (such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity) are not known, so the results might not be generalizable or reflective of actual mobility patterns. Further, mobile phone coverage was limited to 3%-6% of the population in each location. In addition, the data presented here track mobile devices, not persons, who might have multiple devices (such as phone and tablet), who might not take their devices when they leave the home, or who might travel outside their home but remain within 150 m (492 ft) of their usual nighttime location. 3rd, confirmed cumulative cases of COVID-19 might not reflect the actual number of cases because of variability in access to testing and recommendations for who should be tested during this period. Finally, these 4 urban metropolitan areas are not representative of communities across the United States, and community mitigation policies might have a very different impact on mobility in suburban and rural communities.

These temporal trend data provide a preliminary examination of local timing of community mitigation measures and potential impacts on community mobility as well as very early indications of the impact of community mitigation on disease growth. As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the United States, the ability to assess the impact of mitigation strategies on reducing COVID-19 transmission will improve. Decreasing numbers of new cases are needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in communities and relieve pressure on the health care system. Better understanding of the short- and long-term impact of the community disruption that results from these measures is critical. However, this analysis suggests that policies to increase social distancing when case counts are increasing can be an important tool for communities as changes in behavior result in decreased spread of COVID-19.

A very interesting study on the adherence to the stay-at-home/shelter-in-place mitigation strategies and possible motivators to adherence. A preliminary look at the numbers of reported cases shows a trend for decreasing numbers following emergency orders being issued. It will be interesting to follow the variable of numbers of newly reported cases each day, going out at least 2-4 weeks after the implementation of these strategies to judge the impact of these recommendations. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 14 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The number of confirmed cases reported by countries reflects national laboratory testing capacity and strategy, thus the interpretation of the number of cases reported should take this into account.

- WHO has published interim guidance on oxygen sources and distribution strategies for COVID-19 treatment. The document describes how to quantify oxygen demand, identify oxygen sources that are available, and select appropriate surge sources to best respond to COVID-19 patients' needs, especially in low-and-middle income countries. For more details, please see https://www.who.int/publications-detail/oxygen-sources-and-distribution-for-covid-19-treatment-centres.

- The Director-General thanked the United Kingdom for its generous contribution of GBP 200 million [about USD 250 million] to the global response to COVID-19, an act which he described as a 'demonstration of global solidarity'. His opening remarks at yesterday's press [13 Apr 2020] conference are available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19--13-april-2020.

- A group of scientists, physicians, funders, and manufacturers from around the world have pledged to collaborate, in coordination with WHO, to help speed up the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19.

Subject in focus: WHO strengthening supply networks, forecasting required supplies, and sending critical shipments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 supply chain task force
--------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create an acute shortage of essential supplies, including personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and medical equipment. On 8 Apr 2020, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros announced a Supply Chain Task Force that will establish a COVID-19 Supply Chain System (CSCS) to provide countries with essential supplies for their COVID-19 response.

The COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force will:
a. Establish and implement a global strategy to ensure access to critical and life-saving supplies, as identified by WHO
b. Bring together the collective capabilities of public and private actors to meet these needs
c. Ensure the flow of vital supplies and essential cargo.

Pandemic supply chain network
-----------------------------
WHO Operations Support and Logistics, in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), continues to engage private companies in efforts to meet the unprecedented global demand for life-saving medical equipment, laboratory testing supplies, and personal protective equipment.

Initial talks with manufacturers of oxygen production concentrators and ancillary equipment indicate there is potential to secure PSA oxygen plants for installment in the coming weeks. A number of oxygen producers have expressed interest in supporting WHO efforts to secure vital equipment for its stockpile and to meet intermediate to long-term procurement requests.

WHO continues to deliver laboratory testing supplies to countries in need and is ramping up efforts to consolidate demand and work with PSCN stakeholders to ensure access and proper allocation of diagnostics equipment to increase testing capacity in those countries most in need.

COVID-19 essential supplies forecasting tool
--------------------------------------------
Through collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and UNICEF, OSL's COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-19 ESFT) is now available online (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/covid-19-critical-items). Demonstrations have been conducted in WHO EURO, EMRO, and AFRO regions.

The forecasting tool is designed to help governments, partners, and other stakeholders to estimate potential requirements for essential supplies to respond to COVID-19 pandemic. The tool enables the projecting of essential supply needs, including the estimation of personal protective equipment, diagnostic equipment, biomedical equipment for case management, essential drugs for supportive care, and consumable medical supplies.

OSL operations update
---------------------
OSL has organized shipments of critical supplies from Dubai to Addis Ababa, a WFP [World Food Program] hub, for onwards dispatch to 34 African countries. A plan to distribute 340 million surgical masks to 120 countries has been developed, and discussions are underway with WFP to prepare the distribution strategy.

OSL is continuing efforts to establish a global supply chain coordination platform to receive country requests for critical supplies.

Terms:
- No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table)
- Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
- Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures
- Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to:
-- Large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains
-- Large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance
-- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 34 244 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 85.6% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil (4.2%) and Canada (3.2%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 29.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 22.0%, Peru at 13.6%, Mexico at 9.9%), and Chile at 6.3%.

The European region was slower, possibly related to the Easter weekend [10-12 Apr 2020], having confirmed 29 923 (41.7% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3293 (61.3%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. The UK reported 14.5% of newly confirmed cases, Turkey 13.7%, Spain 11.6%, Italy 10.5%, France 8.9%, and Germany 7.0%. Russia accounted for 9.3% of the newly confirmed cases, more than France and Germany. Those 6 countries (UK, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and France, representing 10% of the European countries) account for 66.2% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1617 new cases representing 41.2%% of the regional newly reported cases. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Pakistan, and Qatar represent 12.0%, 10.1%, 8.7%, and 6.4% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Saudi Arabia represents 20.5% of newly confirmed cases, followed by the UAE at 17.2%, Pakistan at 14.8%, and Qatar at 10.9%.

In the African region, South Africa reported 18.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cote d'Ivoire at 17.6%, Algeria and Guinea at 13.1% each, and Burkina Faso at 10.2%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 30.5% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Singapore 30.2%, the Philippines 22.2%, and Malaysia 10.5%.

In South East Asia, India reported 68.0% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 17.8% and Bangladesh at 10.8%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 55.5% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh 32.0%, Thailand 6.0%, and Myanmar 3,7%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [14 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve dropped over the weekend, although the America's region did not appear to drop. Consistent with prior weekend reporting drops.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
