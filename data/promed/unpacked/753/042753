Peru: Vampire bat rabies kills 11 children
-----------------------------------------------
Eleven children from native communities in the Northern Peruvian
Amazon Jungle died because of rabies, after they were bitten by
vampire bats. Attacks by vampire bats led some villagers to leave
their homes in Condorcanqui Province, near the Ecuadorian border.
However, Peruvian authorities assured them that the outbreak is under
control. "Of course, people get frightened. They are temporarily
leaving their homes, and they are getting into the jungle," said the
Vice-President of the Inter-Ethnic Jungle Development Association,
Mr. Shapiom Noningo.
Dr. Luis Suarez, Head of the General Epidemiology Office in the
Peruvian Ministry of Health, declared to Reuters that 2 outbreaks
occurred in different places, one between last September and November
[2006], in which 3 children died, and another one last November
[2006], in which 8 children died. "All of them were less than 6 years
old," Dr. Suarez stated. The total number of persons bitten is 1101
-- the last one was bitten last December [2006] -- and they already
received their rabies vaccination; some doses were brought from
Argentina and Ecuador .
Blood is the only food consumed by vampire bats. They only live in
Latin America, and these animals attack humans when they are not able
to find suitable animals, since they may die if they go for 2 days
without food.
In spite of their poor reputation, Mr. Merlin Tuttle, an American
expert, emphasized that vampire bats are docile and easy to
domesticate, and they must not be vilified. Vampire bats avoid
daylight, and they discreetly bite the heads or feet of sleeping
humans. Curiously enough, they get accustomed to the blood of certain
persons. Mr. Noningo said that 10 000 persons live in this valley,
but there are at least 2500 persons living in the most affected
areas, which are the home of the Huambisa and Aguaruna native communities.

[When I examined my horse 2 we
eks ago, who lives at our place at 1000m (3300ft) in the coastal
mountains of Rio de Janeiro state, I
found a fresh vampire bite on the neck, along the
spine. Fortunately, we don't have vampire rabies here yet, because
my rabies shots expired years ago when I left the New York State lab.
I refer interested readers to the fascinating report of alleged
recovery from vampire rabies of a Peruvian boy who was untreated --
