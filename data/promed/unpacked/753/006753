Fox that attacked dogs had rabies
---------------------------------
A red fox that attacked 2 dogs in Nome has tested
positive for rabies, Alaska State Troopers said
Saturday [26 May 2007]. The owner of one of the
dogs beat the fox to death with a branch to break
up the 18 May [2007] attack, which occurred in an
area known as West Beach, west of the main part of town, troopers said.
Both dogs had been vaccinated and appear to be
fine, said wildlife enforcement trooper Brian
Miller. Both of the dog owners live in the area.
Because the area is isolated, the dogs are not
being quarantined as usual, Miller said. At the
time of the incident, the owner of one of the
dogs was visiting the other dog's owner. The dogs
were outside when the fox approached and attacked them, Miller said.
Because the fox's aggressiveness deviated from
the animal's usually shy behavior, Miller
suspected something was wrong and sent the
carcass to the state environmental health office.
His suspicions were confirmed Saturday [26 May
2007] when he learned the fox had rabies. Miller
said it's the 2nd local case of fox rabies in the
past 3 months that he knows of.

[Rabies regulations in each state may be slightly
different. However, in general, vaccinated dogs
are required to be quarantined. The length of
time of quarantine tends to vary a bit from state
to state. The quarantine period is primarily to
make sure that there was not a break in the
vaccine and the animal is not a danger to its
owners. This appears to be a self-quarantine
situation. Despite the rural nature, it is
certainly a recommended practice to vaccinate all
domestic animals against rabies.
