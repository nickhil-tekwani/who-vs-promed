[1] USA: 12 states, 21 cases

Product testing of a sample of leftover Navitas Naturals Organic Sprouted Chia Powder collected from an ill person's home in Connecticut isolated the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotypes] Newport and Hartford, and an additional serotype, _S._ Oranienburg. A search of the PulseNet database identified a total of 2 ill persons infected with the same strain of _S._ Oranienburg in 2 USA states. This strain of _S._ Oranienburg has been seen before in PulseNet, 1 case per month on average. Initial interviews with ill persons suggested a link to the ongoing outbreak investigation, so these illnesses have been combined with the existing _S._ Newport and Hartford infections previously identified.

As of 9 Jun 2014, a total of 21 ill persons infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Newport (13 persons), _S._ Hartford (6 persons), or _S._ Oranienburg (2 persons) have been reported from 12 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), California (3), Colorado (1), Connecticut (3), Florida (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (1), New York (4), Ohio (1), Utah (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (3).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 21 Jan 2014 to 21 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 1 year to 81 years, with a median age of 49 years. 62 percent of ill persons are female. Among 15 ill persons with available information, 2 (13 per cent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation update
--------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback findings have linked this outbreak of salmonellosis to various brands of organic sprouted chia powder. In interviews, ill persons answer questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before becoming ill. To date, 16 (100 per cent) of 16 persons interviewed reported eating chia seeds or powder, and 11 (73 per cent) of 15 persons who identified the type of chia product consumed reported eating chia powder specifically.

Laboratory testing conducted by public health laboratories in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York isolated one or more of the outbreak strains from 5 samples of leftover Navitas Naturals products containing organic sprouted chia powder collected from ill persons' homes and 2 samples of unopened Navitas Naturals products containing organic sprouted chia powder collected from retail locations.

The Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency continue to investigate similar cases of salmonellosis in several Canadian provinces. CDC, state, local, and Canadian public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. The FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and other partners in this investigation.

[2] Canada: 4 provinces, 34 cases
Date: Tue 10 Jun 2014

http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1370545/public-health-notice-outbreak-of-salmonella-infections-related-to-sprouted-chia-seed-powder


This public health notice has been updated to include 5 additional cases that have been added to the investigation. There are now 34 cases in 4 provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec) involved in this investigation and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has updated the food recall warning to include additional information for sprouted chia seed products.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with Provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Health Canada to investigate 34 Canadian cases of salmonellosis linked to the consumption of sprouted chia seed powder. Sprouted chia seed powder is made from ground, dried sprouted chia seeds.

As a part of this investigation, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued food recall warnings for various products containing sprouted chia seeds and sprouted chia seed powder under the brands Organic Traditions, Back 2 the Garden, Intuitive Path SuperFoods, Harmonic Arts Botanical Dispensary, Naturallyorganic, and Pete's Gluten Free. These products have been recalled and are being removed from the marketplace due to possible salmonella contamination.

The risk to Canadians is low, but those who have bought the recalled products sold under the recalled brands should not consume these products and should consult their health professional if they suspect they have symptoms of a salmonella infection.

Ongoing investigation
---------------------
In Canada, 2 strains of salmonella have been associated with this outbreak: serotypes Newport and Hartford. In total, 34 cases have been reported in British Columbia (6), Alberta (4), Ontario (22), and Quebec (2). 5 cases have been hospitalized; 4 cases have been discharged and have recovered or are recovering. The status of 1 case was not provided to the Agency. No deaths have been reported. The investigation is ongoing but currently, 19 of 19 cases [100 per cent] that have been interviewed have reported consumption of chia seeds or sprouted chia seed powder, and 16 of 19 [84 per cent] cases specifically report sprouted chia seed powder. More information on the epidemiological investigation is also available.

What you should do
------------------
These products have a long shelf life and may still be in people's homes. If you have these brands of dried sprouted chia seed powder products in your home, do not eat them. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. If you are unsure about the source of your sprouted chia seed product, do not consume it. Secure it in a plastic bag and throw it out. Then wash your hands thoroughly in warm soapy water.

The number of cases in both the USA and in Canada has increased and a 3rd serotype of _S. enterica_ has been identified.

Chia is often referred to as one of the natural "superfoods"; clearly contaminated superfoods can make one super sick. Thousands of years ago (http://www.bobsredmill.com/chia-seed.html) chia seed was a staple in the diets of ancient Mayans and Aztecs. The word chia is derived from the Mayan language, meaning "strength", and Aztec warriors relied on chia seed to boost energy and increase stamina. Today this tiny seed is a favorite of athletes, especially distance runners, who tout it as an endurance enhancing superfood.

Chia seed contains a wealth of fiber -- 5 grams in just one tablespoon. It is the fiber in chia that causes chia seed to swell when combined with water, creating chia gel. Whether you eat chia gel or just the raw seeds, the hydrophilic action of chia seed will keep you full longer than many other seeds. Amazingly, chia gel can also be used as a substitute for eggs in many baked goods. Use a proportion of 1 to 6 ratio of chia seeds to water to make chia gel. Use about one tablespoon of chia gel to replace one large egg in your baked goods. - Mod.LL]
