Infectious salmon anaemia
-------------------------
An occurrence of a fish disease, infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), has
been confirmed in Shetland.

It is on one salmon farm site that has been empty of fish since 21
Dec 2008 and is suspected at a further 2 sites (one of which has also
been empty of fish for 6 weeks) in the Burra area.

ISA does not affect humans but can cause serious damage to stocks of
farmed Atlantic salmon in seawater.

The Scottish Government has immediately set up a National Disease
Control Centre and is taking action to control the spread of the disease:
- statutory movement restrictions have been placed on all sites in
the control zone and wider surveillance zone;
- Scotland's Fisheries Research Services is sending a team of fish
health inspectors to Shetland to investigate the affected sites and
to advise industry on their operations under control arrangements;
- investigations into the potential source and potential spread of
the disease will be carried out.

Environment minister, Michael Russell, who has spoken to the company
involved, to local representatives, and to other salmon farming
interests in the last 24 hours , said: "Whilst this disease is
serious, much was learned from the successfully contained outbreak in 1998/99.

"We will be applying those lessons vigorously with the clear aim of
containing and then eradicating the disease from the current affected
site, which in fact is now laying fallow.

"To prevent the spread of any disease present, the harvesting of fish
from neighbouring sites will be conducted under biosecure conditions
and supervised by the Fisheries Research Services."

Ministers are being kept fully briefed by those working to control
the disease and links with the local authority have already been established.

ISA is a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937. It
is classified as a List 1 disease under the EC Fish Health regime
under which eradication action is necessary should an outbreak be confirmed.

Deadly salmon infection detected in Scotland
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA)], a deadly disease that could
devastate Scotland's [GBP] 300 million [USD 441.6 million] salmon
industry has been detected at a fish farm and 2 other sites in the
Burra area of Shetland, Scottish ministers said.

An outbreak of ISA on Shetland, the Western Isles, and Orkney in 1998
and 1999 was estimated to have cost the industry [GBP] 100 million
[USD 147.2 million] and led to the loss of 200 jobs.

To prevent similar damage this time, the Scottish Executive has
announced the formation of a national disease control centre. A
control zone and a wider surveillance zone have been established,
with movement restrictions put in place.

Mike Russell, the Scottish environment minister, promised that
lessons had been learned from the outbreak a decade ago, and said
these would be "vigorously applied."

ISA does not affect humans, but is potentially fatal to salmon and
can seriously harm the fish stocks.

Scotland is the world's 3rd largest producer of Atlantic salmon, with
sales of about [GBP] 300 million [USD 438 170 567] per year
worldwide. The industry supports 8500 jobs north of the Border.

The salmon farm where the disease was discovered has been empty of
fish since 21 Dec 2008, while one of the other 2 sites was emptied 6 weeks ago.

The Fisheries Research Service is sending a team of fish health
inspectors to Shetland to investigate the affected sites and to
advise the industry. Investigations into the potential source and
spread of the disease will also be carried out.

Tavish Scott, Scottish liberal democrat leader and Shetland MSP
[Member of Scottish Parliament], said he recalled the "enormous
financial problems" caused by the outbreak 10 years ago, but said the
industry had changed a lot since

[The following background is derived from the introduction to chapter
2.1.9. "Infectious Salmon Anaemia" in OIE's (World Organisation for
Animal Health) Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals,
available online at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_summry.htm>:

"Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a disease of farmed Atlantic
salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by the orthomyxovirus infectious salmon
anaemia virus (ISAV) . ISA primarily affects fish held in seawater or
fish exposed to seawater. However, indications of disease outbreaks
in fish held in fresh water have also been reported. The disease may
appear as a systemic and lethal condition characterised by severe
anaemia and haemorrhages in several organs. The most prominent signs
observed are pale gills, exophthalmus, distended abdomen, and
petechiae in the eye chamber; skin haemorrhages in the abdomen and
scale oedema may occur. The major findings on post-mortem examination
are circulatory disturbances in several organs caused by endothelial
injury in peripheral blood vessels. These clinical manifestations of
ISA are found in 4 organs: the liver, kidney, gut, or gill. The liver
manifestation is characterised by dark livers caused by haemorrhagic
liver necrosis. The kidney manifestation is characterised by
moderately swollen kidneys with interstitial haemorrhaging and
tubular necrosis. The gut manifestation is characterised by dark red
guts caused by haemorrhaging within the intestinal wall but not into
the gut lumen. In addition to being pale, the gill manifestation
includes, in some cases, accumulation of blood, especially in the
central venous sinus of the gill filaments. Lesions in the liver and
gut are easily visible while lesions in the gills and kidney are less
obvious. In some ISA outbreaks, one of the organ manifestations can
dominate, while in other outbreaks all manifestations can be found.
In individual fish all manifestations may be found to some extent.
Outbreaks dominated by either the liver or kidney manifestation
appear to be most common. Haematocrit less than 10 in end stages may
be observed. Diseased Atlantic salmon presenting with anaemia and
circulatory disturbances should be examined for ISAV infection, if
there are no other, obvious causes to explain their condition.

"Mortality during an outbreak of ISA may vary significantly. Daily
mortality in affected net pens may initially range from 0.5 to 1
percent, but may increase with time. Cumulative mortality ranges from
moderate to high and may exceed 90 percent in severe cases. The
disease usually starts in one net pen and it may take many months
before the disease develops in neighbouring net pens. Although
natural outbreaks of ISA have been recorded in farmed Atlantic salmon
only, subclinically infected feral Atlantic salmon, brown trout and
sea trout (_S. trutta_) have been identified. ISAV has also been
detected in 2 marine species, pollock (_Pollachius virens_) and cod
(_Gadus morhua_)." - Mod.AS
