On 14 Sep, animal health experts from Germany, Belgium, France and
Netherlands informed the European Commission that there are new risks of
foot and mouth disease spreading to European herds by way of meat imports
from Turkey and the Middle East, where outbreaks of the disease are
persisting.
These experts are asking that border and airport checks be reinforced.
According to checks carried out in the Netherlands, more than 1,500
kilogrammes of apparently contaminated food products are being seized every
day at Amsterdam airport.
