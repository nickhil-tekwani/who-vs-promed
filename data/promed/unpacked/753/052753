A fungal disease has hit hectares of tomato lands in Uttarakhand. The Haldwani district is the most affected with 250 acres reeling under this mysterious disease. Local farmers said that they had sprayed pesticides, but the disease could not be controlled.

The disease has attacked the plants, as the fruits have developed small black spots, and the leaves have withered. The heavily infected leaves have also turned black. If the disease is not controlled, then the farmers will incur huge losses. The farmers are hoping that the government will take adequate steps to prevent the disease from spreading further.

[Although a fungus is claimed as the pathogen causing the problem, it is not clear what evidence this is based on. Symptoms similar to what is described above may be due to a number of both fungal and bacterial pathogens of tomato.

Late blight of tomato and potato (caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the country, with a recent outbreak reported from Kerala (see link below). It was reported to affect tomatoes in Uttarakhand in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100121.0236), and it is not clear whether this disease has been excluded as a possible cause of the current problems in the state.

Disease management will need to be based on reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved.
