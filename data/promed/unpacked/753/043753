Wine disease hurts harvest
--------------------------
Italy's wine volume is forecast to slide 15 percent this year [2014] after disease affected [the] harvest.

The grape crop suffered from fungal disease, particularly mildew and botrytis. Average rainfall in Italy was 73 percent above normal in July [2014], according to the country's wine-industry association.

The Italian regions with the biggest declines are in the south, with Sicily's production forecast to slump 27 percent and output in Apulia falling 25 percent. Wine production in Piedmont may fall 8 percent [and] in Veneto, Italy's biggest wine-growing region, is forecast to decline 17 percent. Tuscany is expected to lift output [by] 3 percent.

[Mildews
-------
There are 2 mildews of grapevine. Downy mildew (DM) is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara viticola_. Symptoms include lesions on leaves which later become necrotic. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. Powdery mildew (PM) is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe_ (previously _Uncinula_) _necator_. Leaves heavily infected by PM have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and increased chance of winter injury to the vines. PM is favoured by warm temperatures and the absence of rain. Since high rainfall is reported above to be the trigger for the mildew outbreak, it appears more likely that DM is the cause.

Mildew spores are spread to the leaves and berries mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in infected leaves on the ground. Mildew diseases on grapevine can be extremely serious and will cause severe crop loss. They can be controlled with fungicides, however, wet weather may interfere with fungicide applications and fungal strains with fungicide resistances are emerging.

_Botrytis_
----------
The fungus _Botrytis cinerea_ can cause serious losses in both yield and fruit quality of grapevine. It causes lesions on leaves and also infects shoots, flowers, and fruit leading to bunch rot. If blossoms are infected, the fungus remains latent until berries begin to soften. Infection is optimal at 15-20 deg C [59-68 deg F] with free water or over 90 percent humidity.

Grape cultivars with dense canopies, thin skins, and/or tight clusters are more susceptible. The rot may progress to infect berry clusters or whole bunches, and girdling lesions on the stems may lead to drying and premature fruit drop. Affected berries may split open, develop a grayish mold on the surface and may shrivel in dry conditions.

The pathogen overwinters on plant material and is spread by water, wind, mechanical means, and juice from split berries. Mechanical damage caused by birds or insects creates entry points for the fungus and can greatly increase losses. Disease management relies mainly on fungicide applications, phytosanitation and cultural practices.

_B. cinerea_ also causes blights and grey molds on a wide range of hosts, including many crops such as brassicas and other vegetables, fruit crops and peanut.
