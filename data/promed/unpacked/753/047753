Hepatitis E in Chad - WHO update 3
----------------------------------
Between 26 Jun and 12 Sep 2004, a total of 1292 cases and 42 deaths
(case fatality rate 3.3 percent) of suspected hepatitis E cases has
been reported from refugee camps Goz Amer, Goz Abal, and neighboring
villages. The overall weekly number of reported cases is gradually
decreasing.
A preliminary assessment of the water and sanitation situation in Goz
Amer, conducted by the WHO investigation team, has shown that the
location of water points and latrines in the camp does not ensure
water safety, and, that current methods for water chlorination are
not effective.
Urgent control measures recommended include the systematic
chlorination of all water points in the camp, increasing soap
distribution, and social mobilization and health education activities
to improve the community's awareness of the disease and its
understanding of control measures.
Further epidemiological studies are currently being conducted to
identify potential sources of infection.
