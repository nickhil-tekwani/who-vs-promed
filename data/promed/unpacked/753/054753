The following information was provided at an excellent session on the
subject on Wed 19 Jul 2000. Among the speakers were Duane Gubler (CDC),
Perry Smith (NYS), Tracy McNamara (Bronx Zoo), & Marcelle Layton (NYC).
Humans & horses
-------------------------
So far during the year 2000, 200 human cases of encephalitis have been
tested for WNV from the New York area. None has been positive for WNV, &
no horses either.
Birds
-------
14 000 dead birds have been reported so far, compared with 17 000 in the
whole of 1999. Out of 800 crows found dead since 22 May 2000, 14 have been
positive, distributed from Rockland & Westchester Counties in the north to
Richmond County in the south, & from eastern New Jersey to western Long
Island, NY.
Mosquitoes
----------------
2 mosquito pools were positive, both in NY state: one of _Aedes japonicus_
collected in late June in Westchester Co., north of the City, the other of
_Culex pipiens_ collected in early July in Suffolk Co. (eastern Long
Island). _A. japonicus_ is a recently established import. Both species
have been shown to transmit WNV.
Sentinel birds
-------------------
Sentinel flocks of 3 chickens each have been placed in many counties, & are
being bled every 2 weeks to detect seroconversions. None have occurred so
far. Ducks may be a better sentinel, since 17/18 ducks in the ChildrenÂ´s
Section of the Bronx Zoo seroconverted in 1999 compared with only 1/18
chickens there. Sparrows have been shown experimentally to run high
viremias without dying; they are currently being collected in NY & NJ for
testing.
**********
My information is that Pound Ridge, Westchester Co., where a suspect
positive dead crow was found, is currently being sprayed. All indications
are that this mosquito season is going to see spread of WNV. Residents &
visitors to the greater NY area should take precautions against mosquito
bites.
