So far this year [2008], 2 people have been infected with
hantaviruses and a 3rd suspected case is under investigation

Today's edition [18 Jan 2007] of the [newspaper] El Mercurio signaled
that the Ministry of Health provided details that in the Araucania
Region a 34-year-old man died on 7 Jan [2008] due to this fatal
disease that affects the respiratory system, which he contracted in a
rural area.

Also this month [January 2008] a 37-year-old agricultural worker with
a life-threatening illness, was admitted to the intensive care unit
of the Talca Hospital in the Maule Region.

In the Biobio Region, a rural resident from Nube was admitted to the
Guillermo Grant Hospital, awaits [results of] tests being carried out
in the Institute of Public Health, to determine if he has [been
infected by] this fatal virus, which is transmitted by excretions of
the long-tailed rat [No doubt the long-tailed pygmy rice rat,
_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_). - Mod.TY]

[Mod. CP provided excellent comments in ProMED archive number
20060220.0553 as follows: Hantaviruses in South America are
maintained in sigmodontine rodents. Neither the viruses responsible
nor their presumed rodents hosts have been identified. Several
hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina:
Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat
host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), related Andes-like viruses
Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown), Lechiguanas (in
central Argentina in _O. flavescens_), Oran (in northwestern
Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western Argentina in
_O. flavescens_) virus. Other hantaviruses are present in various
South American countries and in Panama.

Although this article does not specify the hantavirus involved, it is
probably Andes virus.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>)
