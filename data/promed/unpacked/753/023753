_Salmonella_ Outbreaks Linked to Italian-Style Meats
----------------------------------------------------
Fast Facts:
Illnesses: 36
Hospitalizations: 12
Deaths: 0
States: 17
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to investigate two multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections -- one involving _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections and one with _Salmonella_ Infantis infections.

Epidemiologic data show that the likely sources of both outbreaks are Italian-style meats. Investigators are working to determine specific brands and products that are causing illnesses and whether the outbreaks are linked to the same Italian-style meat brands and products.

Epidemiologic Data
------------------
As of 24 Aug 2021, a total of 36 people infected with either _Salmonella_ outbreak strain have been reported. This includes 23 people who are part of the _Salmonella_ Typhimurium outbreak and 13 people who are part of the _Salmonella_ Infantis outbreak.

The true number of sick people in the outbreaks is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreaks may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections
-----------------------------------------------
23 sick people have been reported from 14 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 30 May 2021, to 27 Jul 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/italian-style-meat-08-21/epi.html).

Location / Number of Sick People:
Arizona / 3
California / 2
Colorado / 1
Illinois / 4
Indiana / 1
Maryland / 1
Michigan / 2
Minnesota / 1
Nevada / 1
Ohio / 3
Utah / 1
Virginia / 1
Washington / 1
Wisconsin / 1

Sick people range in age from 4 to 91 years, with a median age of 44, and 67% are male. Of 21 people with information available, 9 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Officials also obtained the sick people's shopper records with their consent. Of the 16 people with information, 14 (88%) ate Italian-style meats, including salami, prosciutto, coppa, and soppressata, which can often be found in antipasto or charcuterie assortments; several brands were reported. This percentage was significantly higher than the 40% of respondents who reported eating pepperoni or other Italian-style meats in the FoodNet Population Survey -- a survey that helps estimate how often people eat various foods linked to diarrheal illness. This comparison suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating Italian-style meats.

Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Infantis infections
--------------------------------------------
13 sick people have been reported from 7 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 9 May 2021, to 24 Jun 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/italian-style-meat-08-21/epi.html).

Location / Number of Sick People:
Arizona / 2
California / 5
Minnesota / 1
New York / 1
Oregon / 1
Texas / 2
Washington / 1

Sick people range in age from 1 to 74 years, with a median age of 41 years, and 31% are male. Of 10 people with information available, 3 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick and collected their shopper records with their consent. Of the 8 people with information, all (100%) ate Italian-style meats, including salami and prosciutto, that can often be found in antipasto or charcuterie assortments; several brands were reported. This percentage was significantly higher than the 40% of respondents who reported eating pepperoni or other Italian-style meats in the FoodNet Population Survey -- a survey that helps estimate how often people eat various foods linked to diarrheal illness. This comparison suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating Italian-style meats.

Laboratory Data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). For each outbreak, WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in each outbreak got sick from eating the same food.

Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections
-----------------------------------------------
WGS of bacteria from 20 sick people's samples predicted resistance to ampicillin for 19 (95%) samples and to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline for all samples. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antibacterials. However, if antimicrobials are needed, illnesses in this outbreak may be difficult to treat with ampicillin and may require a different choice.

Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Infantis infections
--------------------------------------------
WGS of bacteria from 12 people's samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
Investigators are working to identify which Italian-style meat brands and products are making people sick. Until then, CDC is advising people at higher risk for severe _Salmonella_ illness to heat Italian-style meats to an internal temperature of 165Â°F or until steaming hot before eating.
