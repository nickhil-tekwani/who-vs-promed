Red tide in higher than normal concentrations has been reported alongshore
of south western Florida since December 1999. The reported bloom boundary
was extended to the Marco Island area on 4 Jan 2000 after cell counts and
reports of fish kills and respiratory irritation from the area were
received by FMRI (Florida Marine Research Institute ).
Since 4 Jan 2000, eight manatee carcasses have been recovered from the
Marco Island area (southern Rookery Bay to Cape Romano). Six of these
carcasses have been recovered since 20 Feb 2000. Preliminary findings; 1
death is listed as watercraft, 2 are listed as undetermined/too decomposed,
and 5 are listed as suspect for red tide based on gross findings.
Immunoperoxidase analyses for localization of brevetoxin in tissues will be
performed on fixed tissues from the 5 suspect cases. Additional samples
were collected and frozen for further testing.
On Sunday 5 Mar 2000, a moribund manatee was rescued from the Port Of The
Islands marina, south of Marco Island, showing signs of neurological
impairment consistent with brevetoxicosis. The animal was transported to
Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa.
An aerial survey designed to characterize distribution and abundance of
manatees in the affected area is being planned. FMRI's manatee section is
on internal alert.
Ongoing water sampling is coordinated and reported by FMRI's Harmful Algal
Blooms section. Visit www.fmri.usf.edu/redtide.htm for more information.
