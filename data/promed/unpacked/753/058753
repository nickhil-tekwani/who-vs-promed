--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
US authorities might consider a policy similar to the European Pet Travel Scheme (PETS), which has proven extremely efficient in Europe (apart from illegal importation via alternative routes):
Vaccinate, test rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer after 30 days, wait for another 3 months before importation (incubation after exposure/infection before the anti-rabies vaccination, which will NOT act as post-exposure prophylaxis!).

Given the correct implementation of this procedure, not a single imported rabies case in a dog, cat, or ferret was diagnosed in any importing country. These import regulations for pets have been implemented in Europe officially since 2004, though incubation of rabies may exceed 4 months in rare cases.

[Dr Zanoni may have a point regarding imports. Perhaps the USA should further investigate this situation. - Mod.TG]
