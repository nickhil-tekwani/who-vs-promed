["Duck virus hepatitis (DVH) is a highly fatal contagious disease of young ducklings, 1-28 days of age. Ducklings are most susceptible at the younger ages and gradually become more resistant as they grow older. The disease is rarely seen in ducklings over 4 weeks of age. The onset of the disease is very rapid, it spreads quickly through the flock and may cause up to 90% mortality. Sick ducklings develop spasmodic contractions of their legs and die within an hour in a typical "arched-backward" position. The liver is enlarged and shows hemorrhagic spots. To prevent this disease, keep age-groups isolated and vaccinate breeder ducks with an attenuated live virus duck hepatitis vaccine (to produce maternally immune ducklings)."

"The disease, DVH, has traditionally been subdivided into types I, II and III.

"DVH type I can be caused by at least 3 different genotypes of duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) virus, a member of the genus _Avihepatovirus_, of the family _Picornaviridae_. The most pathogenic and widespread is DHAV type 1 (DHAV-1), which was formerly designated as duck hepatitis virus type 1. DHAV-2 and DHAV-3 are 2 additional genotypes within the genus _Avihepatovirus_ that have subsequently been identified as additional aetiological agents of DVH in ducklings.

"DVH type II is caused by duck astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1), a member of the _Astroviridae_ family. AstV-1 has been reported primarily in the United Kingdom. It has been reported in ducklings from 10 days to 6 weeks of age, and causes pathological changes similar to those of DHAV-1.

"DVH type III is caused by duck astrovirus type 2 (DAstV-2), a member of the _Astroviridae_. It is considered distinct from DAstV-1 and has been reported only in the USA. It causes similar liver lesions in young ducklings, but is less virulent than DHAV.

"Diagnosis of hepatitis in ducklings is based on the characteristic disease pattern in the flock, gross pathological changes, the recovery of virus from dead ducklings, and the reproduction of the disease in susceptible ducklings.

"The causal viruses of DVH are not considered zoonotic." Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.08_DVH.pdf.
