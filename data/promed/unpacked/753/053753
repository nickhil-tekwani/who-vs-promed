People visiting Marriott and Harry Sawkins parks have been warned not to touch or feed any wildlife following an outbreak of avian botulism in the local duck population.

Avian botulism is caused by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_, a naturally occurring organism living in lakes and ponds. Outbreaks occur when there is a combination of low water levels, warm temperatures and lack of oxygen in the water.

Council rangers had been investigating the deaths of ducks in both parks since early December 2012. Wildlife Rescue South Coast volunteer John Meany has picked up about 20 dead or dying birds from Marriott Park.

"I got a call to the park about a month ago to a duck that was almost dead," he said. "Then a couple of weeks later, I was called back and found 2 sick ducks and 13 carcasses."

Mr Meany said the sick animals were lethargic and often had paralysed necks that could not support their heads, resulting in the birds drowning.

"I took it to a Nowra vet, who said they had sent samples off to be tested. They had reports of about 200 dead ducks. After the vet got the diagnosis back that it was botulism, I warned Wildlife Rescue volunteers to be wary about being exposed to sick or dead animals in the parks," he said.

Council staff have carried out water testing in Harry Sawkins Park and found water quality within the pond to be at satisfactory levels.

Director of City Services and Operations Bill Paterson said council had been working alongside the Department of Primary Industries in putting practices in place to minimise any further outbreak of the disease.

"Council has put in place measures to ensure any deceased animals are quickly removed from the area, and we will continue to work with the DPI in dealing with the outbreak," he said.

Botulism commonly affects water fowl, but it can affect fish as well. Botulism is sometimes called limberneck in ducks and other waterfowl. Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (such as chironomid (nonbiting midges) fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible, avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are not immune to botulism toxin.
