Update of Bali rabies fatalities
--------------------------------
The Bali rabies outbreak human death count, according to Bali [local]
media, has reached 25. Particulars of 24 cases are listed below.

Age / Date of death / Residence
-------------------------------
28 / 14 Dec 2009 / Buleleng
45 / 12 Dec 2009 / Tabanan
46 / 5 Dec 2009 / Tabanan
28 / 24 Nov 2009 / Karangasem
12 / 23 Nov 2009 / Karangasem
13 / 13 Nov 2009 / Denpasar
7 / 11 Oct 2009 / Badung
54 / 8 Oct 2009 / South Kuta
49 / 7 Oct 2009 / Tabanan
6 / 2 Oct 2009 / Tabanan
78 / 22 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
78 / 16 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
47 / 14 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
24 / 6 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
62 (age also stated as 55) / 22 Aug 2009 / Tabanan
46 / 28 Mar 2009 / Ungasan peninsula
46 / 23 Mar 2009 / Jalan Uluwatu
45 / 30 Jan 2009 / Nusa Dua
32 / 17 Jan 2009 / Jimbaran
3 / 30 Dec 2008 / Kutuh
28 / 23 Nov 2008 / Ungasan
3 / 21 Nov 2008 / Ungasan
32 / 14 Nov 2008 / Ungasan
4 / 17 Sep 2008 / Ungasan

There are several caveats:
1. The Jakarta Post has named 19 officially recognized victims. Bali
[local] media have named 23.
2. The 78 year old victim who died on 16 Sep 2009 is still a mystery. No
death record for this person exists, but this victim's name was mentioned
in at least one press account, with biographical details matching those of
the 78 year old victim who died on 22 Sep 2009. This person apparently
requested but did not receive post-exposure treatment.
3. The Bali government does not recognize that the death of the 3 year old
who died on 30 Dec 2008 was a result of rabies virus infection. The father
of the victim had sought but was unable to obtain post-exposure treatment.
Detailed press accounts of the symptoms appear to establish that this was a
rabies death.

[Subject to the caveats expressed above the number of rabies deaths has
increased from the 20 recorded on 26 Nov 2009 to the 24 listed above (plus
one other case not identified). So far all the those affected have been
local inhabitants, but tourists and other visitors to Bali should be
forewarned of the risk.
