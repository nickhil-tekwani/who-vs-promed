One Washington [State] county [Yakima County] has experienced almost double the cases of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea so far in 2013 than it had in [all of] 2012. Though officials are not certain of the cause, they are urging residents to seek STD tests to see if they have this curable disease.

In 2013, there have been 108 reported cases of gonorrhea in Yakima County, which is a 74 percent increase in cases since the year before. According to the Washington State Health Department, the spread of the disease can now be classified as an "outbreak."

In order to combat the disease, health officials are encouraging residents to seek STD testing, especially if they are at risk. Those who have sex with multiple partners or are between the ages of 20 and 24 are the most vulnerable for the STD, noted CBS affiliate KIMATV. The Health Department has encouraged people both in the area and at the local colleges to get tested if they think they may be at risk.

[Another news report [also] says the highest number of cases of gonococcal disease this year in Yakima County occurred in 20 to 24 year olds (http://www.kimatv.com/news/local/Yakima-County-Suffers-Gonorrhea-Outbreak-227465061.html), but neither news report characterizes the cases of gonococcal disease further. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated.

Yakima County is located in south-central Washington State, with a population of 243,231 (2010), about 10 percent of which is 18 to 24 years of age. Over 41% of the county's population is Hispanic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima_County,_Washington) and many of its residents are involved in the agricultural economy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima,_Washington). The county is noted for agriculture: fruit crops, including apples, peaches, pears, cherries, and melons, hops, a key ingredient in the production of beer, and wine production. 38% of the county's population resides in the city of Yakima, the county seat of Yakima County. The city has a community college and an osteopathic school of medicine that opened in the fall 2008 and graduated its first class in 2012.
