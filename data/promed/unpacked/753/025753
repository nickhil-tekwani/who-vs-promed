The death toll due to the outbreak of leptospirosis in Bungoma District in
Western Province is 12. The source of infection is due to untreated water.
The schools and the communities have been drawing water from various
rivers and have not been treating the water. The river waters had also been
contaminated by untreated sewerage which was discharged into the river in
April this year.
The diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed by serological tests. The
death toll reported by newspapers includes deaths due to other causes. The
prolonged duration of the outbreak (since May 2004) may have been due to
continued exposure to contaminated water. The ministry is still awaiting
confirmation about the animal source of contamination. The most likely
animal source is suspected to be rodents. The area where the outbreak
occurred is a swamp area.
Leptospirosis in humans has been reported in Kenya in Nyanza Province and
Kwale District in Coast Province. In both these areas it was associated
with sugar cane growing.

Only 12 people have died from swamp fever disease in Chesamisi in Western
Province, the government said Thu, 17 Jun 2004. Disputing Press reports
that 26 people had succumbed to the disease known as leptospirosis,
Director of Medical Services James Nyikal termed the reports misleading.
The new figures emerged as the government announced that it had sent a team
of medical personnel to help in surveillance, investigation and health
education. "We have, for instance, sent our public health officers to
educate villagers on the disease and preventive measures," said
Nyikal. Another team was specifically tasked with finding the source of
the disease in the area, which has been put under a state of high alert.
Of the dead, 6 were students of Chesamisi High Boys School while 2 were
from Chesamisi Primary School. The others were villagers. Nyikal put the
number of those admitted to hospital at 86. "A total of 69 Chesamis high
school students are admitted to Webuye sub-district hospital in serious but
stable condition," he said.
11 villagers are admitted to the hospital, 2 at Eldoret's Moi Teaching and
Referral Hospital Eldoret and another 4 at Cherangany Nursing Home in Kitale.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sharif from the Kenyan Department of Health for
clarifying the extent and probable source of the serologically confirmed
outbreak. A recent report from Ethiopia found that 47.5 percent of febrile
outpatients who did not have malaria were seropositive for leptospirosis
(1). In other countries on the African Continent, the report cites
seroprevalence rates for leptospirosis were 33 percent in Ghana and 18
percent in Nigeria.
Readers should note that in epidemic leptospirosis on the Indian
subcontinent (2) and in the Americas (3, 4), severe respiratory disease was
found to be a prominent manifestation of the infection.
