Cholera cases in cyclone-hit Mozambique have risen above 1400, government officials said Tuesday [2 Apr 2019], as hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses arrived in an attempt to limit the rapid spread of the disease. Authorities announced a 2nd death from cholera, which causes acute diarrhea and is spread by contaminated food and water, conditions that some 128 000 displaced cyclone survivors now risk daily while living in temporary, often crowded shelters. Cholera can kill within hours if not treated.

The cholera outbreak has grown swiftly since it was declared last week [week of 25 Mar 2019] with 5 confirmed cases. Now there are 1428 [cases], most of them in the hard-hit port city of Beira, which has been the hub of relief efforts since Cyclone Idai roared in on 14 Mar 2019. The city of a half million residents is most at risk from cholera, but the disease also is reported in outlying communities in central Mozambique. The new death was in Dondo, government officials said.

Monday's (1 Apr 2019) count of cholera cases had been 1052. That figure was already more than double the 500 beds that are now open in 7 cholera treatment centers across the region, though the World Health Organization said it plans to "boost the capacity."

Mozambican and international health workers raced Monday [1 Apr 2019] to contain a cholera outbreak in the cyclone-hit city of Beira and surrounding areas, where the number of cases has jumped to more than 1000. One person has died of cholera, while 97 patients remain in treatment centers, with the others released, Mozambique's health director Ussein Isse announced. The new figures are an indication that cholera is spreading but is being brought under control, health workers say.

The overall cyclone death toll in Mozambique has risen to 518. With 259 deaths in Zimbabwe and 56 in Malawi, the 3-nation death toll from Cyclone Idai now stands at more than 830. Authorities warn the tolls are preliminary, as receding flood waters will expose more bodies. More than 140 000 people in Mozambique are sheltering in 161 sites, including schools and community centers.

Mozambican workers have restored clean tap water to parts of Beira, a city of 500 000, although large areas of the urban center still don't have access to sanitary water, David Wightwick, the World Health Organization's team leader in Beira, told The Associated Press while visiting a water treatment center. "A vaccination campaign against cholera, with 900 000 doses of the vaccine, will start Wednesday [3 Apr 2019]," Wightwick said. "That should blunt the edge of this outbreak."

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 l [4.2 qt] in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
