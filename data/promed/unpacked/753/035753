Seamen poisoned with phosphine
--------------------------------------
[An accident aboard] the cargo ship Odysk, under the flag of Sierra
Leone, which was carrying chemicals from Crimea to Turkey, resulted
in the deaths of 2 people. Additionally, one person was hospitalized
with severe poisoning, while 7 other members of the crew were
hospitalized with serious but less severe poisoning.
According to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Crimea, the
seamen were poisoned with phosphine gas, formed as a result of
contact between ferromanganese silicon and water.
The authorities of Crimea claim that any threat of chemical
contamination in the Black Sea and nearby coast has been eliminated completely.
Two members of the crew of the cargo ship died on board last Friday
due to poisoning from chemical weed-killers.

[There is a factual problem with the information in this report.
According to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Crimea, the
seamen were poisoned "with phosphine gas, formed as a result of
contact between ferromanganese silicon and water." In fact, phosphine
cannot be formed in this manner. Phosphine is a gaseous combination
of phosphorus and hydrogen. It is easily ignited and is toxic.
Perhaps there was another substance taken on board. The question is
left unanswered, and it would be helpful to know what, if any
chemical tests were carried out. - Mod.NP]
[Phosphine is the common name for phosphorus hydride (PH3), also
known by the name phosphane and, occasionally, phosphamine. It is a
colorless, flammable gas with a boiling point of -88 C at standard
pressure. Pure phosphine is odorless, but "technical grade" phosphine
has a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, due to the
presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphine (P2H4). Phosphines
are also a group of substituted phosphines, with the structure R3P,
where other functional groups replace hydrogens. They are important
in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; a metal
phosphine complex can catalyze a reaction to give chiral products.
Phosphine is highly toxic; it can easily kill in relatively low
concentrations. Because of this, the gas is used for pest control by
fumigation. For farm use, it is often sold in the form of aluminum
phosphide, calcium phosphide, or zinc phosphide pellets, which yield
phosphine on contact with atmospheric water or rodents' stomach acid.
These pellets also contain other chemicals which evolve ammonia which
helps to reduce the potential for spontaneous ignition or explosion
of the phosphine gas. They may also contain other agents, such as
methanethiol, to give the gas a detectable garlic smell to help warn
against its presence in the atmosphere. This has been extracted from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine>. - Mod.TG]
