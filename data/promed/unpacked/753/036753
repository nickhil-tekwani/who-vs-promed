Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
The USA is experiencing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

What is added by this report?
COVID-19 pandemic control requires a multipronged application of evidence-based strategies while improving health equity: universal face mask use, physical distancing, avoiding nonessential indoor spaces, increasing testing, prompt quarantine of exposed persons, safeguarding those at increased risk for severe illness or death, protecting essential workers, postponing travel, enhancing ventilation and hand hygiene, and achieving widespread COVID-19 vaccination coverage.

What are the implications for public health practice?
These combined strategies will protect health care, essential businesses, and schools, bridging to a future with high community coverage of effective vaccines and safe return to more activities in a range of settings.

In the 10 months since the 1st confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the USA on 20 Jan 2020 (1; see source URL for complete list of references), approximately 13.8 million cases and 272 525 deaths have been reported in the USA. On 30 Oct 2020, the number of new cases reported in the USA in a single day exceeded 100 000 for the 1st time, and by 2 Dec 2020 had reached a daily high of 196 227 (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases). With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing US holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the USA has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential.... These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact.

Recommended public health strategies
Universal use of face masks: Consistent and correct use of face masks is a public health strategy critical to reducing respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in light of estimates that approximately one-half of new infections are transmitted by persons who have no symptoms (2,3). Compelling evidence now supports the benefits of cloth face masks for both source control (to protect others) and, to a lesser extent, protection of the wearer (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html). To preserve the supply of N95 respirators for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, CDC recommends nonvalved, multilayer cloth masks or nonmedical disposable masks for community use (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html). Face mask use is most important in indoor spaces and outdoors when physical distance of 6 feet or greater cannot be maintained. Within households, face masks should be used when a member of the household is infected or has had recent potential COVID-19 exposure (e.g., known close contact or potential exposure related to occupation, crowded public settings, travel, or nonhousehold members in your house). A community-level plan for distribution of face masks to specific populations, such as those who might experience barriers to access, should be developed (Table; see source URL to view).

Physical distancing and limiting contacts: Maintaining physical distance (6 feet or greater) lowers the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection through exposure to infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols and is important, even if no symptoms are apparent, because transmission can occur from asymptomatic infected persons (2,3) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html). Outside the household setting, close physical contact, shared meals, and being in enclosed spaces have all been associated with an increased infection risk (4-7). Although the impact of physical distancing is difficult to disaggregate from other interventions, one study estimated that physical distancing decreased the average number of daily contacts by as much as 74% and reduced the reproductive number (R0, a measure of transmission, which describes the average number of persons infected by one infectious person) to less than 1 (8).

Avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor settings: Exposures at nonessential indoor settings and crowded outdoor settings pose a preventable risk to all participants (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/going-out.html). Indoor venues, where distancing is not maintained and consistent use of face masks is not possible (e.g., restaurant dining), have been identified as particularly high-risk scenarios (7,10). Crowded events in outdoor settings have also been linked to spread of SARS-CoV-2, although it can be difficult to isolate the impact of crowded outdoor events from related indoor social interactions (11).

Increased testing, diagnosis, and isolation: Isolation is used to separate persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those who are not infected; persons who are identified by testing to be infected should be rapidly isolated (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html). Estimates vary, however, more than 40% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be asymptomatic, and transmission from presymptomatic persons (those who are not symptomatic at the time they transmit infection, but who later experience symptoms) and asymptomatic persons (infected persons who never experience symptoms) is estimated to account for more than 50% of all transmission (2,3). Therefore, reliance on symptom screening to identify infected persons is inadequate (12). Increased testing is an important strategy to interrupt silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic and presymptomatic persons. However, because the sensitivity of available tests and the time since exposure varies, a negative test might provide false reassurance; thus, all prevention strategies should continue to be followed, including use of face masks and maintaining physical distance.

Prompt case investigation and contact tracing to identify, quarantine, and test close contacts: Case investigation is the process of obtaining comprehensive information about persons with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and is followed by contact tracing, which includes identifying and communicating with persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., close contacts; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) to inform them of their exposure, educate them about risks for and symptoms of COVID-19, and encourage them to quarantine, seek testing, and monitor themselves for signs or symptoms of illness (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/contact-tracing.html). Quarantine is used to keep a person who was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 away from others (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html).

Safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death: To protect those who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes, universal mitigation efforts are needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be completely asymptomatic or can manifest as a life-threatening illness; disease can result in postacute and long-term sequelae or disability among survivors. Risk for severe illness increases with age and is highest for those aged 85 years or older (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html). In the USA, approximately 80% of reported COVID-19 deaths have occurred in patients aged 65 years or older.

Certain underlying medical conditions also increase risk for severe illness or death for persons of any age with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html). Long-term care facilities serve older adults and persons with complex medical conditions; COVID-19 can spread rapidly in these congregate settings, resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality.

COVID-19 has also disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html). An age-standardized analysis of COVID-19-associated deaths reported to the National Vital Statistics System through 25 Nov 2020 found that Black persons accounted for 26.9% of COVID-19-related deaths, despite representing 12.7% of the US population (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/health_disparities.htm).

Persons who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness or death or who share a household with someone at high risk should minimize their individual and household risk by avoiding nonessential interactions with persons outside their household whenever possible and implementing all recommended public health prevention strategies.

Protecting essential workers: Essential (critical infrastructure) workers include healthcare personnel and employees in other essential workplaces (e.g., first responders and grocery store workers; https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce). Protecting essential workers requires full implementation of all evidence-based strategies outlined in this guidance. When a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), essential workers, including healthcare personnel, are among the populations being considered for initial phased allocation of limited vaccine doses (21).... US food manufacturing and agriculture is another sector that has been substantially affected by COVID-19, especially among workers in meat and poultry processing facilities, with disproportionate effects among persons who belong to racial or ethnic minority groups (22).... These persons should only return to work if they are and remain asymptomatic and undergo at least daily active symptom monitoring with immediate removal from the workplace if any signs or symptoms of possible COVID-19 occur; viral testing of all close contacts is recommended, and those with positive test results should not return to work.

Postponing travel: Travel increases the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection and could translocate infection between communities. Postponing travel is the best way to reduce this risk (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html). Any traveler who is symptomatic, has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 and has not met criteria for release from quarantine, or has a positive or pending SARS-CoV-2 test result should not travel (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/when-to-delay-travel.html). For those contemplating international travel, CDC recommends getting tested with a viral test for SARS-CoV-2 1-3 days before departure and getting retested 3-5 days after arrival (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-air-travel.html). Domestic travelers should also consider testing.

Increased room air ventilation, enhanced hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection: Increasing room air ventilation, enhancing hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces might help decrease transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (23) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html>). Although the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that most transmission is close person to person, there have been some documented cases of presumed airborne transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html). Avoiding nonessential indoor spaces can help reduce this risk. For indoor settings, increased room air ventilation can decrease the concentration of small droplets and particles carrying infectious virus suspended in the air and, thereby, presumably decrease the risk for transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/conferences/events/heatventair.html).

Widespread availability and use of effective vaccines: Widespread availability and high community coverage with safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines represent the most important public health strategy to control the pandemic. Many COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials. Promising products are being manufactured in anticipation of Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The federal government has established a centralized system to order, distribute, and track COVID-19 vaccines through states, tribal nations, and territories; these jurisdictions are preparing for vaccination with extensive planning for vaccine distribution and administration (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/planning/index.html). CDC and FDA will monitor the effectiveness and safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and update and communicate this information regularly. Vaccinated persons should continue to adhere to all mitigation measures (e.g., mask use, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) until both doses in the series have been received and the duration of immunity provided by vaccines has been sufficiently established.

Discussion
No single strategy can control the pandemic; rather, a multipronged approach using all available evidence-based strategies at the individual and community levels can break transmission chains and address high levels of community transmission; reduce related illnesses, long-term sequelae, and deaths; and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Because COVID-19 has disproportionately affected persons with certain risk factors (e.g., age and some underlying medical conditions) and racial/ethnic minorities, implementing public health prevention strategies in a manner that assures health equity is imperative to safeguard those who have borne the worst of the pandemic's impact. The US healthcare system is being stressed by COVID-19, with multiple jurisdictions establishing expanded or alternative treatment settings.... Schools provide numerous benefits beyond education, including school meal programs and social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. Because of their critical role for all children and the disproportionate impact that school closures can have on those with the least economic means, kindergarten through grade 12 schools should be the last settings to close after all other mitigation measures have been employed and the first to reopen when they can do so safely (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/indicators.html). Similarly, full implementation of public health prevention strategies can help preserve the functioning of essential businesses that supply food to the population, contribute to the health protection of communities and individual persons, and fuel economic recovery.

[The guidelines are well thought out and logical. The challenge will be compliance on the part of the population. The politics surrounding adherence to NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) has been a major deterrence to compliance with simple interventions. Examples are a seasonal gathering held 3 Dec 2020 in New Jersey that broke indoor crowd size restrictions and guests not wearing masks, and a large party with over 400 attendees in Suffolk Country, New York this past week. The travel guidelines make sense, but in recent days there was a media report of a couple who tested positive for COVID-19 and still flew to Hawaii (https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/12/04/hawaii-news/police-california-couple-flew-to-kauai-despite-positive-virus-tests/). - Mod.MPP]

[2] Anatomy of Europe's 2nd wave
Date: Fri 4 Dec 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/04/world/europe/europe-covid-deaths.html


By early June 2020, scarred and battered, Europe was emerging from the depths of its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Strict lockdowns in most countries had lifted healthcare systems off their knees, just as the USA and others were fighting record caseloads. The weather was warming up, the European Union was encouraging borders to reopen and Europeans were desperate for a break. They paid dearly for it.

A devastating 2nd wave has forced reluctant governments back into lockdowns or restrictions and inflicted new scars on European economies. The optimism of the summer is gone, replaced with the realization that loosening precautions led to thousands of deaths just months before vaccines may arrive.

We now know that the 2nd wave in Europe has become deadlier than the 1st. Nearly 105 000 people died of COVID-19 in November [2020] in 31 countries monitored closely by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, surpassing April's [2020] total, official data show. About as many people are dying in Italy each day as when Bergamo was the center of the world's attention. And in most countries, daily deaths are jumping higher this fall than ever before.

Western European countries such as Italy and Belgium, which were hit hard the 1st time, are suffering nearly as badly now. Portugal is doing even worse. Some countries, including Germany, have done roughly the same, while others have done somewhat better, including Britain. Norway, Ireland and Finland have done best of all.

But most notably, nearly every country in Central and Eastern Europe -- which as a region largely skirted the 1st outbreak -- is now seeing alarming spikes in cases and deaths. Dramatic springtime scenes of sick western Europeans stranded on stretchers outside packed hospitals are now playing out in Bulgaria and elsewhere in eastern Europe. In the spring and again in the fall, the coronavirus waves reached deadlier peaks in Europe than in the USA, adjusted for population -- although Europe's current epidemic has begun to level off, and the surging American epidemic may soon overtake it.

How did Europe, home to the world's richest club of nations, find itself back in the claws of a disastrous 2nd wave of the pandemic, after having wrestled back the 1st?

Rush to reopen
It was 14 Apr 2020, deep in the 1st round of lockdowns, when the president of the European Commission delivered a dreaded message: The summer vacation, a sacred European tradition and the economic lifeblood for many countries, might need to be cancelled. A week later, without explanation, she made a 180-degree turn. "I think we will find smart solutions to have some vacation," Ursula von der Leyen told Portugal's SIC TV channel. "I am positive about summer vacation."

Around the same time, the Commission, the European Union's executive branch that tries to coordinate policy for the 27 members, unveiled its "roadmap to reopening," suggesting to national governments how to slowly, cautiously resuscitate social and economic life. On paper it looked measured: phased reopening of schools, retail and other activities coupled with stepped-up testing and tracing as well as mask-wearing and distancing.

But most European governments moved much faster than the Commission recommended. Some, especially along the continent's southern rim, took big risks to admit tourists in July [2020], in a bid to rescue millions of tourism jobs. And the EU, eager to reestablish its fundamental function as a free-movement zone, encouraged countries to reopen internal borders, even as it continued to block outside travelers. More than 4 million people visited Spain in July and August [2020], often with no requirements to test or isolate when they arrived or returned home. While only a fraction of the normal number, it gave the virus plenty of opportunities. Tourists held parties in private villas in the Mediterranean, limiting the effectiveness of government restrictions, which often applied only to formal venues.

Research shows that these decisions -- swift internal reopenings with nominal restrictions, coupled with cross-border travel -- were at the root of the 2nd wave.

In Belgium, which suffered severe 1st and 2nd waves, people returning home from holidays abroad weren't tested, and quarantine demands were not enforced. Cases began to grow exponentially in September [2020]. "While millions of Belgians were returning from holidays including in hotspots such as Spain, mass tourism was a hidden incubator outside the country for a lot of Belgians," said Emmanuel Andre, the country's COVID-19 taskforce chief during the 1st wave.

Genetic research illustrates the impact of such policies. Dr. Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, together with her colleagues, identified a prominent variant of the virus that seemed to have originated or gained a major foothold in Spain by late summer. That variant, Dr. Hodcroft said, accounts for 60% to 80% of all 2nd wave cases in the UK and 40% of Swiss cases, and is noteworthy in other countries, including Belgium. The research indicates that people who traveled to Spain and became infected with this particular variant, took it back to their home countries in the thousands, and it spread from there.

Beyond the holiday season, a false sense that rapid reopenings would lead to rapid economic gains led many governments to adopt policies that backfired. "Europeans wanted it all," said Prof. Devi Sridhar of the Edinburgh University Medical School. "In Europe people are still wondering 'Is it worth it, should we protect people or the economy?'," she said, adding that experience shows this is a false dilemma. Economic forecasts from Europe indicate that the small gains made during the summer months have been wiped out in the 2nd wave, as the spike in economic activity coinciding with the summer months quickly plummeted. Overall, the EU economy is predicted to shrink by more than 7% this year [2020].

By late October [2020], Ms. von der Leyen, the European Commission president, acknowledged the mistakes. "Obviously the exit strategies were partly too fast, and measures were relaxed too soon," she said.

Sleepwalking into the 2nd wave
Signs of the 2nd wave were appearing in many European nations by mid-August [2020], when cases, still low, began to grow at an alarming pace. But, in some cases, politics took precedent.

As cases began to spread in the Czech Republic in the 2nd half of August [2020], the country's tracing system became overwhelmed, said Dr. Pavel Plevka, a virologist with Masaryk University in the city of Brno. By October [2020], about one in 3 tests came back positive, he said, a big warning sign. But life went on as normal. With elections scheduled for 3 Oct 2020, the government carried on as if nothing had changed, and it only pushed for a lockdown after the polls closed. The impact has been devastating. The Czech Republic suffered fewer than 500 deaths in the 1st wave of the outbreak but has recorded more than 8000 deaths in the last 3 months, in a country of fewer than 11 million people. It's one of the worst outbreaks in the world. "I have friends who had to work night shifts because of sick coworkers, they had no vacations, they worked and worked," said Dr. Petr Smejkal, the chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague. "They saw things they've never seen in their lives."

Mixed messages, misinformation and a relaxed attitude were spreading in Central and Eastern Europe throughout the summer, experts say. "I am glad we are less and less afraid of this virus, of this epidemic. You don't have to be afraid of it anymore," Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, said as he urged voters to July [2020] polls. "All of you, especially the elderly, don't be afraid, let's go and vote," he added. Today, Poland faces a severe 2nd wave that is straining its hospitals to the breaking point. Aneta Afelt, an expert in the geography of health at Warsaw University, said that the country implemented a strict lockdown before the 1st wave hit, and people complied. But then the messaging changed. "Politicians were saying that the virus has weakened and the pandemic is over, and maybe it didn't even exist. That put people in doubt and led to a growing group of people who doubt the virus, its origins and consequences," Ms. Afelt said.

Most hospitals in Central and Eastern Europe were spared in the spring. Fewer than 10 patients per 100 000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on a given day in April [2020] in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland. But in the fall, their hospitals have become some of the worst hit. On 30 Nov 2020, nearly 1 in 1000 Bulgarians was in the hospital with COVID-19, a rate higher than ever recorded elsewhere in Europe or in the USA.

Hesitant lockdowns, and the 3rd wave
Even as the 2nd wave began wreaking havoc in multiple European countries, governments waited to push ahead with restrictions. The 2nd wave lockdowns were slower and softer than those in the 1st wave, experts note, and in many cases they have not been strictly enforced, curbing their effectiveness, even as societies suffer economic losses and disruption. A collective exhaustion with new restrictions made it harder to get widespread support and compliance. "There was a certain hesitancy to reintroduce the measures after the summer, because we all knew what they meant in terms of the economy and society," said Bruno Ciancio, the head of disease surveillance at European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. "That hesitancy didn't really pay off. When you reach the levels that you see now, you have to go back to those measures anyway, but the price you pay is very high in terms of hospitalizations and deaths," he added.

The few countries that did move fast saw great benefits. Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway have kept the 2nd wave at bay. Ireland has recorded fewer than 300 deaths since 1 Sep 2020, just 15% of its 1st wave total, after a tough and early 2nd national lockdown.

But experts fear that the makings of a 3rd wave are already lurking in some European societies as they prepare for the holiday season. In the United Kingdom, the authorities are temporarily relaxing measures to permit up to 3 families to come together, even as they advise caution. Elsewhere, like in Belgium, rules are hardly being relaxed, but stores are reopening to accommodate holiday shoppers. Authorities are also debating whether skiing resorts should reopen, in a deja vu of the beach holiday debates. Dr. Hodcroft in Switzerland and other experts say the ski resorts could pose a grave health risk. "My worry is that we'll pay for Christmas parties in January and February [2021] lockdowns," said Professor Sridhar of Edinburgh University. "Unless we see massive behavioral change, we are going to see January and February [2021] lockdowns," she added. "The virus doesn't care it's Christmas."

Date: Fri 4 Dec 2020

Movement between Italian regions will be all but barred between 21 Dec 2020 and 6 Jan 2021, with people allowed to travel only for work, health reasons or emergencies, the Italian government announced on Thursday [3 Dec 2020]. And the restrictions will be even tighter on Christmas, 26 Dec 2020 and New Year's Day [1 Jan 2021], when Italians won't be allowed to leave their towns. "The Christmas festivities are coming," Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said during a news conference on Thursday. "We have to ward off the risk of a 3rd wave."

New cases in Italy have dropped in recent weeks, with 23 219 reported on Thursday [3 Dec 2020] according to a New York Times database, but the numbers remain well above the previous peak in March [2020]. And the country recorded 993 deaths, a new daily high, on Thursday [3 Dec 2020], surpassing the deadliest day in March [2020].

The government said it needed to prevent a rebound of the contagion during extended family gatherings and large parties. Mr. Conte pleaded with Italians to avoid organizing dinners or lunches with anyone they do not live with, especially during the holidays when, he said, "the celebrations become more intense."

Other measures announced Thursday [3 Dec 2020] include a ban on New Year's Eve dinners in hotels, allowing room service only that night. Ski slopes will be closed from the Alps to the Apennines, a coordinated decision by Italy, France and Germany.

The new decree also imposed quarantines on travelers from abroad during the holidays. "It's going to be a Christmas different from all the others," Mr. Conte said.

In other developments around the world:

- China plans to approve 600 million coronavirus vaccines for sale by the end of the year [2020], Wang Junzhi, a biological products quality control expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said on Friday [4 Dec 2020]. The government has already made unproven candidates widely available in an effort to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness. But it has not announced any efficacy data yet, and a spate of quality scandals in recent years has made the Chinese public skeptical of vaccines.

- Most establishments in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, will be required to close by 9 pm starting on Saturday [5 Dec 2020], the city's mayor said. The country reported more than 600 new cases on Friday [4 Dec 2020], its highest tally in nearly 9 months.

- Japan is facing a new coronavirus crisis, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said during a Friday [4 Dec 2020] news conference, noting a rise in the number of severely ill patients had begun to put a strain on hospitals. Japan is experiencing a 3rd outbreak, which has brought some of the country's highest single-day tallies of new infections and deaths since the pandemic began, driven largely by clusters in the Tokyo metropolitan area. While the prime minister fell short of declaring a state of emergency, he urged the public to take precautions.

[These updates shed light on the planned lockdown for the holiday season in Italy in contrast with elsewhere in Europe as described in section [2] above, and highlight the major increases in transmission and deaths occurring in South Korea and Japan.

We await data on efficacy and safety of the Chinese vaccine. It should be reminded that to date the only information available on vaccines that have finished stage 3 clinical trials has been available through press releases by the companies and not through scientific articles. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (237 339), Brazil (47 435), India (36 638), and Turkey (32 736) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 534 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (3-4 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Turkey, Russia (27 403), Italy (24 110), Germany (23 541), UK (16 298), Ukraine (15 131), Iran (13 341), Poland (13 236), Mexico (12 127), and France (11 221). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 62 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days (606 161) and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 4.0%, while daily reported deaths (10 760) have increased by 5.5%. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (11.8%) and reported deaths (35.2%), which may be the start of the expected increase associated with the Thanksgiving weekend travel and gatherings. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 188 326 and newly reported deaths is 2075. The USA has reported more than 200 000 new cases daily over the past 3 days, and over 2500 deaths per day over the past 4 days, and today (4 Dec 2020) represented over one-third of all newly reported cases (34.1%).

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with almost 700 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission -- it is now one week after Thanksgiving Day [26 Nov 2020] and the expected increase in cases due to travel and gatherings may be beginning. That said, the reported numbers will start dropping as the weekend reporting decrease sets in. - Mod.MPP]
