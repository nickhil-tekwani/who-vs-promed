More than 15 000 people suffer from cassava disease "konzo" in DR
Congo: official
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 15 000 cases of people suffering from the cassava[-caused]
disease "konzo" have been reported [this year] against 11 000 cases in
2008, according to the governor of Bandundu province in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DR Congo).

The disease is characterized by spastic paralysis and is caused by the
cyanide contained in the cassava, unlike paralysis of the joints which
can be avoided by vaccination against polio, Governor Richard Ndambu
Wollang said here on Sunday [28 Mar 2010]. The spastic paralysis
hardens the muscles and slows movement.

The problem was attributed to lack of water in Bandundu province that
can be used to eliminate this cyanide from cassava within an
appropriate time. The population ends up placing this cassava in water
that cannot totally eliminate the toxic substance.

The Bandundu governor was in Kinshasa to seek the central government's
support. The financial needs stand at 600 000 U.S. dollars, including
200 000 dollars already allocated for the drilling for water for
villages situated far away from the natural sources of water.

[Konzo is characterized by an acute isolated and symmetrical
hypertonic paraparesis, which is permanent but non-progressive. To
date, 2 large epidemics have been reported, each of more than 1000
cases. The 1st was in the Bandundu region in Congo (1936-37) and the
2nd in the Nampulla province of Mozambique (1981). Small outbreaks
have been reported from Congo, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Central
African Republic. Sporadic cases of konzo also occur. The majority of
cases occur in the dry season, chiefly during a long drought. Familial
clustering is common.

Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_, Crantz) is a root crop widely consumed
in Africa and South America. Although it originated in Brazil (where
it is called manioc), it was brought to Africa by Portuguese
colonists, and it is now an important crop there and in Indonesia and
Southeast Asia. It is the principal source of nutrition for about 500
million people. Its leaves are edible, but the prize is its starchy
root, rich in protein, minerals, and vitamins A, B, and C.

Cassava is used in a vast variety of cakes, snacks, and desserts and
grows wild in many places, being tough and drought-resistant. In
countries where hunger is an overt reality for many poor households,
cassava is among those food crops that can make the crucial difference
between starvation and survival. The cassava plant is the world's 3rd
most important crop. Cassava enters the North American diet also, as
it is made into tapioca.

Surprisingly for an important edible plant, cassava is quite poisonous
without proper preparation. The toxin in cassava is called linamarin.
When eaten raw or inadequately prepared, the human digestive system
will convert this to cyanide. Even 2 cassava roots contain a fatal
dose of poison. While the bitter variety (white cassava) of the plant
has larger concentrations of cyanide than the sweet variety (yellow
cassava), the sweet cassava is not without risk.

To prepare cassava, it should be peeled, grated, and soaked in warm
water for several days. This allows the cassava's own natural enzyme
(linamarase) to convert the cyanogen linamarin to sugar and cyanide
gas, and the volatile gas disperses usually harmlessly. However, women
-- who are usually charged with processing the plant -- can be
sickened by inhaling cyanide gas. What remains after processing can be
boiled and eaten, or more usually, dried and ground.

The shelf life of a cassava root is quite short once it is removed
from the stem, so there is an urgency to get the food to market. Roots
can turn to mush in less than a week. The rush to get cassava to the
market may keep some batches of cassava from being processed properly.

Cyanide is normally converted in humans to the less toxic thiocyanate
by the enzyme rhodanase, a mitochondrial enzyme which is widely
present throughout the human body, with the highest concentrations in
the liver and kidneys. Thiocyanate is the chief metabolite of cyanide.
Thiocyanate itself has a goitrogenic effect [produces goitre] if there
is a shortage of iodine in the diet. The body uses sulphur-containing
amino acids to render cyanide harmless. If the diet is deficient in
protein, cyanide will be converted to cyanate, which induces
neurodegenerative disease in both animals and humans. The cells which
are most affected are Betz cells in the motor cortex. Tropical ataxic
neuropathy can also be produced.

Konzo begins abruptly, without prodromal signs. In 90 percent of cases
the onset of symptoms takes less than a day. The initial symptoms are
described as tremor, cramps, a heavy feeling, and/or weakness in the
legs, a tendency to fall down, and difficulty remaining upright. There
is a visible hypertonic gait when walking or running. Occasionally
there will be lower back pain, blurred vision, speech difficulties,
and/or paresthesia of the legs, but these symptoms disappear within a
month. During the 1st 2 days the majority of patients have general
muscular weakness and are confined to bed. Hypertonicity is present
from day one. Flaccid paralysis of the limbs does not occur. Later
there is a slight partial improvement. Finally the affected person
develops a stable hypertonic paraparesis, which persists for the
remainder of life, or might improve a little. After onset the
neurological signs remain constant or improve minimally if no further
cyanide is ingested.

Prevention of konzo therefore involves avoiding a farming system
dominated by bitter cassava (which contains higher cyanide levels),
insufficient cassava processing, and a protein deficient diet.

In an effort to avoid this toxicity, it has been reported by Siritunga
and Sayre (1) that transgenic cassava free of cyanogens can be
produced. The investigators generated transgenic plants in which
cytochrome oxidase enzymes that catalyze the 1st step in linamarin
synthesis are inhibited. The plants showed a 94 percent reduction in
leaf linamarin content and a 99 percent decrease in root linamarin
levels. Additionally, the same group (2) has reported that transgenic
cassava plants can be produced that overexpress the gene for
hydroxynitrile lyase, facilitating cyanogenesis during processing and
producing a final product with less risk. The tubers of cassava do not
have this enzyme, and processing relies on spontaneous conversion.
Combining these methods could further decrease the risk of cyanide
poisoning from cassava.
