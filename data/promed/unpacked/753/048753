Family of 3 ill with botulism after eating tainted sausage
-------------------------
A Daegu family of three is in stable condition in the first known case in
Korea of food poisoning caused by the Clostridium botulinum bacterium.
A toxin produced by the bacterium can cause fatal paralysis of the
respiratory system. The bacterium is found in soil, from which it may be
carried to foods. It produces the toxin when improperly processed. Botulism
is not accompanied by diarrhea, as most other food poisonings are.
A couple and their 10-year-old daughter remained in the hospital yesterday
in Daegu after being admitted June 14, the National Institute of Health
said. The three had complained of difficulty breathing and general
weakness, it said.
The toxin was found in the stool of the 36-year-old woman, the institute
said. Her 40-year-old husband, and the daughter are also confirmed to have
been affected by the toxin. It was thought to come from sausages the 3 had
eaten.
A disease-control official, Kwon Jun-wook, said [the mother] and her
daughter were on respirators, but all 3 patients have improved markedly.
There have been no indications of additional patients, he added.
Clostridium botulinum bacteria become active in the absence of oxygen. Thus
canned food that has not been properly heat-processed provides optimum
conditions for their proliferation. But the bacteria also have been
associated with other foods improperly treated.
Signs of poisoning can appear up to 36 hours after consumption of tainted
food. Early symptoms also include blurred vision and excessive thirst. More
than 100 people are affected by the bacteria each year in the United
States, with a fatality rate of about 8 percent.
The institute advised thoroughly heating food before eating it. Since the
toxin is not associated with obvious signs, such as odor or taste, it
recommends disposing of food items when in doubt.

Botulism Patients Reported for First Time
Botulinus toxin poisoning has been reported for the first time in the
country, the National Institute of Health (NIH) said yesterday.
A 40-year-old Taegu man, his 36-year-old wife, and their 10-year-old
daughter have been hospitalized with botulism.
The 3 showed symptoms such as difficulty breathing and stiffness of their
limbs after eating sausages at a sauna nearby their home, the NIH said.
The NIH said botulinus toxin was only detected in [the mother], but it has
classified all 3 as botulism patients as they ate the same food and showed
similar symptoms.
Officials said they have collected sausages with the same serial number
from the manufacturer to determine whether they were responsible for the
food poisoning.
Normally caused by eating tainted canned food, the toxin paralyzes the
arms, legs and muscles of those infected. Eight percent of all cases end in
death, with about 100 cases recorded on average in the United States each year.
As it is one of the most potent toxins ever known, botulinus also poses a
major biological threat and is closely monitored in the United States and
other countries.
A NIH official said the cases seem unrelated to biological terrorist acts
but they have stepped up surveillance just in case.
He said people should seek immediate hospital treatment if they suffer from
breathing difficulties after eating canned food.

[Borrowing the discussion from an earlier ProMED-mail posting by Roberta M
Hammond, PhD, Botulism, bottled garlic - Denmark (03): discussion
20030209.0342 ] Botulism is an intoxication caused by a neurotoxin
produced by an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram positive, rod-shaped
bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_. The spores are heat resistant and can
survive in foods that are improperly processed. Most outbreaks are due to
types A, B, and E. The organism and its spores are widely distributed in
nature. They are present in soil, agricultural products, including honey,
marine sediment, and the intestinal tract of animals, including fish.
Symptoms of botulism include weakness, dizziness, blurred or double vision,
difficulty in swallowing and speaking, paralysis, respiratory failure, and
death. A very small amount (a few nanograms) of toxin can cause illness.
Onset of symptoms ranges from 12 hours to 8 days (usually 12 to 36 hours)
after eating contaminated food. In general, the shorter the incubation
period, the more severe the disease and the higher the case fatality rate.
The duration of illness ranges from one day to several months.
Foodborne botulism is acquired by ingestion of food in which the toxin has
been formed, predominantly after inadequate heating during preservation and
without subsequent adequate cooking. Foods associated with botulism are
mostly home-canned foods (vegetables and fruits); commercial processed
foods (tuna, smoked fish, mushrooms, soup, garlic in oil, and cheese
sauce); sauteed onions, and leftover baked potatoes. Conditions that favor
the growth include low-acid foods (pH above 4.6), high moisture content
(water activity above 0.93), low salt, food devoid of oxygen, and
unrefrigerated storage.
The newswire mentions that this is the first identified cluster of botulism
in South Korea. In the newswire discussions there is the suggestion that
this cluster of 3 cases may have been associated with a commercially canned
sausage product and hence there may be concerns of additional contaminated
cans in circulation. More information on this cluster and follow-up
investigations would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
