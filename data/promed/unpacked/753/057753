The United Nations has revealed that the number of Kala-azar disease [leishmaniasis] cases in South Sudan has risen to 4624 after 9 months of war in the newborn country.

The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) [http://www.unocha.org/south-sudan/] said in the weekly situation update that 260 new cases have been recorded since September 2014, bringing the 2014 total to 4624; up from 1614 cumulative cases up to the same week in 2013. OCHA said most of the cases were in Chuil, Lankien, and Malakal districts.

"A full response to Kala-azar requires additional health and nutrition partners to support treatment facilities," the OCHA report said. "In addition, more health partners need training on diagnosis and case management."

Kala-azar is transmitted by the bite of the sand fly and can be fatal within weeks if not treated.

The kala-azar outbreak continued with 4624 cases reported compared to 1614 cumulative cases in the same week in 2013.

WASH scale-up in Bentiu increased water supply to 12.2 litres per person per day, and sanitation improved to one latrine for every 71 people. Work continued in order to reach emergency standards.

Nutrition indicators were dire, with 33 of the 37 counties in critical and very critical nutrition phases located in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei, Unity, Upper Nile, and Warrap States.

USD 1.1 billion have so far been contributed to the South Sudan Crisis Response Plan to support humanitarian action.

Intermittent hostilities continued in Doleib Hill and Canal/Khorfulus areas of Jonglei State. Flight safety assurances to Canal, Kaldak, and Khorflus could not be guaranteed due to heavy presence of armed elements. However, the humanitarian operation site (Kamel) in Pigi County was unaffected by the hostilities. Elsewhere in Jonglei, analysis on returns to Bor town showed that a "general return movement" was not yet taking place but rather that the situation remained fluid, with people moving in and out of the town.

In Upper Nile State, partners planned a mission to Renk to assess the needs of people displaced by the recent fighting in the area. Renk remained calm, with reports of about 5000 displaced people returning to the town from the south.

In Lakes State, growing insecurity, combined with poor road conditions, limited humanitarian activities outside Rumbek town, and it was difficult to ascertain the situation outside the urban area. Cattle raids and revenge attacks continued during the week, some of them reportedly fatal.

In Unity State, UN police were investigating the killing of 2 people inside the PoC site at Bentiu. The security situation otherwise remained calm, but unpredictable.

There were reports of shooting in Yei, Central Equatoria, reportedly by armed elements upset over non-payment of salaries. Further details were unknown, and the situation was reportedly calm thereafter.

Health partners reported malaria on the rise, particularly in Awerial, Lakes State and in UN House PoC in Juba. There were also 16 measles cases reported during the week: 5 in Awerial and 11 in Lankien, Jonglei.

Kala-azar, an endemic disease in South Sudan, continued to spread, with 4624 cases reported compared to 1614 cumulative cases in the same week last year [2013]. Overall, malaria, acute watery diarrhea, and acute respiratory infection remained the main causes of illness among displaced people tracked. Partners stressed that a full response to Kala-azar requires additional health and nutrition partners to support treatment facilities. In addition, more health partners need training on diagnosis and case management.

Food security monitors noted that heavy rainfall continued across the country in September 2014, increasing flooding and compromising crop performance in some areas.

[South Sudan (as the rest of Sudan) is highly endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, VL (Kala-Azar), and is probably the most endemic country in the world.

For a review of the data on leishmaniasis in Sudan and South Sudan, see the comments to the ProMED-mail posting from 16 Sep 2012 (Leishmaniasis, visceral - South Sudan (02): (UY) 20120916.1295988).

Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Sudan and South Sudan, and outbreaks occur regularly and unexpectedly in areas that were previously unaffected. A recent outbreak started at the end of 2009 with thousands of cases, possibly caused by massive population movements and growing food insecurity. This outbreak continued to cause extremely high case numbers in both 2010 and 2011 (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al: Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 2012; 7(5): e35671. (Supplement 81); http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671.

Malnutrition in the population probably contributes to the number of clinical cases of visceral leishmaniasis. An estimated 10 percent of VL cases in Southern Sudan are co-infected with HIV. - Mod.EP
