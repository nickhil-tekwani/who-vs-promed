A nationwide listeria outbreak that has killed 25 people who ate
tainted cantaloupe was probably caused by unsanitary conditions in the
packing shed of the Colorado farm where the melons were grown, federal
officials said on Wednesday [19 Oct 2011].

Government investigators said that workers had tramped through pools
of water where listeria was likely to grow, tracking the deadly
bacteria around the shed, which was operated by Jensen Farms, in
Granada, Colorado. The pathogen was found on a conveyor belt for
carrying cantaloupes, a melon drying area and a floor drain, among
other places.

"You're rolling around cantaloupe on uncleanable equipment and you're
getting it wet and you're not cooling it -- it provides the perfect
environment for listeria growth and spread," said James Gorny, a
senior food safety adviser at the Food and Drug Administration [FDA].

The outbreak, which began in late July 2011, is the deadliest caused
by foodborne disease since 1985. A total of 123 people in 26 states
have fallen ill, including those who died, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nicholas J Parolisi Jr, a lawyer for Jensen Farms, said he could not
comment on the FDA's accusations. The farm had passed a food safety
audit by an outside contractor just days before the outbreak began.
Eric Jensen, a member of the family that runs the farm, said in an
email that the auditor had given the packing plant a score of 96
points out of 100. FDA officials did not criticize the auditor
directly. But Michael R Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods, said
the agency intended to establish standards for how auditors should be
trained and how audits should be conducted. The food industry
increasingly has come to rely on what it calls 3rd-party audits of
farms or processing plants to ensure the safety of food. But the
auditors are hired by the companies being inspected, and their
procedures are largely unregulated. In several recent food safety
lapses, the facilities involved had passed 3rd-party audits.

It was not clear how listeria initially got into the packing shed,
which officials described as an open-air structure having a concrete
floor, a roof, and no walls. Listeria is frequently found in soil or
manure, but tests of the soil on the farm did not turn up the
bacteria. Officials said that a dump truck used to take culled melons
[removal of any product that showed signs of physical damage, such as
skin breaks or decay] to a cattle farm was parked near the processing
shed and could have brought bacteria to the facility.

Jensen Farms, run by Mr Jensen and his brother Ryan, had recently
acquired a set of used machinery to upgrade the way it washed and
dried its cantaloupes. The equipment had been used to clean potatoes
and was not intended for use with cantaloupes, officials said. They
said the equipment was corroded in places and built in a way that made
it difficult to clean and sanitize. An area used to dry the melons
included a cloth cover that could easily have harbored the bacteria,
according to a person who discussed the operation with the Jensens.

Officials also said that the cantaloupes had not been adequately
cooled before they were placed in refrigerated storage, which could
have caused condensation to form on the fruit, creating hospitable
conditions for listeria. The bacteria grow well in wet or damp
conditions and can also thrive in cold.

Dr Gorny said that some of the conditions he described, including
pools of water on the floor, had been noted during a visit in
mid-September 2011 after the plant ceased operation and the equipment
was dismantled. It was not clear if investigators who had visited the
plant while it was still in operation saw the same unsanitary
conditions. Officials said that conditions at Jensen Farms were not
typical of the produce industry. "We have no reason to believe these
factors are indicative of practices throughout the industry," said
Sherri McGarry, a senior FDA adviser.

The outbreak is likely to focus new attention on the use of auditors
in the food industry. Typically farms or processors are required by
their customers, like supermarket or restaurant chains, to have an
auditor evaluate their food safety procedures. Jensen Farms hired an
auditor called PrimusLabs, based in California, to inspect its
facility. Primus gave the job to a subcontractor, Bio Food Safety,
which is based in Texas. Jensen and Primus declined to provide a copy
of the audit report.

Robert Stovicek, the president of PrimusLabs, said his company had
reviewed the audit and found no problems in how it was conducted or in
the auditor's conclusions. "We thought he did a pretty good job," Mr
Stovicek said. He said the auditor, James M DiIorio, has been doing
audits for the company since March 2011. He said that Mr DiIorio had
received 2 one-week training courses as part of his preparation and
had also gone on audits with other auditors. Asked how Mr DiIorio
could have given high marks to a facility that the FDA described as a
breeding ground for _Listeria_, Mr Stovicek said, "There's lots of
variations as to how people interpret unsanitary conditions." Mr
DiIorio did not return phone calls seeking comment.

Trevor V Suslow, a professor of food safety at the University of
California, Davis, said auditors may give farmers, processors, and
retailers a false sense of security. "There needs to be training,
certification, and auditing of the auditors," he said.

[An FDA draft guidance to minimize microbial hazards of melons (July
2009) spelled out ways cantaloupes can become contaminated
(http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/ProduceandPlanProducts/ucm174171.htm).
In this document, more foodborne illness outbreaks were noted to be
associated with melons that have netted rinds perhaps because human
pathogens may adhere to, survive on, and be more difficult to
eliminate from netted melon rind surfaces. Specifically, cantaloupe
was noted to be involved in 10 of the 13 outbreaks associated with
melon consumption and all of the melon-associated outbreaks were due
to bacterial agents, such as _Salmonella_ species.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is frequently found in soil or manure.
Cantaloupe grow on a vine on the ground and the rind can become
contaminated with these enteric pathogens by contact with contaminated
soil or fertilizer, but tests of the soil on the farm involved in the
current outbreak did not turn up the bacteria. Instead this pathogen
was found on a conveyor belt for carrying cantaloupes, a melon drying
area, and a floor drain, among other places. The news release above
did not comment on the possibility of contaminated water used to wash
the cantaloupe or equipment. _L. monocytogenes_ can be commonly found
in a wide range of surface waters, including lakes, ponds, and
streams, contaminated possibly by discharge of sewage or runoff from
farms
(http://books.google.com/books?id=NZsS6tbSAFYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq).
Instead, a dump truck parked near the processing shed used to take
culled melons to a cattle farm was implicated.
