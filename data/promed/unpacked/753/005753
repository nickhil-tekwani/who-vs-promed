Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): Measles outbreaks -- Final report
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Measles DR Congo: MSF says 183 837 cases causing 3667 deaths

A. Situation analysis
Description of the disaster
The DRC's Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak in the country on 10 Jun 2019, presenting it as the deadliest outbreak in the country since the 2010-2011 outbreak which caused at least 210 deaths according to Médecins Sans Frontières. The epidemic spread rapidly to all 26 provinces of the country, exposing an unprecedented 9 110 984 people, affecting 183 837 people, and killing about 3667.

While the country could organize the anti-measles campaign planned in December 2019, the subsequent campaigns scheduled for 2020 have been halted by the onset of COVID-19 as most humanitarian partners and Government (Ministry of Health) were busy responding to the new outbreak.

Overview of Host National Society
DRC Red Cross mobilized 2053 volunteers who reached 1 095 000 people (parents and guardians of children aged 0-59 months) before, during and after the November--December 2019 anti-measles campaign with messages encouraging them to get their children, aged 0--59 months, vaccinated against measles. During the door-to-door sensitization, the volunteers visited 219 000 households and identified 266 802 children aged 0-59 months to be vaccinated and referred them to immunization sites. The children identified by the Red Cross included 143 152 boys and 123 650 girls.

Out of the 266 802 children identified by the Red Cross, 169 530 (92 197 boys and 77 333 girls) were vaccinated. Statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate that a total of 6 760 603 children aged 0-59 months were vaccinated during the November-December 2019 anti-measles campaign. This number includes the 169 530 children that were recovered and brought to vaccination sites thanks to Red Cross volunteers.

During their social mobilization activities, Red Cross volunteers encountered 13 662 resistant parents who did not want to get their children vaccinated for several reasons, including religious, political, or scientific reasons. Out of the 13 662 cases of resistance registered, Red Cross volunteers convinced 4987 cases who understood and got their children vaccinated.

Red Cross volunteers also registered 24 851 zero-dose children (who had never been vaccinated against measles before), and those are included in the total number of children who were vaccinated during the November-December 2019 anti-measles campaign in the 42 health zones targeted by the Red Cross and the Ministry of Health.

The National Society seized the opportunity of that campaign to capture information on all the vaccine-preventable diseases affecting the populations in the health zones targeted. They identified 1,055 cases of measles, and 42 cases of acute respiratory infection, and that information was submitted to the Ministry of Health for consideration.

Overview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country
The American Red Cross established a bilateral agreement with the DRC RC to conduct social mobilization as part of the anti-measles campaign in Kinshasa. Through that support, DRC RC volunteers sensitized 1 422 432 people for the need of getting their children vaccinated and facilitated the vaccination of 1 666 966 children in Kinshasa as reported by the Expanded Immunization Programme (EIP) and 47 971 children recovered by the volunteers.

Overview of non-RCRC actors in country
The Ministry of Health declared the epidemic and called for international humanitarian support to respond to the outbreak. To that effect, the Ministry of Health set up an epidemic coordination commission that planned and conducted the November-December 2019 anti-measles campaign, which was supported by Ministry of Health (MoH), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The collective effort facilitated the vaccination of 6 760 603 children aged 0-59 months.

[The epidemic of measles in the DRC has been "aggravated by low vaccination coverage among vulnerable communities, malnutrition, weak public health systems, outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, difficult access by vulnerable populations to health care and insecurity that has hampered response in some areas.

Lack of funding remains a huge impediment to successfully curbing the measles outbreak in the DRC.

Under the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partner aid agencies vaccinated more than 18 million children under 5 across the country in 2019. However, in some areas, routine vaccination coverage remained low and 25% of the reported measles cases are in children over the age of 5.

The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Médecins du Monde, Médecins Sans Frontières, United Nations Children's Fund, WHO, and other partners have been supporting the Government to bring the long-running epidemic under control." (Excerpted from https://www.afro.who.int/news/deaths-democratic-republic-congo-measles-outbreak-top-6000)

All these organizations should be congratulated on their tremendous collaborative effort to vaccinate children against measles, and at the same time make an effort to address other vaccine-preventable diseases. While attention has been largely focused on COVID-19, measles continues to be a major public health problem, even with a very effective vaccine.
