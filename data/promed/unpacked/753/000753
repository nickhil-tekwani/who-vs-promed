Confirmed cases of measles in Pima County
-----------------------------------------
Concern over a measles outbreak continues today as the Pima County Health
Department confirms 9 active cases of the disease in our area. The Health
Department also considers it likely that transmission of the disease will
continue in the community as well as in hospitals and other health care
settings. This is why, if you think you have contracted measles, it is
recommened you consult your doctor before you visit your local health care
facility. Otherwise, you may risk spreading the disease.

Measles is a respiratory illness caused by the [Measles] virus. Symptoms
include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes for a few days followed by rash.
The Health Department says complications from measles can range from an ear
infection to encephalitis. One to 2 children in a thousand die from measles
infection.

Pregnant women who develop measles are more likely to miscarry, deliver
prematurely, or have a very low birth weight baby.

"Measles is extremely contagious, so the best way to prevent the disease is
to get vaccinated," Pima County chief medical officer Dr Michelle McDonald
said in a printed statement today. "Because of the greater vulnerability to
severe disease in infants and very young children," advises Dr McDonald,
"we are recommending an accelerated schedule for vaccinating children." The
Health Department recommends a dose of vaccine between the ages of 6 and 12
months of age, followed by 2 boosters after the patient's first birthday.

The Health Department also says that adults should insure their immunity if
they have significant contact with those most vulnerable to severe or
complicated measles infection. This would include adults who come into
contact with infants under the age of one (especially if under 6 months) or
individuals who are immunocompromised.

Again, if you believe you may have contracted measles, the Health
Department urges you to contact the health care facility or doctor's office
prior to arrival (especially if a few days of fever has been experienced
and a rash is now developing).

[This outbreak is linked to a previous case, which was traced to a tourist
from Switzerland who was at the Northwest emergency room on 12 and 13 Feb
2008. A 2nd case was a patient in the same emergency room who was later
diagnosed with measles, readmitted and treated in isolation between 24 and
26 Feb 2008. This reports indicates that another 7 cases have been
identified, which may have been contracted at health care facilities. The
rapid spread of this outbreak is indicative of the presence in the
population of individuals who have declined measles vaccination in the past
and may now be at risk of infection.
