The occurence of an outbreak of *scrub* typhus in Georgia doesn't
make sense.
Scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia_ (formerly _Rickettsia_)
tsutsugamushi_, wouldn't ordinarily be transmitted among human
populations (i.e., not contagious) since transmission depends upon
the bite of larval trombiculid mites. The description given is more
akin to that of epidemic typhus caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_,
that is louse-borne, occurs in conditions that favor louse
transmission (decreased hygienic practices, crowded conditions,
colder weather) and often is seen in outbreaks owing to the frequent
exchange of body lice from person to person.
The third form of typhus, murine or endemic typhus that is caused by
_Rickettsia typhi_, is flea-borne and generally occurs in warmer
months when fleas are active and is not associated with such
outbreaks, although clusters may occur.
As _R. prowazekii_ is still known to be a significant infection in
parts of the former Soviet states, this is much more likely, and much
more serious because of the epidemic potential, than either scrub or
murine typhus.
The major dermatologic manifestations include maculopapular to
petechial skin lesions that may coalesce to form purpura, but are not
of the greatest pathognomonic significance. The underlying
pathologic lesion, rickettsial vasculitis, occurs in all organs, and
particularly affects the brain (encephalitis and cerebral edema),
lungs (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema) and increases vascular
permeability leading to mutliple organ failure from hypotension and
organ ischemia. Occasionally, significant thromboses may also occur.
The case fatality rate is quoted as ranging from 30 to 70%, but the
infection is easily treated in many cases with a single oral dose of
doxycycline. De-lousing of clothes, bedding, etc., should be
undertaken to further control spread.
