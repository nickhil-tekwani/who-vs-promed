Whether it's because summers are getting longer or we're spending more time outdoors in nature, or simply because we're testing more, it seems that the number of Lyme disease cases has been on the rise in the past decade. According to a new study, 14% of the world's population currently has or has had tickborne Lyme disease.

Ticks are parasites that feed off the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes even reptiles or amphibians. They can also carry a lot of diseases. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bb) infection, more commonly known as Lyme disease, is the commonest type of tickborne infection.

Diagnosing the disease can be very difficult. The commonest sign of infection is a red rash that appears around the site of the tick bite about a week later. The bite and the rash are typically neither itchy nor painful, which makes it more difficult to diagnose -- but the consequences can be severe. Early symptoms can include fever and headaches, and if untreated, Lyme disease can cause damage to facial nerves, paralysis, arthritis, heart, palpitations, joint pains, and several other serious problems (including impaired memory). Even if treated, Lyme disease causes joint pains, memory problems, and tiredness in about 10-20% of cases.

A team of researchers at Kunming Medical University in China looked at over 4000 studies, selecting 137 of them and ultimately pooling data from 89 studies with almost 160 000 participants. The results suggest a global prevalence of Lyme disease of 14.5% -- in other words, 1 in 7 people in the world either have the disease or have had it.

The highest prevalence was in central and western Europe (21% and 13.5%, respectively) and in Eastern Asia (16%). In Southern Asia and the Caribbean, the prevalence was 2-3%. In North America, the rate was about 9%. The people most likely to get Lyme disease were over 50, males, and often lived in rural areas.

The results also suggest that the prevalence of Lyme disease in the 2011-2020 decade was higher than in 2001-2010, which could be linked to climate change, which could expand the preferred habitat of ticks (more research is required to see exactly why this is happening). Lower rainfall, animal migration, fragmentation of habitats, and more time spent outdoor could also be factors at play.

The researchers call for more long-term studies to assess how big an impact the disease is having. A more accurate picture of the global distribution could "inform the development of public health response policies and [Lyme disease] control programmes", they suggest.

Lyme disease is older than the human race and has been around for at least 15 million years. Ticks and the bacteria they carry are very opportunistic, and in many parts of the world (such as Europe or North America) they're a more important vector of disease than mosquitoes. In the US, some 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported every year, but the real number is actually much higher.

A vaccine was approved for use for Lyme disease in 1998, but it was discontinued in 2002 due to "insufficient consumer demand", according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/vaccine.html]. Several treatments are also currently being researched [https://www.zmescience.com/science/lyme-disease-new-treatment-options-151423/ and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59600-4].

The study has been published in BMJ [Global Health] see below].

Abstract
-----------
"Introduction
_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bb) infection, the most frequent tick-transmitted disease, is distributed worldwide. This study aimed to describe the global seroprevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of Bb in human populations.

"Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and other sources for relevant studies of all study designs through 30 Dec 2021 with the following keywords: '_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato' AND 'infection rate'; and observational studies were included if the results of human Bb antibody seroprevalence surveys were reported, the laboratory serological detection method reported and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We screened titles/abstracts and full texts of papers and appraised the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration-endorsed Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Data were synthesised narratively, and stratified by different types of outcomes. We also conducted random effects meta-analysis where we had a minimum of two studies with 95% CIs reported. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021261362).

"Results
Of 4196 studies, 137 were eligible for full-text screening, and 89 (158 287 individuals) were included in meta-analyses. The reported estimated global Bb seroprevalence was 14.5% (95% CI 12.8% to 16.3%), and the top three regions of Bb seroprevalence were Central Europe (20.7%, 95% CI 13.8% to 28.6%), Eastern Asia (15.9%, 95% CI 6.6% to 28.3%) and Western Europe (13.5%, 95% CI 9.5% to 18.0%). Meta-regression analysis showed that after eliminating confounding risk factors, the methods lacked western blotting (WB) confirmation and increased the risk of false-positive Bb antibody detection compared with the methods using WB confirmation (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2). Other factors associated with Bb seropositivity include age â‰¥50 years (12.6%, 95% CI 8.0% to 18.1%), men (7.8%, 95% CI 4.6% to 11.9%), residence of rural area (8.4%, 95% CI 5.0% to 12.6%) and suffering tick bites (18.8%, 95% CI 10.1% to 29.4%).

"Conclusion
The reported estimated global Bb seropositivity is relatively high, with the top three regions as Central Europe, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. Using the WB to confirm Bb serological results could significantly improve the accuracy. More studies are needed to improve the accuracy of global Lyme borreliosis burden estimates."

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease or LD) is the commonest human tickborne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. An estimated 300 000 cases occur each year in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html) and 85 000 cases in Europe (http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/96819/E89522.pdf). The patterns of disease differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are commoner in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States. The borrelial genospecies, the species of tick, the reservoir host species, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks also all vary by geographical location.

Of the more than 20 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) complex genospecies, only a few (for example, _B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are human pathogens: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (Bbss) is the predominant cause of LD in North America; Bbss also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.

The vectors of Bbsl, which feed on both humans and reservoir species are 4 species of hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks: _I. scapularis_ is the main vector of Bbsl for humans in the eastern half of the US; _I. pacificus_, in the far-western US; _I. ricinus_, in Europe; and _I. persulcatus_, in Asia. The prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries was found to be 13.7% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/). Regions with the highest infection rates were located in central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, southern Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Slovenia); in Switzerland, 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region, of positive ticks, 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_, 44% with _B. garinii_, and 25% with Bbss. The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was higher than in nymphs (10.1%). No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/).

Various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. Migration of birds, which serve as hosts for the infected ticks, may be the cause of the expanding distribution of Bbsl.

Individual hard-bodied ixodes ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of Bbsl complex, as well as multiple other pathogens, including _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, and tickborne encephalitis virus or TBEV, the cause of tickborne encephalitis (TBE). It is, therefore, possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tickborne pathogens may occur.

Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. - Mod.ML]
