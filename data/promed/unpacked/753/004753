With a lack of safe drinking water after the [25 Apr 2015] earthquake, people in Khokana village, on the southern outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley, have begun suffering from diarrhea.

Although the villagers initially got treatment at local health posts, the number of sufferers has increased, so they were referred to a better hospital and to the health camps run by the Nepal Army, said a local social worker, Nepal Dangol.

Similarly, Shivaram Baniya from Adarshashaul Higher Secondary School said that more than 100 diarrhea patients have been provided treatment at health camps run by a joint team of the Nepal Army and the Bangladesh Army.

Clean water, overcrowding, and the risk of disease tops the list of concerns aid workers have for helping the estimated 5 million people affected by Saturday's [25 Apr 2015] earthquake that rocked Nepal. The 7.8-magnitude quake has killed at least 4000 people as of Monday, 27 Apr 2015, a number that is expected to rise as relief organizations are finding it a challenge to reach the epicenter of the temblor.

"Sanitation is a huge issue. That is the key to keeping people healthy," said Jana Sweeny, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross. Nepal had very limited health facilities before the quake struck, so organizations are trying to build additional field hospitals and deploy doctors and nurses to the area.

Of Nepal's 75 districts, 35 have been affected by the earthquake, including 5 that have been "affected severely," according to Unicef spokesman Chris Tidey. "This is a fairly complex situation," he said. "Right now we're looking at anywhere from one million to 1.5 million people sleeping outdoors, either because their homes are destroyed or they're fearful of aftershocks."

Matt Stephens, an aid worker on the ground in Nepal for World Vision, a charity based in Washington State, said the cramped quarters have relief organizations concerned about parasitic diseases. "When you have people in temporary settlements and overcrowding, obviously, there's going to be a hygiene issue," he said. "Our watch is going to be very critical in terms of getting water set up."

Unicef's top priority is getting access to safe water, which had been an issue in Nepal even before the earthquake. The UN agency is giving people oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements to protect against diarrhea as well as issuing therapeutic feeding, a high-protein paste comparable to peanut butter, to ensure that kids are getting proper nutrition. The organization is also planning to set up temporary classrooms so education isn't disturbed.

[The Patan district is one of the 75 districts of Nepal divided into 5 different regions, Eastern, Central, Western, Midwestern and Far Western. It as well as Kathmandu are in the Central Region, which is adjacent to the Gorkha District of the Western Region, where the epicenter of the earthquake was. As shown in the "see alsos" from 2014, there was significant cholera activity in the Central Region especially. Given a sanitary infrastructure that would facilitate cholera transmission prior to the tragedy, the dramatic effects of the disaster on the availability of clean, safe water should produce a significant increase in diarrheal diseases, including cholera.
