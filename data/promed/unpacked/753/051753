At least 4 suspected cases of Ebola were being monitored in Uganda's capital Kampala on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], after the capital's 1st death on Friday [7 Oct 2022], The Telegraph understands.

The Ministry of Health has confirmed 54 cases in total across the country, and more than 1000 close contacts are now being monitored across 5 districts.

The Kampala death was the 19th fatality from the country's outbreak -- though a further 20 deaths have been classed as "probable" Ebola cases.

Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the health minister, said that after developing symptoms, the Kampala victim ran away from his home village and visited a traditional healer in a second region before travelling to Kampala.

Health officials now fear that the virus could spread within the capital, which has direct flights to Europe and the United States as well as other destinations.

At a briefing on Wed night, which was broadcast on all TV and radio stations in Uganda, president Yoweri Museveni described Kampala as facing a "moderate" risk from the virus.

Speaking about how the Kampala case travelled despite being at risk of carrying the virus, he said: "He was poisoning all of these people he was approaching."

UK sources told The Telegraph a further 4 suspected cases had been identified in Kampala. However, the president appeared to rule this out during his television appearance.

"I would like to inform that there is no confirmed case of Ebola in Kampala city. The contacts of the person that died at Kiruddu Hospital are all known and under control," he said.

Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate, often over 50 per cent. The strain spreading in Uganda is the Ebola-Sudanese variant, which has no known vaccine.

Symptoms take between 2 and 21 days to develop after contact, and people are not contagious until symptoms appear.

The 1st symptoms, known as "dry symptoms", are difficult to distinguish from other illnesses and include fever, headache and muscle pains. These later progress to the "wet" stage, which includes vomiting, diarrhoea, hiccuping, and bleeding.

The world has battled sporadic Ebola outbreaks since 1976, the most deadly of which killed more than 11 000 people across Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia between 2014-16.

Dr Benjamin Black, an Ebola expert who worked during the West Africa outbreak, said the news that a carrier of Ebola made it to Kampala is "very significant".

"[The Kampala case] strikes me as similar to stories we heard in the West Africa outbreak connected with onward transmission," Dr Black said. "The man travelled through at least two other districts before Kampala, and visited a traditional healer once he was unwell. We don't know how many other people the healer then treated."

"This was a major issue in the West Africa outbreak. Traditional healers were linked with hundreds of infections," he said.

Ebola is less contagious than COVID-19, spreading through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person or animal. Bats and other wild animals are the suspected reservoirs of the virus.

Dr Black added that it is "entirely possible" that the Kampala case will be contained, as various actors -- including the World Health Organization and NGOs like the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières -- are involved in the response.

However, international concern is rising. Last week the US announced that all arrivals from Uganda would be directed to 5 sites for screening. Passengers will have their temperatures and "virus symptoms" checked, and be asked for contact details.

Following the US announcement, the UK Government on Thursday [6 Oct 2022] told doctors to be on high alert for symptoms and stock up on personal protective equipment.

The UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency] said yesterday [11 Oct 2022] that the risk to the public in the UK remains low.

"UKHSA constantly monitors emerging infection threats in collaboration with partners across the world," said Dr Meera Chand, UKHSA director of clinical and emerging infection. "We are aware of an outbreak of Ebola cases in Uganda and are monitoring the situation closely. The risk to the public in the UK is very low."

The Telegraph understands that UKHSA is deploying a team to Uganda and will re-run its "risk-assessment" of the threat posed to the UK following the death in Kampala. UK "airport restrictions" are said not to be on the cards but more detailed follow-up of people arriving in the UK from Uganda could be.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] has called for travellers to be screened before exiting Uganda. "Both experience and evidence show that exit screening can be an effective measure to support the containment of the disease spread," the ECDC said.

Cases were first detected in September [2022] in Mubende district of Uganda, 50 miles [80 km] west of the capital, among people living around a goldmine. A 24-year-old-man was the 1st known Ebola death, and 6 members of his family also died. 4 health workers have also been among the victims, including a doctor from Tanzania.

Gold traders are highly mobile, particularly along the busy highway that runs between Kampala, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west.

The current Ebola outbreak is the 7th in the east African country since the deadliest in 2000, which killed 224 of 425 people infected.

The Ugandan authorities are urging people to avoid large gatherings, crowded places like markets, parties, weddings, and funerals. As worry spreads, some schools are seeing just half their pupils attend classes, according to the British Medical Journal.

An Ebola task force, formed in 2000, has been reactivated, and the unit includes doctors and nurses from various institutions, including the military.

In previous outbreaks, the virus has spread quickly after those infected refused to go to healthcare facilities, instead preferring for their families to care from them at home, said Dr Andre Willemse, the regional medical director of International SOS, who was also involved in efforts to curb previous Ebola outbreaks.

The Ugandan health secretary, Jane Aceng, has said that local people initially thought the new Ebola outbreak was caused by witchcraft, and so didn't seek medical care.

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] that clinical trials would start within weeks on vaccines to combat the strain of Ebola behind the Ugandan outbreak.

[2] Uganda: vaccine trial

Uganda and the World Health Organization are planning to try out 2 vaccines for the Ebola Sudan virus to try and curb the spread of the rare strain. The virus has so far killed 19 people and infected at least 54 people in 5 districts in Uganda. After meetings in Kampala, the WHO's director general described the new outbreak as troubling.

Uganda hosted ministers from 11 countries in an emergency one-day meeting Wed to align their preparation for and response to Ebola outbreaks and agree on a strategy for collaboration.

Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda's health minister, said the department is expecting 2 different types of vaccines for the Sudan virus of Ebola currently circulating in Uganda.

Both vaccines, according to the WHO, are pending regulatory and ethics approvals from the Ugandan government. Aceng says the vaccines, which are expected to arrive in the country next week, are in clinical trials.

"One, Oxford. Manufactured in the United Kingdom. And the other Sabin. Manufactured in the United States of America. We are getting small doses, but the manufacturers are quickly manufacturing more."

Uganda reported the Ebola outbreak on 20 Sep 2022. The epicenter is the Mubende district, west of Kampala, with one death reported in Kampala itself.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that although the outbreak is troubling, it is not unexpected. Tedros says the primary focus now is to rapidly contain the outbreak to protect neighboring districts, as well as neighboring countries.

The WHO urged Uganda's neighbors to increase their readiness to respond rapidly and efficiently, if needed.

Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, the acting director-general for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says African countries need to change the way they do things in times of outbreaks.

He said this includes strengthening institutions dedicated to health emergencies, strengthening the health work force, local manufacturing and having action-oriented and respectful partnerships.

The WHO has released USD 2 million from its contingency fund to support Uganda's Health Ministry and an additional USD 3 million to support readiness in neighboring countries.

Ogwell says such funds need to be prioritized.

"It is not true that we don't have money," said Ogwell. "And it is not true that African countries are broke. It's an issue of prioritization of the resources that you have. And then, when partners bring their support, what is it supporting? Is it supporting our priorities or is it supporting the priority of the partner? Then, rationalization of our budgets at national level will create a situation where the funds for public sector are going into our priorities."

The Sudan Ebola virus was first reported in southern Sudan in 1976. Several outbreaks have been reported since then in both Uganda and Sudan. The deadliest outbreak in Uganda was in 2000 and killed more than 200 people.

[3] Kenya: borders open

Kenya will not shut down its borders with Uganda or impose stringent travel restrictions following the outbreak of Ebola disease in the East African nation declared last month [September 2022]. Health director-general Patrick Amoth said the border between the nations would remain open. However, Kenya will enhance screening at the points of entry to contain the spread of deadly diseases in the country.

The health authorities in Uganda on 20 Sep 2022 declared an outbreak of Ebola after it confirmed a case of the Sudan ebolavirus in the Mubende district in the central part of the country. "Following the Ebola outbreak in Uganda, we are putting in place measures to ensure public health security of the Kenyan people, including heightened surveillance at the points of entry," said Dr Amoth Thu. "We don't intend to put any restrictions in place because they are not going to work. "This is in line with other countries, including the US, which have enhanced screening following the outbreak of the viral disease."

Travellers who have been to Uganda within 21 days of arriving in the US are subject to enhanced screening, according to a health alert the US Embassy in Uganda issued last week [week of 3 Oct 2022]. The screening applies to any passenger who was in Uganda including US citizens. It involves a temperature and symptom check conducted by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention. The CDC will also collect contact information to be shared with local health departments at the travellers' destination. Uganda has seen soaring infection rates and a rapidly rising death toll since the highly contagious Ebola virus broke out late last month. On Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], Uganda recorded 54 cases of the Ebola virus and 19 deaths. Uganda is one of Kenya's main trading partners and in 2021 accounted for 80 067 arrivals through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

Keeping borders open with enhanced screening is the best approach, as it is the least disruptive to life and business. Educational materials could be distributed to individuals crossing the borders at the time of screening reminding them of the proper procedure should they become ill. - Mod.LK]
