A 76-year-old man was recovering at home after a five-day hospital stint as
the state's second case of St. Louis encephalitis, the state Department of
Health said. The resident of Grove City often fished in the evening and
did not use insect repellent, said Dr. John Piacitelli, director of
Charlotte County Health Department.
The state health department's encephalitis advisory was issued across seven
counties earlier this month and remained in effect. Health officials urged
residents in southwest Florida to take precautions against St. Louis
encephalitis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, after tests confirmed a
34-year-old man from Venice had contracted the disease.
The patient had been battling what he thought was the flu. After days of
high fever, chills, disorientation and extreme weakness, he went to
Sarasota Memorial Hospital for tests, where the [diagnosis was made.
Six sentinel chickens in Fort Myers and three in Cape Coral tested positive
for the disease [sic, about the same time the Venice man's condition was
reported.
In 1997, health officials declared a 10-week medical alert in 27 Florida
counties over mosquitoes carrying encephalitis. There were nine confirmed
human cases of the virus - including a Hillsborough County man who died.

[Chickens do not "test positive for the disease", although they may have
antibody to St. Louis encephalitis virus, which is indicative of infection
with that virus and perhaps an indicator of amplification of the virus.
Chickens are used as sentinels for this purpose in many places n the U.S. -
