The Illinois Poison Center has reported 9 cases of severe coagulopathy associated with smoking synthetic cannabinoids to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) since [Sat 10 Mar 2018]. All 9 cases reported using synthetic cannabinoids, (e.g., K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, fake weed/legal weed, genie, etc.); however, a common product used by the cases has not yet been identified.

The patients all live in the Chicago metro region, but reside in 3 different, distinct areas (southern suburbs, western suburbs, and city of Chicago, to date). IDPH is monitoring the entire state for additional cases.

The coagulopathy exhibited is vitamin K dependent and is consistent with a long acting, highly potent coumarin which can also be found rat poison. Presenting symptoms have included back pain, hematuria, epistaxis, bloody stools and bruising/ecchymosis in various combinations or in isolation. Isolated hematuria as the initial presenting complaint has been reported in at least one of the patients. Almost all patients have had a presenting INR (international normalized ratio) greater than 10.

Emergency Department physicians caring for patients with unusual, unexplained bleeding and coagulopathy should inquire about potential exposures to synthetic cannabinoids and rat poisons or rodenticides.

Emergency physicians and healthcare providers are asked to report all suspected cases to their local health department, the Illinois Department of Public Health at 217-782-2016 or the Illinois Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222.

[It should be remembered that while these are synthetic drugs there may be nothing pure about them. Being contaminated with an anticoagulant, such as coumarin or warfarin, or another anticoagulant rodenticide could be possible. There has been no press release on what the cause of the bleeding is. Surely physicians have done a screen to ascertain what substance is causing the bleeding. If not, I would think an identification of any anticoagulant in the patient would be in order. Fortunately, they do know it is Vitamin K dependent, meaning administration of Vitamin K will help with the normal clotting procedures.

A synthetic compound does not necessarily mean the compound has not been cut or contaminated with some other substance. Users should be aware of this fact and seek medical treatment for any unusual bleeding or bruising. - Mod.TG

Others have reported thromboembolic events (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595371) after repeated use of synthetic cannabinoids which further calls into question whether this is a contamination event, or a case of additional functional groups being added to the synthetic cannabinoid molecules giving the drugs new or different properties over what has been observed previously in users. - Mod.JH
