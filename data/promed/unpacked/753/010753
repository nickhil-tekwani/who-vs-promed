In the first 10 [sic months of this year, until 6 Oct 1999, there were 33
cases of hemorrhagic dengue in Honduras, resulting in 5 deaths, compared
with 7 deaths in the whole of 1998.
There were 12 457 cases of classic dengue in the same period of this
year, compared with 16 390 in 1998, according to health ministry figures.

[These figures, including the 5 deaths from DHF, were reported before the
recent heavy rains. The alert, therefore, has to do with the inevitability
of mosquito proliferation after the rains. The previous report, as posted,
seemed to imply that the alert was connected with the deaths. - DP
