[1] Vaccine effectiveness in children under 5
Date: Mon 13 Jun 2022

The Food and Drug Administration said on Sunday [12 Jun 2022] that 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine appeared to be effective in preventing COVID-19 illness in children under 5, judging by the level of virus-blocking antibodies the shots induced.

The agency's evaluation was posted online ahead of Wednesday's meeting of outside vaccine experts, summoned to recommend how the FDA should rule on applications from both Pfizer and Moderna on vaccinating the nation's youngest children.

Some public health experts are expecting the FDA to authorize both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines, offering parents a choice between the 2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must also weigh in with its recommendations after the FDA acts. Roughly 18 million children younger than 5 are the only Americans who are not yet eligible for shots.

In a staff analysis, the FDA said the data submitted by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, suggests that 3 doses are more effective than 2. But the agency said it was hard to draw definitive conclusions because there were so few cases of COVID-19 among the 1415 children who received 3 doses of the vaccine during the clinical trial. Pfizer has said only 8 children in the placebo group and 2 in the vaccinated group fell ill. The trial protocol said 21 cases were required to render a judgment on efficacy.

So far, the FDA appears to view both Pfizer's and Moderna's requests for pediatric vaccines favorably. Parents are so eager to have a coronavirus vaccine for their youngest children that some have said they would accept even low rates of effectiveness, as long as the vaccines were safe.

In its analysis of Pfizer's data, the agency said that rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 among children under 5 were higher than among those aged 5 to 17, "underscoring the benefit of an effective COVID-19 vaccine in this age group."

The agency also noted that among children 5 or older, who are already eligible for Pfizer's vaccine, the shots have helped prevent hospitalization and other serious outcomes, including during the current year, when the highly contagious Omicron variant and its rapidly evolving subvariants became the dominant forms of the virus.

"Given the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and likelihood of continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the ensuing months, deployment of the vaccine for use among children 6 months through 4 years of age will likely have a beneficial effect on COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in this age group," the FDA said. The agency identified minimal side effects.

On Friday [10 Jun 2021], the FDA said Moderna's coronavirus vaccine for children under 6 was also effective in preventing symptomatic infection without causing worrisome side effects. The 2 vaccines are based on the same type of technology, but the dosage and regimens differ. Moderna is proposing 2 doses at one-quarter the strength of adult doses. Pfizer is proposing 3 doses at one-tenth the strength of adult shots.

[According to Pfizer vaccine manufacturer, only paediatric doses of the vaccine should be given to children; an adult dose is not recommended for vaccinating children. The data on vaccine effectiveness in children particularly those under 5-years-old is scarce, and therefore, it would be pertinent to ensure that unvaccinated children do not continue the disease transmission. - Mod.UBA

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries: the USA (103 143), Germany (38 664), Taiwan (45 100), Brazil (40 173), Argentina (36 835), North Korea (32 810), the UK (28 231), Australia (26 156), Japan (23 332), and Italy (10 668), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1008 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 11 Jun 2022 to late 12 Jun 2022).

A total of 33 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 15 of the 33 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 28.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 23.5% increase in daily reported cases and 13.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.48 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 541.03 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.33 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
