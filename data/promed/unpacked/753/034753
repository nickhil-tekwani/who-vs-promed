A survey of wheat fields in southeast, south central, and southwest Nebraska showed severe levels of stripe rust. In some fields, 100 percent of foliage was yellow and covered with rust pustules, with only the stems and heads retaining green color. In some fields rust had advanced to the [late] stage where teleospores form.

Many of the fields with severe stripe rust were not sprayed with fungicide or were sprayed too late. Further west and north, stripe rust was not as severe as in the southeast or south central, but its development was picking up speed. Fields that were sprayed had little or no rust.

The overall estimated yield loss due to stripe rust will not be known until later in the growing season. However, in the severely affected fields surveyed, 40 to 50 percent yield loss is expected. In some fields severely diseased before the beginning of grain fill, higher losses are expected.

Weather conditions continue to favor stripe rust development and spread. It is too late to treat fields that are severely affected.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

In the report above, it is unclear why farmers neglected to apply preventative fungicide sprays in the areas surveyed. The current outbreak is, therefore, not surprising and cannot be attributed to a new fungal strain.
