Model Predicts Influenza Strain That Will Be Most Prevalent in Future
Flu Seasons
-----------------
An evolutionary model of the influenza virus predicts the strain that will
be most prevalent during future influenza seasons, CDC scientists report in
the 3 Dec 1999
issue of Science. They say that the finding may have implications for
constructing future vaccines.
Dr. Robin M. Bush of the University of California in Irvine, and colleagues
from there and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta,
Georgia, tested their model retrospectively. They used phylogenetic analysis
to determine whether or not influenza A strains that underwent the greatest
number of changes in codons in the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene in
past flu seasons were more closely related to future strains than strains
that had fewer changes. The investigators reviewed data on the 1986 through
1997 flu seasons. Their prediction model was successful for 9 of the 11
seasons.
Dr. Bush and co-authors conclude, "We have identified a small set of rapidly
evolving codons in the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene of human
influenza A subtype H3 in which replacement substitutions in the past appear
to have been selectively advantageous." They add that "[w]hether additional
changes in these codons will confer a selective advantage in the future
remains to be seen." The authors say that their model "...can be used to
examine the evolution of the hemagglutinins of influenza B and influenza A
H1 viruses circulating in humans to identify sets of positively selected
codons that may have predictive value for these important pathogens."
Asked whether the use of the prediction model will aid in the design of
vaccines, co-author Dr. Catherine A.Bender of the CDC told Reuters Health,
"Yes and no...We don't have any evidence that using this method will improve
vaccines." She added that antigenic data needed to construct vaccines are
not always available. However, she said, "We know which positions are
predictive... We can make an educated guess about which strains are most
likely to cause the next epidemic...and focus our efforts on those viruses."

[It has long been known that influenza A hemagglutinins evolve at selected
epitopes, including those arrayed around the viral attachment site.
Moreover, it is understood that influenza A viruses seem to evolve against
the selection pressures of population antibody elicited by circulating
strains in prior years. These data appear to carry the story a bit further.
Although it remains to be seen whether the model will have implications for
vaccine development, understanding the evolutionary behavior of the
influenza A viruses is among the most important current lines of prevention
research in
the influenza field. - Mod.DM]
