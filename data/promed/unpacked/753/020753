--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An unprecedented effort is under way to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines, with pharmaceutical companies, academic researchers, and government agencies aiming to compress into several months a process that typically requires at least several years. This work is supported by extraordinary public and private investments and by newly created entities such as Operation Warp Speed. Concurrent with clinical testing of vaccine candidates, new mechanisms are being established to expedite manufacturing ahead of a future vaccination campaign. Critical decisions will soon need to be made, including evaluations of data on vaccine safety and efficacy, which could lead to the approval of one or more products and the development of recommendations for deployment.

Although new entities and investments have aided the pursuit of COVID-19 vaccines thus far, regulatory and policymaking activities are well within the capabilities of the existing, well-established processes and personnel at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each of which is supported by long-standing committees of independent scientific advisors. Relying on these highly regarded, time-tested mechanisms for evaluating and regulating vaccines and for developing recommendations for their use would promote transparency, independence, and scientific integrity.

With phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates under way, safety and efficacy data will be presented to the FDA as early as this fall [2020]. Decisions regarding approvals and Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) will be made by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which in June 2020 released detailed guidance on COVID-19 vaccine development.(1) Since 1981, CBER's decision making has been supported by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), a panel of nongovernment scientists, physicians, and other experts that reviews evidence for vaccine candidates -- including their benefits and risks -- and makes recommendations regarding approval.

As is the case with all FDA advisory committees, the work of the VRBPAC expands the expertise that informs decision making and is thought to enhance the transparency and legitimacy of the FDA's decisions.(2) The VRBPAC meets openly, as required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which allows the public to view trial data, observe deliberations, and comment on products under consideration. Meetings may be scheduled far in advance, but even the required 15-day minimum-notice period can be waived in exceptional circumstances. Although the FDA isn't obligated to follow recommendations from the VRBPAC and other advisory committees, it usually does.

Concerns have been raised over the possibility of interference in the FDA's decision-making process for COVID-19 vaccines for the purpose of meeting politically advantageous timetables for vaccine introduction. More generally, the pace of vaccine development -- even the name "Operation Warp Speed" -- could be interpreted as suggesting that corners are being cut with regard to safety and efficacy. FDA officials have sought to dispel both concerns, stating that decisions will be made independently based solely on science and that there will be no compromises with respect to evidence standards required for approval or an EUA.(3)

These assurances of independence and rigor would be enhanced by steps reflecting these principles, including the participation of the VRBPAC in the review of COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA isn't legally required to convene the committee, but not to do so in this case would be a marked departure from normal practices. FDA leaders recently commented that transparent discussion about COVID-19 vaccines by the VRBPAC will be needed to ensure public understanding of evidence regarding safety and efficacy.(3)

On 6 Aug 2020, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) introduced legislation that would require the FDA, before licensing or authorizing any COVID-19 vaccine, to receive recommendations from the VRBPAC in public and to make all data provided to the committee publicly available. Separate, bipartisan legislation introduced on 4 Aug 2020 by Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) would require the VRBPAC to meet and provide recommendations before issuing an EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine. If either bill is passed, it would be a rare case of direct congressional intervention in the FDA review process for specific products. But such bills would merely affirm and codify the FDA's traditional process for including the VRBPAC in its work -- a process that FDA leaders have indicated that they anticipate following for COVID-19 vaccines. Such procedural safeguards would strengthen the FDA's independence if it were to face external pressure to deviate from its customary evidence-review practices in the months ahead.

Meanwhile, several groups are developing recommendations for vaccine deployment, particularly for the initial stages of a vaccination campaign, when supplies will be limited. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), another panel of federal advisors, has been the primary US body responsible for establishing guidelines for vaccine use since 1964. ACIP recommendations are widely considered the standard for expert advice regarding vaccination./4

The committee's work has long included the identification of priority groups for vaccine allocation when supplies are limited. Since April [2020], a COVID-19 workgroup composed of ACIP committee members, liaisons from medical professional organizations, CDC staff, and outside consultants has been discussing the development of prioritization guidance, prelicensure and postlicensure safety and effectiveness monitoring needs, and related issues. The workgroup meets weekly in private and presents its ongoing work at meetings of the full ACIP -- all of which are public, as dictated by FACA requirements -- for the committee's consideration. The ACIP typically meets three times per year but is meeting monthly during the pandemic.

It is unclear, however, whether the ACIP will play its traditional role by establishing guidelines for Covid-19 vaccine prioritization and deployment. In July, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) established a committee charged with creating a framework for the equitable allocation of Covid-19 vaccines that includes priority tiers. The stated directive for the group's work is to inform that of the ACIP, not replace it. How the two committees will interact, and the consequences if their prioritization schemes differ -- particularly for public understanding and support for government-led vaccination efforts -- remain unresolved. Unlike the ACIP, NASEM committees are largely exempt from FACA requirements./5 Although information-gathering meetings are generally open to the public and committee conclusions are publicly released, NASEM committee deliberations occur in private.

Moreover, the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, which will coordinate many of the logistic aspects of vaccine distribution, have yet to indicate publicly the degree to which they intend to defer to other groups regarding allocation decisions. Difficulties surrounding the distribution of other scarce medical resources during the pandemic -- including personal protective equipment and the antiviral medication remdesivir -- underscore the importance of establishing clear lines of organizational responsibility and evidence-based approaches to directing vaccines to the populations and locations where they can do the most good. The 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination program, a CDC-led effort that relied on existing vaccine-distribution infrastructure and the ACIP's prioritization guidance, offers a contrast to the more diffuse approach to planning regarding COVID-19 vaccine allocation and distribution.

Progress on COVID-19 vaccine development has been remarkable, but translating promising clinical trial results into successful vaccination programs will require overcoming a new set of challenges. Although the government's willingness to rapidly innovate has facilitated advances thus far, aspects of the regulation and policy work ahead wouldn't be as well served by deviating from well-established practices. The evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates and the development of recommendations are appropriate activities for the FDA's and CDC's traditional evidence-review processes.

Public confidence in vaccination is fragile. COVID-19 vaccination programs will succeed only if there is widespread belief that available vaccines are safe and effective and that policies for prioritizing their distribution are equitable and evidence-based. Trust in science and expertise are threatened, as the pandemic has shown with catastrophic results. Relying on nonpartisan government scientists, their expert advisors, and the transparent, science-based processes that have served US vaccination-related activities exceedingly well for generations would provide the best chance for COVID-19 vaccines to realize the high hopes for their role in addressing the current public health crisis.

It is unfortunate that all aspects of this pandemic have been complicated by politics. Science is by nature inherently political, but politics cannot over-rule data. From shutdowns to masks to antiviral compounds, there has been a tug of war between science and politics. Well established standard operating protocol should be followed before the coronavirus vaccine is released to the public. The Phase I, II, and III trial data must be transparent and interpretation science-based. If not, vaccine skepticism will only be inflamed, and the success of the vaccine in controlling transmission jeopardized. - Mod.LK]

COVID-19 "super-spreading" events play outsized role in overall disease transmission

Mathematical analysis suggests that preventing large gatherings could significantly reduce COVID-19 infection rates.

There have been many documented cases of COVID-19 "super-spreading" events, in which one person infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many other people. But how much of a role do these events play in the overall spread of the disease? A new study from MIT suggests that they have a much larger impact than expected.

The study of about 60 super-spreading events shows that events where one person infects more than 6 other people are much more common than would be expected if the range of transmission rates followed statistical distributions commonly used in epidemiology.

Based on their findings, the researchers also developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, which they used to show that limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer people could significantly reduce the number of super-spreading events and lower the overall number of infections.

"Super-spreading events are likely more important than most of us had initially realized. Even though they are extreme events, they are probable and thus are likely occurring at a higher frequency than we thought. If we can control the super-spreading events, we have a much greater chance of getting this pandemic under control," says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering and the senior author of the new study.

MIT postdoc Felix Wong is the lead author of the paper, which appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see reference below].

Extreme events
--------------
For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the "basic reproduction number" is around 3, meaning that on average, each person infected with the virus will spread it to about 3 other people. However, this number varies widely from person to person. Some individuals don't spread the disease to anyone else, while "super-spreaders" can infect dozens of people. Wong and Collins set out to analyze the statistics of these super-spreading events.

"We figured that an analysis that's rooted in looking at super-spreading events and how they happened in the past can inform how we should propose strategies of dealing with, and better controlling, the outbreak," Wong says.

The researchers defined super-spreaders as individuals who passed the virus to more than 6 other people. Using this definition, they identified 45 super-spreading events from the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 15 additional events from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, all documented in scientific journal articles. During most of these events, between 10 and 55 people were infected, but 2 of them, both from the 2003 outbreak, involved more than 100 people.

Given commonly used statistical distributions in which the typical patient infects 3 others, events in which the disease spreads to dozens of people would be considered very unlikely. For instance, a normal distribution would resemble a bell jar with a peak around 3, with a rapidly-tapering tail in both directions. In this scenario, the probability of an extreme event declines exponentially as the number of infections moves farther from the average of 3.

However, the MIT team found that this was not the case for coronavirus super-spreading events. To perform their analysis, the researchers used mathematical tools from the field of extreme value theory, which is used to quantify the risk of so-called "fat-tail" events. Extreme value theory is used to model situations in which extreme events form a large tail instead of a tapering tail. This theory is often applied in fields such as finance and insurance to model the risk of extreme events, and it is also used to model the frequency of catastrophic weather events such as tornadoes.

Using these mathematical tools, the researchers found that the distribution of coronavirus transmissions has a large tail, implying that even though super-spreading events are extreme, they are still likely to occur.

"This means that the probability of extreme events decays more slowly than one would have expected," Wong says. "These really large super-spreading events, with between 10 and 100 people infected, are much more common than we had anticipated."

Stopping the spread
-------------------
Many factors may contribute to making someone a super-spreader, including their viral load and other biological factors. The researchers did not address those in this study, but they did model the role of connectivity, defined as the number of people that an infected person comes into contact with.

To study the effects of connectivity, the researchers created and compared 2 mathematical network models of disease transmission. In each model, the average number of contacts per person was 10. However, they designed one model to have an exponentially declining distribution of contacts, while the other model had a fat tail in which some people had many contacts. In that model, many more people became infected through super-spreader events. Transmission stopped, however, when people with more than 10 contacts were taken out of the network and assumed to be unable to catch the virus.

The findings suggest that preventing super-spreading events could have a significant impact on the overall transmission of COVID-19, the researchers say.

"It gives us a handle as to how we could control the ongoing pandemic, which is by identifying strategies that target super-spreaders," Wong says. "One way to do that would be to, for instance, prevent anyone from interacting with over 10 people at a large gathering."

The researchers now hope to study how biological factors might also contribute to super-spreading.

"Abstract
---------
"Superspreaders, infected individuals who result in an outsized number of secondary cases, are believed to underlie a significant fraction of total SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we combine empirical observations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and extreme value statistics to show that the distribution of secondary cases is consistent with being fat-tailed, implying that large superspreading events are extremal, yet probable, occurrences. We integrate these results with interaction-based network models of disease transmission and show that superspreading, when it is fat-tailed, leads to pronounced transmission by increasing dispersion. Our findings indicate that large superspreading events should be the targets of interventions that minimize tail exposure.

"Superspreading has been recognized as an important phenomenon arising from heterogeneity in individual disease transmission patterns (1). The role of superspreading as a significant source of disease transmission has been appreciated in outbreaks of measles, influenza, rubella, smallpox, Ebola, monkeypox, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 (1,2). A basic definition of an nth-percentile superspreading event (SSE) has been proposed to be any infected individual who infects more people than does the nth-percentile of other infected individuals (1). Hence, if the number of secondary cases is randomly distributed, then for large n, SSEs can be viewed as right-tail events. A natural language for understanding the tail events of random distributions is extreme value theory, which has been applied to contexts as diverse as insurance (3) and contagious diseases (4). Here, we apply extreme value theory to empirical data on superspreading in order to gain insight into this critical phenomenon impacting the current COVID-19 pandemic.

"Results and discussion
-----------------------
"We view the number of secondary cases resulting directly from an index case of a disease to be a random variable, Z. We also view the individual reproductive number, v, to be a random variable representing the expected number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual.

"Tails are exceptionally significant in extreme value theory, where they determine how rare extreme events are, how the central limit theorem is generalized, and what distribution the scaled maxima of samples follow. We were therefore interested to determine whether the empirically observed distribution of Z for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibited an exponential tail. We searched the scientific literature for global accounts of SSEs, in which single cases resulted in numbers of secondary cases greater than R0, estimated to be approximately 3 to 6 for both coronaviruses (1,7). To broadly sample the right tail, we focused on SSEs resulting in more than 6 secondary cases, and as data on SSEs are sparse, perhaps due in part to a lack of data sharing, we pooled data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, to avoid higher-order transmission obfuscating the cases generated directly by the index case, we ruled out SSEs where a single infected individual led to a cluster of subsequent infections, but the subsequent infections were not indicated to be secondary cases.

"Curating a total of 60 SSEs in this way, we found 45 SSEs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and 15 SSEs associated with SARS-CoV (Fig. 1 A and B). An additional 14 SSEs were documented in news sources and not scientific studies, and their inclusion does not significantly change the following results, which also hold when accounting for sources of bias (below). Details of the dataset are summarized in Dataset S1.

"Several striking observations emerge from the data. While the SSEs surveyed indicated secondary case numbers ranging from ∼6 in a family-spreading incident in Singapore to 187 in an apartment in Hong Kong, many SSEs exhibited significantly more secondary cases than R0 approximately 3 to 6, with the conditional sample mean being 19.7 cases (Fig. 1 A and B).

"We next examined the tail behavior of Z using inference tools from extreme value theory. We found that the tail of Z, as sampled by our list of SSEs, {Zi}, was inconsistent with exponential decay. Instead, we found that the tail of Z is consistent with fat-tail behavior using 3 complementary methods.

"Combining these results with modeling can be timely for informing interventions in the current pandemic. We anticipate future models to consider not only heterogeneity in network interactions, but also in infectivity and susceptibility (11)."

The full article is available at the source URL above.

A natural conclusion from the modeling results proposed is that if one limits the size of gatherings (suggested at less than 10), one could limit the ultimate size of the superspreading event. Superspreading events are more and more recognized as key in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Koen Swinkels has put together a database of over 1500 "superspreading events" related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While the spreadsheet does list events involving less than 6 people, the overwhelming majority of events are more than 6 people (https://kmswinkels.medium.com/covid-19-superspreading-events-database-4c0a7aa2342b). He is working with the COVID-19 Settings Project (https://covid19settings.blogspot.com/p/about.html). This project uses 4 key databases on superspreading events:

- Swinkels K: Larger database of superspreading events, overlapping with Leclerc et al but not focusing just on 1st generation events; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9jwMyT1lw2P0d6SDTno6nHLGMtpheO9xJyGHgdBoco/edit#gid=1812932356;

This includes the Leclerc database and an updated review ([11 Jun 2020]) of the scientific literature PubMed and Cochrane databases. https://superspreadingdatabase.github.io/Evidence_on_clusters_final.pdf.

One approach of tackling the transmission that has been recommended focuses on identifying the superspreading event through backwards tracing of newly confirmed cases to find the likely superspreading events and thereby doing forward tracing of others attending the superspreading event.

A current example of a probable major superspreading event in the USA is the ongoing major transmission in the Dakotas (North and South Dakota) and elsewhere in the region that most likely is related to a motorcycle rally with approximately 250 000 attendees (see COVID-19 update (444): early treatment, herd immunity, USA rally WHO, global 20201019.7872083, COVID-19 update (395): vaccine trial, bradykinins, motorcycle rally, WHO, global 20200909.7760209, and COVID-19 update (392): USA motorcycle rally, cardiac manifestations, WHO, global 20200907.7753457).

[The case numbers for COVID-19 in Africa continue to rise slowly and are now at 1 785 484, with over 42 800 deaths as of 2 Nov 2020.

The case numbers started falling in early September 2020 but are now rising again, even though this is not as much as in other continents. However, there is still cause for concern because the case counts in Africa may not be the true situation on the ground. Some countries have stopped reporting or stopped testing because of lack of resources. Some of the countries are not testing enough people because of the high cost of testing. In Africa over 80% of the COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, so health authorities have stopped contact tracing and mass testing. Only symptomatic cases and those wanting to travel out of their countries or arriving into the countries are tested. Few countries are, therefore, accounting for the weekly increase in case numbers and fatalities. - Mod.YA

- The African region reported 0.91% of daily case numbers and 3.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Uganda, Angola, Guinea, Mozambique, and Nigeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.94% of daily case numbers and 0.47% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.73 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and China.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (93 642), France (52 518), Spain (48 570), and India (37 592), have been dominant. A global total of 6047 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (1-2 Nov 2020). Countries not reporting any new cases include Sweden and Guatemala. The global total is now above 47 million cases.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, France, Spain, India, Italy (22 253), Switzerland (21 926), UK (18 950), Russia (18 257), Germany (16 240), Poland (15 578), and Belgium (11 789). A total of 47 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 47 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 5 are from the South East Asia region. Brazil reported 8501 cases, consistent with continued weekend reporting artifact. The high number of cases reported by Spain and Switzerland may be a function of cases occurring over the weekend when the countries did not report any new cases.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 12.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 12.4%. The USA (dominant in the Americas region) has increased daily reported cases by 19.5% and deaths by 2.2%. Iran (dominant in the Eastern Mediterranean region) has increased daily case reports by 34.1% and deaths by 19.9%.

Impression: Global daily reported cases continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. - Mod.MPP]
