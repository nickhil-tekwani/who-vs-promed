This disease is the most prevalent cause of community acquired pneumonia,
liver abscess, splenic abscess and sepsis in parts of Thailand. In Bangkok
teaching hospitals it is always considered in the differential diagnosis of
any obscure febrile illness. The organism is easy to culture and can be
suspected on a Gram stain (bipolar staining Gram negative bacillus). A
high level of awareness should allow early diagnosis and appropriate
treatment (high dose IV ceftazidime with cotrimoxazole, doxycycline or
amoxiclav - 2 drugs). Long term oral therapy (2-6 month) should follow
when patient is improved and afebrile as relapses are common and often
delayed. We recently had seen several expatriates, one a tunneling
engineer who got pulmonary melioidosis - acute form within the city ,
probably on his job site. Mortality should be low if diagnosis is
suspected and aggressive therapy instituted unless it is the overwhelming
septicemic form. Disease in Thailand is most common in farmers, diabetics
and people with renal disease. The 3 expatriates seen recently all were
normal hosts.

The following background information on melioidosis in Australia and
several surrounding countries were abstracted from the GIDEON software
program:
Australia:
- Melioidosis was first described in north Queensland sheep in 1949, with
the first human case reported in 1950.
- This is the most common cause of fatal bacteremic pneumonia in the upper
Northern Territory.
- The disease is most common in Far North Queensland and the Northern
Territory. Sporadic cases are also reported from Western Australia and
Torres Strait Islands.
- 33 cases (36% fatal) were reported from Northern Territory during
November 1990 to June 1991 (25 of these from Darwin); 28 (6 fatal) during
the wet season of 1993 to 1994; 21 (3 fatal) during the wet seasons of 1994
to 1995. Two fatal cases were reported from Southeast Queensland in 1996.

Malaysia:
The disease is most common in wet rice fields and newly-planted oil palm
areas, monsoon drains, gardens and playing fields. Highest prevalence
exists in both peninsular and East Malaysia. Six percent of diabetics are
seropositive, 29% of blood donors, 5% of febrile patients, 8% of pregnant
women 8% and 3% of farmers.

Myanmar:
The world's first case was described in Rangoon in 1912. Only 5 cases were
officially reported during 1917 to 1991.

Papua New Guinea:
Five cases (3 fatal) were reported from Port Moresby during 1964-1975. An
additional single case was reported in 1993. Ongoing disease has not been
demonstrated in the indigenous population through serological testing.

Singapore:
0.25 of the population are seropositive. 23 cases (4 fatal) were
registered among military personnel during 1987 to 1994.

Thailand:
Melioidosis is common, particularly among rice farmers and their families.
Highest rates are found in the northeast (Khonkaen and Ubon Ratchatani)
during the rainy season. The disease accounts for 20% of septicemia and 40%
of fatal septicemia in North East Thailand (regional rate
4.4/100,000/year). The organism is present in 68% of soil samples in the
northeast.

Vietnam:
Over 100 cases were reported among French troops during 1948-1954, and 343
(as of 1973) among American Troops during the Vietnam war. The disease is
probably prevalent, though rarely diagnosed among the indigenous
population. Seroprevalence rates in northern Vietnam range from 6.4% in
Chau khe, to 31.8% in Bac hong.
