Increased Incidence of Ross River Virus Infection Associated with Flooding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 140 Territorians have been struck down with the debilitating Ross
River virus after recent heavy rain and flooding. Health authorities have
warned [Ross River virus infection virus could spread as floods continue to
affect Territory communities.
The Centre for Disease Control released figures this week after the number
of people infected with the disease almost reached last year's total. Last
year 153 people contracted the Ross River virus, compared with 142 cases in
1999 and 121 people infected in 1998. So far this wet season 144 people have
been infected with the virus, which can cause chronic fatigue, extremely
painful joints and a rash. Of those cases 58 were reported in Darwin, 50 in
the Barkly region, 30 at Katherine, 3 at Alice Springs and 3 cases in East
Arnhem Land. Territory Health Services Senior Entomologist Peter Whelan said
that while the number of Ross River cases had fallen in Darwin, they had
increased across the Northern Territory. Mr Whelan said: "In the Tennant
Creek area there are high numbers of mosquitoes at the moment, and there is
a continuing risk of Ross River virus [infection." He said that he had
recommended that Alice Springs Town Council start mosquito control measures
as soon as possible. Mr Whelan said: "The potential for mosquito borne
diseases is very high with the high number of mosquitoes in the Ilparpa
swamp and Tennant Creek area." Mr Whelan said the control of saltmarsh
mosquito numbers in Darwin had contributed to the low number of Ross River
cases in Darwin.

[The recent extension of the range of the vector of Ross River virus, _Aedes
camptorhyncus_ (the saltmarsh mosquito), to New Zealand has raised
legitimate fears there of introduction of Ross River virus and spread of
epidemic polyarthritis to New Zealand. - Mod.CP
