New Hampshire: 2nd Case of Human Infection in State
--------------------------------------------------
The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services' Office of
Community and Public Health reports the 2nd positive case of West
Nile virus in a New Hampshire resident. The 18-year-old man is from
Hillsborough County. He traveled to Florida as well as within the
southern part of NH during the period when he would have contracted
the disease. He has been released from the hospital after a lengthy
stay and is continuing to recover.
"There is a possibility that this patient acquired West Nile virus in
Florida, but we will never know for sure," said Dr. Jose Montero,
Chief of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. "This case
reinforces the need for the public to be vigilant in prevention
measures until the end of the season in early November."
This is the 2nd case of West Nile virus in a New Hampshire resident
in 2003 and the 1st year the State has had human cases. A 37-year-old
Rockingham County woman also contracted the illness in August after
visiting Nebraska. She has since recovered. "Unfortunately, the
discovery of human cases in New Hampshire this year is not
unexpected," said Dr. Montero. "West Nile is now endemic in the
State. The majority of people who become very ill are elderly; the
fact that 2 relatively young people have gotten ill is an
illustration of the respect we need to show this virus and the
measures we must all take to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta now
considers West Nile virus to be a permanent part of the environment
in the United States. It first arrived in New York City in 1999 and
has steadily spread westward to 44 states and over 4000 human cases
nationwide this season. In New Hampshire there have been 209 positive
birds and 6 positive mosquito pools this season. The Department of
Health and Human Services is no longer collecting birds from
Rockingham, Hillsborough, or Strafford counties and the towns of
Concord, Keene, and Laconia in 2003, due to the large numbers of
positive birds already identified in these communities.

[This case is not included in the data published in the MMWR weekly
update reproduced below. It is not certain, however, that either of
the 2 human cases of West Nile virus infection in New Hampshire are
indigenous cases; both individuals had travelled beyond New Hampshire
and may have contracted infection elsewhere. - Mod.CP]

[In the USA the only states with no confirmed cases of autochthonous
West Nile virus infections remain Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and Oregon.
The epidemic may be beginning to decline. The weekly counts of new
human cases during the past 4 weeks have been 414, 1046, 1214, and
now 690. So far the 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado,
Nebraska, and South Dakota have accounted for 62.8 percent
(3029/4827) of the total number of confirmed human cases in 2003. -
