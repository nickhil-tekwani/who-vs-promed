More than 200 people have been infected by scrub typhus in villages
of Jogindernagar in Mandi district of Himachal with few of them in a
critical condition, said an official. According to Jogindernagar SMO
Dr Jitender Kaul, there may be many patients in the villages around
the town but only around 40 patients were getting treatment in the
hospital, while a few were admitted to primary health centers (PHC) in
villages.

"Some scrub typhus patients were reported from PHCs across the
villages while some critical cases were admitted to town hospital.
However, no casualty is reported so far but the disease can prove
fatal if not treated on time," he said. Usually the disease spreads
due to the negligence in cleanliness and improper handling of the
cattle. "Villagers usually enter into cowsheds barefooted which they
clean after several days."

[The following is excerpted from a US CDC report (Demma LJ, McQuiston
JH, Nicholson WL, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect
Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2006 Feb [date cited]. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no02/05-0967.htm>):

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia
tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval
mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both
the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_
(rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support
_O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are
thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent
hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub
typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific
islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and
eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and
Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its
severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a
person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be
complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented
recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory
confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21
days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite.
Fever, headache [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a
maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as
pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and
myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of
untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating
prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates
for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub
typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should
begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting
laboratory confirmation."

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission
in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O.
tsutsugamushi_
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm>). Humans become
infected when they accidentally encroach in a area where the
chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub
brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.

Joginder Nagar is a town in Mandi district in the northwest Indian
state of Himachal Pradesh, with a population of about 5000 in 2001.
The town is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides;
it has an average elevation of 1010 metres (3314 feet)
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogindernagar>). Himachal Pradesh is
bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir on the north,
Punjab on the west and south-west, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the
south, Uttarakhand on the south-east and by the Tibet Autonomous
Region on the east.
