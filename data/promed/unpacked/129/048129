Bubonic plague adds to woes
---------------------------
Lilongwe (UN Integrated Regional Information Networks/All Africa Global
Media): Malawi's existing health challenges of cholera, malnutrition,
malaria, and HIV/AIDS have been joined by another -- the bubonic plague.
Since April 2002, 71 cases of the disease carried by fleas and rodents have
been reported in the far south of the country, the World Health
Organization said on 30 May 2002. The first victim this year was a 9 year
old girl from Zavedo village. Outbreaks of bubonic plague have occurred in
Nsanje district at the southern tip of the country since 1994, with the
number of cases peaking at 304 in 1999. There were no reported cases for
the 2 years before April 2002.
The plague, which has a case fatality ratio of up to 60 per cent if left
untreated, has also been reported in Mozambique, leading to cross-border
collaboration between Mozambican and Malawian health teams. "WHO is
concerned due to the fact that the current epidemic is combined with
malnutrition because of the food shortage in the country. It is a
well-known fact that prevalence and severity of all infectious diseases
increase where malnutrition is rampant," a statement said.
A World Food Program (WFP) assessment released this week estimated that 3.2
million Malawians face food shortages due to anticipated food shortages
this year. The country is only just recovering from a cholera epidemic that
killed over 900 people. Malawi's overstretched health services now share
the added burden of acquiring adequate medical staff and finding chemicals
to spray against fleas and rodents. The UN children's agency, UNICEF, and
WHO response includes providing cash to districts to buy insecticides for
household spraying and sending a consultant to give front-line health
workers refresher training.

[The Nsanje district of Malawi has been the subject of ProMED-mail postings
in the past (see below). The role of population disruption due to war,
famine, floods and other calamities cannot be overemphasized in the
epidemiology of a variety of infectious diseases including plague. In such
situations involving plague, one must be concerned about the possibility of
pneumonic plague with the possibility of person to person spread and a very
high mortality even with treatment. The bubonic form of _Yersinia pestis_
infection itself is spread to man from infected rodent fleas and without
secondary pneumonia is not infectious to others. - Mod.LL]
