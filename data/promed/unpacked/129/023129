Bird flu, including the H5N1 strain dangerous to humans, has spread to new
villages in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, officials said on Wednesday.
Both Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour, and Bulgaria across the Black
Sea slapped bans on imports, adding to measures put in place by Russia and
Kazakhstan. But Prime Minister Yuri Yekhanurov said he hoped emergency
measures invoked to contain the outbreak in the peninsula jutting into the
Black Sea could be repealed by the New Year.
"The situation ... with bird flu in Crimea remains difficult. There are
more cases of infection of domestic birds," a Health Ministry statement
said. Instances of bird flu had now been detected in 25 villages in Crimea,
it said, with the H5N1 strain confirmed in 11. Nearly 54 000 birds had been
rounded up and destroyed in affected villages and 513 residents remained
under medical observation.
Ukraine has so far based its data on tests by Russian laboratories.
Officials say they are awaiting further confirmation of the presence of
H5N1 from a laboratory in Britain later in the week. Cases of H5N1 have
also been found in Romania and Russia.
Belarus's top veterinarian said his country's ban applied to all farm goods
from Crimea and 5 adjoining regions. "We are taking measures to keep bird
flu from spreading further," Mikhail Bushilo told Reuters in Minsk. The
disease, he said, could spread "to any food source you can think of".
Bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat, eggs and live birds
from throughout Ukraine. Russia and Kazakhstan imposed similar bans this
month.
The first discovery of bird flu late [in November 2005] prompted President
Viktor Yushchenko to invoke a state of emergency in several villages, with
the seizure and slaughter of birds and imposition of exclusion zones
patrolled by police. But villagers complained that birds had been falling
ill since September with officials taking no action. Ukraine's chief
veterinary officer was then dismissed.
About 22 million domestic birds live in Crimea -- of 190 million throughout
Ukraine. Poultry producers say the outbreak has had no effect on annual
consumption of one million tonnes. Yekhanurov, addressing a cabinet
meeting, said the measures undertaken in Crimea, a major stopping point for
migratory birds heading south for the winter, were containing the outbreak.
He proposed lifting the state of emergency, imposed for the first time
since Ukraine won independence in 1991. "I am asking that a legal analysis
of the state of emergency be carried out," he said. "I believe that a
quarantine will be quite sufficient. The government sees no problem in
lifting the state of emergency."
