From: Dr. Patricia (Trish) Somsel <SOMSELP@mercyhealth.com>

The role of Blastocystis in intestinal disease is far from clarified.
Surveys have shown the organism to be present in 1-20 % of fecal samples
but not always associated with symptoms. There may be variation in the
virulence of strains. The most common complaint associated with presence
of the organism is abdominal discomfort; diarrhea is not standard. Some
suggest presence of 5 or more organisms per high power field correlate with
symptomatic disease but this is not substantiated in more recent studies.
We suggest to clinicians that this agent may be of concern IF all other
agents of intestinal disease are eliminated as possibilities, including
bacterial, viral and parasitic.
