LATE BLIGHT, POTATO - RUSSIA: (SAKHALIN)

Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] warns of the threat of potato contamination with late blight in Sakhalin. The branch in [the] region notifies that in the southern part manifestations of potato late blight have been noted. The development of the disease is facilitated by the weather conditions prevailing in the region -- high humidity and sharp drops between day and night temperatures.

The specialists of the department recommend that the potato farms take protective measures for planting potatoes in accordance with the recommended schemes. Special attention should be paid where crop change has not been carried out for more than 2-3 years. It is necessary to use fungicides permitted for use in the Russian Federation.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Presence of both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen increases the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop. In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist and increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge mainly on potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), but recently also on tomato (ProMED-mail post 20180611.5850443).

A recent molecular survey of potato diseases in Russia (ProMED-mail post 20190606.6506616 & see link below) reported varying levels of _P. infestans_ (single infections or coinfections with other pathogens) from 10 western regions and Irkutsk (south-central), but did not include the far eastern region of Sakahlin.
