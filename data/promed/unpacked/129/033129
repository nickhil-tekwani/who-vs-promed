The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife [WDFW] considers the exotic strain of PRV [piscine orthoreovirus ] to be an unacceptable risk to native stocks of Pacific salmon. Under the conditions of its permit, Cooke Aquaculture Pacific was required to destroy the fish at its Rochester, Thurston county, hatchery facility.

For the 2nd time, Cooke Aquaculture Pacific has destroyed 800 000 juvenile Atlantic salmon after testing required by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) determined the fish were infected with an exotic strain of piscine orthoreovirus (PRV.) The strain is essentially the same strain of virus found at the Iceland hatchery from which Cooke receives Atlantic salmon eggs.

Cooke had a similar problem last May [2018]. Tests on the most current batch recently came back, said Amy Windrope, Region 4 director for WDFW. 2 of Cooke's last 3 batches of Atlantic salmon in the past year have tested positive for PRV, Windrope said. The 3rd was clean.

The fish were in quarantine prior to their destruction and the water they swam in at the hatchery was disinfected prior to discharge. "They are complying with the terms of the permit, and we are protecting Puget Sound from this exotic strain," Windrope said. Cooke declined to comment on the findings, Joel Richardson, vice president of public relations for Cooke Aquaculture wrote in an email to The Seattle Times.

The WDFW is processing a permit from Cooke to move about 500 000 rainbow-trout eggs to its Rochester hatchery by early January [2018]. The eggs would be supplied by Troutlodge, a vendor in Washington.

Ken Warheit, director of fish health for the state of Washington, said the state has not tested Cooke's adult Atlantic salmon in its pens for PRV because the state is updating its rules. Testing of adults may take place in the spring [2019], he said.

Atlantic-salmon farming was a little-noticed business in Washington until Cooke acquired its farms in the state and in August 2017 caused a spill of about 260 000 Atlantic salmon from its Cypress Island farm because of inadequate maintenance of its nets, 3 state agencies found after an intensive investigation of the spill. The spill and state findings led the Washington state legislature last session to enact a gradual phase-out of net-pen farming of exotic species in Washington waters by 2025, including Atlantic salmon.

[The 1st cases of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) were registered in 1999 in the Hitra/Fr√∏ya area of Norway. Since then, there have been an increasing number of outbreaks along the Norwegian coast, and HSMI was also reported in the United Kingdom and Chile (see archive no. 20111013.3068). Later on, the piscine reovirus (PRV) was established as the causative agent. In 2012, PRV was found in cutthroat trout caught in Cultus Lake, British Columbia (see archive no. 20120730.1221744), and then in several episodes from Alaska to Washington. More recently, the screening of 363 archived and 916 fresh-frozen salmonids tissues collected in British Columbia (Canada) and Alaska (USA) between 1974 and 2013 identified the presence of PRV in salmon originating from both of these areas with the earliest detection being from a sample of wild steelhead trout collected in 1977, so the circulation and translocation (via trade) of this virus in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have been occurring for a long time. - Mod.PMB
