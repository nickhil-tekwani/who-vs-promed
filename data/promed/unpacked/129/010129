Incidentally, 126 cases of the full-blown filariasis were recorded in the state [Maharashtra] last year [2016]. The rise in the full-blown filariasis cases is a serious concern. However, despite persuasion and monitoring, patients skip treatment and develop the full-blown disease."The state had recorded 2245 such cases throughout last year [2016]. In addition to these, another 132 people were diagnosed with chronic filarial swellings, the full-blown disease, causing disfigurement and disability among patients, the latest report of the state health department has revealed. This is an achievement," Diggikar said.

State entomologist Mahendra Jagtap said, "A patient found infected with microfilarie usually do not progress to full-blown stage if he/she completes 4 cycles of treatment in a year. The rise in the full-blown filariasis cases is a serious concern. "This rise only shows that patients found with early stage (minute larva) of the disease were not adequately treated," health activist Sanjeev Dabhade said." Lymphatic filariasis is a slow-progressing disease.

In Pune, the Centre's move to extend the deadline for eliminating lymphatic filariasis by 3 years to 2020 may do little for Maharashtra as the state continues to record extreme cases of the disease. In the last 10 months, as many as 1221 persons were found infected with microfilariae - the minute larva that enters a person's bloodstream and get passed on when a mosquito bites an infected person.

There are no outbreaks and people do not succumb to it; but it may cripple them for life. The state government needs to scale up their surveillance work to find and treat every patient so that no patient progresses to the full-blown stage," Dabhade added. Nevertheless, health officials seemed optimistic about achieving the disease elimination within the revised deadline.

[The most recent data on mass drug administration (MDA) to control and ultimately eradicate lymphatic filariasis in India show a coverage of 88 percent (http://nvbdcp.gov.in/mda.html). Co-administration of DEC with Albendazole during MDA is standard and the overall microphilaria rate decreased from 1.2 percent in 2004 to 0.3 percent in 2013 (Prov.) (http://nvbdcp.gov.in/mda.html).

The term "flull blown disease" used here is not well defined and the difference between the 126 cases with "full blown disease" and 132 with "chronic filarial swelling" is unclear. The key numbers are that 2245 were new diagnosed cases of lymphatic filariasis and that 132 cases had chronic filariasis with lymphedema. Maharashtra state has 114 million inhabitants (2012), which is 1 case per roughly 50 000 inhabitants, still below the overall figure of 0.3 percent positivity cited by the ministry of health (http://nvbdcp.gov.in/mda.html). - Mod.EP
