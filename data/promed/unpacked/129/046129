The World Health Organization (WHO) is to present Nigeria with a
certificate of guinea worm disease eradication next year [2011]. Chief
consultant epidemiologist in the Federal Ministry of Health, Henry Akpan,
disclosed this on Wednesday [10 Nov 2010] in Abuja while speaking on the
status of guinea worm disease eradication in Nigeria.

He stated that Nigeria had a lot to celebrate, as Wednesday [10 Nov 2010]
marked 2 years since the last case of guinea worm [infestation] was
reported in the country. Nigeria used to have the largest number of cases
globally, 653 620 cases in 5879 villages as of 1988, but with concerted
efforts in the implementation of intervention measures, a 99.99 per cent
case reduction was recorded at the end of 2006.

Only 16 cases were reported in 10 villages of 6 states. In 2008, the last
38 cases of guinea worm disease were reported in Nigeria in 5 villages in
Enugu and Ebonyi states.

"Guinea worm disease cases have dropped steadily, and the last case was
reported in Nigeria on 10 Nov 2008. Today [10 Nov 2010] marks 24
consecutive months that there has been no confirmed report of guinea worm
disease in Nigeria. The international community has acknowledged this
achievement. We think the Nigerian populace is entitled to be made aware of
this success story," he said.

Akpan, however, cautioned that in order to secure the certification by WHO,
there have to be 36 consecutive months of zero guinea worm disease cases
reported, in addition to meeting other criteria, which include nationwide
publicity and knowledge about guinea worm disease, cash rewards, adequate
safe water supplies in the villages at risk of the disease, and maintenance
of nationwide certification with regard to standard guinea worm disease
surveillance.

In his remarks, the chairman of the National Committee on Certification,
Olukayode Onyediran, said there was a need to work with the Federal
Ministry of Water Resources and other water generating agencies to provide
potable and safe water to sustain the gains made so far in guinea worm
eradication.
