Actually, in the lower 48 states, the majority of botulism cases are linked
to restaurants, caterers, or other larger-scale food producers. Home
canning has become a very rare cause. In Alaska, fermented fish causing
botulism remain a substantial problem.

[From a previous post: Type C or avian botulism is rarely a threat to
humans, who are more often affected by type A, B or E, sometimes found in
improperly canned food. - Mod.TG
However, I do not believe I said anything about home canning of foods,
although with the issue of the year 2000 possible problems there has been a
resurgence in home food canning. - Mod.TG
