[To summarize the events of the past few days, transmission of MERS-CoV continues in Riyadh (although we do not have dates of onset of the cases) in cases 5, 6, 7, and 9 -- although only case 5 gave a definite history of contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Among the cases was a healthcare worker for whom possible contact with other case(s) was still under review. This brings the total number of cases of MERS-CoV reported by Riyadh since 21 Jul 2015 to 159 of whom 28 were in healthcare workers.

There is also transmission ongoing outside of Riyadh, most notably with a probable new nosocomial outbreak in Madinah, with 4 cases reported in this period, of which 3 were in healthcare workers, and all 4 had a history of contact with other cases. Of concern is that the 1st case reported from Madinah in this present round had a date of report on 7 Sep 2015 -- an 80-year-old female with a positive history of contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness... but no mention of where the contact was. As Madinah is frequently visited by pilgrims, with the influx of large numbers of tourists during this period there is clearly cause for concern.

Of the 11 newly confirmed cases, 4 are in healthcare workers (1 from Riyadh and 3 from Madinah). Looking at healthcare workers, in the same period we're using for the outbreak in Riyadh (beginning on about 21 Jul 2015) there have been a total of 33 healthcare workers reported as newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection out of 183 cases (18.0 percent). Of these 33 healthcare workers with MERS-CoV infection, 4 (12.1 percent) did not have known contact with MERS-CoV-infected individuals and 4 (12.1 percent) had a possible history of contact with MERS-CoV infection prior to onset of illness; the remaining 25 (75.8 percent) did have contact with known cases. So the questions that arise include: Why are so many healthcare workers being infected? Is compliance with infection control measures suboptimal? Are the infection control measures themselves suboptimal for MERS-CoV? Are there more cases presenting to the healthcare sector that are being missed? Are there delays in implementation of infection control measures for febrile respiratory illnesses in general, e.g., waiting for confirmation of laboratory testing prior to implementing infection control measures?

It is important to mention that new locations with cases have cropped up in the past week or so. In the above report of 11 newly confirmed cases, 4 were from Riyadh, 4 were from Madinah, 1 from Alkharj, 1 from Qweiyah, 1 from Dawadmy (a map showing the locations of these cases can be found at the source URL). While we do not have histories of possible camel contact, this suggests that the previously observed fall seasonal increase in cases may be starting, or perhaps awareness on the part of the health sector has increased so that there is more testing for febrile respiratory illnesses.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 8 Sep 2015
--------------------------
Between 26 and 31 Aug 2015 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 22 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 deaths. Fifteen (15) of these reported cases are associated with a MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Riyadh city.

Details of the cases
1- A 57-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 26 Aug 2015 and was admitted to hospital on 30 Aug 2015. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 Aug 2015. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

2- A 58-year-old male from Riyadh city was admitted to hospital due to chronic conditions on 9 May. This hospital has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. On 26 Aug 2015, while hospitalized, the patient developed symptoms and, on 28 Aug 2015, tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative-pressure isolation room on a ward.
