--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- Hospital environments in Bangladesh are an important source of carbapenem-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ (CRPA).
- A significant proportion of CRPA isolates (56%) were phenotypically positive for metallo-Î²-lactamase (MBL).
- CRPA isolates were predominantly positive for blaNDM gene, followed by blaVIM and blaIMP.
- All CRPA isolates in the study were positive for virulence genes and biofilm-associated genes indicating their pathogenic potential.

Abstract
--------
Background
Increasing evidence of carbapenem-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ (CRPA) infection in healthcare facilities poses an alarming threat to public health. There is little evidence of the occurrence of this organism in Bangladeshi hospitals.

Methods
We collected 117 environmental swab samples from 2 tertiary care hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tested for _Pseudomonas_ species by non-selective enrichment of swabs followed by plating on Cetrimide-agar. We confirmed the isolates as _P. aeruginosa_ by API 20NE test and PCR for 16S rRNA gene. We analysed _P. aeruginosa_ isolates for susceptibility against 15 clinically important antibiotics and tested the carbapenem-resistant isolates for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). All CRPA isolates were characterized for carbapenem-resistant genes, virulence genes, and biofilm formation genes.

Results
Of 117 swab samples, 82 (70%) tested positive for _P. aeruginosa_. All _P. aeruginosa_ isolates were multi-drug resistant and 39% (n=32) of isolates were CRPA. Around 56% (n=18) of CRPA were MBL-producing. 22% (n=7) of isolates were positive for carbapenemase gene blaNDM, followed by 16% (n=5) for blaVIM, and 13% (n=4) for blaIMP. Sequencing identified these genes as blaNDM-1, blaIMP-13, blaVIM-2 variants. Based on OD values, 94% (n=30) of CRPA isolates were capable of producing biofilms. All CRPA isolates (n=32) were positive for at least one of six biofilm-associated genes and 4 of 12 virulence genes tested in the study.

Conclusions
Hospital environments in Bangladesh are contaminated with highly virulent CRPA which might be a potential source of hospital-acquired infections accentuating the need for strengthening hospital infection control programs.

[_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, a Gram-negative bacillary pathogen, is a frequent cause of healthcare-associated infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract, and bloodstream infections. In 2017, multidrug-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ caused an estimated 32 600 infections in hospitalized patients and 2700 estimated deaths in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-508.pdf).

Hospital outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ are often caused by multidrug resistant _P. aeruginosa_ clones that colonize the hospital environment and patients and routes of transmission may be patient-to-patient or hospital environment-to-patient, via contaminated hands of hospital staff or equipment (https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-016-0157-9, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19046054, https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.03071-12, https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.01772-06, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219028/).

To minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission from the environment, potential reservoirs should be identified. The research above studied environmental _P. aeruginosa_ contamination at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using surveillance culture data at a single point in time and tested the carbapenem-resistant isolates for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production.

As the authors of this study point out, there are several limitations of this study: they did not characterize the clonal relationship between isolates; they did not collect any information on the persistence of particular isolates of MDR-_P. aeruginosa_ in the hospital environment; nor did they obtain isolates from patients to understand the clinical significance of particular environmental strains and delineate possible transmission pathways. They also did not further investigate the mechanisms for carbapenem resistance other than MBL production.

Anti-pseudomonal carbapenem antibiotics (imipenem and meropenem) are "antibiotics of last resort" for the treatment of various life-threatening infections due to these multidrug-resistant pathogens. Ertapenem, unlike the other carbapenems, lacks activity against _P. aeruginosa_. Resistance to carbapenem in _P. aeruginosa_ is a major problem for patients with infections caused by this MDR pathogen. Carbapenem resistance can be due to multiple mechanisms that include increased expression of antibiotic efflux pumps, decreased outer membrane permeability due to reduced expression of transmembrane porin channels, and increased AmpC beta-lactamase activity, in addition to the acquisition of plasmid- or chromosomal-encoded carbapenemases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620637/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930500/).

KPC (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases), MBLs (metallo-beta-lactamases), and OXAs (oxacillinases) are carbapenemases, that is, enzymes that hydrolyze, thereby inactivating carbapenems. Ambler classification separates beta-lactamases (BLs) into 4 classes: classes A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B MBLs have one or 2 divalent zinc ions at the active site. ESBLs (extended spectrum BLs) and KPCs are Ambler class A BLs; NDMs (New Delhi MBLs), VIMs (Verona integron-encoded MBLs), and IMPs (imipenemases) are Class B MBLs; AmpC are class C BLs; and OXAs are class D BLs.

MBLs hydrolyze almost all beta-lactam antibiotics, except the aztreonam, the monobactam antibiotic, and cefiderocol, a siderophore-modified cephalosporin active against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

The older beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, block most Ambler class A BLs but not KPCs (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00031), nor do they block Ambler class C (AmpC), B (MBLs) or D (OXAs). Newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors include avibactam and relebactam, which have a diazabicyclooctane core, and vaborbactam, which has a boronic acid core. However, none of these newer beta-lactamase inhibitors block class B (MBLs). - Mod.ML
