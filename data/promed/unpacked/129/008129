Hepatitis A outbreaks in the EU/EEA mostly affecting MSM - 2016-2017
--------------------
Epidemiological summary
-----------------
Since the previous epidemiological update published on 29 Sep 2017, 22 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported 950 additional confirmed cases associated with this outbreak through sequencing analysis. Since June 2016 and as of 22 Dec 2017, 3813 cases have been linked to these specific outbreaks. The peak of the outbreak was in March 2017, when 507 confirmed cases linked to this outbreak were detected.

According to the ECDC epidemiological update published on 22 Dec 2017, since January 2017 and as of 22 Nov 2017, 15 040 hepatitis A notifications have been reported by 24 EU/EEA countries. This represents a 3.6-fold increase compared with the average 4226 cases reported for the same period between 2012 and 2015.

Information on gender is available for 15 022 cases: 11 790 were male and 3232 female. Compared with the average number of hepatitis A cases reported during the same period between 2012 and 2015, the number of male cases shows a 6-fold increase, and the number of female cases shows a 1.9-fold increase. The highest male-to-female ratio was 4.9:1, reported in March 2017. Since then, the number of male cases decreased progressively until November 2017, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.0:1. The highest number of notifications for a month (1745) was received in June 2017.

In addition to the number of cases reported above, Poland is seeing an increase in the number of cases. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 14 Nov 2017, Poland has reported a large increase in hepatitis A notifications, with 2206 cases reported from January to October 2017, compared with 26 cases in the same period in 2016. Slovakia reported 503 hepatitis A cases from January to October 2017, compared with 1157 cases in the same period in 2016, which represents a 2.3-fold decrease. However, no cases in Poland or Slovakia could be linked to the outbreak as sequencing information was not available.

Vaccination
--------
Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU remains limited, with some countries having reported shortages, including Austria, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. Since the last update, vaccine shortages have also been reported in the Czech Republic, France, and Norway; Germany reported minor shortages in Germany. The Netherlands and Sweden have reported no shortages. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment in June 2017, Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued new vaccination recommendations.

ECDC assessment
---
As of November 2017, the monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases remains higher than in previous years. The male-to-female ratio has decreased in the last months but still remains high. A considerable increase in the number of hepatitis A cases caused by the outbreak strain in women has also been observed. This indicates that the outbreak has spilled over to the non-MSM population.

Although decreasing in its intensity, the outbreak is still ongoing, and more cases associated with this event are to be expected in EU/EEA countries in the coming months.

The conclusions and options for response set out in ECDC's rapid risk assessment entitled "Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men - Third update, 28 June 2017," remain valid.

Actions
---
ECDC requested EU/EEA countries to report events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. ECDC monitors the hepatitis A outbreaks in Europe through EPIS-FWD and epidemic intelligence. ECDC published an updated rapid risk assessment on 28 Jun 2017 and several epidemiological updates on this outbreak on 29 Sep 2017 and 22 Dec 2017.

[Although this ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A has primarily involved men who have sex with men, it seems that there is increased spillover into women. Potential reasons for this include household transmission and spread via infected food handlers. - Mod.LL
