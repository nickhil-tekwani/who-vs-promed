Boy dies from rabies in Azerbaijan's Aghdam region
--------------------------------------------------
A 12-year-old schoolboy died from rabies in Ashagi Baharli village of
Aghdam, APA's Karabakh bureau reports. The boy had been bitten by his
dog. As the injury was slight, his parents did not pay attention to
it. Some days later, the child began to cough. Though they went to
the doctor several times, he felt worse day after day. The boy's
relatives told APA's correspondent that they did not tell the doctor
that the child had been bitten. When he was taken to the capital, it
became known he had been infected with rabies. He died on Sat 12 Jun 2010.

The staff of Aghdam Central Hospital has taken control at the village
where the boy lived. The boy's relatives relatives told APA's
Karabakh bureau that the dog, which had bitten the schoolboy, had run
away. Aghdam Central Hospital informed APA's Karabakh bureau that
the boy's relatives, their neighbors and anyone who had contact with
the boy, has now been vaccinated against rabies virus infection.

People warned of rabies spread
------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health has cautioned people to beware of the
current rabies spread in the country after 13 fatalities have been
confirmed in the 1st 5 months of 2010 thus far.

According to Deputy Public Health Minister, Phansiri Kullanartsiri,
13 people from 7 provinces have died from rabies. 12 of the patients
who died had been bitten by [domestic] dogs, while another person
died by being bitten by a stray cat.

A total of 6 patients were from Bangkok, while 2 were from the
western province of Kanchanaburi. The provinces of Saraburi, Samut
Prakan, Suphan Buri, Tak, and Chon Buri shared one case each. Bangkok
and Kanchanaburi hence have been classified as a dangerous zone for
rabies spread.

Meanwhile, Disease Control Department Director-General, MD Manit
Teeratantikanont, warned people about raising dogs aged less than 3
months old, especially stray puppies because they might be infected
with rabies but did not show symptoms. MD Manit explained that some
dogs showed symptoms of infection within one to 2 months but it could
be prolonged to even 6 months for some.
