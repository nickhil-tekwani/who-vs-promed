[Although it has been announced that a campaign to control YF has been launched in the Luanda area, beginning with the Viana municipality, no mention is made about similar campaigns being initiated or planned in other provinces that have had YF cases, including Huambo. In the absence of a vaccination campaign and vector control efforts, additional cases can be expected.
