2000/038 EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments
----------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the intercepted consignment reports for
1999 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 99/183) from the following
countries: Austria, Cyprus, Czechia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece,
Guernsey, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Switzerland, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom.
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests. Other interceptions due to prohibited commodities,
missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out
that the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their
interception reports.
Pest/Consignment/Type of commodity/Country of origin/Country of
destination/number
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis/_ Lycopersicum
esculentum_/Seeds/Thailand*/France/1
