Asian soybean rust confirmed on soybean plant tissue submitted
-------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust has never been identified in an Iowa field since
the disease was reported in the continental United States in November
2004. However, the disease now has been conclusively identified on
soybean plant tissue, which was submitted to the Iowa Soybean Rust
Team in early March. This soybean residue is reported to have been
recovered from a bin of soybeans produced in Iowa in 2006. Efforts
are underway to identify other remnant plant residue that may show
symptoms and signs of the disease in order to discern details of this
event. The fungus and the spores that cause the disease cannot
survive without green leaf tissue and will die during Iowa winters.
The recently discovered rust fungus does not pose a risk of infection
for the 2007 growing season in Iowa.
"The fast, conclusive identification of soybean rust in this one
particular plant residue sample illustrates the rapid diagnostic
capabilities available at Iowa State University to protect the
state's soybean crop from the threat of this disease," said Iowa
State University College of Agriculture Dean Wendy Wintersteen.
"This discovery reminds us that it is possible for Iowa fields to
become infected with this disease," said David Wright, director of
contract research at the Iowa Soybean Association. "Nonetheless,
growers should not overreact to this development. Instead, growers
must be ready to act appropriately and economically in 2007 should
this disease again show up in Iowa and be a threat to soybean yields."
Bill Northey, Secretary of Agriculture with the Iowa Department of
Agriculture and Land Stewardship, said the finding does not
necessarily increase the risk for next year's crop.
"The confirmation of this disease in the 2006 crop does not guarantee
that we will have Asian soybean rust in the 2007 Iowa soybean crop.
As in previous years, producers should monitor conditions that favor
rust and consult with extension specialists on identification and
management plans. However, it is imperative for producers to avoid
the inclination to panic and take drastic, costly and unnecessary
action before positively identifying soybean rust in their fields,"
Northey said.
The Iowa Soybean Rust Team comprises personnel from Iowa State
University (ISU) College of Agriculture and ISU Extension, the Iowa
Soybean Association, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land
Stewardship and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
The Iowa Rust Team recruited and trained more than 600 agribusiness
professionals from 2004 to 2006 to serve as "First Detectors" who can
examine leaf samples and decide whether the samples warrant further
investigation for possible infection with soybean rust by ISU
Extension personnel in the state or by campus-based ISU scientists.
Growers are encouraged to consult with Iowa Soybean Rust Team First
Detectors in the 2007 growing season if they observe plants that they
suspect might have soybean rust. There is no charge to consult with
these First Detectors concerning possible soybean rust infections.
The names and contact information for First Detectors is available at
<http://www.soybeanrust.info> and at county extension offices.

[A narrow escape for soybean growers it seems, and a wake-up call for
constant vigilance in the areas that have not (yet) had an outbreak
of soybean rust in the field. A map showing the current distribution
of soybean rust in the US can be found at: <http://www.sbrusa.net/>
