As of Tue 23 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
1774 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
723 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.8 per cent],
1033 recoveries, and
18 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. As of the time of preparation of this report, information on today's [Wed 24 Jan 2018] update is still pending. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update (that was through 15 Jan 2018), there has been a total of:

2 newly reported recoveries.

[MERS-CoV continues to be active during the month of January 2018 with 18 cases reported since the 1st of the year. These cases have been reported from 8 different regions around the country - with 7 cases reported from Riyadh, 2 each reported from Al Qaṣīm, Al Jawf, `Asīr and Najran, and 1 each from Ash Sharqīyah - Eastern, Tabūk, and Hail. All but one of the cases were Saudi nationals, 4 (22.2 percent) were female, 14 (77.8 percent) were male, 1 was a healthcare worker (in Riyadh), 9 (50 percent) were reported as fatalities, and 17 were classified as primary cases with 3 having a history of direct contact with camels and 14 still under investigation.

This past week since the last update followed this pattern with 4 newly confirmed cases from 4 different regions, all were Saudi nationals. One of the 4 was reported as a fatality, and all 4 were classified as primary cases still under investigation.
