Health officials in Guernsey are reporting a rise in cases of scarlet fever, an illness that normally affects children.

There have been 5 cases recently and doctors and school nurses are on alert. So far there has been no explanation for the outbreak. Once a common killer, the illness is now easily treatable with antibiotics. It is caused by streptococcal bacteria and is typically seen as a rash and a sore throat.

The highly contagious disease is passed on through saliva and by an infected person coughing or sneezing nearby.

To avoid the illness medics are advising: Wash your hands often; Do not share eating utensils; Dispose of tissues; and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing.
If you think you, or your child, have Scarlet Fever you should see your family doctor as soon as possible; make sure that the full course of any prescribed antibiotics is taken and stay at home for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.

The first symptoms often include a sore throat, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. After 12 to 48 hours the characteristic fine red rash develops - if you touch it, it feels like sandpaper. The rash usually first appears on the chest and stomach, rapidly spreading to other parts of the body. It normally takes 2-5 days from infection before the first symptoms appear, but the incubation period may be as short as 1 day and as long as 7 days. Scarlet fever often clears up after a week, but it is advisable to visit your GP to get a full diagnosis and proper treatment.

The usual treatment is a 10-day course of antibiotics. The fever should subside within 24 hours after starting this, but it is important to take the whole course to clear the infection. If it is not treated with antibiotics, it can be infectious for 2-3 weeks after the symptoms appear. Current guidance advises that children should not return to nursery or school or adults to work until a minimum of 24 hours after starting treatment.

[In a video that accompanies the above news report, we are told that there is a 5-fold increase in the incidence of streptococcal infection in Guernsey, but they report that there is nothing unusual about the strains of streptococci isolated. How that was determined is not stated.

The following is extracted from moderator ML’s comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - Guernsey 20110217.0521:

“Scarlet fever is an infection caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_, also known as group A streptococcus (GAS), a Gram positive coccus that grows in chains. Scarlet fever is usually associated with concurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, but may be associated with a streptococcal infection at other sites. An erythrogenic [red-producing] exotoxin released by the strains of _S. pyogenes_ that cause scarlet fever leads to the red rash that is characteristic of the illness. The incidence of pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years), during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close contact. Person-to-person spread from infected patients by means of respiratory droplets is the most common mode of transmission. It can rarely be spread through contaminated food
(http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).

“Persons who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are less contagious
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).
A history of GAS sore throat or scarlet fever in the community, neighborhood, or school may increase the likelihood of infection.

“The incubation period (the time between becoming infected and having symptoms) is short, generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins with a fever, sore throat, and an initially white, then bright red tongue with prominent red papillae, the so-called "strawberry" tongue, followed 12-48 hours later by a rash. The rash usually first appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body, and is more intense in skin folds, the so-called Pastia lines. The rash is described as "sandpapery" to touch. The face may be flushed with perioral [around the mouth] pallor. The rash can last for more than a week and is followed by desquamation (peeling) of the skin around the palms, fingertips, toes and groin area.

“Diagnosis of scarlet fever is clinical. Blood cultures are rarely positive, but GAS can usually be demonstrated in the throat by culture or rapid streptococcal test. Complications of scarlet fever include local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional lymph nodes, retropharyngeal [behind the throat] tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [kidney inflammation]. Septic complications due to spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and endocarditis [inflammation of the inner lining of the heart muscle, including the heart valves], occur rarely.

“Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of GAS pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, erythromycin, or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine. With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are uncommon: penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of ARF; unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

“Early recognition and treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential to prevent spread of group A streptococcal infections. Patients should no longer be infectious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours.

“The Bailiwick of Guernsey, with a population of 65 726 in 2008, is a British Crown Dependency in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey) and includes the islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, Brecqhou, Herm, Jethou, Burhou, and Lihou, which along with the Bailiwick of Jersey form the Channel Islands. Guernsey is situated 30 miles (48 km) west of France's Normandy coast and 75 miles (121 km) south of Weymouth, England. The island of Guernsey itself had a population of 59 710 in 2001 and has a total area of 25 square miles [about 65 sq km). Saint Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey as well as its main port, had a population of 16 488.

“The Channel Islands can be seen off the Normandy coast using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the UK at http://healthmap.org/r/0uaR. “ - Mod.ML]
