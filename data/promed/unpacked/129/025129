Owners of buildings in Sydney's CBD [central business district] have been put on notice after 4 workers recently contracted Legionnaires' disease.

NSW [New South Wales] Health has reported the outbreak could be from contaminated water [from] cooling towers in a number of large buildings. Unlike many other bacterial diseases, Legionnaires' disease isn't spread by human contact, but it typically occurs when a person breathes in contaminated water or dust.

The outbreak comes shortly after a similar situation occurred in Lidcombe, a suburb in western Sydney, in September last year [2018]. At the time, 3 individuals who had traces of the infection were thought to have become infected by the same water cooling system, according to the Western Sydney Local Health District's public health director Shopna Bag. The water cooling system has since been decontaminated.

And in 2016, a further 15 individuals reportedly contracted the condition after visiting Sydney's Central Business District, during 2 separate outbreaks linked to 2 cooling towers located in the inner city. As a result of the 2016 outbreak, NSW Health imposed stricter public health regulations, in which building owners were required to undertake monthly tests on cooling towers.

Passersby can contract the disease from contaminated vapour drifting in the outside wind, with symptoms including fever, chills, and shortness of breath. In some extreme instances, patients can develop pneumonia.

Dr. Jeremy McAnulty, the Director, Health Protection of NSW Health, said necessary precautions should always be taken. "As a routine, when visiting common areas, NSW Health works with local councils to ensure cooling towers in the affected areas are properly maintained," he told the Sydney Morning Herald. "People who develop this disease are diagnosed by chest X-ray and a urine test and usually require antibiotic treatment in hospital." If left untreated, Legionnaires' disease can cause a person to suffer from life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure from pneumonia and kidney failure.

[Humans acquire _Legionella_, the cause of legionnaires' disease, usually after inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

More than 70% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7% of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4% are _Legionella longbeachae_ (Yu VL, Plouffe JF, Pastoris MC, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002;186(1):127-8; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/1/127/837207).

Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during use of non-sterilized potting soil, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ and Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 4 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

Sydney, located on Australia's southeast coast, with a population of about 4.8 million residents, is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney).
