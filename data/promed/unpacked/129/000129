Abstract
--------
Objective
To directly measure the fatal impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an urban African population.

Design
Prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study.

Setting
Zambia's largest tertiary care referral hospital.

Participants
Deceased people of all ages at the University Teaching Hospital morgue in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled within 48 hours of death.

Main outcome measure
Postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs were tested via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Deaths were stratified by covid-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.

Results
372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of less than 40 and in 70/364 (19.2%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with COVID-19 (51/70; 73%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, 6 were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only 5 were tested before death. COVID-19 was identified in 7 children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with COVID-19 increased with age, but 76% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The 5 most common comorbidities among people who died with COVID-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31%), hypertension (19; 27%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23%), alcohol misuse (12; 17%), and diabetes (9; 13%).

Conclusions
Contrary to expectations, deaths with COVID-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, cases of COVID-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done not because COVID-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of COVID-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.

[This is extremely important since the general impression has been a lack of cases of COVID-19 in Africa, but the reality is there is actually a lack of testing. It is disturbing that 76% of the deaths were under 60 years old. If this underestimate of COVID-19 intensity is typical for other resource poor African countries, as well as other resource poor countries outside Africa, which is likely the case, it is very serious since these populations suffer from so many other diseases, as well as poverty. - Mod.LK]

[B] Sub Saharan toll
Date: Wed 17 Feb 2021 9:00 am EST

https://www.princeton.edu/news/2021/02/17/true-toll-coronavirus-sub-saharan-africa-may-be-obscured-tremendous-variability


The true toll of coronavirus on sub-Saharan Africa may be obscured by tremendous variability in risk factors and surveillance.

Although early reporting portrayed sub-Saharan Africa as being largely spared from the coronavirus pandemic, an international team led by Princeton researchers reported that determining the true impact of the novel coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa may be complicated by a tremendous variability in risk factors and obscured by surveillance challenges.

One early feature of reporting on the coronavirus pandemic was the perception that sub-Saharan Africa was largely being spared the skyrocketing infection and death rates that were disrupting nations around the world.

While still seemingly mild, the true toll of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa may be obscured by a tremendous variability in risk factors combined with surveillance challenges, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Medicine [see reference below] by an international team led by Princeton University researchers. "Although reports of the toll of SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa have to date been generally low in comparison to other regions, we must account for the extreme national and subnational variability in drivers of the pandemic across this region," said first author Benjamin Rice, a Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellow in ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton.

Precise projections for sub-Saharan African countries remain difficult given a lack of information on the prevalence of risk factors such as chronic diseases and access to healthcare, Rice said. But he and his co-authors synthesized a wide range of information on risk factors and trends in infection for sub-Saharan Africa from 25 Feb 2020 to 20 Dec 2020. The researchers then developed an interactive online tool that shows the impact that different risk factors -- such as rates of chronic disease, the local population density of physicians, and the percentage of an urban population living in crowded housing -- might have on the trajectory of the pandemic. The researchers also developed a set of simulations to evaluate the role of different drivers of viral spread.

Their results showed that climatic variation between sub-Saharan African population centers had little effect on early outbreak trajectories. That finding is consistent with research that Rice's co-authors have published suggesting that climate conditions in the summer and winter would have a minimal effect on coronavirus during the pandemic phase.

The Nature Medicine paper also found that differences in connectivity, although rarely considered, are likely an important contributor to differences in how the virus has spread across sub-Saharan Africa, said co-author Fidisoa Rasambainarivo, an HMEI [High Meadows Environmental Institute, Princeton University] postdoctoral research associate based in Madagascar. "These results could allow officials to anticipate what might happen in their countries given the varying contexts of human-movement networks and health across sub-Saharan Africa," Rasambainarivo said.

The researchers developed national and sub-national analyses that indicated specific settings where strengthening coronavirus surveillance could yield the greatest returns, Metcalf said. An urgent focus in sub-Saharan Africa is developing a better understanding of the intersection between the pace of the epidemic and the likelihood of disruptions to local and national health systems, which in many areas are already fragile. "These results underscore the importance of developing tools such as serology to better measure susceptibility in order to directly evaluate the current situation and landscape of risk," Metcalf said.

The authors conclude, "The burden and time course of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be highly variable across [sub-Saharan Africa] SSA. Simulations show that variation in international and subnational connectivity are expected to be important determinants of pace, but variability in reporting regimes makes it difficult to compare observations to date with expectations (Extended Data Fig. 7). As the outbreak continues to unfold, critically evaluating this mapping (Extended Data Fig. 8) can focus surveillance efforts to areas expected to have prolonged epidemic trajectories and high mortality burdens. The emergence and rapid spread in southern Africa of lineage B.1.351, with multiple spike protein mutations including the N501Y mutation associated with increased transmission rate in the UK lineage B.1.1.7, indicates the importance of genomic surveillance of transmission foci in SSA38. Additional immunological surveys and country-specific analyses of the age profile of mortality are urgently needed in SSA and will likely be a powerful lens for understanding the current landscape of population risk. When considering hopeful futures with the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it is imperative that vaccine distribution be equitable and in proportion with need. Understanding factors that both drive spatial variation in vulnerable populations and temporal variation in pandemic progression could help approach these goals in SSA."

UK COVID-19 swab study highlights lockdown impact
-------------------------------------------------
The latest results from an ongoing study from Imperial College London to track COVID-19 patterns in Britain show that infections have fallen by more than 2/3 since January [2021], likely due to lockdowns.

In other global developments, the World Health Organization announced a new battle plan against COVID-19.

Declines spanned age-groups, regions
------------------------------------
The research team based at Imperial College London, part of the REACT program, has been using home-based swab tests to tracking virus spread, and their latest results from a preprint study include 85 000 people who were tested between [4 and 13 Feb 2021]. Infections fell across the country, with steeper drops in London and the South East, and more modest declines in Yorkshire and Humber.

Prevalence dipped across all ages at a similar level, suggesting that the pattern is due to the lockdown, rather than vaccination. However, they warned that infections are still high, at about 1 in 200 people, with the highest levels seen in young people ages 5-12 and those ages 18-24 years old.

Paul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, who directs the research program, said in an Imperial College news release that the results are encouraging about lockdown impact. "While the trends we've observed are good news, we need to all work to keep infections down by sticking to the measures which are designed to protect us and our health system."

ref. Riley S, Walters C, Wang H, et al. REACT-1 round 9 interim report: downward trend of SARS-CoV-2 in England in February 2021 but still at high prevalence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background and methods
England entered its 3rd national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic on [6 Jan 2021] with the aim of reducing the daily number of deaths and pressure on healthcare services. The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from randomly selected people in England in order to describe patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Here, we report data from round 9 of REACT-1 for swabs collected between [4 and 13 Feb 2021].

Results
Out of 85 473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than 2/3 since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all 9 regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18-24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5-12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Healthcare and care home workers were more likely to test positive compared to other workers.

Conclusions
There is a strong decline in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England among the general population 5-6 weeks into lockdown, but prevalence remains high: at levels similar to those observed in late September 2020. Also, the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals is higher than at the peak of the 1st wave in April 2020. The effects of easing of social distancing when we transition out of lockdown need to be closely monitored to avoid a resurgence in infections and renewed pressure on health services.

[The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) should help elucidate factors that impact virus transmission. It is known that masks and social distancing and hand washing are critical to control, but the contribution of each is not clear. And vaccination also must be included in the analysis. The 1st round of data was collected May 2020 and the study is now in the 9th round, with each round testing between 150 000 and 175 000 randomly selected individuals ages 5 years and above. One strength of the study is that it includes individuals both with and without symptoms, so it captures the population better than a study at a clinic.

The authors address the impact of vaccination:
"Since December 2020, the UK government has rolled out a vaccination programme to categories of individuals considered the most at risk for severe infection and death [12]. These categories are mainly age-based, with nearly all people of 70 years and over being offered the vaccine during January and February 2021. However, the fall in prevalence was similar among those aged 65 years and over compared with other age groups, suggesting that if vaccines are effective at reducing transmission as well as disease, this effect is not yet a major driver of prevalence trends. Therefore, the observed falls described here are most likely due to reduced social interactions during lockdown."

Once a greater portion of the population is vaccinated, hopefully, immunity in the population will drive infection and hospitalization rates down more. - Mod.LK]

[3] Israel vaccination and reopening
Date: Thu 18 Feb 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/world/middleeast/israel-covid-vaccine-reopen.html


New government and business initiatives are moving in the direction of a 2-tier system for the vaccinated and unvaccinated, raising legal, moral, and ethical questions.

Israel has raced ahead with the fastest COVID vaccination campaign in the world, inoculating nearly half its population with at least one dose. Now, the rapid rollout is turning the country into a live laboratory for setting the rules in a vaccinated society -- raising thorny questions about rights, obligations, and the greater good.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet voted this week to open shopping malls and museums to the public, subject to social distancing rules and mandatory masking. For the 1st time in many months, gyms, cultural and sports events, hotels, and swimming pools will also reopen, but only for some. Under a new "Green Badge" system that functions as both a carrot and a stick, the government is making leisure activities accessible only to people who are fully vaccinated or recovered starting Sunday [21 Feb 2021]. 2 weeks later, restaurants, event halls, and conferences will be allowed to operate under those rules. Customers and attendees will have to carry a certificate of vaccination with a QR code.

Israel is one of the 1st countries grappling in real time with a host of legal, moral, and ethical questions as it tries to balance the steps toward resuming public life with sensitive issues such as public safety, discrimination, free choice, and privacy. "Getting vaccinated is a moral duty. It is part of our mutual responsibility," said the health minister, Yuli Edelstein. He also has a new mantra: "Whoever does not get vaccinated will be left behind." The debate swirling within Israel is percolating across other parts of the world as well, with plans to reserve international travel for vaccinated "green passport" holders and warnings of growing disparities between more-vaccinated affluent countries and less-vaccinated poor ones.

Israel's central government -- eager to bring the country out of its 3rd national lockdown without setting off a new wave of infections -- was spurred into action by local initiatives. Chafing under the country's lockdown regulations, an indoor shopping mall in the working-class Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam threw its doors open last week [week of 8 Feb 2021] for customers who could prove that they had been vaccinated or had recovered from COVID-19.

In Karmiel, the mayor made a similar decision to open his city in the northern Galilee region for business. His office began processing requests from employers who could verify that all of their employees had received the requisite 2 vaccine doses or had recovered from the virus.

And in other cities, mayors wanted to bar unvaccinated teachers from classrooms while some hoteliers threatened unvaccinated employees with dismissal.

Dr Maya Peled Raz, an expert in health law and ethics at the University of Haifa, defended some limits on personal liberties for the greater good. Employers cannot force employees to get vaccinated, she said, but they might be allowed to employ only vaccinated workers if not doing so could harm their business. "That may involve some damage to individual rights, but not all damage is prohibited if it is well-balanced and legitimate in order to achieve a worthy goal," she said. "It's your choice," she added of leisure activities. "If you are vaccinated, you can enter. As long as you aren't, we can't let you endanger others."

4 million Israelis -- nearly half the population of 9 million -- have received at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and more than 2.6 million have gotten a 2nd dose. But about 2 million eligible citizens aged 16 or over have not sought vaccines. The average number of new daily infections is hovering around 4000.

The speedy vaccination program in Israel contrasts sharply with the situation in the occupied territories, where few Palestinians have received even one dose. The disparity has provoked fierce debates about Israel's ethical and legal obligations to the Palestinians, as well as the potential health risk to Israelis of not vaccinating them.

Mr Edelstein, the health minister, said on Thursday [18 Feb 2021] that vaccination would not be compulsory in Israel. But his ministry is proposing legislation that would oblige unvaccinated employees whose work involves contact with the public to be tested for the virus every 2 days. And he is promoting a bill that would allow the ministry to identify unvaccinated people to the local authorities.

Local authorities and volunteers have been trying to lure people to vaccination centers with offers of free pizza, Arabic sweets and, in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, bags of cholent -- a slow-cooked stew traditionally prepared for the sabbath. Yet getting vaccinated remains voluntary and not everybody is rushing to it.

[OH], 34, a manager of vacation rentals in Jerusalem, said he believed in a natural approach to a healthy body and insisted that the risk posed by the virus -- which he called "a flu" -- had been exaggerated. He added that he did not trust the vaccine's safety. He said he did not know what he would do if legislation was introduced limiting his options. "But I won't get vaccinated. I'll surely participate in demonstrations. I believe I won't be alone," he said, adding, "I can survive without going to the theater, to soccer matches, or to a restaurant. It's annoying but what can I do?"

Concerts and restaurants are luxuries that people can more easily forgo. But the questions become more pressing and contentious when it comes to the rights of employers and workers. The rights of teaching staffs have come under particular scrutiny as some in-person classes reopen. A quarter or more of Israel's teachers have not sought a 1st dose, a situation that critics say poses a potential danger to pupils under 16, who are too young to be vaccinated. Some health workers have also refrained from being vaccinated. After a number of city mayors threatened to bar unvaccinated teachers from their classrooms, the deputy attorney general clarified that they did not have the authority to do so without new legislation.

Dr Peled Raz said the temporary emergency law governing Israel's response to the virus would be easier to amend with regard to health workers than to others because of potential harm to themselves and patients, adding that would be justified. "You want to be a nurse and won't get vaccinated?" she said. "Either get vaccinated or choose another profession."

But 2 rights organizations, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Worker's Hotline, said they had already received complaints from other unvaccinated workers. The groups wrote a letter to the attorney general this month [February 2021] demanding that he issue a clear opinion and said that under existing law an employer may not demand information from workers regarding their vaccination status. "The 1st problem is that there is no policy," said Gil Gan-Mor, the director of the civil and social rights unit at the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. "When the government is not working fast enough, we see too many private initiatives." Striking a balance between competing rights and interests remains a matter of debate, he said, and requires a broad discussion in Parliament.

Barak Cohen, a lawyer and social activist, raised more questions in a recent Facebook post. "To what degree is it appropriate to pressure and coerce when the decision-making process surrounding the vaccine is kept hidden, in the dark and confidential?" he wrote, noting that he does not deny the seriousness of the coronavirus or the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine. He also pointed to the low public trust in the government and what he called drug companies' "huge financial interest."

In Karmiel, City Hall gave at least 20 businesses a local version of a Green Badge to put in their windows, according to Eli Sade, the director of the mayor's office. All who entered were required to show that they had been vaccinated or had recovered from the virus. But police officers told store owners to close because they were breaking the law.

The shopping mall in Bat Yam, which wanted customers to prove they had been vaccinated, soon dropped the requirement for showing a green passport at the entrance and went back to equipping the guards with temperature guns. Inside, the few stores that opened had created their own entry policies. One chain followed basic social distancing regulations while another required a vaccination certificate. Sportswear and lingerie stores operated a "takeout" service for customers who stood at the door.

[HZ], 20, who was working in a Japanese-style home wear and gift store, said she did not plan to be vaccinated because an aunt had been overcome by dizziness after both of her doses. If she was told not to come without a green passport or a negative test every 2 days, she said with a shrug, "So I won't come."

[Public Health laws vary from country to country. In autocratic countries, edicts from the central level are often carried out with threats of severe penalties if disregarded. In more "democratic" countries, segments of the population can and do object to measures that would fall under public health laws. As pointed out in the article above, the Israeli government is now facing challenges on how to proceed with lifting of restrictions in a democratic society where personal freedoms are of paramount importance. The enactment and enforcement of laws based on vaccine compliance has been challenging to say the least as seen by prior experiences in Israel (and many of the European and American countries) with respect to measles vaccination and measles outbreaks associated with large pockets of unvaccinated individuals.

In looking into Public Health Law in the USA, CDC has a course titled "Public Health Law 101". Some pearls and examples from "Unit 7 Infectious diseases" present the USA position (available at https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/phl_101.html).

In the USA, the Constitution divides powers between the state and federal governments. The Federal government has authority for (1) interstate commerce; (2) foreign trade and travel; and (3) national security. The States have "all powers not given to the federal government", especially "police powers" -- defined as: "powers exercised by the states to enact legislation and promulgate regulations to protect public health, welfare, and morals, and to promote the common good."

Federal and state governments cooperate when
- communicable disease threats cross state lines;
- federal and state authority overlap as in food safety

In the USA, the issue of mandatory vaccinations for societal safety is a good example of where public health laws have been passed at the state level and are enforced -- there is mandatory education for minors and mandatory vaccination for school entry. If a child is not vaccinated and not permitted to go to school, the parents can be prosecuted for withholding education from their child.

So the questions raised in Israel as to whether to mandate proof of vaccination to enter some areas and shops or not hire employees who object to vaccination, or those who refuse to undergo testing every 2 days (teachers) does raise the issue of societal safety. I suspect legal scholars are watching how Israel plans to deal with this at the country level. - Mod.MPP]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2020, the Israeli Government approved the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and initiated a national immunisation campaign prioritising healthcare workers (HCWs), as in other countries./1 This campaign coincided with a 3rd wave of COVID-19, peaking at 10 116 daily new cases by mid-January, 2021. The Sheba Medical Centre, Israel's largest hospital with 9647 HCWs, began staff vaccination on [19 Dec 2020]. All HCWs, excluding those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were eligible for vaccination. Clinical trial data of BNT162b2 vaccine estimated an early vaccine efficacy in preventing COVID-19 of 52.4% before dose 2, and 90.5% on days 2-7 after dose 2. /2 A recent analysis of BNT162b2 vaccine data estimated vaccine efficacy of 89-91% during days 15-28 after the st dose. /3 We examined early reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 rates in vaccinated HCWs.

To assess vaccine-associated rate reductions we analysed a retrospective cohort of 9109 vaccine-eligible HCWs, comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Active daily symptom reporting and immediate same-day testing allowed for prompt (less than 24h) detection and investigation of exposed or symptomatic HCWs. /4 We defined all HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at Sheba Medical Centre or in the community as cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs were contacted by infection control staff and requested to respond to a contact tracing questionnaire and a clinical questionnaire specifically regarding COVID-19 symptoms. Symptomatic HCWs were defined as COVID-19 cases. We used the number of days each HCW was unvaccinated or days after the 1st dose as follow-up time. Rate ratios and 95% CIs associated with time after 1st-dose administration were adjusted for community exposure, using the distribution of probability of a positive contact by means of Poisson regression (appendix). The adjusted estimates were subtracted from 1 to obtain rate reductions.

By [24 Jan 2021], of the 9109 eligible staff, 7214 (79%) had received a 1st dose and 6037 (66%) had received the 2nd dose. 5505 (91%) fully vaccinated HCWs received the 2nd dose on days 21 or 22 after the 1st dose. 6818 (95%) HCWs were vaccinated at Sheba Medical Centre. All employees vaccinated in the community (n=396) were required to report dates of 1st and 2nd dose to the Human Resources department at Sheba Medical Centre.

Overall, there were 170 SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in the period between [19 Dec 2020], and [24 Jan 2021], of which 99 (58%) HCWs reported symptoms and were designated as COVID-19 cases. Of the 170 HCWs who became infected, 89 (52%) were unvaccinated, 78 (46%) tested positive after the 1st dose, and 3 (2%) tested positive after the 2nd dose. Among the 125 infections that could be traced, 87 (70%) were community acquired and there were no nosocomial clusters. /4 Compared with a SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of 7.4 per 10 000 person-days in unvaccinated HCWs, infection rates were 5.5 per 10 000 person-days and 3.0 per 10 000 person-days on days 1-14 and 15-28 after the 1st dose of the vaccine, respectively. Adjusted rate reductions of SARS-CoV-2 infections were 30% (95% CI 2-50) and 75% (72-84) for days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose, respectively (table; appendix).

Table: Rate reductions of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases in health-care workers at the Sheba Medical Centre, Israel, from December 2020 to January 2021

Compared with a symptomatic COVID-19 rate of 5.0 per 10 000 person-days in unvaccinated HCWs, disease rates were 2.8 and 1.2 per 10 000 person-days on days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose of the vaccine, respectively. Adjusted rate reductions of COVID-19 disease were 47% (95% CI 17-66) and 85% (71-92) for days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose, respectively.

The limitations of this study include the observational nature of the study design. Lack of active laboratory surveillance in the cohort might have resulted in an underestimation of asymptomatic cases. Data on vaccine efficacy in preventing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, and our results of rate reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, which include asymptomatic HCWs, need further validation through active surveillance and sampling of vaccinated people and unvaccinated controls to ascertain the actual reduction of asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals. The early rate reductions seen in HCWs might differ from vaccine efficacy reported in the general population due to their higher exposure risk or due to exposure to more virulent or infectious strains.

Our data show substantial early reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 rates following 1st vaccine dose administration. Early reductions of COVID-19 rates provide support for delaying the 2nd dose in countries facing vaccine shortages and scarce resources, so as to allow higher population coverage with a single dose. Longer follow-up to assess long-term effectiveness of a single dose is needed to inform a 2nd dose delay policy.

[Once again, good data are coming out of Israel on the impact of vaccinations. In the letter to the editor above, the data support an increasing protection against serious disease 15-28 days following a 1st dose of the mRNA vaccine when compared with those 1-14 days following the 1st dose of vaccine. A key circumstantial bit of evidence will be a reduction of daily reported new cases at the country level. We await further information coming out of Israel and other countries. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (69 998), Brazil (51 350), and France (22 501) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 609 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 17 Feb 2021 to late 18 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Spain (14 515), Italy (13 755), Russia (13 447), India (12 643), UK (12 057), and Czech Republic (10 930). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 11.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 12.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 28.4% decrease in daily reported cases and 7.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments. The global daily reported cases over 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 110.82 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.45 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.MPP]
