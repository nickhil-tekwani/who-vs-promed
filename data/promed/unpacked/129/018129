----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the report of a typhoid fever outbreak in North Korea, at present, I do not know of formal notifications or communications. Note that the region of the possible outbreak is large and remote, has chronically inadequate water and sewage systems as generally elsewhere in country, and both Ryanggang and neighboring North Hamgyong provinces were also badly hit by flooding in 2016. Massive post-flood investments have gone into recovery and reconstruction of these areas and it will be important to know the point/city of outbreak. The rainy season and flash floods tend to increase risks of water- and foodborne illnesses, although access to Widal test or ELISA or even liver function tests here to timely confirm and treat remains limited, unstable, and discriminatory.
