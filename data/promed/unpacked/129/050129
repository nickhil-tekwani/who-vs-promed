FAIRFIELD HOSPITAL (MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA) CLOSURE (2)
=====================================================
[I consider] the imminent closure of Fairfield Infectious
Diseases Hospital, one of the most patently stupid actions I have ever
witnessed. Having studied at the institution, I echo and share the concerns
expressed in the original posting.
The address of the health minister concerned is
The Hon Marie Tehan MP,
Minister for Health,
Dept of Health & Community Services
555 Collins St
Melbourne 3000
Victoria, Australia

I hope you can find time to make a protest.
Regards
Derek Mitchell
