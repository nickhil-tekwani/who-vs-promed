Police are investigating the mysterious deaths of 2 children in Philippi whose family believe died due to food poisoning.

The siblings, aged 6 and 4, died, while several other family members became severely ill after eating the same chicken earlier this week in Samora Machel.

The City of Cape Town has confirmed the chicken eaten by the family was safe for consumption when it was bought from a vendor in the informal settlement. However, toxicology reports reveal a substance usually found in insecticides or medications was found in their systems.

The City's JP Smith says experts tested frozen chicken found in the family's fridge, as well as the gravy used in the meal, and the chickens on the farm where the vendor had bought it from.

"The City of Cape Town lab has concluded their bacteriology assessment of the samples of the remaining chicken and gravy which formed part of the meal. Test results show that there were not sufficiently high enough levels of bacterial organisms to cause either illness or death, so the poisoning must have happened at their home."

[Apparently, there was a very minor accumulation of bacteria of some sort in the food, but it was well below the concern level.

Was the food tested on the same toxicology panel as the bodies of the siblings? Was the food the source of the substance of either an insecticide or a medication? Did the children get a larger dose than the adults? Or were the children more susceptible to whatever the mysterious substance was?

There are not enough clinical signs to hazard a guess at the substance in question. In most cases, an insecticide is not the same as a medication, unless perhaps one is referring to an anti-parasiticide medication, which also kills parasites.

If there is authoritative information regarding this situation, ProMED-mail would appreciate the news being shared. - Mod.TG
