Tougher regulation of the horse racing industry, the financial hardships facing farmers and an unknown condition affecting camels are issues set to dominate this week's Federal National Council's [FNC] session.

Mosabeh Al Kitbi, Sharjah, said the mysterious type of fever, believed to be unrelated to MERS, has been around for years.

However, he will raise his concerns with the Minister of Environment and Water, Rashid bin Fahad, that the situation in Al Dhaid, Sharjah, Dubai, and Al Ain, is getting worse.

"It has existed for 2 years. There were individual cases, but in the past few months vets have announced increased cases of camels suffering fever," said Mr Al Kitbi.

"The Ministry of Environment must take action. After taking some samples they have discovered that it has nothing to do with MERS. But what is it? And what is the cure for it?"

There is confusion as to the source of the disease, with some believing it spread from camels that participated in races in neighbouring Arabian Gulf countries, while others say it is from visiting racing camels.

"Camels are a very important animal resource -- people rely on them for food, clothes, milk. So if they are suffering any disease, there should be cooperation between the municipalities," said Mr Al Kitbi.

Some owners have been able to save their animals from dying after an early diagnosis and treatment, which can cost up to Dh 10 000 [USD 2722.94] each camel, he added.

Dr Mahmoud Mohammed, a vet in Al Dhaid area, said he had treated more than 50 camels in the past 5 months -- out of which 5 per cent have died.

"The labs we have in the area are not advanced enough to carry out tests and diagnose the exact disease," he said. "I told Mosbeh to tell the ministry to identify the disease and its treatment."

The camels are suffering rapid breathing, cold, flu, coughing, and fever.

Dr Mohammed said he treats each camel based on the symptoms, so an animal suffering severe coughing is given cough syrup, while one suffering the flu is given antibiotics.

"Even if they were suffering from MERS, the treatment would be pretty much similar. The ministry needs to carry out tests in advanced labs so we will have proof."

[The report above includes some answers to our request for information in posting 20140615.2542315 addressing undiagnosed mortality of dromedary camels in the UAE (Al Dhaid, Sharjah, Dubai, and Al Ain; see map at http://www.memnav.com/im/uae_map.gif).

According to the (anecdotal) information:
1. The event in the UAE started about 2 years ago.
2. Initially is was sporadic, recently the incidence increased.
3. Clinical signs, as mentioned by a practitioner said to had treated 50 sick camels, include "rapid breathing, cold, flu, coughing and fever."
4. According to the said source, in the absence of diagnosis, symptomatic treatment was applied, eventual mortality becoming 5 percent.
5. Another source claimed that early diagnosis and (very expensive) treatment helped save camels' lives.
6. As source of infection, 2 scenarios were mentioned:
i. imported race camels
ii. returning race camels
7. According to one source, the local authorities ruled out MERS-CoV as possible diagnosis. No further details (test mode, laboratory name) provided.

More, firsthand details are awaited.

It deserves to be mentioned that UAE has reported, so far, 67 MERS-CoV cases in humans, of which 9 reportedly died. - Mod.AS
