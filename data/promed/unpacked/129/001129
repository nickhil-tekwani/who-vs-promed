[As of today, 25 Jan 2019, there have been 9 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019. Of these 9 cases, 7 were reported from Riyadh City and 2 from Jeddah in Makkah province. Classification of these 9 cases included 3 secondary infections in household contacts, and the remaining 6 were primary community-acquired cases, none of whom gave an initial history of known contact with camels. (This may change as more information becomes available.) An overriding question remains: what is the source of infection for those individuals who do not have identified high-risk exposures? Is it contact with individuals who have undiagnosed mild disease? Is it contact with individuals who have contact with other individuals who have had contact with camels? Is the transmission occurring in healthcare facilities with undiagnosed infections? Is the transmission occurring through unknown/unidentified camel "contamination" in the public environment? - Mod.MPP
