[The manifestations of tularemia in these cases are not stated.

Voles (http://www.voles.com/) are likely to be the reservoir here. They are often called meadow mice, or field mice, and occupy a wide variety of habitats, depending on the species. Generally, voles prefer areas with heavy ground cover of grasses, grass-like plants, or litter. They are active both day and night and throughout the year. Voles eat a variety of plants and animals. They frequently forage on grasses, forbs, roots, bulbs, tubers, bark, snails, and insects. To find food, voles construct tunnels and surface runways with many burrow openings. Several adults and young can live in these runway systems. This intricate network of tunnels and burrows provides voles with excellent shelter from the weather and protection from predators. Voles store seeds and other plant matter in underground chambers. A picture of a vole can be found at http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/september22/gifs/Yellowstone_vole.jpg.

Palencia is a province of northern Spain, in the northern part of the autonomous community of Castile and Leon in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is bordered by the provinces of Leon, Cantabria, Burgos, and Valladolid. - Mod.LL
