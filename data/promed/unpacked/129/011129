[According to information submitted in their annual report of 2015, Russia reported 9 outbreaks of sheep and goat pox during this year. These were located in the Republic of Dagestan, Primorye Krai and Republic of Kalmykia. See report at http://tinyurl.com/zv78oro (see section No. 1 and No. 3 of this report).

"Capripoxviruses are most likely to be introduced in infected animals, but fomites and animal products such as wool can also spread disease. Outbreaks can be controlled by quarantines, movement controls, and depopulation of infected and exposed animals, followed by stringent cleaning and disinfection of farms and equipment. Proper disposal of infected carcasses is important; burning or burial is often used.

Capripoxviruses may persist for up to 6 months in shaded, uncleaned pens and for at least a few months in dry scabs on skin, fleece and hair. Poxviruses are resistant to drying, and can also survive freeze / thaw cycles, although the infectivity may be reduced. When the disease has spread more widely, vaccination may also be considered.

Infection results in good immunity, and vaccination is used to control sheep and goat pox in endemic areas. In these regions, new animals should be quarantined before adding them to the flock or herd. Infected herds and sick animals should be isolated for at least 45 days after they have recovered from clinical signs. In some outbreaks, the herd may be culled." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/sheep_and_goat_pox.pdf
