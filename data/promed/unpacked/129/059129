Kuwait on Saturday confirmed its first cases of foot & mouth disease
(FMD) in 3 years, becoming the third Gulf Arab state to recently
report instances of the disease, which is ravaging farms in Europe.
"We have found FMD cases in the Kabd area in the north of the country,
but we do not have the number of cases yet," said Wafaa Shehab, public
relations director at the Public Authority for Agriculture and Fish
(PAAF). "We have formed an emergency vaccination team and isolated the
infected cows and workers to prevent the spread of the disease," she
said. Farms in the Kabd area raise only cows.
There was a limited outbreak of FMD in Kuwait in 1998. Since January
[2001, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have reported cases
of the highly contagious viral infection, which affects cloven-hoofed
animals but is harmless to humans. The al-Qabas newspaper said Kuwait
had discovered 250 cases of FMD in cattle farms in the Kabd area. A
farmer told the newspaper 65 of the 90 cows on his farm were infected.
Kabd farmers have asked the PAAF to vaccinate their livestock to
prevent the spread of the disease.
FMD has swept Britain and spread to parts of continental Europe.
Kuwait has already banned the import of livestock from all European
Union states following scares over mad cow disease.

[We checked with Nick Knowles at Pirbright who replied as follows:
"Kuwait had the PanAsia strain in 1996, 1997, and 1998. We had 2
samples in May 1999, but were unable to isolate any virus. Nothing
since then. We have, however, sequenced recent isolates (2001) from
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. They are closely
related to each other, but distinct from the UK PanAsia virus (about
8% different at the nucleotide level). They may be related to an
earlier lineage that is part of the PanAsia strain. We are currently
investigating this further. There is no connection with the UK
outbreak."
This article does not give us enough information to know if the
correct strain of vaccine is being used. - Mod.TG
