A rabbit producer has contacted me from Havana wishing to know about the
availability and cost of RHD vaccines in Cuba.
Is anyone aware of a contact name in Cuba I could refer this gentleman to?
Also, is the rabbit haemorrhagic disease vaccine available in Cuba and is it
available from any veterinary clinic there?

[I was not aware there was a vaccine against rabbit hemorrhagic disease
virus, which the Australians erroneously call "rabbit calicivirus". If
nothing else, we might now have information that the hemorrhagic disease of
rabbits in Cuba is caused by RHDV. That's a start. Now we would like to
know where the rabbits came from or whether this was a local recrudescence
after a long period without overt disease in Cuba. -- Mod CHC
