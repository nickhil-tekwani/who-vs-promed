MOSAIC VIRUSES, CASSAVA - INDIA: (KERALA)

A national symposium, "Changing Plant Disease Scenario in Relation to
Climate Change," was held recently at the Indian Institute of Spices Research.

There is a severe occurrence of _Indian cassava mosaic virus_ in
Kerala, due to shift in climate conditions, and new reports of
_African cassava mosaic virus_ and _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_,
according to plant pathologists.

Proper surveillance and monitoring are the only possible remedy to
check new emerging diseases.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the
past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is
caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_
which seem to be associated with it in different areas. Co-infections
as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been
reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent. The
additional CMD virus species in Kerala would strongly enhance the
possibility of recombinant strains to emerge which may then spread in
the country, and, therefore, pose a serious risk to Indian cassava production.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion and stunting of plants
leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are
spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material
(including seed tubers). At least one of them (_African cassava
mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an alternative host
(soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host
reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease
management for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their
vectors as well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these
methods have proven unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD,
varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed
for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some
areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by
_Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; see previous ProMED-mail posts
listed below). Development of crop varieties with resistance to
multiple viruses, as reported above for CMD in Kerala, is
particularly difficult (see ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463).
