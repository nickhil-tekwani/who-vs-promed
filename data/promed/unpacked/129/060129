The Public Authority for the Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources' (PAAAFR) director general Jassem Al-Bader said on Tuesday [10 Jun 2014], 5 camels in Kuwait have been found infected with MERS coronavirus [MERS-CoV]. The camels found infected have been identified and quarantined, and were found amongst 83 diagnosed [probably "tested"?] specimens, stated the official.

The authority has taken adequate precautionary measures and has summoned the herd owners to [isolate] the infected animals in order to prevent the infection from being transmitted elsewhere. As a result of the findings, PAAAFR has held an urgent meeting with the Ministry of Health in order to agree on steps aimed at monitoring these particular herds, in addition to coordinating measures for other camel herds in the country.

The official ensured that PAAAFR will be carrying all procedures necessary under the guidelines on the matter set forth by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the World Health Organization [WHO]. The authority will also be coordinating on the matter with its regional Gulf Cooperation Council partners.

MERS-CoV, Qatar
---------------
Information received on [and dated] 9 Jun 2014 from Dr Kassem Nasser Al-Qahtani, director of Dept of Animal Resources, Ministry of Environment, Department of Animal resources, Doha, Qatar

Summary
Report type: follow-up report no 3
Date of start of the event: 14 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Nov 2013
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 17 per cent
Mortality: 0 per cent
Zoonotic impact: asymptomatic exposure of camel to MERS-CoV (laboratory advanced)
Causal agent: MERS-CoV

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Al-Shahanya, Al-Shahanya, Ar Rayyan, Ar Rayyan
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 May 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 12 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 3 barns of 12 camels of different ages and at same place

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Camelidae / 42 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: milk was collected according to local customs; crias (dromedary calves) were not weaned after delivery but kept at the farm in paddocks adjacent to their dams throughout lactation. Dams were reunited with their cria to trigger milk production. Once milk production was initiated, the milk samples were collected by the camel owner or caretaker without specific hygienic precautions.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, zoning, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam) and National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Bilthoven), The Netherlands (foreign laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Camelidae / seroneutralization test (SNT) / 18 May 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Since the start of the Qatar MERS-CoV event, reportedly on 14 Oct 2013, 3 outbreaks have been reported, all in the same location (Al-Shahanya in the district of Ar Rayyan (see map at the source URL above).

The event's summary's statistics are the following:
Total outbreaks: 3 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 52 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0
(available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015380_20140610_175414.pdf).

Some clarification on the epidemiological comment, addressing the dam/offspring contacts and milk feeding procedures in the infected units, will be helpful.

If the information from Kuwait (item [1]) is officially confirmed, Kuwait will become the 5th country in the Arabian peninsula where MERS-CoV infections in dromedary camels have been discovered.

Official notifications to the OIE have, so far, been issued by Qatar (applying PCR, virus isolation, and now SN) and Oman (RT-PCR); in both, in subclinically infected camels. According to scientific publications, Saudi camels infections by MERS-CoV have been diagnosed by PCR and virus isolations, and in UAE by several serological techniques.

The media report from Kuwait leaves room for some questions. The report mentions 83 camels "diagnosed" (this may, apparently, mean "tested"), in "herds", of which 5 are said to be infected.

- How many herds have been tested?
- What were their sizes and locations?
- How old were the tested/positive animals?
- What was the age distribution in each affected herd?
- Which test(s) was(were) applied and by which laboratory?
- Is related human infection suspected?

The Kuwaiti statement about "coordinating measures for other camel herds in the country" under the "guidelines on the matter set forth by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the World Health Organization [WHO]" is of interest. We shall be grateful for obtaining such international guidelines referring to camels, in case available, and will be glad to disseminate them. - Mod.AS]
