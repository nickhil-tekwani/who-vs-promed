Pakistan to apply for rinderpest disease-free certification soon
-----------------------------------------------------------------
LAHORE: Pakistan is likely to apply for rinderpest-free certification by
the end of this year as no case of this disease has been reported in the
country since Sep 2000, according to the Punjab secretary for livestock
Ikhlaq Tariq while addressing a press conference in Lahore. He said the
livestock departments around the country have ensured that their livestock
remain in "excellent health". This was essential for the health and well
being of local consumers as well as for the sustainability of livestock
exports.
Tariq said [that some journalists had published] a baseless report about a
mysterious disease in buffaloes at Okara. FAO Headquarters at Rome picked
the news on internet as the symptoms stated in that news items about the
mysterious disease resembled rinderpest. He said that the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations was rightly concerned
as it was involved in a project in Pakistan for the elimination of
intra-boundary diseases (rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, and peste des
petits ruminants). He said FAO alerted its Islamabad office to look into
the matter.
Tariq said FAO consultant Dr J Mariner (epidemiologist), Dr Mazoor Hussain,
National Consultant Trans-boundary Animal Disease Surveillance, and other
experts visited the reported area and carried out fresh surveys. No
evidence of any disease was found in the entire region. The buffalo
reported to be suffering from the mysterious disease died due to drenching
pneumonia a few days earlier. Dr Mariner confirmed the findings to the press.
In a signed report, Dr Mariner stated, "There is no truth about the news
that seems to have some political motives". He said FAO surveys have found
no evidence of rinderpest in Pakistan since Sep 2000. Dr Manzoor Hussain
told the newsmen that the FAO team under a funded project obtained samples
from 9230 animals. These samples were tested at the FAO Afghanistan
Laboratory (based in Islamabad) and all samples were cleared. He said local
testing laboratories have conducted even more tests during the past five
months and have found no evidence of rinderpest in Pakistan.
Rinderpest erupted in the Northern Areas of Pakistan in 1994 and 1995. 40
000 cattle died because of this disease in that area before the disease
could be brought under control through extensive vaccination.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Roeder for responding to our request for information
on the alleged disease in Punjabi cattle; he has kindly forwarded this
report from the International News section of The News of Pakistan. Dr
Roeder further confirms that FAO is working closely with the Government of
Pakistan, with assistance from the European Union (EU), to strengthen
surveillance for the control of the most serious contagious diseases of
livestock. He added that one major outcome expected is an assured status of
rinderpest freedom in the near future. "Rinderpest -- says Roeder -- was
last seen in Sindh in 2000. Through the Global Rinderpest Eradication
Programme, FAO continues also to work closely with Indian colleagues who
have benefited greatly from rinderpest freedom since they eradicated the
disease in 1995 -- again with some assistance from the EU".
It is indeed relieving to note the improvement in animal health in
Pakistan. Hopefully, the political situation in that subcontinent will not
deteriorate, to reverse the obtained achievements; rinderpest is
notoriously known to be adversely influenced by political unrest. - Mod AS].
