An adult female elephant, which was found dead in Hadagada wildlife sanctuary in the district 2 months ago, died of anthrax infection according to the pathological investigation report received by the forest department on [Wed 27 Jun 2018].

Blood samples taken from the jumbo's ear tip were sent to the Animal Husbandry College of Odisha University of Agriculture Technology (QUAT). "The pathological investigation has detected the presence of anthrax bacteria," said Anandpur divisional forest officer Ajit Kumar Satpathy. The animal's body was found on [Sat 12 May 2018].

"We had detected preliminary signs of anthrax bacteria in the carcass of the 20-year-old female elephant in the preliminary diagnostic investigation conducted by local veterinary surgeons. However, samples were sent to OUAT for confirmatory report," Satpathy said.

The forest department has undertaken sensitisation drive as a precautionary measure and asked the farmers to avoid using the spot where the carcass was recovered. The villagers had been asked to stop grazing their cattle in the area for one week. "The villagers had abided by the forest department instructions. Therefore, the threat of the bacterial disease spreading its tentacles has been curbed," Satpathy said.

An immunisation drive to vaccinate the domesticated animals had been conducted in the villages.

The animal was buried with application of chemicals for the decaying of the body at the earliest. The village where the death was reported is close to elephants' habitation corridor.

Anthrax disease is spreading in 5 villages of the 3 mandals in Srikakulam district. After the death of 7 sheep at Karakavalasa village in Jalumuru mandal, officials of the animal husbandry department have been alerted and they sent the meat for tests at a laboratory in Hyderabad.

In cases in which anthrax was confirmed positive, the officials brought 3000 doses of anthrax vaccine immediately from the Pader Agency of Visakhapatnam and vaccinated 500 animals in Karakavalasa, Annupuram, Bidulapuram, Marrivalasa, Kittalapadu villages situated in Hiramandal, Jalumuru, Saravakota mandals.

Anthrax vaccine is available at Paderu area where the disease recently spread and surplus medicine was available. On learning about the spread of the disease among the animals, the officials of the district medical and health department were alerted and the people were also cautioned not to consume the meat of sheep, goat and other animals for some time.

"Anthrax disease automatically spreads among humans, if we consume the meat of animals affected by the disease", the divisional medical officer Dr Menda Praveen said while speaking to The Hans India here on [Wed 27 Jun 2018].

Anthrax disease is likely to spread among animals within a radius of 3 km [1.86 miles approx.] from Karakavalasa village where the disease was found. It was found that in the 3 km radius, a total of 20 villages are located in 3 mandals.

"To prevent it from further spreading, we have been instructed to purchase 13 500 doses of anthrax vaccine from a private laboratory in Bengaluru and it will reach soon," deputy director (DD) of animal husbandry department Dr Manchu Karunakar Rao told The Hans India. "We will vaccinate all animals found within the 3 km radius after procuring vaccine", the deputy director added.

Tension prevailed in the district and people of Jalumuru, Saravakota and surrounding mandals are in the grip of fear after anthrax was detected in sheep at Karakavalasa village of Jalumuru mandal. Veterinary officials started conducting special vaccination drive and examinations in surrounding villages of Krakavalasa. A total of 13 500 more doses of vaccination are on the way from Bengaluru.

After the death of many sheep at Karakavalasa village very recently, veterinary officials collected blood samples from the suspected animals and sent the same to the veterinary biological research institution in Hyderabad for tests. As suspected by the veterinary officials, researchers confirmed anthrax in the blood samples.

To arrest the spread of the disease, veterinary officials, following directions from District Collector K Dhananjaya Reddy, started administering the vaccination to the cattle at Karakavalasa, Anupuram and other nearby villages. Since they brought 3000 doses of vaccination from Visakhapatnam, they started the drive in war-footing mode. They also wrote to the higher-ups seeking more doses from Bengaluru with immediate effect.

With the suspicious death of sheep 2 days ago [Tue 26 Jun 2018], microscopic blood examination was conducted on the spot and found the presence of anthrax organism in the blood serum, said Dr M Venkateswara Rao, the Srikakulam Animal Husbandry joint director. The samples were later sent to veterinary biological research institute in Hyderabad for confirmation. After confirmation, we started administering vaccination to all domestic animals in and around the village.

"Although we brought 3000 doses of anthrax vaccination from Visakhapatnam, a load of 13 500 more doses of vaccination are on the way to Srikakulam from Bengaluru," he added. "To check its prevalence, we would administer vaccination to the animals in 3-km [1.86 miles approx.] radius from the prime point," said Venkateswara Rao. The sprinkling of formaldehyde was also conducted in the sheds.

[Odisha is in north east India and we have had frequent reports of anthrax in elephants there. Burning carcasses is the best method for handling cases but with elephants it necessitates a fair bit of organising. They are to be congratulated and on vaccinating nearby livestock.

How so many many flocks of sheep became infected in Andhra Pradesh -- in south east India -- is unclear. But the human risk from butchered sheep carcasses is very real. They are readily butchered and shared with family and neighbours, quite apart from those that end up in street markets. The official response is to be congratulated. - Mod.MHJ
