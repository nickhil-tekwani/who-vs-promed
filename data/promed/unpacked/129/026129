The Kansas Department of Agriculture [KDA] has announced that vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] was confirmed in horses in Butler County on 16 Jun 2020. Kansas becomes the 4th state in the US to have confirmed cases of VSV this year.

The infected horses live on different private residences in south central Kansas. When clinical signs were first identified on a premises in Butler County, KDA contacted veterinarians in the region to alert them of the possibility of VSV, which led to additional suspect cases in the area. Upon receiving the laboratory confirmation, KDA established a quarantine on the 3 affected premises. KDA has tested a number of other animals in the region which are showing clinical signs consistent with VSV, and are awaiting final laboratory testing.

"Protecting the health and safety of horses and other livestock in Kansas is our highest priority," Dr Justin Smith, animal health commissioner, said. "We encourage all livestock owners across Kansas to be aware of the clinical signs of VSV and follow best practices to limit exposure to insects. Livestock owners should take extra precautions to limit exposure to other animals."

VSV is a viral disease which primarily affects horses but can also affect cattle, sheep, goats, swine, llamas, and alpacas. In horses, VSV is typically characterized by lesions which appear as crusting scabs on the muzzle, lips, ears, coronary bands, or ventral abdomen. Other clinical signs of the disease include fever and the formation of blister-like lesions in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, ears, hooves, and teats. Infected animals may refuse to eat and drink, which can lead to weight loss. Vesicular stomatitis can be painful for infected animals and costly to their owners. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, and can develop flu-like symptoms.

The primary way the virus is transmitted is from biting insects like black flies, sand flies, and midges. Owners should institute aggressive measures to reduce flies and other insects where animals are housed. VSV can also be spread by nose-to-nose contact between animals. The virus itself usually runs its course in 5 to 7 days, and it can take up to an additional 7 days for the infected animal to recover from the symptoms. Premises with animals diagnosed with VSV are quarantined for at least 14 days after the last affected animal is diagnosed. There are no USDA-approved vaccines for VSV.

VSV is considered a reportable disease in Kansas. Any person who suspects their animals may have VSV should contact their local veterinarian or state animal health official.

When VSV was confirmed in neighboring states this spring [2020], KDA implemented increased importation requirements from the affected regions to help prevent the spread of VSV into Kansas. Because of the confirmed case in Kansas, other states and Canada are likely to increase restrictions on livestock imports. Animal health officials strongly encourage all livestock owners and veterinarians to call the animal health authority in the destination location for the most current import requirements prior to travel.

For more information about VSV, including documents outlining symptoms, fly control practices, and current situation reports, please visit the KDA website at http://www.agriculture.ks.gov/VSV. If you observe clinical signs among your animals, contact your veterinarian right away. For questions about VSV in Kansas, please contact the KDA Division of Animal Health at 785-564-6601.

In its [11 Jun 2020] situation report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) identified 2 new Arizona premises with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The newly affected premises are in Apache and Maricopa counties.

Since APHIS's previous situation report (4 Jun 2020), 6 Arizona premises have been released from quarantine in Apache, Cochise, Maricopa, Pinal, and Santa Cruz counties. 5 Arizona premises are currently quarantined for VSV, all of which are in Apache and Maricopa counties.

Also since the 4 Jun 2020 situation report, 5 New Mexico premises (in Bernalillo, De Baca, Dona Ana, Grant, and Sierra counties) have been released from quarantine. No new cases have been confirmed in New Mexico and Texas, the other 2 states affected by VSV in 2020. No premises are currently quarantined in New Mexico; 2 premises remain quarantined in Kerr and McMullen counties in Texas.

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot and mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the western hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The south western and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the most recent and largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[This outbreak of VSV continues. However, USDA and obviously the states have stopped reporting the strains. Since Texas had both the Indiana and the New Jersey strains, it would be nice to know the distribution of the strains. - Mod.TG]
