There are 3 further officially confirmed cases of African swine fever (ASF) in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute on the Riems [FLI] has diagnosed the disease in wild boars.

The animals belong to a group of wild boars that were killed a week ago during a driven hunt near Marnitz (Ludwigslust-Parchim district) on the state border with Brandenburg. A dead infected piglet was discovered. As a result, all 17 wild boars killed there were examined. Three of them have now also tested positive. ASF is not dangerous to humans, but infected pigs usually die.

The Ludwigslust-Parchim district has already set up zones in which strict regulations apply. This also includes a restricted area that unauthorized persons are no longer allowed to enter. A protective fence is now being erected there. Construction has already started. All wild boars are now to be tracked down and killed in this region in order to limit the risk of further infections as far as possible.

The work on the approximately 40-kilometer [25 mile] electric fence south of the A24 should be completed in the next 4 days, said a spokesman for the district on Saturday [27 Nov 2021]. Since Friday [26 Nov 2021], the 'State Forest' [a legal entity under public law in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania], and the veterinary and food monitoring service have also been working to get a precise overview of the number of wild boar in the area. Several drones will be used for this purpose -- a police helicopter with thermal imaging cameras will also be used in the coming days. Only when the fence is ready do experts want to go into the area. Until then, the animals should not be roused.

In addition to the core protection zone south west of the A24 between Marnitz and Ziegendorf, the district has designated a larger surveillance area that extends beyond the city of Parchim. According to the information, the domestic pig populations are particularly observed there. The authorities assume that there are 106 herds of domestic pigs in the area with a total of 25 000 to 30 000 animals. Eight of these farms have reportedly more than 100 pigs. So far, there is no evidence that domestic animal populations in the region are affected by ASF. In particular, keepers must ensure that domestic pigs cannot come into contact with wild boar.

[According to 'Pig Progress', the distance between the infected farm, near Lalandorf (20211118.8699737), where the ASF virus was discovered in the hitherto unaffected state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on 14 Nov 2021, and the location, near the A24 highway, where the infected wild boar were found/killed later, is about 60 km. A map indicating both locations as well as all previous cases in Germany (in the states of Brandenburg and Saxony) is available at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2021/11/ASF-Germany-1st-Wild-boar-case-in-Mecklenburg-Vorpommern-824014E/.

ASF has been spreading in Germany's eastern states, Brandenburg and Saxony, since September 2020. So far, over 2700 animals have been identified as infected. There have been also 3 introductions into pig farms. The spread in the wild boar population of these 2 states has been continuing at a concerning rate. On 24 Nov 2021, a total of 10 ASF-infected wild boar were determined in Brandenburg. On 25 Nov 2021, 15 animals were determined as infected in Saxony and 7 in Brandenburg, totalling 22. The said data are available in a continuously updated table on the website of Germany's national laboratory, FLI, including locations and, if available, age and gender of the positive wild boars. The said table includes also the recent information on wild boars in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, determined by FLI as infected on 26 Nov 2021. The table is available at https://tsis.fli.de/Reports/Info_SO.aspx?ts=011&guid=713dfb87-c1ae-46f6-bde2-f831de257a9a (thanks to Sabine Zentis for the link). The route of ASF introduction into the farm is under investigation. - Mod.AS]
