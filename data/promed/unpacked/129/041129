Respiratory disease found in chickens
-----------------------------------------
A respiratory disease in chickens has been found on several poultry
farms in southeastern North Carolina.
As of 11 Apr 2007, at least 57 suspected cases of infectious
laryngotracheitis, or ILT, have been found on farms in Union, Anson,
Montgomery, Randolph, Richmond, Moore, Scotland, Robeson and Bladen
counties. So far, 45 cases have been confirmed.
The disease is extremely contagious and can spread by contaminated
equipment, boots, clothing and litter. Chickens can be infected
through the respiratory tract and eyes.
The disease doesn't pose a threat to humans, said Sarah Mason,
director of poultry health programs at the N.C. Department of Agriculture.
The signs of ILT in chickens include swelling or foamy material
around eyes, labored breathing, neck extension when coughing, and
gasping, Mason said.
"We are seeing some death from it in the birds," she said. "There is
a higher morality rate than what you would expect normally."
Mason recommends isolating birds as much as possible if they show
signs of ILT. During outbreaks, farmers should not visit other people
who have birds.
"I would have a dedicated set of clothes, including shoes, just to
work in the chicken house," she added. "If you are sharing equipment
with other farmers, you need to make sure you disinfect between farms."
Small producers and non-commercial growers should avoid buying birds
at auctions and shows during outbreaks.
"If they do bring new birds to a flock, you should quarantine the
birds for at least a month before mixing them with an existing
flock," Mason said.
Small producers and noncommercial growers who suspect their birds may
have ILT can bring carcasses to one of the 5 diagnostic labs in the
state. For a fee, a pathologist will examine the bird and give
suggestions. It is important to keep the birds on ice, she said. Labs
are located in Raleigh, Rose Hill, Elkin, Monroe and Arden.

[Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), a respiratory disease caused by
a herpes virus, is a reportable disease in North Carolina.
The virus may survive for 8-10 days in fecal droppings and for over 2
months in a carcass. The disease is persistent within a flock for as
long as 2-6 weeks. Most viral respiratory diseases do not circulate
within a flock for this amount of time.
The virus affects chickens and turkeys, pheasants and wild fowl. Wild
birds may be carriers for the disease.
ILT can cause excessive illness and death in a high percentage of an
infected flock. Economic loss from the disease is from ill birds,
deaths, and decreased production in the survivors, which remain
carriers for a long time. This disease has no treatment, but it is
preventable with a vaccine.
Incubation time for the virus is about 3-5 days. Classical clinical
signs of the disease are gasping, extension of the neck forward or
upward, and coughing. There may be bloody exudates in the cough.
Difficulty swallowing, ruffled feathers with nasal and ocular
discharge may be very early clinical signs of the disease.
There are various strains of this virus, and the pathogenicity varies
according to the strain. The virus is easily and rapidly spread by
respiratory means and through close contact.
The disease does not affect people, but people may be the main
carriers for transmitting the disease between flocks if careful
bio-containment precautions are not taken. The virus is not
transmitted through eggs, so chicks are unaffected at the time of hatching.
Laboratory diagnosis is needed to accurately diagnosis the virus. The
initial clinical signs must be differentiated from Newcastle Disease
virus and bronchitis.
Vaccination is an option in controlling but not eradicating the
disease. Therefore, use of the vaccine is controversial. - Mod.TG]
