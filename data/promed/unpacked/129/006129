The bird flu is spreading to additional poultry flocks in Minnesota, according to the state Board of Animal Health. The latest outbreak of avian influenza has now affected 15 flocks in the state, up from 7 last Friday [1 Apr 2022].

The newly reported cases all are in commercial turkey flocks -- 2 in Kandiyohi County and one each in Becker, Dodge, Le Sueur and Stearns counties, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Previously, the bird flu was found in commercial flocks in Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Meeker, Morrison and Stearns counties, as well as backyard flocks in Mower and Stearns counties.

The affected flocks so far include more than 636 000 birds. Birds in affected flocks are euthanized as part of efforts to keep the virus from spreading. The outbreak is a serious threat to Minnesota's turkey industry, with nearly 700 farms that raise about 40 million birds a year. In 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus or euthanized to slow its spread.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the avian influenza strain is a low risk to the public. No human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States.

Minnesota animal health officials say the latest outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza is now affecting flocks totalling more than a million birds across the state. The latest cases reported on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] include 2 commercial poultry flocks in Morrison County and one each in Big Stone, Meeker, Stearns and Waseca counties.

In total, avian flu has now been found in 21 poultry flocks across 11 Minnesota counties -- 4 commercial flocks in Kandiyohi and Morrison counties; 3 in Stearns County; 2 in Meeker County; and one each in Becker, Big Stone, Dodge, Lac qui Parle, Le Sueur and Waseca counties -- as well as backyard flocks in Mower and Stearns counties.

Those 21 flocks add up to 1 017 568 birds, the state Board of Animal Health reported. Most of the affected operations are commercial turkey flocks. Affected flocks are euthanized to keep the virus from spreading.

The first of the state's cases in this latest outbreak was confirmed on 25 Mar 2022. Minnesota's turkey industry includes nearly 700 farms that raise about 40 million birds a year, the most of any state. An outbreak of avian flu in Minnesota in 2015 resulted in the deaths of 9 million birds.

CDC has said the latest strain of avian influenza is a low risk to the public.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture reported its 15th outbreak of bird flu this week, this time in a Hamilton County commercial turkey facility where 8000 birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and deadly disease. It's the 2nd outbreak in the north-central Iowa county. The 1st was a week ago, when a facility with 28 000 turkeys was infected.

Just a day after the Iowa Department of Agriculture announced another positive case of bird flu, Hardin County also confirmed a positive case of the virus. This brings the total of cases in the state from 15 to now 16, with a commercial turkey flock reportedly being the site of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

Officials are reminding flock owners to prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and to report sick birds or unusual deaths to the state.

Commercial and backyard HPAI detections in Iowa are as follows:
1 Mar 2022 - Pottawattamie: backyard mixed species
6 Mar 2022 - Buena Vista: commercial turkey
10 Mar 2022 - Taylor: commercial layer chickens
17 Mar 2022 - Buena Vista: commercial layer chickens
20 Mar 2022 - Warren: backyard mixed species

Highly infectious bird flu has been confirmed in the Nebraska Panhandle, authorities said on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022]. The discovery of ill birds at a farm in Scotts Bluff County is the 5th confirmed case of avian flu among domestic or agricultural flocks in Nebraska, according to the State Department of Agriculture. The 4 other outbreaks have been in the eastern half of the state: Butler, Holt and Merrick counties.

The virus was found in a mixed-species flock numbering fewer than 50 birds, according to the state. All have been euthanized and incinerated. The state agriculture department has established a 6.2 mile surveillance zone around the location, as outlined by USDA policy. This alerts poultry owners to the risk of infection and reminds them to take extra steps to protect their flocks.

Additional cases have been found among wild birds in Nebraska, including in the Lincoln and Omaha areas. The largest Nebraska outbreak has been at 2 industrial-sized poultry operations in Butler County, where a total of 970 000 birds have been euthanized and are in the process of being composted, according to the state. The virus isn't harmful to humans and isn't as deadly among wild birds as it is among domestic birds.

[6] Montana (Cascade and Judith Basin counties): backyard flocks

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2 flocks in Montana -- a noncommercial, backyard flock (poultry) in Cascade County, and a noncommercial, backyard flock (non-poultry) in Judith Basin County.

Samples from the flocks were tested at the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in the state on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.

According to CDC, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to [ensure] the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://bit.ly/3JvdhKx.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://bit.ly/3v8DedZ.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high) -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

[In an article from Ontario, Canada, the comment was made regarding everything we do is to protect our birds. This is absolutely correct. Every thing you do related to your birds matters. Every step, every action must be deliberate with security for your birds foremost in your mind.

This virus is wreaking disaster on every aspect of the avian industry. It has touched the commercial producers as well as the backyard grower and the hobbyist with only a few birds. If you have birds as pets, be aware because this virus does not discriminate; bring your pets inside and do not visit anyone having pet or commercial birds.

Biosecurity is the watchword of every hobbyist, backyard producer, and commercial producer. This serious virus should cause all of us to think, breathe and act with the safety of our birds and others' birds uppermost in our minds and actions. - Mod.TG
