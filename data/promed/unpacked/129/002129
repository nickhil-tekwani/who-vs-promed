The South Korean Embassy in Egypt issued a travel warning on Tuesday [21 Feb
2006] for the African nation after a series of reports came out on the spread
of avian influenza throughout the country. More than 50 000 South Koreans
travel to Egypt each year, according to official data.
Quoting the Egyptian government's announcement, officials at the embassy said
that the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus was increasingly prevalent in Cairo and
some other popular tourist areas, including Luxor. The Egyptian government has
already decided to shut down 8 state-run zoos for 2 weeks in an attempt to
counter the pandemic, they added.
The bird flu virus stems from such poultry as chickens, ducks, turkeys and
geese, and usually does not infect humans. No human infection has yet been
reported in Egypt.
The South Korean Embassy in Cairo advised travelers to avoid contact with
those poultry and immediately go to the hospital if they experience symptoms
such as fever, cough and respiratory problems.

In India, where officials are scrambling to contain a major outbreak in
poultry, hundreds of people turned up for screening at medical camps in areas
where bird flu has been reported. The World Health Organization said that
while no human cases of bird flu had been found in India, Egypt or Nigeria --
countries where H5N1 has been found in birds [poultry] -- transmission risks
remain as long as the virus is present. "There is really no time frame. As
long as the virus is circulating it could jump into humans," WHO spokesman
Dick Thompson told a press briefing in Geneva.
In India, 10 people have been quarantined as officials scrambled to contain a
major outbreak of bird flu in poultry before it took hold in the world's
second most populous nation. So far, there are no confirmed human cases but
thousands of people have been tested just in case. "About 500 people have
walked into makeshift medical camps in the town of Navapur [Navapur city,
State of Maharashtra, lat. 21.80 N; long. 73.47 E] in Maharashtra state to get
checked for cough and cold since Monday evening," said T.P. Doke, the state
health director. Doke said [healthcare] authorities had completed a door-to-
door search in Navapur where 30 000 people had been examined. Another
Maharashtra state official said about 300 000 birds have been culled so far
with tens of thousands more to be killed.

[No new human case has been reported from any country. Also there has been no
confirmation of direct transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus from wild
birds to humans anywhere in the outbreak areas or beyond. The screening [in
Imdia] appears to be based to a large extent on symptomatology and may be
intended to reassure the population rather than to locate human cases. -
