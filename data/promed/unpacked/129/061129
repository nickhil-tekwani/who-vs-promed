Influenza -- update 113
-----------------------
Situation update
----------------
Influenza H1N1 (2009) virus transmission remains locally intense in parts
of India and New Zealand.

In India, the number of new H1N1 (2009) cases per week, including fatal
cases, has continued to increase since mid June 2010 in several states,
particularly in the western state of Maharashtra and to a lesser extent in
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. The current epidemic of influenza
H1N1 (2009) does not appear to have peaked yet in these states. Overall, 79
new laboratory confirmed H1N1 (2009) associated deaths were officially
reported across India during the week of 2-8 Aug 2010. During the last 2
weeks of July 2010, more than one third of respiratory specimens tested
positive for influenza virus in the state of Maharashtra, all of which were
H1N1 (2009). In the southern Indian state of Kerala, where recent influenza
activity in India was first detected, transmission of H1N1 (2009) virus
appears to have peaked during late June and early July 2010 and has
declined substantially since. Seasonal influenza B viruses are also known
to be currently circulating in India, although at lower levels than H1N1
(2009) viruses.

In New Zealand, the national consultation rate for ILI [influenza-like
illness] continued to increase, particularly in recent weeks, passing the
seasonal baseline during the last week of July 2010. The majority of
influenza viruses detected during the current winter epidemic have been
H1N1 (2009). Influenza activity (as indicated by rates of ILI,
hospitalizations, and absenteeism) has been geographically uneven but
focally intense in some areas, particularly those areas that experienced
milder epidemics during the previous winter 2009 pandemic wave. Nationally,
overall rates of ILI and numbers of severe and fatal cases remain well
below levels seen during the winter 2009 pandemic wave, however, the
situation continues to evolve and the current epidemic has yet to peak.

Except in South Africa and New Zealand, overall influenza activity and
rates of respiratory diseases remained low in other countries of the
temperate southern hemisphere (Australia, Chile, and Argentina). In South
Africa, active circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses
was observed during June and July 2010.

Influenza H1N1 (2009) continued to circulate at low to moderate levels over
the past month in the tropics of the Americas (Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia, Brazil), West Africa (Ghana), and South and Southeast Asia (India,
Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia).

Variable circulation of seasonal influenza viruses continues to be detected
in all regions of the world. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have recently
circulated in the tropics of the Americas (particularly in several Central
American countries), in southern and western Africa, and in parts of
Southeast Asia. The most active areas of influenza type B virus circulation
continue to be in parts of central and southern Africa.

Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of
Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical
regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes.

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health care
services. The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators
reported. Information is available for about 60 countries each week.
Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of
reporting is expected to increase over time.
