Equine influenza in vaccinated horses - UK
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of equine influenza has been confirmed on a thoroughbred racing
yard in Newmarket, Suffolk, England. The first clinical signs were observed
in a single horse on 7 Mar 2003. Subsequently, signs of coughing and nasal
discharge have spread rapidly through all horses on the yard (70 to 80
residents in total). Only 2 have been reported with pyrexia of 102F
(38.9C). All horses are fully vaccinated against influenza with a vaccine
containing representatives of both American-like and European-like strains
of equine influenza, according to Office International des Epizooties
recommendations. All had received an annual booster dose in November 2002.
Acute sera and nasopharyngeal swabs have been taken from the majority of
horses on the premises and 8 swabs were positive in the rapid influenza
nucleoprotein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay test. So far 5 isolates
have been obtained and investigations at the Animal Health Trust
laboratories are continuing. Further information on characterisation of the
virus will be posted as it becomes available.

[Obviously the alarming news, for which we thank Jackie Cardwell, is the
recording of clinical disease, apparently diagnosed as equine influenza, in
properly vaccinated horses. Details on the virus strains included in the
applied vaccines, and the characterisation of the causative virus strain,
are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
