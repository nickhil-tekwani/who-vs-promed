Senator died of bird flu
------------------------
BULAWAYO: The woman mainstream MDC-T [Movement for Democratic Change
– Tsvangirai] senator for Mabutweni has died of bird flu, a family
spokesperson told journalists at her house in Mpopoma high density
suburb [of Bulawayo] on Wednesday [28 Dec 2011]. A family spokesperson
Samuel Gombami who is brother to the senator's husband said that
postmortem results released on Tuesday in Harare shows that she died
of bird flu.

“We were finally given postmortem results and they show that she was
taken away by bird flu. We still can’t believe this as a family, we
are in still shock,” said a relative. Bird flu also known as avian
influenza is a contagious disease of birds, caused by avian influenza
(A) virus. The outbreak of avian influenza of most concern began in
poultry in South Korea in mid-December 2003. The Mabutweni senator was
buried at Lady Stanley Cemetery in Bulawayo. Prime Minister Morgan
Tsvangirai and dozens of MPs and senators attended the funeral.The
48-year-old senator died after complaining of disorientation and
dizziness while travelling home to Bulawayo from a funeral in Gokwe on
Boxing Day. She was rushed to a hospital in Kadoma where she died.

[This report was also relayed to ProMED-mail by Nati Elkin
<nati@poultrymed.com> whose assistance is welcomed. Confirmation of
the initial diagnosis of avian influenza is awaited. The description
of the victim's condition on admission to hospital is not sufficiently
specific to confirm the dignosis of influenza virus infection on
symptoms alone. Laboratory confirmation that the death of the patient
was the result of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection is
necessary.

Likewise information on the prevalence of avian influenza virus in
wild birds or poultry in the Bulawayo area is lacking, as is
iformation on the extent of the victim's possible contact with
diseased birds. Zimbabwe is not among the 15 countries that have
reported human cases of avian A (H5N1) influenza virus infection in
the past.
