Land O'Lakes recalls 2 percent milk in 8 states
Single-serve cartons of Land O'Lakes 2 percent milk have been recalled
in eight states. Ten-ounce cartons of the milk dated Feb. 10 and Feb. 11
were recalled in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana, said Kohler Mix Specialties Inc., a
subsidy of Michael Foods Inc. Officials suspect contamination. The
company on Tuesday said the milk could be contaminated with Listeria
monocytogenes bacteria, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal
infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with
weakened immune systems.
Kohler spokesman Mark Witmer said fewer than 1000 cases were affected.
Each case holds 24 cartons. The plant code of PLT 27-416 is printed on
the top seal of the carton. There were no reports of serious illness as
a result of the possible contamination, the company said. Consumers are
advised not to drink the milk and to return it instead for a refund.
They may call Kohler Mix at 800-248-3447 or Land O'Lakes at 800-328-4155
for further information.
