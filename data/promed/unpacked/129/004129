Up to 21 Nov 2015, 739 suspected cases of microcephaly were reported, identified in 160 municipalities in 9 states of Brazil, according to the 2nd edition of the epidemiological report on microcephaly, released on [Tue 24 Nov 2015]. The government continues to make every effort to monitor and investigate the increasing number of cases of microcephaly in the country as a priority.

Pernambuco state remains with the highest number of cases (487); it was the first to identify an increase of microcephaly in its area and has had the collaboration of a Ministry of Health team since [22 Oct 2015]. Next are the states of Paraiba (96), Sergipe (54), Rio Grande do Norte (47), Piaui (27), Alagoas (10), Ceara (9), Bahia (8) and Goias (1). Among the total cases, a suspicious death was reported in the state of Rio Grande do North. This case is under investigation to determine the cause of death.

Case investigations are being done by the Ministry of Health, integrated with the state and municipal secretariats, and with the help of national and international institutions. Committees of specialists are supported by the Ministry of Health in epidemiological and laboratory analysis, as well as case monitoring.

Since the cases appeared, the Ministry of Health sent to the state secretariats orientation for the process of notification, surveillance, and assistance for pregnant women and their babies affected with microcephaly. This information is constantly updated.

It is not yet possible to ascertain the cause of the increase in cases of microcephaly that has been recorded in 9 states. All hypotheses are being thoroughly analyzed by the Ministry of Health and any conclusion at this point is premature. Analyses were not completed and, therefore, are still ongoing.

The Flavivirus Laboratory of the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro participates in the investigations and concluded on [17 Nov 2015] a diagnostic test established the presence of the Zika virus genome in samples from 2 pregnant women from Paraiba, whose fetuses had microcephaly confirmed by ultrasound examination. The genetic material (RNA) of the virus was detected in samples from amniotic fluid, using real-time RT-PCR.

Despite being an important scientific finding for understanding of Zika virus infection in humans, the current data do not allow one to correlate unequivocally, infection by Zika virus as a causal factor of microcephaly. Such an explanation will be made by studies coordinated by the Ministry and other institutions involved in research into the causes of microcephaly in the country.

For managers and health professionals, the Ministry of Health directs that all cases of microcephaly be communicated immediately, electronically. Also, that prevention efforts be strengthened and that vector control in urban and peri-urban areas, conform to the Guidelines of the National Dengue Control Program.

It is important that pregnant women maintain monitoring and prenatal medical consultations, with the completion of all tests recommended by their doctors. The Ministry of Health reinforces the guidance to not consume alcohol or any other type of drugs, not use drugs without medical prescription, and avoid contact with people with fever or infections.

It is important, also, that pregnant women adopt measures to reduce the presence of mosquitoes that transmit pathogens, by the elimination of breeding sites and to protect themselves from exposure to mosquitoes, such as keeping doors and windows closed or screened, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts, and use [mosquito] repellants that are approved for use by pregnant women.

Microcephaly is not a new problem. It is a congenital malformation in which the brain does not develop properly. In the current situation, the investigation of the cause has the health authorities worried. In this case, babies are born with head circumference (PC) lower than normal, which is usually greater than 33 cm [13 in]. This defect can be a congenital effect of a number of factors from different sources, such as chemicals, biological (infectious) agents such as bacteria, viruses, and radiation.

Cases of microcephaly under investigation [state / number of cases]:
Pernambuco / 487
Paraiba / 96
Sergipe / 54
Rio Grande do Norte / 47
Piaui / 27
Alagoas / 10
Ceara / 9
Bahia / 8
Goias / 1

[Concerning the data, now updated, of microcephaly in Brazil: indeed, there was a significant increase in the number of cases -- 399 cases up to 17 Nov 2015 to 739 on 24 Nov 2015. There is still little information available or reported on the results of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory investigations conducted to date. Reportedly, albeit in general terms, the most common causes of congenital infections are toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, as well as environmental causes, etc., that apparently already have been (or are being) investigated. Early on, there are no findings or conclusive results.

The identification of the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of 2 pregnant women who showed clinical signs compatible with those expected/described for symptomatic infection with Zika virus, and whose fetuses showed signs of microcephaly in prenatal exams, points to the ability of the virus to cross the placental barrier. That is, one of the conditions for fetal infection to occur has been demonstrated. However, although it is a quite significant finding, it is subject to corroboration for the possible elucidation of the (or a few) cases of microcephaly in the northeast region; the results are still not definitive, that is, a causal relationship has not yet been (and can not) be definitively proven.

What now? There is a temporal association between increased incidence of microcephaly and the length and geographic distribution of transmission (and the exposure of pregnant women) to Zika [virus] in the northeast states. A large proportion of mothers whose newborns now have microcephaly at birth, mentioned a clinical presentation during pregnancy that would be compatible with infection (symptomatic) caused by Zika [virus]. Identification of the genome of Zika [virus in] amniotic fluid indicates that the virus is capable of crossing the placental barrier. In short, evidence adds up to, but does not establish for now, a causal relationship.

The surveillance system is on alert. Clinical and epidemiological investigations must (or should) be conducted. The research protocol proposed by the Ministry of Health (see http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2015/novembro/18/microcefalia-nota-informativa-17nov2015-c.pdf; in Portuguese) contribute to standardization and uniformity of definition of criteria and prospective investigation of upcoming cases. But until final and conclusive results are obtained, all caution should be taken in order to prevent alarmism, panic, or extreme measures.

ProMED-PORT takes the opportunity to thank Dr Ricardo Albernaz <ricmanga@gmail.com> for his submitted comments that are in line with comments previously stated in the current and previous post, and that point to "the self-evident severity of the event," to the fact that the data available [still] do not prove a causal relationship between microcephaly and Zika [virus infections], to the lack of "detailed information on the cases, and to the need for appropriate strategies for research and health risk communication from the public agencies. - Mod.RNA

Establishing a causal relationship between Zika virus infections during gestation and microcephaly will not be easy. If there is retrospective study to determine what proportion of the mothers of microcephalic infants have antibodies to Zika virus, ProMED-mail would be interested in the results.

Prospective studies, as mentioned above, have a greater possibility of establishing the Zika virus-microcephaly link. If Zika virus continues to spread in in Brazil, there may be a sufficiently large pool of cases for a significant study. Now that there is a Zika virus outbreak going on in Colombia, it would be prudent for physicians there to watch for an increase in microcephaly cases in infected pregnant women. Ideally, there should be close communication and collaboration between the public health authorities in both countries to employ standardized approaches to obtain comparable results.
