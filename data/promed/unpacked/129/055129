Reality is not as that described. That the genetics of the Justinian plague were different from the Black Death proves nothing, except that more than one plague strain has the power to provoke -- under the right circumstances -- a pandemic. Nothing new in that. Plague with pandemic potential has been out there in Central Asia for centuries. There were 3 separate huge outbreaks of pneumonic plague in Manchuria in the early 20th century, which killed a total of 85 000 people. But a worldwide pandemic never broke out, even without antibiotics, because the intelligent doctors who rushed into Manchuria imposed ultimately successful quarantines. Otherwise, at least one of those outbreaks could have reached Peking [Beijing], and that could have been nasty indeed, though a worldwide pandemic on the scale of the Black Death still would have been most unlikely. As the great plague doctor Wu Lien-teh said, no disease is so susceptible to quarantine as plague. And he was speaking of the worst form of plague, pneumonic plague.

The Justinian plague, unlike the Black Death, was probably never very communicable -- there is no evidence of contagion from any of the primary sources. The Prophet Muhammad, who witnessed later stages of the pandemic, noted its random pattern -- that plague appeared to strike out of nowhere -- and concluded that the disease was God's gift. During the Black Death, Muslim physicians who witnessed contagion and insisted the disease spread through contact got into serious trouble for contradicting the Prophet. But they were observing a different disease pattern altogether than the one Muhammad saw. The Justinian plague seems to have rat- and rat-flea-borne bubonic plague, which was fostered by the immense storehouses of grain erected by Emperor Justinian, and by the grain trade across the Mediterranean from the great grain-growing regions of North Africa, from where it 1st burst into humanity. The Central Asian origins of the Justinian plague remain quite likely -- though there is nothing new in this observation: to gerbils and grass rats, Asia and Africa are one long habitat. The Justinian plague was most parallel to the plague outbreak in India in the early 20th century, which followed the same pattern: random "strikes" not shared in households, and no evidence of contagion. This is what the late plague expert Robert Pollitzer called "zoonotic plague" as opposed to the "demic" plague of the Black Death and the Manchurian outbreaks, which is human-to-human borne.

Anyone studying the Justinian plague and the Black Death would have realized that, given the pattern of transmission alone, these were very different outbreaks, and therefore had to be very different genetically. Proving this tells us nothing, since the researchers cannot possibly pinpoint which genetic changes signal human-to human transmission.

The most important point is that social conditions on earth have changed so dramatically that it is impossible to imagine, except in the case of a bioterrorist using the right plague strain with the genetic potential to transmit immediately lung-to-lung (and good luck with that -- the Soviets knew how to identify those strains, but at this point the likelihood of a bioterrorist repeating their discoveries seems vanishingly small) and then adding in antibiotic resistance. But that sort of plague outbreak could be handled with quarantine.

A natural Black Death? Seriously -- does anybody believe this? People would be immediately isolated and treated with antibiotics, as happens in Central Asia all the time. It's also important to remember that the Black Death wasn't just pneumonic, it was bubonic also. And this wouldn't be the rat-rat-flea pattern seen in the Justinian Plague. This was "demic" bubonic plague, spread by the so-called human flea, _Pulex irritans_. Both those conditions, uncontrolled pneumonic plague and human-to-human flea-borne transmission via _P. irritans_, were necessary to produce the Black Death. So was ignorance, and filth, and the updated Mongolian Silk Road, which provided rapid transportation out of Central Asia.

Another Black Death? Most unlikely.

Oh, and by the way, the Athenian plague (as even a cursory look at Thucydides would reveal) was not, and could not have been, the plague; that outbreak -- complete with secondary outbreaks of Brill-Zinsser's -- disease was almost certainly typhus. And the Antonine plague -- probably smallpox or measles -- wasn't caused by _Yersinia pestis_ either.

_Y. pestis_ is still out there in rodents, as it has been for millennia. I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the prevailing epidemiology was that the Mongol hoards brought the plague with them, the famine that stimulated the Mongol migration west having driven together the various grain-hungry vectors required for a pandemic of _Yersinia pestis_. This point of view was partly driven by anti-Chinese politics of the time.

Toward the end of the 20th century, there was some thought that the Romans imported the plague accidentally into the Mediterranean area by their incessant exploration of central Africa looking for ivory. The deeper into the forest the searches penetrated, the more they were exposed to the wild rodent vector of the bacillus, thus allowing the ship-board rats to acquire the fleas of the rodents of the deep forest. Due to the habit of burying at sea crew or passengers that died in transit, it took a while for human cases to manifest in Roman cities. If this scenario is true, it is probable that the Mongols took the plague BACK to the Far East, thus introducing it to a naive population.

That the Justinian strain and the Hong Kong strain are so significantly different may be an example of isolation of a population and allowing it to diverge by rapid expansion into a new niche.
