Mice have invaded thousands of homes and businesses and may have a
bacterial disease causing flu-like symptoms in humans, Florida state health
officials said Tuesday. Tests show mice in northwest Orange County may have
leptospirosis, a bacterial disease commonly associated with animals in
tropical areas.
Further testing is needed to determine what type of leptospirosis the mice
are carrying and whether the bacteria could make humans ill.

No human cases of leptospirosis have been found in Florida this year, said
Bill Bigler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health.
An average of 1 case is reported each year in the state. Symptoms include
fever, neck ache, chills and fatigue and typically appear 4 to 19 days
after exposure. The disease can only be detected with a blood test and is
treated with antibiotics.
People become infected with the disease through direct contact with water
or moist soil contaminated with urine from infected animals. It generally
isn't transmitted person-to-person, Bigler said.
