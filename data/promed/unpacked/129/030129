3 children at Bronx day care center infected with _E. coli_
-----------------------------------------------------------
3 young children who attend the same day care center in the Bronx have been
infected with the _Escherichia coli_ bacterium, city health officials said
yesterday, 1 Jul 2004. They are investigating whether as many as 18 other
children at the day care center are also infected. 2 of the infections,
which occurred at the "For Kids Only" day care center, were first reported
to city officials by physicians at a Bronx hospital last Fri, 25 Jun 2004,
said Dr Don Weiss, the director of surveillance for the Bureau of
Communicable Diseases, which is part of the City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene. Another case was reported on Mon, 28 Jun 2004.
The children range in age from 7 months to 3 years old, Dr Weiss said. A
4th child, who does not attend For Kids Only, has also been infected, Dr
Weiss said, and may have had contact with children who do attend the
center. All 4 children were initially hospitalized, but only 1 remains in
the hospital, in stable condition, Dr Weiss said. The exact cause of the
outbreak has yet to be determined.
As soon as city officials learned of the outbreak, they sent a medical
team, including an epidemiologist, to the day care center. They then called
the families of all the children who attend the center regularly to see
whether they had developed symptoms of infection. The families of 18
children reported possible symptoms. The owners of For Kids Only are
cooperating with the investigation and have voluntarily closed its doors,
Dr Weiss said.
Some levels of _E. coli_ bacteria are normally found in the intestines of
humans and animals. Although most strains are harmless, the strain found in
the children, known as _E. coli_ 0157:H7, can cause a diarrheal illness
that sometimes leads to kidney damage and severe illness. The spread of
infection is usually caused by poor sanitary practices like inadequate
handwashing after the handling of diapers and the unsafe preparation of
food. Dr Weiss said that the day care center has no cafeteria and serves
food that the children bring from home.
As many as 180 children, from 6 months to 5 years old, regularly attend the
center, Dr Weiss said. He also said that outbreaks of _E. coli_ at day care
centers occur every now and then around the country but none had occurred
in New York City in recent memory.
