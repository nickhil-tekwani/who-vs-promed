Cassava farmers in Nebbi District are counting losses after a strange disease destroyed their plantations. The district production officer said the cassava could have been attacked by both brown streak and soft root diseases, with about 40 percent of 647 registered farmers affected.

The farmers were mobilised in 2018 to plant Nasse-19, a cassava variety which matures in [approximately 18 months], with the aim of supplying factories. But the project has been beset by a number of challenges. The farmers say the disease attacks the tubers, making them turn yellow as they rot before maturity.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), cassava brown streak causes loss of root (tuber) production and quality. The disease is spread through planting of stem cuttings from infected plants. Soft rot is caused by pathogens that destroy the texture of plant tissue making [it] soft and watery.

[Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD; also called root rot) can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) and _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ (UCBSV; both genus _Ipomovirus_). The viruses are spread by whiteflies and infected tubers. CBSD is considered a threat to sub-Saharan Africa, especially to new crop varieties developed with resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSD). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally. For more information, see ProMED-mail post 20190214.6315604 and others in the archives.

Several fungal species are known to cause root rots in cassava, alone, or in coinfections (see links below). Furthermore, a range of soil borne fungi, bacteria, and nematodes can cause soft and/or root rots in many crops.

It is not clear why a combination of CBSD and additional root rot pathogens is suggested above. Reliable diagnosis of any and all potential pathogens present will be crucial for devising management strategies.
