[The location of the outbreak can be seen at the WAHID OIE report
site referenced above, but it is instructive to view an
administrative map of the country at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>
It shows that all 4 administrative divisions in the western half of
the country are affected. This report only contains information on
the 1st outbreak at Batken, while information is still lacking on the
outbreaks at Chui, Talas, and Osh and will presumably follow in
updates.
The virus is serotype A, while in the 2006 outbreak it was FMD
serotype O, and in 2004 serotype Asia 1. The reported prevalence rate
is worth highlighting as there are only 17 cases out of almost a half
million cattle. Despite the fact that FMD appears to have been
identified in Kyrgyzstan every year or every 2 years for almost a
decade and vaccination is permitted, this is an incredibly low attack
rate for an outbreak of FMD. It will be most interesting to see if
this is indeed a typographical error or if the prevalence rates in
the remaining 3 administrative divisions mirror those reported here.
It would be useful to understand how the denominator of animals at
risk is thought to be over 440 000 cattle and yet, there are so few
infections of an apparently new strain of FMD virus. One can easily
understand the lack of mortality reported here but FMD spreads
quickly and efficiently, usually resulting in fairly high prevalence
rates while a new virus shows up on the screen.
Currently, there are several countries in the region affected by FMD
and the spread and source of introduction may be regional in nature.
