While it was from a non-technical source, the article from the Asia Times [https://asiatimes.com/2022/05/indonesias-cattle-under-threat-from-two-diseases/?] had a piece of information that was not correct. Regarding the outbreak of FMD that commenced in the Philippines in 1994, the FMD virus involved was the type O Cathay strain or the pig-adapted strain that did not transmit in large ruminants. This virus was not in buffalo in India at this time (the source of frozen meat from India), but widespread in pigs in East Asia, especially China. The origin of the outbreak was most probably from feeding pig meat swill of East Asian origin.

[Dr Gleeson's correction is much appreciated. It refers to the following piece of information on FMD in the Philippines, presented in the Asia Times article dated 19 May 2022:

"Pork leftovers from airline meals fed to pigs has been widely blamed for the outbreak in Britain, while in the Philippines, frozen meat from India -- where FMD is also endemic -- was suspected of allowing the disease into the island of Luzon in the mid-1990s."

The introduction of the pig-adapted FMDV-O to Luzon, the Philippines, in 1994 was reviewed in the following OIE publication:

Gleeson L J. A review of the status of foot-and-mouth disease in South-East Asia and approaches to control and eradication. Rev Sci Tech Off int Epiz. 2002; 21(3): 465-475; https://doc.oie.int/dyn/portal/digidoc.xhtml?statelessToken=1TyfIfDmZK_QGsAevyCVgg-IrsWqZxjFGJpw-9XUvBM=&actionMethod=dyn%2Fportal%2Fdigidoc.xhtml%3AdownloadAttachment.openStateless.

The paper also addressed Indonesia's key position in the prevention of the spread of FMD to Australasia and Oceania. - Mod.AS
