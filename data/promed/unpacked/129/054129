Update: influenza activity -- United States and worldwide, 2006/2007
season, and composition of the 2007/2008 influenza vaccine
-------------------------------
During the 2006/2007 season, influenza activity peaked in mid-February in
the United States and was associated with less mortality and lower rates of
pediatric hospitalizations than during the previous 3 seasons. In the US,
influenza A (H1) viruses predominated overall, but influenza A (H3) viruses
were isolated more frequently than influenza A (H1) viruses late in the
season. Although influenza A (H1), A (H3), and B viruses co-circulated
worldwide, influenza A (H3) viruses were the most commonly reported type in
Europe and Asia. Sporadic cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infections associated with severe illness or death were reported among
humans in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Laos, Nigeria, and Viet Nam.
This report summarizes influenza activity in the US and worldwide during
the 2006/2007 influenza season (1 Oct 2006 to 19 May 2007) and describes
the composition of the 2007/08 influenza vaccine.
United States
-------------
The national percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for
influenza and the proportion of outpatient visits to sentinel providers for
influenza-like illness (ILI)* peaked in mid-February [2007]. Although
influenza A (H1) viruses were most commonly isolated overall, influenza A
(H3) viruses were more frequently identified than influenza A (H1) viruses
from early March [2007] through May [2007]. A small number of influenza B
viruses also were identified.
Viral surveillance
------------------
During the period 1 Oct 2006 to 10 May 2007, World Health Organization
(WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 179 268
respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 23 753 (13 per cent) were
positive. Of these, 18 817 (79 per cent) were influenza A viruses and 4936
(21 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Among the influenza A viruses, 6280
(33 per cent) were subtyped; 3912 (62 per cent) were influenza A (H1)
viruses and 2368 (38 per cent) were influenza A (H3) viruses. The
proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza first exceeded 10
per cent during the week ending 23 Dec 2006 (week 51), peaked at 28 per
cent during the week ending 10 Feb 2007 (week 6), and declined to less than
10 per cent during the week ending 28 Apr 2007 (week 17). The proportion
was above 10 per cent positive for 14 consecutive weeks. The peak
percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza during the previous
3 seasons ranged from 23 per cent to 35 per cent, and the peak occurred
during early December [2006] to early March [2007] (1.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a3.htm>; CDC, unpublished
data, 2007). During the previous 3 influenza seasons, the number of
consecutive weeks during which more than 10 per cent of specimens tested
positive for influenza ranged from 13 to 17 weeks (1.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a3.htm>1; CDC, unpublished
data, 2007).
Composition of the influenza vaccine for the 2007/2008 season
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee recommended that the 2007/2008 trivalent
influenza vaccine for the US contain A/Solomon Islands/3/2006-like (H1N1),
A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like viruses.
This represents a change only in the influenza A (H1N1) component.
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 is a recent antigenic variant of the 2006/2007
vaccine strain A/New Caledonia/20/99. The influenza A (H3N2) and influenza
B components remain the same. These recommendations were based on antigenic
analyses of recently isolated influenza viruses, epidemiologic data,
post-vaccination serologic studies in humans, and the availability of
candidate vaccine strains and reagents.
Antigenic characterization
--------------------------
Since 1 Oct 2006, CDC has antigenically characterized 1107 influenza
viruses collected by US laboratories: 486 influenza A (H1) viruses, 289
influenza A (H3) viruses, and 332 influenza B viruses. Of the 486 influenza
A (H1) viruses, 439 (90 per cent) were characterized as similar to A/New
Caledonia/20/99, the influenza A (H1N1) component recommended for the
2006/2007 influenza vaccine. 45 (9 per cent) viruses showed reduced titers
with antisera produced against A/New Caledonia/20/99 and are similar to
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, which is a recent antigenic variant of A/New
Caledonia/20/99 and is the influenza A (H1N1) component recommended for the
2007/08 influenza vaccine. 2 influenza A (H1) viruses showed reduced titers
with antisera produced against both A/New Caledonia/20/99 and A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006. Of the 289 influenza A (H3) viruses, 69 (24 per cent) were
characterized as similar to A/Wisconsin/67/2005, the H3N2 component
recommended for the 2007/2008 vaccine, and 220 (76 per cent) of the 289
viruses showed reduced titers with antisera produced against
A/Wisconsin/67/2005. Influenza B viruses currently circulating can be
divided into 2 antigenically distinct lineages represented by
B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/02/87 viruses. A total of 254 (77 per cent)
of the 332 influenza B viruses that have been characterized belong to the
B/Victoria lineage: 128 (50 per cent) were similar to B/Ohio/01/2005, and
126 (50 per cent) showed reduced titers with antisera produced against
B/Ohio/01/2005. B/Ohio/01/2005 is antigenically equivalent to
B/Malaysia/2506/2004, the recommended influenza B component for the
2007/2008 influenza vaccine. 78 (23 per cent) of the 332 influenza B
viruses were identified as belonging to the B/Yamagata lineage.
Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance
-----------------------------------------
The weekly percentage of patient visits to US sentinel providers for ILI
exceeded or was at baseline levels (2.1 per cent) during the weeks ending
16 Dec 2006 and 24 Mar 2007 (weeks 50-12) and peaked twice, once at 3 per
cent for the week ending 30 Dec 2006 (week 52), and again at 3.5 per cent
for the week ending 17 Feb 2007 (week 7). The increase in the percentage of
patient visits for ILI during the week ending 30 Dec 2006 (week 52) might
have been influenced by a reduction in routine health care visits during
the holiday season, as has occurred in previous seasons. During the
previous 3 influenza seasons, the peak percentage of patient visits for ILI
has ranged from 3.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent and the peak occurred during
late December to mid-February (1.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a3.htm>; CDC, unpublished
data, 2007).
State-specific activity levels
------------------------------
State and territorial epidemiologists report the geographic distribution of
influenza in their state through a weekly influenza activity code. The
geographic distribution of influenza activity peaked during the week ending
24 Feb 2007 (week 8), when 25 states reported widespread activity and 19
states reported regional activity. 41 states reported widespread influenza
activity at least once during the 2006/2007 season. No states reported
widespread influenza activity during the weeks ending 21 Apr to 19 May 2007
(weeks 16-20). The peak number of states reporting widespread or regional
activity during the previous 3 seasons ranged from 41 to 50 states (1.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a3.htm>; CDC, unpublished
data, 2007).
Influenza-associated pediatric hospitalization
----------------------------------------------
Pediatric hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza
infections are monitored in 2 population-based surveillance networks: the
Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the New Vaccine Surveillance Network
(NVSN). During the period 1 Oct 2006 to 28 Apr 2007, the preliminary
influenza-associated hospitalization rate reported by EIP for children aged
0-17 years was 0.81 per 10 000. For children aged 0-4 years and 5-17 years,
the rates were 1.62 per 10 000 and 0.23 per 10 000, respectively. During 5
Nov 2006-26 May 2007, the preliminary laboratory-confirmed
influenza-associated hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 years in
NVSN was 3.46 per 10 000. EIP hospitalization data collection ended on 28
Apr 2007, whereas NVSN hospitalization data collection ended on 26 May
2007. Rate estimates are preliminary and might continue to change as data
are finalized.
In years 2000/2006, the end-of-season hospitalization rate for NVSN ranged
from 3.7 (2002/2003) to 12 (2003/2004) per 10 000 children aged 0-4 years.
During the 2004/2005 influenza season, the end-of-season hospitalization
rate for EIP was 3.3 per 10 000 children aged 0-4 years and 0.6 per 10 000
children aged 5-17 years; during the 2005/2006 season, the rates were 2.8
and 0.4, respectively. Differences in rate estimates between the NVSN and
the EIP systems likely result from different case-finding methods, the
diagnostic tests used, and the populations monitored.
Pneumonia- and influenza-related mortality
------------------------------------------
During the 2006/2007 influenza season, the percentage of deaths attributed
to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) did not exceed the epidemic threshold** in
the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System. The percentage of P&I deaths
peaked 3 times, once at 7.5 per cent during the week ending 20 Jan 2007
(week 3), once at 7.7 per cent during the week ending 24 Feb 2007 (week 8),
and again at 7.5 per cent during the week ending 24 Mar 2007 (week 12).
During the previous 3 influenza seasons, the peak percentage of P&I deaths
ranged from 7.8 per cent to 10.4 per cent, and the total number of weeks
above the epidemic threshold ranged from one to 16 (1.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a3.htm>; CDC, unpublished
data, 2007).
Influenza-associated pediatric mortality
----------------------------------------
As of 6 Aug 2007, among persons aged less than 18 years, a total of 68
deaths associated with influenza infection occurring during the period 1
Oct 2006 to 19 May 2007, were reported to CDC. These deaths were reported
from 26 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana,
Minnesota, North Carolina, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and
Wisconsin). All patients had laboratory-confirmed influenza virus
infection. Age-specific information was available for all 68 persons; 10
were aged less than 6 months, 10 were aged 6-23 months, 9 were aged 2-4
years, and 39 were aged 5-17 years. Of the 63 patients for whom influenza
virus type was known, 47 (75 per cent) had influenza A and 16 (25 per cent)
had influenza B viruses. Of the 53 patients aged less than 6 months for
whom vaccination status was known, 50 (94 per cent) had not been vaccinated
against influenza. These data are provisional.
Worldwide
---------
During the 2006/2007 influenza season, influenza A (H1), A (H3), and B
viruses co-circulated worldwide. In Africa, small numbers of influenza A
and B viruses were reported. In Europe and Asia, influenza A (H3) viruses
were identified most frequently, but influenza A (H1) viruses circulated at
low levels. Influenza B viruses circulated at lower levels overall in Asia
and Europe but predominated in some countries.
Human infections with avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses
------------------------------------------------------
From 1 Dec 2003 through 25 Jul 2007, a total of 319 human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) infection were reported to WHO (2). Of these, 192 (60
per cent) were fatal. All cases were reported from Asia (Azerbaijan,
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Thailand, Turkey, and Viet Nam) and
Africa (Djibouti, Egypt, and Nigeria). To date, no human case of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection has been identified in the United States.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
During the 2006/2007 influenza season, influenza activity in the US peaked
in mid-February [2007], and the percentage of deaths resulting from
pneumonia and influenza remained below baseline levels for the entire
influenza season. In the US, influenza A (H1) viruses predominated during
most of the season, but influenza A (H3) viruses were more frequently
identified than influenza A (H1) viruses since early March [2007].
Worldwide, influenza A (H3) viruses predominated in many European and Asian
countries.
In the US, the majority of influenza A (H1) viruses were characterized as
A/New Caledonia/20/99, the recommended influenza A (H1N1) component of the
2006/07 influenza vaccine. 50 per cent of the influenza B viruses
characterized as belonging to the B/Victoria lineage were further
characterized as B/Ohio/01/2005, the antigenic equivalent of
B/Malaysia/2506/2004, the recommended influenza B component for the
2006/2007 influenza vaccine. In the early months of the season, the
majority of influenza A (H3) isolates matched the A/Wisconsin/67/2005
strain, the recommended influenza A (H3N2) component for the 2006/2007
vaccine. Beginning in late February 2007, the majority of the influenza A
(H3) isolates indicated reduced titers with antisera produced against
A/Wisconsin/67/2005. States are requested to submit a subset of their
summer influenza isolates and any samples that cannot be subtyped by
standard methods or are unusual to CDC for further antigenic characterization.
In May 2007, a Health Alert Network advisory was issued by CDC regarding an
increase in the number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths and
co-infections with _Staphylococcus aureus_ during the 2006/2007 season (3).
Only one pediatric death with influenza and _S. aureus_ co-infection had
been reported during 2004/2005, and 3 had been reported during the
2005/2006 season (3). Of the 68 reported deaths among children associated
with influenza infections during the period 1 Oct 2006 to 19 May 2007, a
total of 21 had co-infections with influenza and either
methicillin-resistant or sensitive _S. aureus_. State health departments
have been asked to ensure that all influenza-associated pediatric deaths
from the 2006/2007 influenza season are reported to CDC.
At the June 2007 Annual Meeting of the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE), members voted to ratify a position statement
adopted by the CSTE Executive Committee in January 2007 that adds human
infections with novel influenza A viruses to the list of nationally
notifiable diseases and conditions reportable to the National Notifiable
Disease Surveillance System. Novel influenza A viruses are defined as those
isolated from a human but subtyped as nonhuman, or those that cannot be
subtyped by standard methods. Human infections with novel influenza A
viruses that can be transmitted from person-to-person might signal the
beginning of an influenza pandemic. Rapid reporting of human infections
with novel influenza A viruses will facilitate prompt detection and
characterization of influenza A viruses with pandemic potential and
accelerate implementation of effective public health responses. In
addition, influenza-associated pediatric deaths were maintained as a
nationally notifiable disease reportable to the National Notifiable Disease
Surveillance System.
In May 2007, health authorities in the United Kingdom identified 4 persons,
2 in Wales and 2 in north west England, who were infected with a low
pathogenic avian influenza A (H7N2) virus (4). All 4 persons had been
exposed to infected poultry at a farm in Wales; limited evidence of
human-to-human transmission has been associated with low pathogenic avian
influenza viruses such as influenza A (H7N2) virus (4). The United Kingdom
incident underscores the importance of submission and identification of
unusual influenza isolates.
In collaboration with local and state health departments, CDC continues to
recommend enhanced surveillance for possible avian influenza A (H5N1)
infection among travelers who have severe unexplained respiratory illness
and are returning from influenza A (H5N1)-affected countries. Additional
information regarding influenza, including avian influenza, is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu>. Updates on the worldwide avian influenza
situation are available from WHO at
