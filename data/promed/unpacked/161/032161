Human trichinellosis in Croatia
--------------------------------------------
The examination of some 30 samples of meat products which were suspected of
causing the trichinosis epidemic in Istria showed that all of the products
were negative to trichinosis, an epidemiologist of the Croatian Public
Health Institute, Borislav Aleraj, said on Mon 28 Oct 2002.
"The path of contamination of 68 patients in Istria has not been discovered
yet, but the important thing is that there are no newly-contaminated
people," Aleraj told HINA. He believes that the epidemic has been stopped,
which means that the products that contained the infected meat have been
used up, and all suspected products have immediately been withdrawn from
stores as of the first case of illness.
