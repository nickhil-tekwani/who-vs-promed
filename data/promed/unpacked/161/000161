Since the beginning of 2019, a cumulative total of 5060 monkeypox cases, including 103 deaths (CFR [case-fatality rate] 2%), were reported from 18 provinces. In week 49 (week ending 8 Dec 2019), 56 cases and one death were reported nationally.

[It is curious that this many monkeypox (MPX) cases (5060) during 2019 did not come to our attention until now. MPX virus is endemic and widespread geographically in the DR Congo, with cases in 18 provinces; fatal cases occasionally occur. The 2% CFR is relatively low for the clade of MPX that occurs in the DRC, which can reach 10% or more. There is no additional information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
