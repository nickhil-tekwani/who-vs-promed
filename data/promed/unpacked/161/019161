Cows recently imported to Bahrain from Europe were found to have been
infected with foot and mouth disease (FMD), it was revealed [see
commentary].

No figures are available, but all the cattle affected have been
slaughtered, said Municipalities and Agriculture Affairs Ministry
animal wealth [sic] director Dr Salman Abdul Nabi Ebrahim.

Thorough checks on all cattle imports from the FMD endemic countries
had ensured that any stock displaying symptoms of the disease were
immediately destroyed, he told our sister newspaper Gulf Daily News.

"We have done that all the time and will continue to do so," said Dr
Ebrahim. "However, there had been no FMD outbreak among Bahraini
cattle, and that part is well taken care of."

Dr Ebrahim also strongly denied suggestions that Bahraini cattle were
at risk of being infected. "Yes, we have had infected cattle arriving
from overseas, but that has not affected the local stock," he said.

[The detection of FMD in imported cattle does not necessarily
indicate imported infection; the susceptible, unvaccinated European
cattle could have been infected underway if transported by sea or
after arrival in Bahrain itself if air-transported. Bahrain
officially notified the OIE on 5 Apr 2009 about an outbreak of a new
strain of FMD, namely serotype A, which had, reportedly, started on
24 Nov 2008 and was confirmed on 13 Dec 2008. According to the
report, the affected herd came from Somalia with a vaccination
certificate, and the animals showed clinical signs after a one week
quarantine. See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7975>.

A report titled "Situation of FMD in the Middle-East" has been
recently issued by the WRLFMD (FMD World Reference Laboratory,
Pirbright); see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_epidemiology/Note%20recent%20FMD%20events%20in%20M-East.pdf>.
The report includes the map "Reported or detected FMD outbreaks in the
Middle-East (all reports) Dec-08/Mar-09," which is recommended.

According to the said report, in the 1st months of 2009 outbreaks of
FMD caused by serotype A have been detected in several countries in
the Middle East. This serotype is considered endemic in Turkey, Iran
and Pakistan, but as a result of genetic and antigenic drift,
sweeping regional epidemics occur at intervals. The last major type A
change in the region was in 2005-6, when an epidemic of the A Iran 05
strain spread through Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, reaching the Thrace
region of Turkey and as far as Jordan. In 2008, a new variant of the
type A Iran 05 virus replaced the previous strain in Turkey, and this
and related type A viruses appear to be on the move in the region.
This serotype A of the Iran 05 strain has been diagnosed in samples
from Bahrain in November 2008 and again in February 2009; see also
Bahrain's page on the WRLFMD website at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/bar.htm>,
which includes the genotyping of several Bahraini isolates.

According to OIE's data (2007), the local population of animals
susceptible to FMD in Bahrain includes 8700 cattle, 42 000 sheep and
24 000 goats.

In January 2009, an FMD outbreak started in Lebanon, affecting at
least 11 villages. Reportedly, 7 samples arrived at Pirbright on 24
Mar 2009; the results of their serotyping and genotyping -- of
particular importance to neighboring countries -- are pending. -
