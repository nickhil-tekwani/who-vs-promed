AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS - NIGERIA: SEROTYPE 2 (02)
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[On 31 Jan 2007, ProMED-mail posted information on the identification
of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) serotype 2 in equine blood
samples from Nigeria. (African horse sickness - Nigeria: serotype 2
20070131.0399). Initially, these cases were suspected to have been
caused by equine herpesvirus. New information was obtained from the
OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) Reference Laboratories for
AHSV (African horse sickness virus) and BTV (bluetongue virus), in
Onderstepoort, South Africa. The posting included a brief discussion
on possible previous occurrences of AHS in Nigeria.
Subsequent to the above posting and to the included moderator's
comments, we received the following communications addressing the
history of AHS in Nigeria. - Mod.AS]

The following article on AHS in Nigeria may be of interest. I am not
sure of the serotype, but we have certainly isolated AHS in Nigeria,
way, way back in the 70s. (Kemp GE, Humburg JM, and Alhaji I.
Isolation and identification of African horse-sickness virus in
Nigeria. Vet Rec, 24 Jul 1971; 89 (4): 127-8

[The undersigned mentioned, in a direct reply to Prof Tomori --
copied to the reference laboratory in Onderstepoort -- that possible
relevant data were included in a later paper by the same author (Kemp
GE. Antibody in Nigerian animals to African horse sickness serotype
9. Vet Rec, 12 Oct 1974; 95 (15): 345), raising the possibility that
the past AHSV event, described by Prof Tomori, might have been caused
by AHSV-9.
The following response, received from the AHS reference laboratory,
might be of interest to subscribers. - Mod.AS]

This is the post script to the Nigerian horse sickness saga.
I checked your other Vet Rec reference in our library and I think you
are correct about the type 9 isolate. According to the reference,
they had it typed at Onderstepoort and this was probably the spleen
sample from Nigeria, which we couldn't trace back to an actual
typing. The publication gives details of a neutralization survey on
over 200 horses using that isolate and working with mice to do the
tests. About 50 percent of the animals tested were positive to type 9
AHSV. They referenced an old Peter Howell FAO document and
apparently, between 1949 and 1962, there were 8 of 9 serotypes in
circulation in various African countries. Only AHSV 2 was missing and
Kenya recorded most isolates. The nearest neighbours to Nigeria --
Belgian Congo and French West Africa -- had a type 6 and a type 4 in
the mid 1950s.
Now, all these years later, an AHSV type 2 has gone to Nigeria,
although it has probably been present somewhere nearby, just gone
unreported and unnoticed all this time. Fascinating, I would say.
