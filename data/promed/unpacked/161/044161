In a story published in the Carrick Times on [7 Feb 2014], a father recounts what happened to his 14-year-old boy last year [2013], that caused him to lose the sight in one of his eyes.

"We have no idea where our son picked up the infective _Toxocara_ eggs, but we believe it was from dog's feces." There are so many reasons to teach young children to keep their fingers out of their mouths and not to eat dirt. Add the fact that there are so many dogs and puppies using our yard for a bathroom; your own, a neighbors, even a stray.

In the United States, most puppies and many adult dogs are infected with the roundworm, _Toxocara canis_. Infection of the adult dog with this parasite happens when they ingest eggs from the contaminated environment. The puppies usually get this parasite from the mother before birth [or] through her milk.

The puppies will start passing eggs in their feces by 3 weeks of age. This parasite can be spread to humans by ingestion of eggs from the soil or from contaminated hands. Most at risk are young children under 5 years of age, especially those with a history of eating dirt and exposure to puppies.

One study showed that 20-60 percent of soil samples from backyard residences, public parks, and children's sandboxes were contaminated with _Toxocara canis_ eggs. Though it is found throughout the US, diagnosis of disease in children is made most frequently in the south.

Light infections in humans are usually asymptomatic, and probably occur quite frequently.

Human infection with _Toxocara_ usually takes one of 2 forms; visceral larval migrans (VLM), this is where the larvae migrate aimlessly. They usually end up migrating to the liver, but almost any tissue can be invaded.

The other rarer manifestation is ocular larval migrans (OLM), where the larvae enter the eye where permanent vision loss is possible. The diagnosis of _Toxocara_ is usually based on clinical signs, history of exposure to puppies, laboratory findings (including eosinophilia), and the detection of antibodies to _Toxocara_. Stool samples are not useful for examination since the larvae don't mature to adults in humans.

Anti-parasitic drugs are available for treating VLM. You cannot treat OLM with antiparasitics and one is usually left trying to prevent more damage to the eye. The best thing to do is increase prevention by reducing the accidental ingestion of eggs.

Prevention measures include:
- keep the dogs and puppies under a veterinarian's care for early and regular deworming;
- clean up after the pet and dispose of stool;
- keep animals' play area clean;
- wash hands after playing with dogs or cats;
- keep children from playing in areas where animals have soiled;
- cover sandboxes to keep out animals;
- don't let children eat dirt.

[Infections with _Toxocara canis_ and _T. cati_ are often not recognized. An elevated total IgE and eosinophilia should alert the clinician to the diagnosis. It is well known that _Toxocara_ in rare cases may migrate to the eyes as described in this case. Hand hygiene is the most important preventive measure. - Mod.EP

Several studies have shown that nearly 100 percent of puppies are infected in utero from day 42 of the gestation by somatic larvae. This so-called transplacental migration or intrauterine infection is the most important mode of transmission in dogs; 98.5 percent of activated larvae is reported. Gonadotropin prolactin was suggested as a hormone involved in stimulating dormant _T. canis_ larvae to resume their migration. Within hours of birth, the larvae that were present in the liver of the neonate, migrate to the lungs and undergo a tracheal migration. Adult worms can be found at 2 weeks of age and large numbers of eggs may be passed in the feces after a minimum period of 16 days. Transmission occurs in consecutive pregnancies, even in the absence of reinfection between each parturition.
