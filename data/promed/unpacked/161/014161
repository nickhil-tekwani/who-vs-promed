A TEVETMED POST

The emus that I had reported dying of suspected EEE did come up positive.
The client lost about 30 of 40 in a group. A neighbor lost 3-4 out of 50 or
60. Bloody diarhea and a quick death were about the only symptoms.
Vaccinated [emu breeders and a vaccinated mare in the same area were
unaffected.
