CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_
serotype I 4,[5],12:i:- infections. Investigators are using DNA
analysis of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify
cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

From 1 Nov 2010 to 21 Dec 2010, a total of 89 individuals with a
matching strain of _S. enterica_ serotype I 4,[5],12:i:- have been
reported from 15 states and the District of Columbia. The number of
ill people identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as
follows: Connecticut (1), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (1),
Hawaii (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (50), Indiana (9), Massachusetts (1),
Missouri (14), New York (1), Pennsylvania (2), South Dakota (1),
Tennessee (1), Texas (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (3). Among 81
persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range
from 1 Nov to 14 Dec 2010. Case-patients range in age from 1-75
years, with a median age of 28. 68 percent of patients are female.
Among persons with available information, 23 percent reported being
hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Because the pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern associated with this particular
serotype commonly occurs in the USA, some of the cases identified may
not be related to this outbreak.

Public health officials in multiple states have been interviewing ill
persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten
and other exposures in the week prior to illness. Preliminary results
of this investigation indicate a link to eating alfalfa sprouts at a
national sandwich chain.

This investigation is ongoing. CDC, FDA, and state and local public
health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases and
trace potentially contaminated product. CDC will update the public on
the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.

[This discussion is taken from Salmonellosis, frozen poultry pie -
USA (multistate)(04): recall 20071013.3355:

As readers will note from past outbreaks of salmonellosis, the
specific organism involved is usually referred to as _Salmonella
enterica_ followed by its serotype (or serovar) name such as _S.
enterica_ serotype Tennessee. Serotype Tennessee was associated with
the well-publicized USA-wide peanut butter-associated outbreak
affecting more than 600 people.

As discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric
Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control),
<http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf>,
_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S.
enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_,
_arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_ and _indica_. _S. enterica_
subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually
isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority
of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with
the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries
somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella
pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed
in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the
flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the
serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H
antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to
another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. The
outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. Echeita and
colleagues (1) have found that this monophasic strain appears to be
such due to the absence of the _flj_B gene, which is involved in the
H antigen switching mechanism. According to Paccagnella, around 1903,
Smith and Reagh reported on the different behavior of the flagellar
and somatic antigens of salmonella strains. Their work was mostly
ignored until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2
forms, the swarming form called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English:
with breath) and the non-swarming form, called the O form (_ohne
Hauch_, in English: without breath). The H form contained both O and
H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were
transposed to the salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture motility is preserved, whereas
if H antiserum is added the culture does not move. Therefore, H
antigen was involved with swarming in the agar plate (breathing might
have been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellae, of
course, do not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ bacteria do.)

Several other foodborne outbreaks related to 4, 5, 12:i:- salmonellae
have been reported, including one in New York City reported in 2002
(2). Additional information about this monophasic organism, which may
be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, can be found in references 3-5.
