The number of dengue fever cases in Hong Kong has reached 25 -- 19 more
than for the same period of 2002 -- with the discovery of a man suffering
the potentially fatal haemorrhagic form of the disease.
The victim, a 46-year-old man who fell ill a day after returning from Sri
Lanka, is believed to be the 1st haemorrhagic case so far in 2003. Only 5
cases [of DHF] have been detected in Hong Kong since 1994, all of them
imported. His case has prompted another warning from the Department of
Health for the public to guard against the deadly disease, which is spread
by mosquitoes that bite during the day. Last week a senior health official
warned that cases of dengue fever had increased to an alarming level.
The man developed fever, a cough, vomiting, and diarrhoea on 2 Aug 2003 and
was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital last Thursday with rashes, a
spokesman for the Health Department said. He added that tests confirmed the
man was suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever. The man's condition was
stable last night.
In 2002, Hong Kong recorded 44 cases of dengue fever, including its first
locally contracted cases -- 7 reported in Ma Wan, Lantau. This followed an
outbreak with 1200 cases in Macau [China] the previous year [2001], with no
fatalities.

25 more people with dengue-like symptoms were admitted over the weekend to
an already overcrowded hospital in southern Trinidad, officials said
Monday. Dozens of others over the past month have checked into San Fernando
General Hospital with high fever and nausea, said Jonathan Fraser, health
authority spokesman. Fraser could not provide an exact number of cases over
the past month.
The hospital, one of the Trinidad and Tobago's largest, is 35 miles (56
kilometers) south of the capital, Port-of-Spain. It has been at full
capacity since at least Friday, prompting officials to urge people with
non-urgent cases to seek treatment elsewhere. Some patients have been moved
into corridors and hallways for lack of space, Fraser said.
Doctors had not confirmed Monday whether the viral-type illness was dengue,
Fraser said. Blood tests were being conducted, but Fraser said he did not
know when results would be known.
This twin-island Caribbean country of 1.3 million residents typically
experiences a rise in dengue cases during the rainy season, which runs
through the second half of the year.
There have been 757 confirmed cases of dengue in Trinidad this year, which
officials said was normal. During the same period in 2002, there were 2703
cases.
However, 2002 appeared to be an aberration possibly caused by a new strain
of the virus that surfaced in the region, health officials have said.
Numbers similar to those for this year had been reported in 2001 and
previous years.
Fraser could not say how many deaths there have been in 2003.
