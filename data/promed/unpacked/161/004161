A canine flu outbreak has been confirmed at PetSmart's Farmingdale dog
day-camp and boarding, the pet supplies chain said Monday [21 Nov
2011].

Corporate spokeswoman Michelle Friedman said 8 dogs have been
diagnosed with the latest strain of the highly contagious disease, and
they are recovering, with PetSmart paying for treatment.

In the past one or 2 months, veterinarians have reported outbreaks in
the New York metro area, including a Rockland County kennel and an
animal shelter in Teterboro, New Jersey.

The flu, spread by contact and coughs, is usually not fatal but can be
serious for dogs with breathing and respiratory issues. The clinical
signs are similar to the human flu -- cough, runny nose, fever, and
lethargy -- but experts said life threatening signs can develop,
including pneumonia. Dogs more likely to catch the virus are those
exposed to other canines gathered in close quarters, such as dog parks
and boarding facilities.

PetSmart's Farmingdale dog camp has been closed since 14 Nov 2011 and
the PetsHotel shut down Friday [18 Nov 2011] as workers disinfected
the area, Friedman said. They are to reopen Wednesday [23 Nov 2011],
she said, but dogs who have been there recently won't be allowed back
until 2 weeks after their last visits.

"The safety and well-being of all pets that have been under our care
is our priority," Friedman said. "We haven't seen any new incidents
beyond these 8 cases."

[In any place where animals gather in social or semi-social settings,
including boarding facilities, there is the possibility of passing
this disease to another dog.

There are vaccines to prevent this disease. Perhaps it should be
considered as a necessary vaccine prior to boarding, and if the dog is
taken to dog parks or other gatherings where social diseases are
likely. - Mod.TG]
