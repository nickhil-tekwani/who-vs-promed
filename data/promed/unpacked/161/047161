All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in
the State of California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks
to affect 17 commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003,
END was also confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada.
A backyard flock was confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003 in the
State of Arizona.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final
validation. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
personnel and other federal government personnel are working with
the States to consider additional resources to meet the labor
demands at the Task Forces. APHIS has developed a plan for
national END surveillance. This plan will enhance the already
extensive surveillance underway.

Operational Update
-------------------
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
Effective 10 Feb 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from all of La Paz and Yuma Counties and a portion of
Mohave County, AZ.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an
extraordinary emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and
Nevada. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority
within Arizona, California and Nevada.
Currently there are 17 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END. The breakdown of the commercial premises
involved is as follows:
4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact),
5 counties in San Diego County (5 infected), and
8 premises in San Bernardino County (8 infected).
Of the 2447 premises designated for depopulation, 92.0 percent
have been completed.
In conjunction with the outreach efforts of the Central California
Command post, Stanislaus County personnel have begun END
surveillance efforts. This cooperative approach was finalized in an
agreement signed by Task Force and County officials last week.
Similar agreements with approximately 15 other counties in that
region should soon follow.
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is
staffed and working cooperatively with approximately 15-20 county
officials to implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the
Central Valley.
The Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination (AgMAC) Group met 5
Mar 2003, to discuss the END situation, resource availability, State
personnel legislation, and future personnel needs. The AgMAC is
scheduled to have follow-up meetings weekly to address these
issues and any additional issues as they emerge.
Task Force personnel, in close collaboration with the California
State Highway Patrol, have agreed to establish an inspection station
at the commercial truck weighing station on Interstate 5 at Castaic.
Personnel will perform visual inspections of commercial vehicles that
contain birds or poultry. Further, California State Highway Patrol
officers will remain alert for commercial poultry vehicles they see in
and around quarantine zones, and those officers will notify the Task
Force with any information pertinent to the Task Force mission.
Outreach Activities
----------------
This week, Task Force personnel from the Las Vegas Incident
Command Post met with officials from the Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce in Las Vegas. Chamber of Commerce officials plan to
assist the Task Force mission by distributing END educational
materials at Hispanic grocery stores.
Task Force personnel at the South Coast Incident Command Post
have begun distributing END educational materials in the utility bills
of residents who live in areas highly affected by the virus.
On a daily basis, Task Force public information personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation,
and cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city
managers in Southern California.
Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450
calls per week from the public through the Joint Information Center
phone bank. This is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls
from early October 2002. On average, approximately 300 of these
calls require follow-up action by the Inland Desert or South Coast
Incident Command Posts.
The Task Force information staff provides daily updates to
approximately 35 media outlets in California. In addition, in Area
Command alone, the information staff fields approximately 70 media
calls per week.
