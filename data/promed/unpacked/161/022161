[1] Cholera: management, commentary
Date: Tue 14 Sep 2010
From: Eduardo Gotuzzo <eduardo.gotuzzo@upch.pe> [edited]


In face of a cholera pandemic in resource-constrained settings (with
poverty, limited conditions of drainage, and scarce health
facilities), efforts should be implemented at different levels:

1. At the community level, health care of all patients with diarrhea
but no vomiting:
- use oral rehydration salts, which must be started immediately,
encouraging drink of water every 30-60 minutes, provided the patient
continues without vomiting;
- oral rehydration salts should be prepared with safe, clean water,
either drinking water or chlorinated water (tap water with 1 drop of
hypochlorite solution per 10 liters of water). Also, the tap water
can be boiled and then covered for 2-4 hours so it can recover
ambient oxygen and its typical taste;
- for this activity, mothers should be encouraged to stimulate and
provide oral rehydration both to their children but also to adult
relatives.
2. Patients treated at the community level should be referred to the
health centers when there is vomiting, or diarrheas with increasing
volumes. For the latter case, oral rehydration should be reinforced
and closely observed, and the patient should receive antibiotics for
3 days (antibiotics help to diminish the number and the volume of
stools).
3. If the patient does not respond well to oral rehydration, he or
she should be treated at mini-hospitals or hospitals, with
intravenous rehydration therapy containing sodium chloride (0.9
percent). The goal is to keep the diuresis, and to start again with
oral rehydration therapy as soon as the patient recovers enough to
tolerate it.
4. The sitting position (far more than typical cholera cots) reduces
aspiration pneumonia and vomiting, and facilitates moving on with the
oral rehydration. Such a simple method is of extraordinary help.
5. Finally, given a dramatic situation such as that observed in Goma,
Congo DR (of very high mortality, exceeding more than 20 000 deaths),
I would consider recommending, in addition to the measures indicated
above, the use of prophylaxis in all cohabitants of a home where
there is a cholera case. One tablet of fluoroquinolones, such as
ciprofloxacin, reaches adequate concentration in stools for more than
2-4 days and thus stands as a quite good option for prophylaxis. In
my opinion, this measure should not generate a drug resistance
phenomenon, even considering massive use.

A total of 417 people had been killed by cholera in Cameroon
according to the country's health authorities. The outbreak was
declared on 6 May 2010 in the Extreme-Northern parts of the country
as 6239 cases had been reported.

Apart from spreading to the northern parts of the country, 2
suspected cholera cases have been reported in Yaounde, the country's
capital 3 others in Douala, the country's economic capital.

"These zones are prone to cholera due to heavy rains. Therefore we
should expect to see cholera cases all the time. There are some
carriers who will exhibit cholera symptoms and others who may not, "
the country's Public Health minister Andre Mama Fouda said after a
meeting in his office. He, however, noted that the Extreme Northern
parts, the northern parts, as well as the coastal regions and some
sections of the western region were the most affected by the epidemic.

[4] Cholera, diarrhea - India (Orissa)

Cholera, and other water borne diseases, which have claimed 39 lives
since the end of August 2010, have infected 124 more people in
Orissa's Rayagada district in the last 2 days, and triggered panic
among the residents, an official said Tue 14 Sep 2010.

According to the latest data, the number of people and villages
affected by the diseases has risen to 784 and 156 respectively. "Over
100 more people have been infected and the diseases have been
reported from 54 new villages," an official of the health control
room told IANS.

However, local newspapers claimed that the government figure was far
from the real figure. Dharitri, a vernacular Oriya daily, said in a
report on 14 Sep 2010 that the number of deaths in Rayagada district
has crossed the 100 mark and the number of people affected has
crossed the 1000 figure. Another vernacular newspaper 'The Samaja'
said the disease has also spread to the neighboring Gajapati and
Nabrangpur districts. The paper also said that during the past 2
days, at least 7 people have died of cholera and other water borne
diseases in Rayagada, Gajapati, and Nabrangpur.
