Moderator TY is absolutely right when remarking that wild rat-induced SEOV [Seoul virus] infection should be included in each serological investigation of a suspected [hantavirus infection] case, including cases in Panama, even when admittedly RT-PCR remains the gold standard. However, due to the short duration of SEOV viremia, RT-PCR remains often negative, so that plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) in specialized labs or serology in other labs are often the only solution. Commercial hantavirus tests, however, often lack a diagnostic SEOV antigen, so that cross-reacting other murid hantaviral pathogens often result in the diagnosis of a "HTNV" [Hantaan virus] or a "DOBV" [Dobrava virus] infection, even in regions where these pathogens are actually absent.

In an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), murid prototype HTNV 76-118 strongly cross-reacts equally with murid SEOV, and also, mostly to a lesser degree, with arvicolid PUUV [Puumala virus]. Of note, these same IFA cross-reactions allowed, from the early 1980s onward, the start of surprisingly efficient serodiagnosis for Western-European HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome], despite being predominantly PUUV-induced, indeed (Clement 2015, Clement et al. 2019). Moreover, in pioneer IFA times, the former prudent circumscription of worldwide omnipresent rat-borne SEOV pathogen was consequently always described as being "HTNV-like," like in a few African countries (Clement et al. 2019). However, these same serological cross-reactions bear an implicit warning for developed regions like Finno-Scandia, where sero-diagnoses until now often rely on assays containing only PUUV antigens considered (wrongly), since decades, as the sole local hantaviral pathogen. Of note, not a single SEOV-HFRS case was reported so far from Finno-Scandia, despite demonstration, dating from 1989, of SEOV-infection in local rats (LeDuc et al., 1986). The same observation is valid for blatantly absent diagnoses of human SEOV infections hitherto from vast regions like Australia and New Zealand, despite, again, the demonstration of SEOV-infected rats already since 1986 (LeDuc et al., 1986).

In another ProMED report, Hantavirus - Africa: South-Africa ex Europe (Croatia), Archive Number 20210603.8419923, the authors have to be congratulated for their efforts in tracing back an early serum sample of the described Croatian patient, finally yielding a RT-PCR result, positive for PUUV. Herewith, South Africa's 1st HFRS case is, in fact, an imported PUUV case, coming from Croatia. Indeed, PUUV is absent from South Africa, due to the local absence of its rodent reservoir, the bank vole [_Myodes glareolus_]. However, the same South African authors should be reminded that, no doubt, commensal wild rats are, to the contrary, also present in their country, but here again, not a single SEOV-HFRS case was reported so far from South Africa. Finally, in the same report, Croatia is described as having 2 local hantaviral pathogens: PUUV and DOBV. Once again, SEOV is not mentioned, nor considered.

In summary, SEOV is mentioned in virtually each hantavirus paper as the only global hantaviral pathogen but is, in fact, almost never considered in the description of new local HFRS (or HCPS [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome] cases. Thus, paradoxically enough, it is the only global hantaviral pathogen [that] remains a permanent blind spot in hantavirology.

[Dr. Clement continues to remind us of the need to consider SEOV when making a differential diagnosis of hantavirus infections. The potential for misdiagnosis will not be resolved until routine laboratory tests are done to differentiate between SEOV and other hantaviruses. HFRS and HCPS are serious diseases. Knowing which hantavirus is responsible for cases is epidemiologically important since the habits and habitats of their rodent host species are different with a difference in risk of human exposure and, hence, the need for taking different and appropriate preventive measures. - Mod.TY
