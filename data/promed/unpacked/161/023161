A new outbreak of tuberculosis was confirmed by the prefecture of the Ardennes. It is located in a cattle farm in the town of Semide (Canton Machault [Champagne- Ardenne region]) following the discovery of suspicious lesions at slaughter.

According to the statement issued by the prefecture, the test results revealed the DNA of _Mycobacterium bovis_, the bacterium responsible for bovine tuberculosis. Analyses are underway to determine the strain implicated. This is the 2nd outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in the municipality of Semide, the 1st of which was discovered in June 2012.

The fate of the suckler herd, composed of 109 calves, will have to be determined soon in line with the Ministry of Agriculture's ordinance.

According to the prefecture of the Ardennes, this is the 6th case of bovine tuberculosis diagnosed in the Ardennes.

[According to the 25 Nov 2013 (most recent) update of EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), 9 EU countries have reported, so far, a total of 183 outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle, as follows (in brackets: date of last report, number of outbreaks):
Austria (21 Feb 2013, 2),
Belgium (27 Sep 2013, 9)
France (24 Oct 2013, 100)
Germany (18 Apr 2013, 24)
Italy (24 Sep 2013, 15)
Netherlands (09 Jul 2013, 4)
Poland (18 Oct 2013, 11)
Switzerland (14 Nov 2013, 13)
UK (30 Sep 2013, 5).

For the above and additional details, see http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_outbreaks_per_disease_en.pdf.

France maintains -- since Dec 2000 -- the status of country "officially bTB free" according to international criteria ("at least 99.8 percent of the herds free"). Herd surveillance has been applied in areas with historical background and in herds with high potential for spread (such as raw milk dairy farms).

Three potential wild bTB reservoirs are suspected in France -- wild boar, red deer, and badger. During the previous outbreak in Semide, preliminarily badgers were named as suspected. A recent study provides useful information on the bTB reservoir issue in France, including maps and suggested venues for further studies:
