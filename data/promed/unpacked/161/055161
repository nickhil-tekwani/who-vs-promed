A detailed story of the influenza A type H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong,
presented by returning experts to the USFDA (Food and Drug Administration)
is available on the JAMA website
<http://www.ama-assn.org/public/journals/jama/jamahome.htm> in the issue of
Mar. 4 /98, JAMA 279: 643-644.
Note that in the following quote:
>>>>>>>
"One of the striking things about these cases is the age-related
mortality," Fukuda said. "If you just eyeball them, you can see that they
are concentrated among young adults." Of 7 patients 18 years of age and
older (up to 60 years), 6 died. Of 11 patients younger than 18 years, 2
died. "An 88% mortality among the older age group. This was very striking
to us," he said.
>>>>>>>>>
Dr Fukuda is referring to CFR (case fatality rate), not mortality as a
result of infection. Serology has shown that a number of people in Hong
Kong have developed antibodies to the virus without having been sick.
