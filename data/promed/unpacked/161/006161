At a mink farm in Meijel (municipality of Peel en Maas) an infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been established. The company has approximately 10 000 parent animals. The contamination came to light from the "early warning", the monitoring system in which animals are tested for the virus every week. The company will be cleared as soon as possible.

A total of 57 mink farms in the Netherlands have now been declared infected.

[Meijel is situated in Netherland's southeastern province of Limburg, adjacent to the demarcation line with North Brabant province, where most of the COVID-19 outbreaks in minks have been recorded; see map at https://tinyurl.com/y5ke66yk.

The total number of infected Dutch mink farms as of last Friday (18 Sep 2020) was 54 (20200918.7794239); the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Netherland's mink farms continues despite the tightening of control measures. Out of Netherlands' total of (about) 120 mink farms, 57 have already been found infected. The mechanism of the continued circulation of the virus in mink is yet to be explained.

According to a government decision supported by the parliament, mink farming is to be discontinued in the Netherlands in spring 2021. - Mod.AS]

[The map and table, continuously updated, showed the following data when accessed]:

In total, 25 mink holdings have been found infected with COVID-19 out of the country's total of 1136 holdings, as of Friday [25 Sep 2020].

The infected holdings were found in 2 communities in North Jutland:
- Hjorring: 22 infected holdings out of 65 [the number, as of Fri 18 Sep 2020, was 17]
- Frederkshavn: 3 infected holdings out of 51 [unchanged].

[Denmark is the world's largest producer of mink skins. Since July 2020, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) has monitored Denmark's 1136 mink farms for the presence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With a monitoring strategy and the stricter restrictions for infected mink farms, the DVFA and the Danish health authorities assessed that it is justifiable to let infected herds live because the risk of spreading infection to humans is minimal. Since 16 Sep 2020, the DVFA no longer issues press releases on individual findings of COVID-19 on Danish mink farms. Instead, herds with confirmed infections are identified on the DVFA's website in a continuously updated map and table.

COVID-19 in farmed minks has also been reported to the OIE from Spain (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Informe_visones_OIE_16.07.20_.pdf, one outbreak) and from the USA, where the first 2 outbreaks reportedly started, in Utah, on 26 Jul and 2 Aug 2020, respectively; report submitted to the OIE on 20 Aug 2020 (https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=35412). Since then, 4 additional outbreaks on mink farms in Utah (USA) have been reported, the most recent one, which reportedly started 8 Sep 2020, has been reported to the OIE on 24 Sep 2020. According to OIE data, the total number of susceptible minks on the 6 affected farms in Utah was 42 157, of which 7912 died; no culling applied. The diagnosis was carried out by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory), applying gene sequencing and real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).

All farmed minks, in Europe and the USA, are American minks (_Neovison vison_).

According to available information, resulting from investigations of the Dutch event, the farmed minks in the provinces North Brabant and Limburg were initially infected from humans; in few cases, they were found likely to subsequently infect humans. Cats and dogs have also been shown to be infected by human patients, but no vice versa infection has been recorded.
