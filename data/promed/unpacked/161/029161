22 Oct 2016 Guinea: The Government of the Republic of Guinea establishes the National Post-Ebola Recovery and Resilience Fund
http://reliefweb.int/report/guinea/government-republic-guinea-establishes-national-post-ebola-recovery-and-resilience
[On 5 Oct 2016, at a side event of the World Bank Annual meetings, the Government of Guinea and the MPTF [Medium Term Policy Framework] Office established the National Post-Ebola Recovery and Resilience Fund (FNRPE). Ahead of the upcoming resource mobilization efforts, the Government of the Republic of Guinea sent a strong signal of commitment to all partners by announcing a USD 5 million pledge from its own resources.
The FNRPE will support the implementation of a USD 550 million plan organized around 5 pillars: (1) economic recovery, women's entrepreneurship and youth employment; (2) social protection and support to vulnerable groups; (3) water, hygiene and sanitation; (4) governance and social cohesion and (5) health, risk reduction and contingency. The FNRPE will be managed in accordance with the principles of the Paris Declaration and the New Deal. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance, and participation of representatives of the United Nations and other development partners will ensure that all decisions are taken in a true spirit of partnership and transparency.]

21 Oct 2016 Liberia: The psychological scars of Ebola: Report
http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/liberia-psychological-scars-ebola
[From Médecins Sans Frontières [Doctors Without Borders (MSF)]
Two years after the peak of the Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak in Liberia, survivors, as well as their families and health workers, are gradually rebuilding their lives. As MSF transfers its mental health services to the Liberian Ministry of Health, MSF psychiatrist Frédéric Gelly describes the process of psychological healing:
(Interview with MSF psychiatrist Frédéric Gelly):
"Q: What effect did the Ebola epidemic have on people's mental health?
"A: More than 4800 Liberians died from Ebola in 2014 and 2015. Many people saw relatives die; some lost their whole families. Others continue to suffer from an extreme sense of guilt, for being the 1st in their family to catch Ebola and spread it to others, or for being the only one who survived. Two years later, they ask themselves over and over again: 'Why did I survive and others die?'
"Religion is one way to deal with death, including rituals around burials. A shared sense of community and common beliefs can help reduce the pain and trauma of those close to you dying. But at the height of the epidemic, even this possibility was denied, as the government had to lay down strict rules about cremating the dead and forbade burial ceremonies."...more]

19 Oct 2016 Uganda: Travelers eating baboon meat on the Gulu Highway
http://allafrica.com/stories/201610190355.html
[The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) has warned that there is a high chance that travelers that eat roadside mchomo (roast meat) could be eating baboon meat. Andrew Sseguya, the UWA executive director, said baboon meat is sold as illegal bush meat at Kafu along the Kampala-Gulu highway. "We have arrested a number of people from Kafu selling baboon meat as kob meat," Sseguya told journalists at the UWA headquarters at Kitante, Kampala. Consumers also are sold dead calf meet as bush meat.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), consumption of meat from primates (monkeys, baboons, gorillas and chimpanzees) can lead to contraction of viruses such as the deadly Ebola virus.
It also links Ebola infections in people to handling and eating infected animals. In 2012, CDC also identified evidence of viruses -- such as simian foamy virus -- in illegally imported wildlife products impounded at several US airports.]
[There are so many reasons one should not eat bush meat, e.g. disease risk, wildlife conservation, tourism, economics, but other sources of nutrition must be identified before we can even hope this practice will stop. - Mod.LK]

Abstract.
Following its immergence in December 2013, the recent Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa has spread and persisted for more than 2 years, making it the largest EBOV epidemic in both scale and geographical region to date. In this study, a total of 726 glycoprotein (GP) gene sequences of the EBOV full-length genome obtained from West Africa from the 2014 outbreak, combined with 30 from earlier outbreaks between 1976 and 2008 were used to investigate the genetic divergence, evolutionary history, population dynamics, and selection pressure of EBOV among distinct epidemic waves. Results from our dataset showed that no non-synonymous substitutions occurred on the GP gene coding sequences of EBOV that were likely to have affected protein structure or function in any way.]

[A previous study noted rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation. They found the observed substitution rate was roughly twice as high within the 2014 outbreak as between outbreaks. Mutations were also more frequently nonsynonymous during the outbreak. Similar findings have been seen previously and are consistent with expectations from incomplete purifying selection. ... The investigators identified 395 mutations, including 50 fixed nonsynonymous changes with 8 at positions with high levels of conservation across ebolaviruses. (SK Gire et al. Science 12 Sep 2014: Vol. 345, Issue 6202, pp. 1369-1372)].
[In this early study, the biological significance of the mutations was not evaluated. Since EBOV is an RNA virus, the mutations were not surprising. - Mod.LK]
