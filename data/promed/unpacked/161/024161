To the best of my knowledge, no new cases of anthrax have been
confirmed by the lab since 28 Jul 2006. I have a stack of 8
submissions to ND VDL [Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, North Dakota
State University, Fargo, ND] all of which are negative. This deal
appears to have stopped short. We were having extreme heat with
temps in the triple digit range at about that time. I don't know if
that plays a role or not. I also don't know what to expect from here on.

[Randy has been on a well-deserved leave. The last MN Board of Animal
Health report was posted 20 Jul 2006:
<http://www.bah.state.mn.us/diseases/anthrax/Record%20Anthrax%20Outbreak%207%2020%202006.pdf>
For the moment MN seems to be enjoying a well-deserved breathing
space. Only time will tell if the present series of outbreaks is in
fact over. It had grouped into 4 clusters, (1) Kitson and western
Roseau counties, (2) eastern Roseau & western Lake of the Woods
counties, (3) NW Red Lake and (4) SE Red Lake county. - Mod.MHJ]
