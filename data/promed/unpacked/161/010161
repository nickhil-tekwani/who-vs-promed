As COVID-19 cases in the United States soar in the wake of the holidays, led by the highly transmissible omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, nearly a quarter of hospitals are reporting critical staffing shortages due to workers being sick or off work for quarantine.

Meanwhile, federal and states are expanding vaccination activities and policies to protect more people.

As healthcare workers face exposure risks at home and in hospital settings, many facilities are stretched thin, with facilities this time juggling big burdens on general wards alongside busy intensive care units.

US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) data show that 141 385 hospital beds are currently in use by COVID-19 patients, approaching the record peak from January 2021. With rising numbers of health workers calling in sick, some facilities are leaving some beds empty, because they don't have enough staff to safety fill them with patients, according to the Wall Street Journal. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-cut-beds-as-nurses-call-in-sick-with-covid-19-11641810781]

Currently, about 24% of US hospitals report critical staffing shortages, the highest of the pandemic, and many facilities are starting to limit elective surgeries and consider crisis standards of care.

Colorado's health department on 7 Jan [2021] reactivated its crisis standards of care for emergency medical services, due to many emergency medical service (EMS) staff out sick and a high demand for patient transports.

State officials last activated the EMS crisis standards of care in April 2020 when Colorado was among the 1st states affected in the nation's 1st COVID-19 surge. In November [2021], it reactivated crisis standards of care for staffing healthcare systems, allowing hospitals more flexibility in boosting staff to meeting increasing community medical needs.

On CBS "Face the Nation" yesterday [9 Jan 2022], former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said omicron activity has already peaked in some Mid-Atlantic states, with omicron now setting its sights on the Midwest, where the pace is picking up.

The US 7-day average is now at more than 714 000 cases a day, up from about 410 000 cases a day a week ago, according to the Washington Post tracker. Also, 7-day average for deaths is nearly 1600 a day, with new hospitalizations averaging almost 100 000 a day over the past week. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic&state=US]

The US COVID-19 total just topped 60 million cases, and more than 838 000 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/]

As cases surge, efforts are underway to ease and extend vaccine protection through primary doses and boosters. Massachusetts, Illinois, and Oregon are among the states that are launching mass vaccination sites, according to the New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#some-states-are-opening-mass-vaccination-sites-amid-the-omicron-surge-in-the-us]

At the federal level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday [9 Jan 2022] updated its guidance for quarantine and isolation for the 3rd time in 2 weeks. The update organizes the information into charts that make the steps easier to read and follow. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html]

Meanwhile, the US Postal Service is seeking a 120-day delay in complying with the Biden administration vaccine mandate for workers at large companies, according to NPR. The mandate was schedule to take effect today [10 Jan 2022], but several states have challenged the measure, which is under review by the Supreme Court.

International COVID headlines
---------------------------------
- An advisory group from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) last week weighed in on a potential animal role as it relates to SARS-CoV-2 evolution and the omicron variant. It said a rapid genetic assessment doesn't show a close relation to any viruses collected from animals, but it adds that animal samples to compare with viruses from humans are limited. The OIE said, however, that its experts can't rule out an animal connection, because of the identification of omicron spike mutations associated with adaptation in mice as demonstrated in experimental studies.

- China reported its 1st confirmed local omicron cases, which involve 2 people in the northern port city of Tianjin. Officials have limited movement out of the city and are doing mass testing to identify other spread of the virus. [See ProMED post 20220112.8700789.]

- The global total today climbed to 309 161 751 million cases, along with 5 492 990 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data.

[2] Vaccine and MIS-C [multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children]
Date: Mon 10 Jan 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/pfizer-covid-vaccine-91-effective-against-inflammatory-syndrome


Among 12-18-year-old hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 91% effective in preventing the rare but serious coronavirus-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), according to a US study [see citation below] published late last week in Morbidity and Mortality Report.

In the 1st real-world evaluation of the Pfizer vaccine's effectiveness against MIS-C, a team led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers compared the odds of COVID-19 vaccination in 102 adolescent MIS-C patients and 181 controls at 24 sites.

Controls included 90 COVID-19-negative patients and 91 MIS-C-negative patients from 1 Jul - 9 Dec 2021, after the emergence of the more virulent delta (B1617.2) variant but before the even more highly transmissible omicron (B.1.1.529) strain.

Median participant age was 14.5 years, and 58% had one or more underlying medical conditions. About 36% of controls and 5% of COVID-19 patients were fully vaccinated at least 28 days before hospitalization.

MIS-C, which usually occurs 2-6 weeks after a mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, is a hyperinflammatory disorder marked by severe illness requiring hospitalization and involvement of at least 2 organ systems.

Estimated vaccine effectiveness against MIS-C was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78% - 97%). A sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a positive COVID-19 or serologic test estimated vaccine effectiveness at 90% (95% CI, 75% - 96%).

Regardless of control group, effectiveness against MIS-C was similar, at 92% in COVID 19-negative controls (95% CI, 77% - 97%) and 89% in controls without MIS-C (95% CI, 70% - 96%).

Sixty-one percent of case-patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 37% required respiratory or cardiovascular life support. All 38 MIS-C patients requiring life support were unvaccinated, including 9 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, 35 needing vasoactive drugs, and one needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The length of hospital stays between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were similar, at a median of 5 days, and no deaths were reported. Overall, 89% of case-patients had cardiovascular system involvement, 82% had gastrointestinal involvement, and 67% had hematologic (blood) involvement.

The researchers cautioned that the time point at which 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine protect against MIS-C is unknown and that while the participating hospitals covered a broad geographic area, the findings are not generalizable to the rest of the US pediatric population. Regardless, they said, the results support COVID-19 vaccination in this age group.

"This analysis lends supportive evidence that vaccination of children and adolescents is highly protective against MIS-C and COVID-19 and underscores the importance of vaccination of all eligible children," the authors concluded.

[3] Common cold and COVID-19
Date: Mon 10 Jan 2022

T cells induced by infection with coronaviruses such as those that cause the common cold might help protect against COVID-19, finds a small UK study [see citation below] today [10 Jan 2022] in Nature Communications.

Led by Imperial College London researchers, the study included 52 people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through an infected household member. Participants underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) retesting 4 and 7 days after initial diagnosis starting in September 2020, before COVID-19 vaccines were widely available to most UK residents. Eighty-eight percent of participants were White.

Cross-reactive T cells were significantly more abundant in the 26 uninfected participants than in the 26 diagnosed as having COVID-19.

In an Imperial College London news release, 1st author Rhia Kundu, PhD, said that while T cells' cross-protective effect is an important discovery, "it is only one form of protection, and I would stress that no one should rely on this alone. Instead, the best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is to be fully vaccinated, including getting your booster dose."

The authors said that the results could provide a blueprint for a universal vaccine to protect against infections from current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron (B.1.1.529).

Senior author Ajit Lalvani, MBBS, explained that T cells work by neutralizing proteins in SARS-CoV-2 rather than its surface spiked protein, the target of current COVID-19 vaccines. The T cells, he said, mutate much less often than the virus.

"Consequently, they are highly conserved between the various SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron," Lalvani said. "New vaccines that include these conserved, internal proteins would therefore induce broadly protective T cell responses that should protect against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
-------
"Cross-reactive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in pre-pandemic cohorts and proposed to contribute to host protection. Here we assess 52 COVID-19 household contacts to capture immune responses at the earliest timepoints after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Using a dual cytokine FLISpot assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we enumerate the frequency of T cells specific for spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and ORF1 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that cross-react with human endemic coronaviruses. We observe higher frequencies of cross-reactive (p = 0.0139), and nucleocapsid-specific (p = 0.0355) IL-2-secreting memory T cells in contacts who remained PCR-negative despite exposure (n = 26), when compared with those who convert to PCR-positive (n = 26); no significant difference in the frequency of responses to spike is observed, hinting at a limited protective function of spike-cross-reactive T cells. Our results are thus consistent with pre-existing non-spike cross-reactive memory T cells protecting SARS-CoV-2-naive contacts from infection, thereby supporting the inclusion of non-spike antigens in 2nd-generation vaccines."

Imperial College London news release:
"A new study, published in Nature Communications and led by Imperial College London researchers, provides the 1st evidence of a protective role for these T cells. While previous studies have shown that T cells induced by other coronaviruses can recognise SARS-CoV-2, the new study examines for the 1st time how the presence of these T cells at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure influences whether someone becomes infected.

"The researchers also say their findings provide a blueprint for a 2nd-generation, universal vaccine that could prevent infection from current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron.

"Dr Rhia Kundu, 1st author of the study, from Imperial's National Heart & Lung Institute, says: "Being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn't always result in infection, and we've been keen to understand why. We found that high levels of pre-existing T cells, created by the body when infected with other human coronaviruses like the common cold, can protect against COVID-19 infection." - Mod.LK

- The Americas region reported 16.9% of cases and 18.4% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 111.30 million cases, now surpassed in the last 24-48 hours by the European region. Argentina reported 101 689 cases followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru. An additional 12 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Jamaica, Guyana, Puerto Rico, and Curacao) in the past 24 hours. One additional country reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases (Suriname). Notably, the USA, Canada, Costa Rica, and Honduras, among others, did not report any cases/deaths over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 53.0% of daily case numbers and 48.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has now acquired the position as the most severely affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 111.33 million. Some countries not reporting cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden, among others. A total of 33 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours with 3 countries reporting more than 100 000, 11 reporting more than 10 000, and 19 reporting over 1000 cases. An additional 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.4% of daily case numbers and 16.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 17.44 million cases. There appears to be some catchup reporting as no data was updated for this region on Fri 7 Jan 2022. Lebanon (33 366) reported the highest number over the last 24 hours followed by Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, UAE, Jordan, Bahrain, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and Occupied Palestinian Territory.

A global total of 6101 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 8 Jan 2022 to late 9 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 77 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 44 of the 77 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 63.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 65.8% increase in daily reported cases and 23.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3 100 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 311.01 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.50 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
