Six cases of elephantiasis have been reported in Narayansthan and 2 cases in Kushmisera in the past 10 months, according to the data of the District Health Office in Baglung [Gandaki Province]. The onset of the summer season has worried health workers in Baglung with mosquitoborne diseases becoming prevalent in Narayansthan of Baglung Municipality-14 and Kushmisera of Jaimini Municipality-1. According to health workers, patients with lymphatic filariasis, also called elephantiasis, have been reported from these 2 places in the past year.

Lymphatic filariasis, a mosquitoborne parasitic disease, is caused by filarial worms transmitted by different kinds of mosquitoes, including culex, anopheles, and aedes. It is the second [commonest? - Mod.SH] major infectious disease after leprosy that causes permanent and long-term disability in Nepal.

"Baglung 135 cases of elephantiasis between July 2021 and April 2022," said Dev Prakash Ghimire, public health inspector. According to Suraj Gurau, chief of the health office in Baglung Municipality, 19 other patients with elephantiasis are taking regular medication for the disease in Baglung Municipality.

The risk of the spread of vectorborne diseases in the communities has become a matter of public health concern, and the local units are encouraging people to adopt preventive measures this summer. Ram Prasad Khanal, chief of Baglung Municipal Health Branch, says Baglung Municipality plans to spend Rs 2 million [about USD 16 500] this fiscal year to conduct an awareness programme in every ward to inform and educate the local residents about vectorborne diseases and preventive measures to avoid mass breakout of such diseases.

"We plan to implement mechanisms to control the spread of vectorborne diseases in the communities," he said. "Narayansthan and Kushmisera villages are situated near the banks of Kaligandaki River. The local climate creates a conducive environment for insects and bugs to thrive; therefore, the risk of vectorborne diseases is higher in these areas." Baglung Municipality has also started filling ditches, covering open holes, and cleaning dirty ponds with the onset of summer.

"Studies have shown that the culex mosquito transmits elephantiasis, the anopheles mosquito transmits malaria and the aedes mosquito transmits dengue and all of these mosquitoborne diseases have been found in Baglung Municipality," said Gurau, chief of the health office in Baglung Municipality.

According to Sharma, the public health inspector, a study conducted by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division found mosquitoes in Baglung Municipality can transmit nine different types of diseases. "Most of these infections cause fever and body aches and can be life threatening as well," said Shailendra Pokhrel, virologist at Dhaulagiri Hospital in Baglung. "Dengue and Japanese encephalitis are the most prevalent here."

According to the World Health Organization, elephantiasis has affected 40 million people in 83 countries. Of those affected, one third are in Africa and one third in India, while the rest are in other parts of South Asia. WHO has made a worldwide commitment to eliminate the disease by 2020.

[Nepal implemented a national effort to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2020 through mass drug administration (MDA) using diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (ALB). Clearly the goal was not achieved.

One study comparing pre- and post drug administration (Ojha CR, et al. Impact of mass drug administration for elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Nepal. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017; 11(7):e0005788; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005788) found an antigen positive prevalence between 1% and 20% before drug administration and 0.0% to 1.9% after.

The study concluded that "Although Nepal has achieved significant progress towards LF elimination, 5 rounds of MDA were not sufficient to disrupt the transmission cycle in all districts, probably because of high baseline prevalence." - Mod.EP
