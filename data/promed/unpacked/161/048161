The residents of Al-Dimas town in Rif Dimashq governorate [25 km or 15.5 miles northwest of Damascus] have complained of the occurrence more than 70 cases of hepatitis among the residents, mostly among students, over the past 2 weeks. Many family members of the patients have suggested that the spread of the disease in the town is due to contamination of the drinking water network, because the network is older than 40 years. They demanded sterilization of the toilets and the drinking water tanks in schools and ensuring that they are clean and sterilized continuously.

The director of the Directorate of Health of Rif Dimashq, Yassin Na'nos, denied to Al-Watan the occurrence of any case of hepatitis A among the students. He indicated that the infection has been reported among the residents and confirmed the recovery of 17 persons with viral hepatitis, while one patient remained in the process of recovery. He denied what the residents have claimed about having 70 cases and noted that a medical team was sent to the town and found that the number of cases is within the normal range.

Na'nos pointed out that 6 random samples were collected from the main drinking water network and were analyzed by a committee in the Directorate of Health. The analysis showed that the drinking water was safe and free from contamination except for one sample. The water unit was ordered to increase the chlorine content to reach the sampling site.

Na'nos indicated that another medical team would be sent in cooperation with the Directorate of Education and School Health Unit to take samples of water pipelines and drinking water tanks in schools for analysis. Any water tank that is not suitable for use will be disposed of, and an alternative one will be installed, and the tank that needs cleaning will be cleaned. Al-Watan learned from local sources that the Directorate of Education in Qudsaya district and the School Health Unit that were assigned to check the schools have observed that the toilets were not clean, especially in the mixed secondary school.

In turn, the mayor of Al-Dimas, Mohammed Mustafa Hjairi, indicated that 30 students got the infection, mostly from the mixed secondary school, and all of them are in the process of recovery. He stressed that the issue is not confined to students in the town only, but there are cases among the students studying in the neighboring areas or Mezzeh region in Damascus.

Hjairi explained that there will be follow-ups and adoption of a series of precautionary measures to ensure the safety and health of the residents in the town, such as sterilization of water tanks and cleaning them and ensuring the safety of drinking water fountains in schools and the cleanliness of the toilets.

[If indeed the cases are not due to hepatitis A (negative anti-HAV IgM), then the presumed fecal-oral spread disease may be caused by hepatitis E, presumably genotype 1, another waterborne cause of viral hepatitis that can cause substantial outbreaks including fatalities, especially in late semester pregnant women. An outbreak is currently occurring in Namibia.

Rif Dimashq Governorate, literally, the "Governorate of the Countryside of Damascus," is one of the 14 governorates of Syria. It is in the southwestern part of the country and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_Dimashq_Governorate. - Mod.LL
