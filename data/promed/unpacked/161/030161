A man who died last month in a New York hospital is reported to be the
first fatality caused by a strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ exhibiting
intermediate level resistance to vancomycin. Other patients [see
ProMED-mail archived references cited above from Japan, and New Jersey and
Michigan in the USA, have recovered.
The patient who died was an elderly man suffering from renal failure.
Thirty-eight contacts (hospital personnel and family members) were tested
[presumably by nasopharyngeal swab cultures - Mod.ES and no carriers of
the organism were found.
Dr. Barbara DeBuono, New York State Health Commissioner, has stated that:
"this isolated case poses no risk to the public."
The Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta (CDC) has recommended isolation of
any patient found to be infected with vancomycin-resistant strains of
_Staphylococcus aureus_.

[Vancomycin is viewed as the current last hope for treatment of infections
caused by strains of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Gram positive cocci
that have acquired genes for beta lactamase enzymes that render them
resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Such bacteria often carry
genes that impart resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents as
well.
Vancomycin acts by binding to the substrate of the transpeptidase enzyme(s)
used by bacteria in cell wall synthesis, thereby preventing cross-linking
of bacterial cell wall polymers. The penicillins and cephalosporins also
inhibit this step in cell wall synthesis, but by a different mechanism,
i.e. by binding to the transpeptidase enzymes at or near their active site
pockets. Bacterial beta lactamase enzymes inactivate penicillins and
cephalosporins, but vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is not a
substrate for beta lactamases. Bacterial resistance to vancomycin can
result when bacteria acquire genetic information that alters their cell
wall components such that vancomycin can no longer bind, but transpeptidase
enzymes can still effect cross-linking of cell wall components. Over use
of antibiotics like vancomycin will accelerate the emergence of resistant
strains of bacteria, and most hospital infection control officers have made
efforts to limit its use to circumstances that absolutely require it. -
