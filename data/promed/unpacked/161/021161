Bulgaria uncovers 3rd FMD flare in poor Strandzha region
--------------------------------------------------------
[Veterinary authorities reported] that 14 foot and mouth disease
[FMD] infected animals have been confirmed in the south eastern
Bulgarian village of Gramatikovo. This is the 3rd flare of FMD in the
southeastern Strandzha Mountains region for January [2011], after the
disease was discovered in the villages of Kosti and Rezovo.

About 1100 blood samples of animals from the region have been tested,
out of which only the 13 announced on Monday [31 Jan 2011] were found
to be positive.

All animals susceptible to FMD in the village of Gramatikovo will
have to be killed, which amounts to 1 cow, 38 sheep, and 111 goats.
The movement of animals through Gramatikovo has been completely
forbidden; there are also limitations on the movement of people.
Owners will be remedied [compensated? - Mod.SH] in accordance with
Bulgarian and EU legislation.

The sparsely populated Strandzha is not a major producer of meat in
Bulgaria. Residents fare on livestock breeding and tourism.

[A map showing the location of Gramatikovo is available at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BU/39/Gramatikovo.html>; its
distance from the nearest previous outbreak, in Kosti, is 10.92 km
(6.79 mi). It can also be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Bulgaria at <http://healthmap.org/r/0q3P>.

Official confirmation and notification are anticipated; it will be
interesting to note if the identification of the reported cases has
been initially based on clinical findings or on serological tests. -
