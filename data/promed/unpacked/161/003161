[Human cases of avian H7N9 avian influenza continue to occur sporadically throughout southern China with no subsequent transmission from person-to-person. The patients are generally middle-aged or elderly and often have underlying morbidities. The numbers recorded so far have been few in relation to the population potentially at risk. - Mod.CP]
