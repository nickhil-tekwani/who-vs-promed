The Marquette County Health Department (MCHD) has said Eastern equine encephalitis, commonly known as EEE, has been identified in Marquette County. The health department said that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) found EEE in a ruffed grouse.

"The presence of EEE in wild bird populations is a strong indication that EEE is carried by local mosquitos in Marquette County and throughout the UP [Upper Peninsula]," MCHD said in a release. The main takeaway for humans, and their pets, is to take precautions to prevent mosquito bites from the start.

"...EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the US, with a 33% fatality rate among humans who become ill," the health department noted. While EEE can be contracted from mosquito bites, it does not spread person to person.

Signs of EEE include sudden fever, chills, and body and joint aches. Serious symptoms will follow.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is maintained in an endemic transmission cycle involving ornithophagic mosquitoes, specifically _Culiseta melanura_ (Diptera: Culicidae) and passerine birds in freshwater swamp foci. Serological evidence suggests that numerous species of birds are exposed to this virus.

The ruffed grouse (_Bonasa umbellus_) is a medium-sized grouse inhabiting forests from the Appalachian Mountains across Canada to Alaska. This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable (red list category) under the range size criterion.
