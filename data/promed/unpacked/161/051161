On 18 and 19 Dec 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of 2 new laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The 1st patient is a 62-year-old man from Guangdong Province. He became ill on 11 Dec 2013 and was admitted to hospital on 16 Dec 2013. He is currently in critical condition. He has a history of exposure to live poultry.

The 2nd patient is 38-year-old man from Guangdong Province. He became ill on 9 Dec 2013 and was admitted to hospital on 18 Dec 2013. He is currently in critical condition.

The Chinese government continues to take the following surveillance and control measures:
* strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
* reinforce case management and treatment;
* conduct risk communication with the public and release information;
* strengthen international collaboration and communication; and
* conduct scientific studies.

Additionally, an 80-year-old male reported earlier by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), Hong Kong SAR, China died on 26 Dec 2013.

So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.
