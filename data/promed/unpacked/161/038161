[The Japanese epizootic is speedily expanding to very alarming dimensions,
though, so far, only one outbreak (no. 9) has been detected outside the
initial infected area. The involvement of pigs, prolific virus producers,
is contributory to the spread.

It will be interesting to note the reportedly identified details of the
Japanese virus strain O/JPN/2010 which, according to the information above,
is "similar to the one found in the Asia outbreak". No genotyping results
of the current Japanese isolate(s) are available on the website of the
WRLFMD (Pirbright). 2010 isolates from both S Korea and China (Hong Kong)
have been found to be FMDV serotype O, topotype SEA (South East Asia),
genotype/strain Mya-98 with close genetic similarity. For the genotyping
results and a dendrogram, visit
