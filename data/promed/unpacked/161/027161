Researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding a disease that
has wiped out more than half the Tasmanian devil population but say
there is no easy solution for stopping its transmission. They say a
lack of genetic diversity in the devil population is allowing the
devil facial tumor disease to spread quickly.
Scientists have discovered that none of the animals are mounting an
immune system attack on the disease, making it particularly
devastating. The cancer cells in all infected devils are genetically
identical, indicating the disease originated from a single animal.
"We propose that this tumor arose in a single individual and has
spread through the population by biting during fights for food and
mates," Dr Katherine Belov from Sydney University's School of
Veterinary Science said. The immune system of the original animal did
not recognize the tumors as foreign. And because Tasmanian devils are
all genetically similar, their bodies did not recognize that the
tumors were foreign cells and attack them.
"This information provides a deeper understanding of the nature of
the disease and will aid in developing effective disease control
strategies," Dr Belov said. "Essentially, there are no natural
barriers to the spread of the disease, so affected individuals must
be removed from populations to stop disease transmission."
Dr Belov said Tasmanian devils had lost genetic diversity in the most
important gene region for the immune system, the Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The devils all had a similar MHC
type to the tumor, she said. "What also worries me is that many other
wildlife populations are going through similar bottlenecks: koalas on
Kangaroo Island; platypuses on King Island," she said. "Loss of
genetic diversity in these genes just opens the door for emergency
and rapid spread of new and old disease."
The research, a collaboration between Sydney University, the
University of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Department of Primary
Industries and Water, and the Australian Museum, has been published
online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The disease emerged in the devil population 10 years ago and has
spread through eastern Tasmania, threatening the existence of the
species in the wild. Once the cancer becomes visible and spreads
internally through the body, the animal usually dies within a few
months from starvation and the breakdown of body functions.
Scientists predicted at a devil forum in Hobart earlier this year
[2007] that the species faced extinction within 10 to 20 years at the
current rate of decline.

[This is sad news. The most disturbing part of this article is the
comment about removing the diseased animals. ProMED-mail post
20070218.0616 contains the following: "Rodrigo Hamede, a specialist
on the cancer who traps and monitors the animals, says 'If the devils
are ever going to develop immunity -- and to my mind that is the best
bet -- by removing creatures you are making it less likely.'"
They are running a pilot program on an isolated peninsula where all
the diseased devils they capture are killed. There is some evidence
that this approach is working to protect the overall population,
because, over time, the average age of the animals they capture has
become older, suggesting that more animals are avoiding the cancer
and surviving longer. But the program is expensive, and Hamish
McCallum, chief scientist of the Devil Facial Tumor Program said his
team was not yet sure about its effectiveness in stopping the disease.
There is no test to detect the disease in pre-tumorous animals. If
there is no test for the pre-tumorous animals, then clearly they are
proposing removing those animals that have visible tumors. This
moderator has seen no reports indicating the expensive experiment
mentioned above has proven successful. So the question is: How do
they know this is the right thing to do to still save the animal
population? - Mod.TG]
