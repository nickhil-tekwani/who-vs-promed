Abstract
_Trypanosoma evansi_, the causal agent of Surra, is a salivarian African trypanosoma introduced in America during the 15th century. In this study we report the 1st case of African trypanosomiasis in Uruguay. We describe clinical signs and the evolution of the disease on a Uruguayan Cimarron dog, as well as the isolation and molecular characterization of the _Trypanosoma evansi_ reported strain. This constitutes the 1st case of Surra in Uruguay, showing the expansion of the parasite to the south of the American continent. Future work is needed to identify the vector and possible reservoirs in order to avoid the spread of the disease. The epidemiological relevance of the findings are discussed.

[As series of cases from India and Sri Lanka were reported by ProMED-mail in between 1999 to 2007, our entomology moderator at that time, Professor Mike Serivice from the Liverpool School of Tropical medicine wrote:
"Species of _Trypanosoma_, such as_Trypanosoma evansi_, are widely distributed in Central and South America and also Asia and infect domestic and wild animals causing animal trypanosomiasis. In the absence of tsetse flies other biting flies such as tabanids and stable flies are the vectors (Mod.MS)." (Trypanosomiasis - India (West Bengal) (02): 20050122.0223).
Thus the report is not surprising and _Trypanosoma evansi_ does not pose a risk to humans in South America. - Mod.EP]

[_Trypanosoma evansi_ caused severe anemia in horses and pronounced leukopenia in dogs, both naturally infected. The horses presented microcytic normochromic anemia and the dogs showed microcytic hypochromic anemia. The clinical signs observed were fever, anemia, edema of the legs and lower parts, weakness and inappetence. Light microscopic studies demonstrated that _Trypanosoma evansi_ produced several alterations in erythrocytes of dogs and horses. These pathologic changes included vacuolation, acanthocytes, dacrocytes, codocytes, microspherocytes and bizarre shapes. Mature erythrocyte were observed adhered to trypanosomes. Erythrophagocytosis was also demonstred. - Mod.TG
