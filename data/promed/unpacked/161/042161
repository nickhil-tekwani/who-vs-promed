Dozens of immigrants have been recently reported sick with varicella (chickenpox) in Mexicali immigrant shelters, a state official said.

State Chief Epidemiologist Oscar Zazueta said the number of Central American immigrants who have been confirmed with the illness has climbed to 51. Over half of those cases were found at the Alfa y Omega shelter. Agency staff found another 15 at the state's Family Development Office shelter and 8 more at the Hogar de Angeles shelter. Two additional cases were reported at Hijo Prodigo shelter.

Zazueta said 36 cases have been reported in Tijuana.

Authorities said a request was made to the Mexican government to distribute chickenpox vaccines. According to Zazueta, the government agreed to send 1000 vaccines that will be primarily given to minors who have not been vaccinated.

[Given the close confinement of these refugees and the likelihood that the immunization schedule has not been completed, it is not surprising that diseases such as varicella will occur. Accumulations of susceptible individuals, such as military recruit camps and college campuses, experience periodic outbreaks of transmissible diseases including mumps and meningococcal infection. Although the medical information available related to the young people who have died in these camps is not really available, meningococcal disease has likely occurred.

It would be prudent that immunizations should be given. - Mod.LL
