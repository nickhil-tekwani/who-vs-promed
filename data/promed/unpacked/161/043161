- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 [monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2] response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder region, with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].

- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with a focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental-positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample, also from Waberi district, Banadir province, collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.

- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2.

Indonesia
- No cVDPV1 cases were reported this week.
- 1 cVDPV1-positive isolate from a healthy community contact was reported from Yahukimo, Papua province. The sample was collected on [13 Feb 2019].
- In total, 3 genetically linked cVDPV1 isolates were detected from Papua province. In addition to the above-listed isolate, cVDPV1 was isolated from an AFP case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and from a sample of a healthy community contact, collected on [24 Jan 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

[Unfortunately, there continues to be significant circulation of both the wild polioviruses (WPV) and the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) documented in the above weekly report. While there are no newly confirmed cases of WPV-associated disease, the WPV has been isolated from multiple locations in both Pakistan (all 4 provinces with positive environmental samples) as well as Afghanistan (Hilmand, Kandahar, and Nangarhar provinces). If one reads the article below, one sees there have been 2 newly confirmed cases reported in Pakistan, not as yet included in the weekly global summaries.

As for the cVDPVs, Nigeria has reported its 3rd case in the recently newly identified state of Kwara, but environmental samples were positive for cVDPVs in 4 other states (Borno, Kano, Tobe, and Katsina). In Niger, cVDPV2 were isolated from 5 healthy contacts in Zinder region, and in Indonesia, 1 cVDPV1 was isolated from a healthy contact with the sample taken in February 2019.

[2] Pakistan: 2 new cases (Sindh, FATA)
Date: Thu 21 Mar 2019
Source: The Express Tribune [edited]
https://tribune.com.pk/story/1934333/1-karachi-reports-first-polio-case-year/


Two new polio cases emerged in Khyber tribal district and Karachi on Thursday [21 Mar 2019], bringing the total number of cases to 6 in the ongoing year [2019].

While a 12-month-old toddler from Landi Kotal contracted the virus, the victim from Karachi is a 3-year-old minor.

According to focal person on polio eradication Babar Atta, the cases are symptoms of an underlying problem: heavy virus circulation in sewage and the environment. "On PowerPoint, everything is a green, [but] on ground a big fat red," he tweeted.

A separate statement issued by the Sindh government gave details on the case from Karachi: "It is with great regret that we announce the 1st polio case of Sindh in 2019, as a 36-month-old female child has tested positive for the virus in UC 9 Lyari town," the communique read.

The statement quoted provincial DG Health Masood Solangi claiming that the child had received oral polio vaccine multiple times; however, she had a history of illness, suffered from malnourishment, and was low on immunity, and hence developed weakness in her limbs.

"However, the child will not suffer from paralysis, as she was vaccinated with OPV on multiple occasions and has fully recovered," he was quoted as saying.

Coordinator [of the] emergency operation center of the Polio Eradication Initiative Umer Farooq Bullo said, "The Sindh government will respond strongly, and a campaign is planned in the city from [25 Mar 2019."

He urged parents to take responsibility and comply with recommendations given by health experts and cooperate with polio teams.

A total 12 poliovirus cases were reported from the country in 2018.

[Positive environmental samples in KP Tribal Areas and Sindh (Karachi) can be explained by the identification of 2 new cases. The addition of these cases to the global total will increase the global total of reported cases associated with WPV infection to 8, and that of Pakistan to 6. A table showing the distribution of reported cases by province and year can be found at http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces.

Given the described recovery of the case in Sindh, it is unclear if this case will be reported as a confirmed case. We await further information on this case. - Mod.MPP]
