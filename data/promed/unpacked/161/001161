More than 40 military staff and recruits at an academy in central Switzerland were taken to hospital on Thu 4 Jul 2019 after they suddenly fell violently ill, the government said.

In a statement, the Swiss defense department said that on Thu 4 Jul 2019 afternoon, 43 recruits and members of the Jassbach academy in Linden, in Bern Canton, suddenly suffered from acute gastrointestinal problems, with diarrhoea and vomiting.

"As a result, all 43 service members were sent by ambulance and helicopter to hospitals and military medical facilities," the statement said. An army spokesman told the ATS news agency that 4 of those affected were in a critical condition.

The authorities were still trying to determine the cause of the disease outbreak.

As a precaution, the canton of Bern has imposed a quarantine on the Jassbach site, which specialises in cyber-defense training, the statement said.

[Norovirus, also known as stomach flu or a stomach bug, is "a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea," according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It leads to 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the United States every year.

The commonest symptoms are stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Fever, headache and body aches can also be signs of norovirus.

CDC says that symptoms usually develop 12-48 hours after a person is exposed, and most people recover within one to 3 days. Norovirus can lead to dehydration, particularly in young children, older adults and those with other illnesses. Although there is currently no vaccine or medication to treat those with norovirus, it is recommended that sick people drink a lot of liquids to prevent dehydration.

Norovirus can spread easily and quickly, particularly in crowded environments. It can spread through contaminated food, contaminated water, contaminated surfaces, and through sick people. Some of the commonest places for norovirus outbreaks are cruise ships, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities and at restaurants or catered events where groups of people are in close contact with each other in enclosed areas.

If anyone has any further information on the etiology of these cases with gastrointestinal symptoms, ProMED looks forward to you sharing it with us. The symptoms and situation are very much like a norovirus outbreak, as described above, but some cases seem more severe than norovirus generally is. Note that most cases generally recover within 1-3 days, yet in the situation described in this report, 4 individuals affected were in a critical condition, and others were hospitalized. - Mod.LK
