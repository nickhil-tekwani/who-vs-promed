A woman was bitten by a possibly rabid fox in the Vail area on [Wed 10 Jan 2018].

According to a news release from the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the woman was walking on a path along the Pantano Wash in Rancho Del Lago at about 11:30 a.m. when the fox attacked her. She was apparently bitten on her calf as she tried to kick the fox away. She is being treated for possible exposure to rabies.

The fox was found dead after apparently drowning in a golf course pond after the attack. Its body was submitted for rabies testing. The fox had been reported earlier in the day and was acting erratically.

Foxes are among the principal rabies hosts in Arizona along with bats and skunks, though other animals can get rabies, too. Rabid animals may appear disoriented or intoxicated, salivate heavily or appear thirsty.

Game and Fish Regional Supervisor says people should never approach wildlife that is behaving abnormally. "Avoid contact with and don't approach wildlife that is behaving abnormally or appears to be ill," Vega said in the release. "If you believe that you see a rabid animal, call us at 1-623-236-7201 or the Pima County Health Department at 520-724-7797 immediately. In addition, avoid touching any dead wildlife that you may find, and keep your pets away from them as well."

Animal owners should consult a veterinarian if their animal is injured by wildlife.

[To find Vail, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/AZ/Vail.html

Arizona is one of the major states for fox rabies; see https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/wild_animals.html.

So while it is speculative that this woman was exposed to a rabid fox, though its behavior was typical, and that the drowned fox was the animal causing the trouble, it is a sound initial position to take. And remember the sooner one is vaccinated after exposure, the more likely is survival.

In Arizona, there are at least 3 strains of rabies circulating in the environment. The ones that are most commonly identified are the big brown bat, grey fox and skunk strains. Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise, and Coconino counties have the highest number of animals that test positive for rabies. In 2009, 280 wild and domestic animals tested positive for rabies; rabies was detected most frequently in skunks, followed by bats and foxes.
