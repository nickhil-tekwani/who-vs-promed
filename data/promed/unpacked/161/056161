The Waikato Domestic Bee Association (WDBA) is calling on all Hamilton [Waikato] beekeepers to help rid the city of the hive-destroying American foulbrood disease (AFB). An AFB infection causes death of the honey bee (_Apis mellifera_) larvae. The disease is in almost all countries where honey bees are found.

The AFB bacterium produces resistant, long-lived spores and an infected beehive will usually be killed by the disease. The infection can be present in a beehive but not initially visible so the disease is easily spread by interchanging equipment, dividing or selling hives. AFB spores can survive more than 35 years and withstand boiling water and are resistant to a range of disinfectants.

Beekeepers who find AFB in one of their hives must notify the AFB Pest Management Agency within 7 days and destroy the infected hive to prevent infection spreading. This includes killing the bees, then burning all parts of the hive as well as any honey. The association aims to make Hamilton the 1st AFB-free city in New Zealand.

The programme involves using a new diagnostic tool to test all hives in Hamilton this year [2017] as an annual event to clear the city and ensure it stays free of AFB. Samples of bees from hives in the city will be tested for AFB using DNA testing to identify the disease before it can be detected visually.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
