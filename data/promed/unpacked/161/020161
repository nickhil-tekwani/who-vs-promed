China: 3rd Toddler in Hong Kong Contracts Enterovirus 71 Infection
---------------------------------------------------
A 3rd Hong Kong toddler has been confirmed with the potentially deadly
enterovirus 71 in a recent outbreak at a local nursery, the Health
Department stated on Thu 27 May 2004.
Enterovirus 71 killed 50 children in Taiwan in 1998, and 30 in Malaysia
1997. It is one of several viruses that causes hand, foot and mouth disease
-- whose symptoms include sores or rashes on those body parts, as well as
fever.
The latest Hong Kong enterovirus 71 case is a 2-year-old girl, Hong Kong's
Health Department said in a statement. She attends the same nursery as 2
other toddlers who came down with the virus and went on to develop hand,
foot and mouth disease, the statement said, adding those 2 children have
since recovered.

[The Hong Kong Department of Health and the Social Welfare Department held
a seminar on enteroviral infection on Thu 27 May 2004 for staff members of
childcare centres.
(Press release: <http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>).
A Health Department spokesman stated that: "Enteroviruses including
enterovirus 71 (EV-71) can cause a variety of illnesses primarily among
young children, such as hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). HFMD tends to
be more common in summer months. So far this year, there were 6 reported
cases of EV-71 affecting children below the age of 5. They have all
recovered and did not develop any complications." [The new case described
above would appear to be additional to these 6 cases].
The spokesman stated that the seminar was held to promote vigilance against
enteroviral infection in childcare centres, where this disease commonly
occurs. Staff who attended the event were briefed on the symptoms and
characteristics of the disease, and how to take effective preventive
measures in their institutions. These include: washing hands before eating
and after going to toilet and changing diapers; covering mouth and nose
when coughing and sneezing; maintaining good ventilation; and cleaning
thoroughly toys or appliances which are contaminated by nasal or oral
secretions. - Mods.MPP/CP]
