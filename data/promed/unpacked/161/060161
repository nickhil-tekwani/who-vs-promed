Sporadic influenza activity in the WHO European Region
------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 15/2011 [11-17 Apr
2011] by 35 member states in the WHO European Region.
- Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute
respiratory infection (ARI) activity are below baseline or at
pre-season levels in most countries.
- Hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are
declining overall in countries with sentinel hospital-based
surveillance for SARI.
- 10 per cent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or ARI,
and 4 per cent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients, tested
positive for influenza.
- Influenza B continues to make up most of the influenza detections
from sentinel sites in the Region this week.

Current situation -- week 15/2011 [11-17 Apr 2011]
--------------------------------------------------
During week 15/2011, low influenza activity was reported in 22
countries and 2 reported medium intensity. ILI or ARI consultation
rates have returned to pre-season levels or are below the national
baselines in all of the 21 countries reporting clinical data this
week. Among the 25 countries reporting on the geographical spread of
influenza, most reported no or sporadic activity (21 countries). Local
spread was reported in 2 countries (Armenia and Croatia), while 2
reported regional spread (Georgia and Lithuania). The impact of
influenza on health care systems was low in all but one (Armenia) of
the 17 countries reporting on this indicator.

Data on sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were reported
from 8 countries: Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Republic of
Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine. SARI
hospitalizations are declining overall and appear to have reached
pre-season levels in Kazakhstan, Romania, and Serbia.

Virological situation -- week 15/2011 [11-17 Apr 2011]
------------------------------------------------------
Ukraine reported pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus to be
dominant, and it was co-dominant with influenza B virus in 3
countries. Influenza B virus was reported as the dominant type in 5
countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 310 respiratory specimens, of which 31
(10 per cent) were positive for influenza virus: 5 (16 per cent) were
influenza A and 26 (84 per cent) were influenza B. All influenza A
viruses were subtyped: 2 as pandemic A(H1) and 3 as A(H3). In the 6
countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity
ranged from 5 per cent to 18 per cent, with a median of 8 per cent
(mean: 9 per cent). In addition, 203 non-sentinel specimens were
reported positive for influenza: 104 (51 per cent) influenza A and 99
(49 per cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 81 were
subtyped: 71 (88 per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 10 (12 per cent) as
A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals representing 8 of 10 countries participating in
SARI surveillance collected 112 SARI specimens, of which 4 (4 per
cent) were positive for influenza. Among the 3 countries testing 10 or
more sentinel SARI specimens, the percentage testing positive for
influenza ranged from 0 per cent in Ukraine to 5 per cent in the
Russian Federation.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-15/2011 [4 Oct 2010-17
Apr 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 83 042 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 58 911 (71 per cent) were influenza A and 24 131
(29 per cent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 46 957
were subtyped: 45 211 (96 per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 1746 (4 per
cent) as A(H3).

>From week 40/2010 through week 15/2011 [11-17 Apr 2011], 1531 out of
5484 sentinel SARI specimens (28 per cent) tested positive for
influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 871 (57 per cent) were
influenza A and 660 (43 per cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 691 were subtyped: 638 (92 per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 53
(8 per cent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 4728 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 2427 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1963 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 155 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 181 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 2 were
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 565 influenza viruses, 150 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 130 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 12 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 5 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 29 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 20 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 163 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
3533 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Of the 3183 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were
tested, 3091 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 92 viruses (3 per
cent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 92 viruses were resistant
to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. Four influenza
A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to both
inhibitors. All of the 346 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 340 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 197 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 10 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
Influenza activity has returned to pre-season levels in most
countries across the WHO European Region, along with a continued
decrease in the percentage of ILI and ARI sentinel specimens testing
positive for influenza. Influenza B accounted for 84 per cent of the
total positive specimens collected this week [11-17 Apr 2011],
although the majority of virus detections since the start of the
season have been pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009. Countries with
hospital-based sentinel surveillance continue to report SARI
hospitalizations, although numbers are declining overall, along with a
decreasing proportion of samples testing positive for influenza.

[In brief, of the 35 countries in the European region submitting
reports for this period only Armenia, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Moldova, Lithuania, and the Russian Federation reported significant
activity.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. In addition, clicking on France, the
Russian Federation, Turkey, and UK (England) will provide regional
data for these countries. - Mod.CP]
