In response to the recent discussion on resistance among _Acinetobacter_
sp. due to the PER-1 enzyme, we analyzed The Surveillance Network (TSN)TM
Database-USA (reference) for prevalence of resistance in this common
nosocomial pathogen. For 6,833 strains, 1,386 (20.3%) were resistant to
ceftazidime; for 7,037 strains, 1,910 (27.1%) were resistant to
piperacillin, and for 2,367 strains, 552 (23.3%) were resistant to
ticarcillin.
Without molecular typing, it is not possible to determine how much
resistance is mediated by the PER-1 enzyme, but analysis of our TSN
Database-USA shows that resistance to ceftazidime, piperacillin, and
ticarcillin is common. Imipenem resistance, however, is not prevalent.
While resistance to imipenem has been documented, among 6,428
_Acinetobacter_ sp. strains in the TSN Database-USA, only 172 (2.7%) have
an imipenem-resistant profile.
REFERENCE
TSN Database-USA is a repository of millions of in-depth, strain-specific,
qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial test results reported daily, via
a network of computer interfaces, by health care institutions across the
United States. Upon receipt, the data is held in quarantine for a period
of five weeks during which time it is processed through a series of
computerized quality control filters and reviewed by the scientific staff
here at MRL Pharmaceutical Services in Reston, VA to ensure accuracy. At
the end of that period, the validated data are merged into the national TSN
Database-USA. At the time of this inquiry, TSN Database-USA contained
9,393,109 susceptibility test results from 649,176 strains provided from
107 institutions.
