Raw mung bean sprouts linked to more than 230 salmonella cases in South Australia (SA) originated in Queensland but health authorities don't know where they were contaminated. Almost half of the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Saintpaul cases have developed during the past 12 days and 43 people have been admitted to hospital since the outbreak began in December 2015, SA Health says. Chief medical officer Paddy Phillips, who usually sees fewer than 20 cases of the strain each year, has urged people not to eat raw bean sprouts and food outlets not to serve them raw. The seeds came from Queensland before being sprouted and packaged in South Australia but SA Health hasn't confirmed where they were contaminated.

"Because we've got the positive (result) from one of the factories, we're working through other factories and we're working right back through the processing chain doing a forensic examination with PIRSA (Primary Industries and Regions SA)," Prof Phillips told ABC radio on Friday, 22 Apr 2016. "The reason why we're not asking people to recall them ... is because you can make them safe. Ditch them or blanch them for 10 seconds in boiling water and you should be OK."

A salmonellosis outbreak which has hospitalized 12 people across Darwin [Northern Territory] has been traced to tainted mung bean sprouts. Centre for Disease Control acting director Peter Markey said it was thought the salmonella outbreak was linked to a similar one in South Australia. Some supermarkets have withdrawn mung bean sprouts from sale.

Dr Markey said word had been passed onto vendors at markets in Darwin including Parap, where a bowl of laksa topped with fresh sprouts is a Saturday tradition for many Territorians. He advised laksa fiends to go without the sprouts for the time being. "We don't think it's enough to just pour the hot laksa over the bean sprouts," he said.

[Laksa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa) is a popular spicy noodle soup in the Peranakan cuisine, which is a combination of Chinese and Malay cuisine. Laksa consists of rice noodles or rice vermicelli with chicken, prawn or fish, served in spicy soup; either based on rich and spicy curry coconut milk, or based on sour asam (tamarind or gelugur). It can be found in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Southern Thailand.

It seems that the outbreaks are related. - Mod.LL
