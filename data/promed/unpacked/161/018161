The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen has recorded a total of 39 688 suspected cholera cases and 183 associated deaths during the period 22 to 27 June 2017. According to a WHO Daily Epidemiology update today, [Thu 29 Jun 2017], 231 364 suspected cholera cases and 1439 deaths have been recorded since 27 Apr 2017.

The overall case-fatality rate is 0.6 percent although it is higher in some areas and among certain age groups. While cholera is endemic in Yemen, the country has experienced a surge in cholera cases during the past 2 months, with nearly 5000 cases reported per day. Ongoing conflict, destroyed health, water and sanitation infrastructure and malnutrition have caused the people to be more vulnerable to diseases, including cholera.

WHO and health partners are actively supporting the Ministry through a cholera task force to improve cholera response efforts at the national and local levels. This includes the establishment of diarrhea treatment facilities, oral dehydration centers, training of health workers to manage cases, water purification in communities, deployment of rapid response team to manage cholera cases investigations and respond to the outbreak, enhancement of Yemen's disease early warning surveillance systems, and provision of emergency medical supplies to treatment facilities.
