A Victorian farm is in quarantine and 1000 sheep have been vaccinated against anthrax after a sheep was killed by the deadly bacterial infection. Agriculture Victoria says it has quarantined a Swan Hill property after anthrax was identified on [Fri 3 Mar 2017]. There are no restrictions on people or vehicles moving on and off the farm, but no animals can be moved.

Agriculture Victoria said infections were common among cattle and sheep in that part of the state and the public was not at risk. "The risk to the general public is negligible as you have to have very close contact with infected carcasses to have any risk -- and even then the implications are relatively minor," Victoria's chief veterinary officer Charles Milne told AAP on [Mon 6 Mar 2017].

One animal on the farm has been confirmed as having anthrax and another 33 animals that died in recent weeks are suspected to have contracted the disease. Their carcasses were burned as a precaution. About 1100 sheep on the property have been vaccinated and all animals at properties bordering the affected farm have also been treated as a precaution, Dr Milne said. A quarantine will be in place until the vaccine is takes effect.

Anthrax is a bacterial infection commonly found in the soil during hot, dry conditions, and it causes a rapid death once animals are affected. There are very few symptoms before death, although in this latest case, the sheep had symptoms of acute pneumonia, Dr Milne said. People from the affected farm have been offered testing and authorities say there is no impact on local produce or food safety.

Quarantine measures are in place at a sheep property near Swan Hill in Victoria, with at least one confirmed case of anthrax. Animal health staff were called to the property in north west Victoria after a number of sheep died suddenly.

Victoria's chief veterinary officer Charles Milne said anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria and has been found in Victoria before. "One animal that has died on the farm has been examined and confirmed as having anthrax," he said. "We had 33 other animals that have died, some of which may have died from anthrax but testing has not been able to be undertaken on those because they died some time ago. There have been a number of other deaths on the farm, the carcasses of all the animals have been destroyed so any residual infection is removed. The animals on the farm have all been vaccinated to ensure that if there is any residual infection in the environment they are protected. A ring of farms around the premises will also be vaccinated over the coming days."

Farmer being monitored for the disease
--------------------------------------
Veterinarian Charles Milne said it was difficult for the disease to jump to humans and expressed confidence the quarantine measures would protect the general public from exposure. But he said one farmer was being monitored for signs of the illness. "There is a very low risk of human infection; you will actually need to handle the infected material to be at risk," he said. "So in terms of risk to the general public, it's absolutely nil. But one of the farmers who is on the premises has had a lesion that might be consistent with anthrax and that is currently being monitored by the medical authorities."

Urged to report sudden stock deaths
-----------------------------------
Dr Milne said producers needed to be on the lookout for the disease and contact authorities if there were any unexplained stock deaths. He said symptoms were hard to spot before the animal died but blood may be present around the nose, mouth, and anus of carcasses. "It develops very rapidly and often the 1st sign is death; that is why when animals die on farms we undertake anthrax testing as a routine," he said. "That means the risk of anthrax moving off the premises is extremely low because animals will die before there is risk of spreading infection. We have on occasion had multi-premises outbreaks but they are usually associated with extremely dry years, which is not the case this year."

There are a number of lessons to be learnt from this Australian sheep anthrax outbreak. The most obvious one is to not ignore unexpected livestock deaths. By delaying, this outbreak went from one animal dead to 34, and this then put neighbouring livestock at risk. Hopefully the owners of any livestock subject to secondary outbreaks do not have lawyers.

Secondly this outbreak was forecast by a posting last July 2016, which covered a PLoS publication on GARP [genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction model system] niche modelling _Bacillus anthracis_ ecology in Australia; see 22 Jun 2016: Anthrax - Australia: niche modeling of historic distribution 20160622.4302780. The full reference is

Barro AS, Fegan M, Moloney B, et al. Redefining the Australian anthrax belt: modeling the ecological niche and predicting the geographic distribution of _Bacillus anthracis_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016; 10(6): e0004689. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004689
http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004689

And if you bring up this paper check out figure 3, "Predicted geographic distribution of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Australia based on GARP ecological niche modeling" and you will see that outbreaks in this part of Victoria were predicted. This is one of the valuable uses of GARP niche modelling. It tells one clearly where any surveillance programmes must be concentrated. And this is not the 1st time that such a model was shown to be correct and of value.

In my experience of this disease over many years, sheep anthrax deaths are commonly overlooked initially. I suspect it is because of the low value of individual sheep. The threshold for reporting is around 6 to a dozen deaths for flocks of some 100 ewes. For flocks of some 1000 ewes it starts getting reported at 2 dozen deaths, at least in South Africa. In Australia it seems that the reporting threshold approaches 3 dozen deaths. For peasant farmers with just a few dozen sheep their problem is that they can be invisible to their government veterinarians and response to any reports may be slow, if at all. - Mod.MHJ]
