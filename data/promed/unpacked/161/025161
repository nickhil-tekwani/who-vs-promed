Three pregnant women have suffered miscarriages, and nearly 200 people have been hospitalised with [listeriosis] as an outbreak of the infection grips Spain's holiday spots.

A nationwide alert has been sent out after _Listeria_, bacteria which can cause a type of food poisoning called listeriosis, were suspected in packaged pork. Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis and sometimes results in lifelong harm or even death.

Two of the miscarriages happened in Seville and the other in Madrid. One devastated mother lost her baby at 32 weeks, while the others lost their little ones just 8 weeks into pregnancy. Most of the 197 cases have occurred in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, but people have fallen ill across the country, from Madrid to the island of Tenerife.

Spanish authorities have said that as many as 5 pregnant women may have lost their babies to the outbreak, and 3 people may have died, but stats are yet to be confirmed. At least 67 people have been hospitalised, the majority in Seville. Of these, 23 are pregnant women who are under antibiotic treatment, and 3 are patients admitted to intensive care units.

Authorities are investigating whether a pork product sold by Seville-based Magrudis could be the source of the outbreak after several of those struck down were found to have eaten it. The product under investigation is a pack of meat called "Mecha," of which a batch of 2000 are thought to be the source of the contamination.

Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to listeria, when bacteria may cross the placenta to infect the baby, who has no immunity. Spain's Health Minister Maria Luisa Carcedo said: "We are monitoring this; alerts have been sent out, and we've ordered that all products (that have come) from this factory since May 2019 be pulled from shelves." She said an investigation is looking into how the meat evaded what she called "strict food safety controls."

A spokesman for the firm said recalls had been put in place and an investigation launched into the possible source.

The Spanish consumer organisation FACUA warned that the outbreak could get worse, as many people don't show symptoms straight away. It can take up to 4 weeks for people to fall ill.

Spanish officials are also investigating whether a Brit tourist may be the 1st foreign national to become infected with _Listeria_, as an outbreak of the infection is gripping the country's holiday spots. According to local media, the man consumed meat while on holiday in Seville. The man, whose name and age have not been revealed, was later diagnosed with the bacterial infection listeriosis after he arrived in France where he was hospitalised.

Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, and sometimes results in lifelong harm or even death.

[The listeriosis outbreak is now reported to extend throughout Spain, although most cases are occurring in Seville. The news report above says that the outbreak has involved 3 miscarriages, and a case in a tourist from the UK who is now hospitalized in France is suspected to have been acquired in Seville.

_Listeria_ have been identified in 3 meat products and in needles used to inject lard into the meat before it is cooked; after cooking, the meat is usually served cold and in thin slices. Proper cooking of the meat should have killed _Listeria_, which suggests either that the meat may have been improperly cooked or that contamination may have also occurred after cooking. All products from this meat processing facility in Seville have now been recalled.

Because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases can be expected.

Genotyping clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ will help identify clusters of cases that have a common source, and genotyping the isolates from the food and environmental surfaces at the meat processing facility will help confirm the source, if genotypes match. We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak. - Mod.ML
