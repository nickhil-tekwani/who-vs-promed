[It is indicative of a chronic risk that the only animals affected here were too young to have been vaccinated in early April 2021 when all the others were vaccinated. The pathogen was waiting to infect them, whether from a contaminated livestock grave or from contaminated livestock feed. If it were commercial feed, other farms receiving this batch of feed would be at risk of cases unless vaccinated. Young lambs and kids are not aggressive grazers. A puzzle.

Experience has taught me that it would be worthwhile to revisit this farm and walk around, talk to the farmer and his workers. You will see the answer, even if it is in 2 or 5 years' time. And talk with the neighbouring farmers, who may reveal something of value, knowingly or unknowingly. And write it all down, as memories are unreliable. - Mod.MHJ
