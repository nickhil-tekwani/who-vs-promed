A 32 year-old French participant to Ecochallenge Sabah 2000 exhibited high
fever, chills, sweats and arthralgias. Symptoms appeared on 4 Sep 2000 and
were followed by a renal syndrome. A serum was received at Pasteur
Institute (National Reference Center and WHO Collaborating Center for
Leptospira) for leptospirosis diagnosis on 12 Sep 2000. Results obtained on
14 Sep 2000 showed a typical result for early acute phase of leptospirosis:
macroagglutination: positive, ELISA IgM: highly positive (1/3200) and
microagglutination test (MAT) slightly positive. The higher MAT titer was
1/400 against [the grippotyphosa serogroup.
At least 2 other partners of the patient were ill, but they live in [the
South
of France and at the present time no further information about them is
available.
