CORM ROT, SAFFRON - INDIA: (JAMMU AND KASHMIR), UPDATE

Mir Shakeel Ahmad, director of Mir Kesar Products Pvt. Ltd., one of
the prominent saffron exporters of Kashmir: "Saffron is facing a
tough time presently. There is shortfall in production, because of
drought from past few years, which led to a disease of the crop --
the saffron corm gets damaged with a disease, which is highly telling
on its production. At present, the demand for saffron is high but
there is a shortfall in supply.

"There are more than 2 lakh [200 000] people who are directly or
indirectly involved with the saffron trade. The crop covers an area
of 5000 acres (2023 ha) in various places -- Pampore, Budgam,
Pulwama, Anantnag, and Kishtwar. Kashmiri saffron is considered no. 1
in the world.

"The main problem of saffron in Kashmir is the diseases in seed
[corms]. The problem got aggravated as we do not have alternate
sources of irrigation, other than rainwater. The disease of the corm
has highly affected our production. Our production in 2007 was 60
percent less than in 2006. Similarly, in 2008 it was 40 percent less
than 2007. This yearly decline in production has given a major
setback to our industry. Saffron has a tremendous scope for export
and a huge market in India."

[Saffron (_Crocus sativus_) is an important crop used as a spice and
for pharmaceutical purposes. Corm rot is a great threat to the
saffron industry particularly in India. Fungal pathogens such as
_Fusarium_, _Penicillium_ and _Rhizoctonia_ species have been
reported from corm rot affected saffron crops. For example, more than
20 percent of the saffron area in Pampore (Pulwama district) is
reported to be highly infected with inoculum of _Fusarium
moniliforme_ var. _intermedium_.

When up to 80 percent of the crop in Kishtwar (Doda district) was
affected by a corm rot during 2005/2006, the fungus _Athelia rolfsii_
(previously _Sclerotium r._) was identified as being associated (see
link below). The disease starts as small patches in a field that
gradually enlarge each year. Symptoms include brown, sunken,
irregular lesions below corm scales. Leaves from severely infected
corms dry up from the tip downwards. White fungal mycelia appear on
the corms and they rot. Sclerotia may be formed and pathogen
transmission through infested soil has been demonstrated.

Longer planting cycles and replanting of unsorted corms are
considered the main reason for increased corm rot incidence. Stress
factors like the drought reported above may have contributed to a bad
yield but are not a cause of the disease. Disease management includes
cultural measures and corm treatment with fungicides.
