The number of confirmed mumps cases at UW-Madison [University of Wisconsin, Madison] continues to increase. 5 student cases have been identified at this time and UHS [University Health Services] continues to work with public health officials to monitor the situation.

Mumps is a contagious viral illness that spreads by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

While most people who have been given the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are usually protected for life against mumps infections, the illness can still occur in previously immunized persons.

Faculty and staff should take the following steps to stay healthy and prevent spreading mumps:
1. Watch for symptoms, even if you have been vaccinated, and stay home if you are sick. If you experience mumps symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling of the cheek and jaw area) contact your private healthcare provider.

It's a campus expectation that anyone suspected of having mumps stays home from school, work, or similar activities for 5 days. We encourage faculty and staff to allow students with mumps symptoms to stay home from class and work, and to provide alternate arrangements.

There is no treatment for mumps, but you can soothe your symptoms by getting plenty of bed rest, taking over-the-counter pain killers such as ibuprofen or Tylenol to relieve any pain, and drinking plenty of fluids.

2. Take a page from the flu playbook with preventive actions. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water; sneeze and cough into a tissue or your elbow; and avoid sharing drinks, food, and utensils.

3. Check your immunization records to make sure you've had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. See your private healthcare provider or local pharmacy if you need a 2nd dose.

[ProMED-mail appreciates this report from Dr Welter. Mumps outbreaks can be difficult to control on university campuses and unfortunately, immunity is sometimes incomplete, even after appropriate immunization. Another larger outbreak was recently reported in the Ohio State University campus. Most universities in the US require proof of immunity to mumps at the time of enrollment.
