Why are additional laws needed? I am not a lawyer, but aren't existing libel
laws sufficient? This type of legislation seems to be aimed at censorship
and to prevent knowledgable individuals from informing the public of
potential hazzards. These laws seem more dangerous to the public than the
food producers!
To paraphrase Will Rogers, I fear for our freedom whenever a legislature is
in session!
