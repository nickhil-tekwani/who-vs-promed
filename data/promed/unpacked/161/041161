Deadly bird flu spreads in Burkina Faso
---------------------------------------
Burkina Faso is preparing to cull more poultry, after the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain of bird flu 1st detected near the capital last month spread to
2 more towns, the government said late on Friday [19 May 2006].
The disease had been confirmed in Bobo-Dioulasso, the 2nd city, some 360 km
(220 miles) west of the capital Ouagadougou, and in Sabou, around 100 km
west of the capital, the government said. A new outbreak had also been
found in Ouagadougou itself.
The impoverished West African nation 1st confirmed in early April 2006 that
it had found the virus in poultry at a motel on the outskirts of Ouagadougou.
It has since isolated the area and culled birds within a 3 km (2 mile)
radius. "The original site has been disinfected. But the measures will be
stepped up, and the same ones will be taken at the new sites," Animal
resources minister Tiemoko Konate told reporters. He said the new cases --
found in traditional artisanal rather than modern farms -- had been
confirmed on Friday [19 May 2006] after tests carried out by the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) at its laboratory in Weybridge, England.
Neighboring Ivory Coast became the 6th African country to be hit by H5N1
this month [May 2006]. The virus has killed more than 100 people around the
world since 2003.
World Health Organization officials fear human cases have gone undetected
in West Africa due to poor health services. So far, the region has no
confirmed human infections, though in another part of the continent, 5
[should read 6] Egyptians have died from the virus.
Konate said tests had been carried out on the staff working at the motel in
Burkina Faso where the virus was 1st found but said that no human cases had
been discovered.

[A map of Burkina Faso can be found at
<http://go.hrw.com/atlas/norm_htm/burkina.htm>. Burkina Faso sent to the
OIE an "Immediate notification report" on 4 Apr 2006, notifying a single
outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in the village Gampela, province of Kadiogo. The
affected species was helmeted guineafowl (_Numida meleagris_). No further
reports have been sent since. - Mod.AS]
