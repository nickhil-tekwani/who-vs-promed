CATERPILLAR PLAGUE - BRAZIL
===========================
Subject: "Killer caterpillars return to southern Brazil"
SAO PAULO, Jan 5 (ex Reuter) - Apparently, caterpillars are spreading
fear in southern Brazil, where 20 people have been taken to hospital
recently after touching them, authorities said on Friday.
The caterpillars, which secrete a potent venom through their skin,
have killed nine people over the past two years, Celso Bernardon,
a public health official, informed Reuters. A public awareness
programme has been initiated in Santa Catarina.
Contact with the venom causes a burning sensation and spotting on the
skin. If left untreated, it can lead to high fever, bleeding from the
nose and ears, kidney failure and death, said Luis Dalla Costa, a doctor
in the Santa Catarina city of Chapeco. Since December, 20 people have
been treated in hospital after contact with the caterpillars, Costa said.
In most cases, unsuspecting victims grab a tree trunk or another
object where the caterpillar rests. But authorities are concerned that
children, attracted by the greenish worm-like creature, might become
curious and want to feel it. It grows to a length of two inches (5 cms).
It is appears every year from December to March. The pupal and adult
forms are harmless.
Once just a rural phenomenon, the caterpillars this year are migrating
into urban centres, turning up on porches and in the fruit trees of
suburban gardens. This apparent increase is being blamed on the excessive
use of toxic fertiliser killing the caterpillars' normal predators.
