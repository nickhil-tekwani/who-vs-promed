An _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection mainly results from eating uncooked
food, drinking contaminated water and unpasteurized milk, and working
with cattle. Diagnosed with this potentially deadly _E. coli_ strain,
one child has succumbed to the disease, and 3 other children are
recovering following the outbreak of the disease at the Vancouver,
Washington, day care center, according to the health officials.

The 4-year-old boy who died of the disease was hospitalized on 19 Mar
2010 after he was found infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacterium.
Soon, 3 other children were also admitted but they have been released
after the treatment. Further, the officials informed that 22 children
and 4 adults were also tested. Out of these, 6 tested positive for
the strain but they were not admitted as they showed no symptoms of
the disease.

The health officials are confident that the infection has not spread
further, and they are closely investigating the cause of the disease.
The cause of the cluster is yet not known, but the officials are
certain that the bacteria did not come from food or water. The
outbreak could be the result of unhygienic conditions at the state
day care center as hands are not washed properly after toilet use or
diaper change.

In a statement, Clark County's health officer, Dr. Alan Melnick said,
"In investigating this particular outbreak, we were not able to find
a point of source or specific food or beverage item that caused the
infection. What it seemed like was that there was some person to
person transmission going on in the day care," he added.

[The risk of person-to-person transmission of this pathogen (as well
as with shigellosis) is substantial because infection may be spread
by a smaller number of bacteria in general than salmonellosis and
campylobacterosis. In day care outbreaks, secondary cases may also
occur in siblings not attending day care. - Mod. LL]
