The horror mouse plague has coincided with a spike in a rodent-borne bacterial disease in Queensland with case numbers almost doubling in 2021. The Sunshine State [a nickname for Queensland because of its tropical and sub-tropical climates] has reported 78 cases of leptospirosis to date this year [2021], compared with only 41 cases at the same time last year.

The case numbers might not seem like a lot, but the rate of infection has grown 70 per cent compared with the 5-year average.

A total of 81 cases were reported in 2020, and 56 in 2019 according to Queensland Health.

The disease is caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria, found in the urine of infected animals including mice, rats, cattle, pigs, and dogs, Professor Keith McNeil, a spokesman for Queensland Health, said.

Leptospirosis has been reported in Cairns, the Hinterland, and Darling Downs regions.

Symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, vomiting, and red eyes and can develop about 14 days after becoming infected. "Symptoms can be similar to the flu so often it can be difficult to recognise and can be mistaken for other diseases," he said. "Serious disease such as meningitis, kidney failure, bleeding, and respiratory complications can develop from leptospirosis infection if it's not treated promptly, so it's important to see your doctor immediately if you suspect you have had exposure to contaminated water, soil or mud, and develop these symptoms within a week or two," he said.

"Leptospirosis is a notifiable condition that is most common in tropical and subtropical areas like northern Queensland and it can potentially cause serious illness," Professor McNeil said. "While leptospirosis is treatable with antibiotics, early diagnosis is still the key. The bacteria can enter the body through skin cuts or abrasions or through the lining of the mouth, nose, and eyes by exposure to water, soil, or mud contaminated with the urine from infected animals. Agriculture workers are most at risk, such as those working with animals, or cane or banana farm workers, but it can also be caused by drinking or swimming in creeks, rivers, or lakes contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Waters affected by heavy rain or flooding are especially risky. That means people who participate in camping, gardening, bushwalking, and water sport pursuits can also be at risk of infection as they may have contact with contaminated water, soil or mud during these activities."

He said because there are multiple strains of the bacteria, a person can be infected multiple times. "As the wet season ends and we move into the cooler dry season, we would expect to see less cases of leptospirosis based on previous year trends," he said.

Prof McNeil recommended several measures people could take to protect themselves from leptospirosis: "If you work with animals, make sure you cover cuts and abrasions with a waterproof dressing, wear protective clothing such as gloves and boots, shower after work, wash, and dry hands frequently, and do not eat or smoke when handling animals," he said.

Tips to protect yourself from leptospirosis
- Practice good hand hygiene and wash hands with soap properly and regularly, especially before eating or drinking
- People should treat or boil water especially if collecting from a source that could be contaminated by floodwater run-off
- Avoid swimming or wading in water where there is a chance of contamination with animal urine or floodwater run-off
- Cover cuts and abrasions with waterproof dressings, especially before coming into contact with soil, mud, or water that may be contaminated with animal urine
- Wear protective footwear outdoors, especially when walking in mud or moist soil. Avoid walking barefoot on muddy surfaces or in muddy water, particularly if you have cuts or abrasions on your feet or legs
- Wear gloves when gardening
- Control rodents by cleaning up rubbish and removing food sources that are close to housing and thoroughly clean any areas where rodents have been.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_.

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar specific. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease (such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever). Canecutter's disease apparently got its name from leptospirosis that occurred among mainly immigrant canecutters in Queensland, Australia in the 1930's; infected canefield rats, present in large numbers during the wet summers of the early 1930s, spread the disease through their urine (see http://libcom.org/history/1934-queensland-canecutters-strike).
