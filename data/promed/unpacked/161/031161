An outbreak of hepatitis C infection in a dialysis center in Tarragona
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following an association complaint that dozens of
patients were infected, the Department of Health
has opened an investigation to clarify the
numbers involved and the origin of the virus infection.

This morning [9 Feb 2010] the Government has
confirmed the existence of an outbreak of
hepatitis C virus infection in a dialysis clinic
in Tarragona, the Santa Tecla Renal Institute.
This is a private dialysis clinic that had
infected a dozen kidney patients, according to a
complaint of the Patient Advocate Association
(ADEPA). The Health Department has opened an
investigation to determine how many users of the
clinic might have become infected and to shed light on the origin of the virus.

The infection occurred last December [2009] when
dialysis clinic representatives communicated the
alleged negligence to the infected patients,
according to the ADEPA complaint. The clinic also
warned of the need [of patients] to take
precautions with relatives to avoid any
[transmission of] infection through wounds or
bleeding. They are treating an "undefined number
of patients but more than a dozen," according to the association.

Hepatitis C is a contagious disease that affects
the liver, causing inflammation of the organ and
preventing its proper functioning. It spreads
through contact with of infected blood which can
occur through medical practices applied without proper sterilization.

The Health Department is conducting an analysis
of samples taken in order to determine if that
[the dialysis clinic in question] is the source
of the infection, said a department spokesman.
ADEPA regretted the "occultness" of the health
center in not wanting to specify the number of
infected patients as well as requesting the
Terragona Prosecutor's office to initiate an
investigation to establish responsibilities.

More than 10 patients are infected with hepatitis
C in a dialysis clinic in Tarragona
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The infections presumably occurred during
dialysis sessions at the Santa Tecla Renal
Institute. More than a dozen renal disease
patients have been infected by hepatitis C virus
during dialysis sessions at the Santa Tecla Renal
Institute in Tarragona, according to the
Association's Patient Advocate (ADEPA) and
sources confirmed to Europa Press Center.

There is still an "undetermined" number of
[infected] hemodialysis patients, but certainly
more than a dozen, said the president of ADEPA,
Carmen Flores, in a statement to Europa Press
criticizing the "occultness" of the institute
towards revealing the actual number of infected individuals.

The events date back to [3 Dec 2009] when
representatives of the clinic met with a number
of patients infected with the virus at different
times, when the negligence was reported.
Testimony from patients confirmed the clinic's
statement. In view of the advanced age of some of
the patients they were reassured that they had no
need to be concerned since the disease [i.e.,
cancer, liver failure] does not develop until
after 20 years. Also they were informed of the
need to take precautions with relatives to avoid
any infection through wounds, bleeding, cleaning
supplies and toiletries such as razors, towels and underwear.

After these events, one patient who had been on
the waiting list for a [kidney] transplant for 4
and a half years, was referred to a specialist at
the dialysis clinic where it was explained that
he could not [now] accept a kidney due to the
[risk of] hepatitis C infection. Subsequently a
hepatologist at the Joan XXIII Hospital reviewed
the blood [data] collected at the dialysis
clinic, and carried out more comprehensive
testing, which no longer revealed traces of the
virus, probably because the patient's own body
must have eliminated it, and therefore, he could
possibly have received the kidney. Nonetheless,
half a day later the kidney had already been
transplanted to another patient on the waiting
list, according to the association.

Besides the above mentioned case, the association
cited 4 others, some more serious. The Santa
Tecla Renal Institute in Tarragona said that
cases have been notified to the Regional Ministry
of Health of the Government, which investigates
the causes of such incidents, and is "following" the course of each case.

The Regional Ministry of Health is conducting a
"phylogenetic analysis of the samples to
determine the origin of the virus," according to
a statement to Europa Press by a department
spokeswoman Marina Geli. The chief prosecutor
asked the Tarragona Director of ADEPA, Javier
Jou, for an ex officio investigation to determine
the number of patients involved, the origin of
the contagion and the accountability.

[Hepatitis C virus infection is the most common
chronic bloodborne infection. Sixty to 70 percent
of persons newly infected with hepatitis C virus
typically are usually asymptomatic or have a mild
clinical illness. Chronic hepatitis C virus
infection develops in 70­85 percent of hepatitis
C virus-infected persons; eventually 60­70
percent of chronically infected persons have
evidence of active liver disease. The majority of
infected are not clinically ill, but infected
persons serve as a source of transmission to
others and are at risk for chronic liver disease.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is most efficiently
transmitted through large or repeated
percutaneous exposure to infected blood (e.g.,
through transfusion of blood from unscreened
donors or through use of injecting drugs).
Although much less frequent, occupational,
perinatal, and sexual exposures also can result in transmission of HCV.

Accidental transmission of hepatitis C virus
infection may occur in hemodialysis clinics as a
result of lapses in medical procedures, from
insufficiently screened blood supplies and
occasionally from hepatitis C virus-infected
patients as a result of multiple use of needles
and reagents. The route of transmission of the
infection in the Tarragona incident is unclear
due to the "occultness" of the clinic management.
Further information is requested.
