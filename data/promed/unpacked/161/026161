1. In my letter of 19 Mar 2003 I indicated that antibodies against
Low-Pathogenic Avian Influenza [LPAI] were detected in Dinteloord.
This was based on 3 positive results; all other 1297 surveyed poultry
farms were found negative. Subsequent to these results, additional
investigations have been carried out by the CIDC-Lelystad [the
Central Institute for Animal-Disease Control]. This involved samples
collected in 2002 and kept frozen in the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine in Utrecht. Virus isolation trials have demonstrated that
the relevant virus was a low-pathogenic variant, confirming the
presence in the Netherlands at the end of 2002 of an H7 LPAI virus.
According to the tracing that was carried out, it is very probable
that the infection has spread to the Gelders Valley by various
contacts. Presumably, the virus mutated to become a highly pathogenic
variant and caused the outbreak on 28 Feb 2003.
2. In my letter of 5 Mar 2003 [see ref 20030306.0552] I indicated
that the AI virus was initially found to affect humans; this was
reported to you at the same time by the Minister of Public Health,
Welfare and Sports. In order to find out whether the current epidemic
may have caused infections in other animal species, I have started an
investigation concerning the presence of Avian Influenza among pigs
in mixed farms within the defense zone of the Gelders Valley. The
first results show that many pigs have produced antibodies against
Avian Influenza H7N7, which is the virus responsible for the current
outbreak in poultry.
It is known that pigs may harbour multiple viruses, hence enhancing
the possibility of virus mutation ("mixing vessel" theory) and
infection of humans. At present, upon the advice of the Food and
Non-Food Authority (VWA) in the Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Sports (VWS), the risks to public health by infected pigs are under
assessment. This investigation should find out whether, and to what
extent, further infection occurs among pigs. Aside from the effect of
such data upon public health, they may also have consequences
regarding the poultry industry and the repopulation of affected farms.
Pending this investigation I have announced today a stand-still of
the transportation of pigs and pig-manure within the protection and
buffer zones. This concerns both mixed farms as well as farms
containing exclusively pigs. This stand-still is directly supported
by the advice of the Outbreak Management Team Influenza (OMT),
responding to the VWS, and of the CIDC in Lelystad. A summary of the
said investigation is appended [see 2].

Advise of VWA regarding Avian Influenza in pigs
-----------------------------------------------
On 13 infected poultry farms that also maintain pigs, the pigs were
randomly sampled to investigate the occurrence of AI infection. It
was demonstrated by the H7N7 HAR-test that in 5 of the said farms, a
large number of the pigs had antibodies against the influenza variant
responsible for the current outbreak in poultry. This has been
confirmed by the EU reference lab in Weybridge, UK.
It is thus most probable that this AI-virus, in some cases, can move
from poultry to pigs. Pigs are often asymptomatic carriers of the
influenza virus. Pigs are susceptible to both avian as well as human
influenza viruses. The literature [supports the possibility of]
transmission of the influenza virus from pigs to humans: in several
known cases, avian and human influenza types have been transformed to
new types in pigs (re-assortment).
Following consultations with other relevant authorities, the VWS
forwarded the following questions to the OMT staff for early
investigation:
1. What is the extent of H7N7 influenza-virus spread in pigs - within
and among farms?
2. Is there a possibility that the H7N7-virus appears in pigs
together with human influenza types?
The following activities have already been undertaken:
1. Follow-up of the seroconversion in the 5 positive pig farms,
including H7N7 serology in all pigs, as well as pharyngeal swabs
(PCR) sampled throughout the farm, one sample per pen, at least 60
samples per farm. Attention should be paid to clinical ILI
(influenza-like illness) symptoms (conjunctivitis, etc.).
2.Serological surveillance in preventively culled mixed (poultry and
pigs) farms as well as exclusively-pigs farms, currently limited to
the protection zone in the Gelders Valley.
3. Serological monitoring of positive farms, to investigate the
possibly presence of other virus types circulating within the pig
population.
Pending the results obtained, the WVA, in consultation with the other
authorities, will propose to the OMT staff additional investigational
activities, and will advise on further control steps.

Bird Flu Spreads in Europe, Human Health Concerns
---------------------------------------
A severe Dutch outbreak of bird flu is seen spreading across Europe,
mildly infecting humans and prompting fears that a mutated version of
the virus could spark a flu epidemic in people, authorities said on
Thursday.
The Dutch Agriculture Ministry, grappling to contain a month-long
outbreak that has spilled into Belgium and is nearing the German
border, said there was a danger that bird and human flu could mix in
pigs and produce a mutation against which humans have no resistance.
"It is possible. Until now avian flu has not been able to be
transmitted from one person to another -- if it does...it could cause
a large number of infections," World Health Organisation spokesman
Iain Simpson told Reuters. "There have been a number of influenza
pandemics over the centuries, and the last one was in the late 1960s,
so there is a view that we're overdue another one, although that
doesn't mean it's going to happen anytime soon," he added.
While the WHO, the global human health agency, said it was possible
that the disease could turn into a serious human epidemic,
international food and animal health authorities dismissed the idea.
Several farm workers in the Netherlands suffered from eye infections
caused by bird flu. The new worry is that the disease could mutate
and jump to humans after several pigs were found to have antibodies
to the avian flu.
Nerves are jangling in Germany, as bird flu approached to within 1.5
kilometers of the German border on Thursday. French, British,
Portuguese, and Spanish authorities were less concerned, despite
worries that migrating wild birds could spread the disease. The chief
form of transmission, however, is consumption of infected materials
or feces.
"The situation is extremely precarious," German Junior Agriculture
Minister Alexander Mueller said in a statement on Thursday.
In the Netherlands, 15 million out of more than 100 million birds
have been slaughtered as authorities battle to suppress its spread.
German authorities have announced new measures to combat the disease,
with orders to farmers to report any reduction in poultry flocks'
performance, bans on pigeon racing, and appeals to people not to take
pet birds on Easter holidays to the Netherlands and Belgium.
"We are now waiting and hoping," said Stefen Sallen, spokesman for
the farmers' association in North Rhine Westphalia, the state next to
the closest Dutch case. "It would be a terrible blow for us if it
comes into Germany."
"The most common method of spread of this virus is [the oral/fecal
route]. While it's true that migratory birds could spread the disease
-- that is always with us -- what's happened in this instance is that
the virus has mutated from [one that infects] wild birds into [one
able to infect] domestic poultry," said a spokesman for Britain's
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
"We're always aware of the risk of avian influenza from migratory
birds. However, the outbreak from Holland doesn't necessarily mean
the risk is heightened -- it's always with us," he added. "The danger
of infection is actually much [higher] through poor biosecurity," he
said, adding that UK farmers had been issued advice on maintaining
[stringent] disease prevention measures.
But British pig specialist Dr Michael Meredith said the spread via
migratory wild fowl was inevitable. "There is a risk here -- if the
virus gets into the wild bird population it will be very difficult to
control," he said. Meredith also raised the possibility of a new
virus hybrid. "Pigs have been kind of a mixing vessel for the big
pandemics over the years. They're susceptible to avian flu and human
flu. When the 2 viruses get together they can form a hybrid virus,
which has the malignancy of the avian virus," he said.
International food and animal health authorities dismissed worries of
the bird flu turning into a serious human disease.
The Paris-based International Animal Health Organisation (OIE) said
there was no clear evidence of any risk to consumers. "There is no
way this could turn into a human virus like SARS," Alex Schudel, head
of OIE's scientific and technical department, told Reuters.
Peter Roeder, animal health officer of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), said tough controls were now in place to curb the
spread of the disease, but he could not rule out the possibility that
wild fowl, such as ducks, geese, and swans, could spread it.
"The indications are that the avian flu is still spreading and is not
under control," Roeder said, ruling out any link between the avian
flu and SARS.
"There is no link at all," he said. "They are caused by 2 different
agents. SARS is very clearly a very different virus from the avian
flu virus."

[The letter of the Dutch Minister of Agriculture (which is the 12th
since 3 Mar 2003 - see
<http://www.minlnv.nl/infomart/parlemnt/2003/>), as well as its
appendix (item 2), provide important epidemiological data on the
evolving outbreak. The data still expected from the relevant Dutch
research institutes are essential for accurate risk assessment, which
may in turn inform the difficult decisions about further control
measures, particularly the fate of pigs in (clinically) unaffected
farms. As my colleague, Moderator Martin Hugh-Jones, remarks,
"Logically there is no reason why these pathogenic mutations should
always take place in Southern China. A possibility is not a
probability, but it may behoove us to be aware of the chance in the
coming weeks."
This HPAI outbreak is now seriously threatening further spread in
Europe, where a second country -- Belgium -- most probably has on its
hands the first confirmed outbreak. It seems to have become since 28
Feb 2003 an epidemiological event of exceptional magnitude. In the
meantime, 218 farms have been found infected, and additional 22 are
considered "seriously suspected." As of 17 Apr 2003, the number of
culled birds reached 15.7 million. All public events which involve
possible contacts among animals (including horses, ponies, donkeys,
cows, sheep, goats, and pigs) such as exhibitions, fairs, markets,
auctions etc. -- are banned. - Mod.AS]
