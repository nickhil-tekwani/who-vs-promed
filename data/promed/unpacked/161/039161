In response to your request for information on the new episodes of
"grisi siknis" in the Coco River region of Nicaragua, I have recently
returned from the area, where my organization, Intermed
International, has had active health outreach programs for the past
17 years. Although there is certainly a serious situation regarding
food shortages due to substantial crop losses, I was not informed by
the villagers in the communities that I visited -- about 10 along the
Coco River and the inland plains -- of this new epidemic of grisi siknis.

It would not be surprising, though, that such may be the case, since
the "epidemics" of this condition have in the past been associated
with situations of stress in the communities -- more recently, as was
pointed out, between December 2003 and March 2004, when more than 150
people over a vast area of the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of
Nicaragua, including the 2 main towns, were affected.
During my 4-year tenure as field director of our rural health
program, I was able to observe first-hand a number of cases of this
syndrome, which is more common in the very isolated villages of the
upper and middle sections of the Coco River, which marks the border
between the Nicaraguan and Honduran Miskito and Sumo regions.
Typically the syndrome affects teenage or young women, who suddenly
enter a catatonic-type state, alternating with episodes of agitation
and panic attacks. Although news media reports have mentioned violent
episodes, that has not been my experience. The people affected might,
during the agitation phase, try to flee while screaming in panic. I
did learn of a few cases in which the women had grabbed a stick or
other "weapon" to try to "fight off" the supposed "attackers", since
the sufferers seem to be having hallucinations of people and/or
animals trying to harm them. But by far the main danger is to the
patients themselves, who in their agitated state might suffer falls,
run into trees, or even drown in the river while trying to escape
their "pursuers".
Most of the time, though, the patient remains in a catatonic-like
state, which may last from hours to several days.
Despite 250 years of contact with Europeans, including Christian
missionaries and western medicine, traditional beliefs are extremely
strong in Miskito society. These are deeply spiritual people who
typically attend Christian churches and actively participate in
services, but under the surface keep their traditional animist
beliefs very much alive and well. Central to these are beliefs in a
host of creatures, including the souls of deceased relatives or
neighbors who have died violently or suddenly, as well as those of
animals (e.g. the evil Lhasa, or Jaguar's Soul) and mythological
creatures, like Liwa Mairin or Evil Siren. The experts who are called
upon to deal with this protean range of spirit creatures are almost
as many as the spirits themselves: ukuly or prophets, sukias or
witchdoctors, uhuras or curanderos (herbalists), and dilman or evil
witchdoctors, to mention just a few.
The local belief is that the cause of grisi siknis, better known
among the locals as pauka prukan, is a sorcery put into the person by
an evil witchdoctor or dilman. No Western medicines, including
anticonvulsants or antidepressants, seem to have any effect, the most
effective "treatment" involves the intervention of the "good
witches": sukias and ukuly.
Treatment involves a range of interventions including chants,
rituals, as well as local botanicals, which might contain
psychoactive chemicals.
Grisi siknis is classified by DSM-IV as one of several Culture-Bound
Syndromes, along with "amok" of Malaysia, "cathard" of Polynesia,
"mal de pelea" of Puerto Rico, and our own Western "anorexia nervosa"
and "bulimia nervosa." It most closely resembles "pibloktoq", also
known as "Arctic hysteria" suffered by the Greenland Inuit people,
and which, just as grisi siknis, presents itself as an abrupt
dissociative episode accompanied by extreme agitation of up to 30
minutes' duration, followed by convulsive episodes and a coma-like
state lasting 12 or more hours.
For more in-depth and expert information you might want to contact
Philip Dennis, a Professor of Anthropology at Texas Tech University,
who has performed some important research on ethnological and
anthropological aspects of Miskito culture, including grisi siknis.

[If the news report had specified teenage women, I would never have
suggested an infectious or toxic etiology (infectious diseases and
toxins are not known to be gender-specific), since this age and sex
group is particularly prone to mass hysterical episodes worldwide.
The last time I said this I was taken severely to task by a supporter
of women's rights for libeling the gender, but it just happens to be
a fact -- between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass
hysteria in medical journals (see ProMED post 20020605.4409:
Unexplained rash illness - USA (multistate)(06). - Mod.JW]

I worked in the Honduran Mosquitia in 1985 briefly, and there was
indeed considerable psychological stress from the contra war and
Nicaraguan refugee resettlement at that time. There were reported
attacks of grisi siknis, or grisi munaia (literally 'going crazy') as
well in Mocoron. I did not personally witness an attack, but by all
reports and the published information on this, it's been identified
as a "culture-bound" syndrome with some affinity to other 'running
disorders' (like the so-called arctic hysteria or pibloqtoq). And
certainly it may be a culture-specific elaboration of responses to an
organic condition, as the author of the memo indicates.
The anthropologist Philip Dennis wrote a useful article on the topic
that was published in a volume on "The Culture-Bound Syndromes"
appearing about 1985 (edited by White & Marsella).

An anthropologist/physician opinion:
Latin America has a number of folk diagnoses which cannot be directly
translated into ICD-9 code, because certain features do not exactly
match. Many of these are folk explanations of syndromes we would
attribute to physical causes (ancias = anxiety disorder; empacho =
bowel obstruction), while others would translate into anger, fright,
or fugue-like states (coraje = extreme anger with violence; bilis =
unexpressed anger associated with bile in the classic Greek sense).
I have seen, in Honduras, temporal (?) lobe epilepsy in a woman
attributed to "coraje" because she would become unreasonably angry --
to the extent that she would convulse. She had such a convulsion
while waiting in line for medical care at an Army medical action
project. Phenytoin abolished the episodes.
The psychosis described, under the stressful conditions described,
strongly suggests a shared psychological disorder due to stress,
upheaval, and despair. An epidemiological study would likely show an
index case in a stressed locale, if this is a "new" syndrome. If it
is recognized in folklore, it might arise simultaneously in several such areas.
