Musso D, Nhan T, Robin E, Roche C, Bierlaire D, Zisou K, et al. Potential for Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion demonstrated during an outbreak in French Polynesia, November 2013 to February 2014.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Since October 2013, French Polynesia has experienced the largest documented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection. To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3 per cent) of 1505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever.

Zika virus infection in French Polynesia: implications for blood transfusion
----------------------------------------------------------------
French Polynesia, in the South Pacific, has experienced the largest reported outbreak of ZIKAV infection, which began in October 2013, with an estimated 28 000 cases in February 2014 (about 11 per cent of the population), concomitantly with the circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1 and 3. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of ZIKAV infection resulting from transfusion of infected blood has not been investigated. Since other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion, several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.

Discussion
----------
The main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75 per cent for DENV and West Nile virus (WNV). For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections.

Arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission has been reported principally for WNV, DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high.

During the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) and in Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-2007), blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.

Due to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained. The specificity of this RT-PCR assay has been previously evaluated and was confirmed by sequencing analysis conducted during the outbreak in French Polynesia and its sensitivity was similar to that previously evaluated.

We detected an unexpectedly high number of positive asymptomatic blood donors (42/1505; 3 per cent). To date, no post-transfusion ZIKAV infection has been reported in recipients of ZIKAV-positive blood in French Polynesia; however, haemovigilance studies are still ongoing.

Due to concomitant circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 3 since early 2013, multiplex NAT testing for DENV has been implemented from April 2013: no DENV-positive donor has yet been detected. While this might be related to a low level of viraemia in asymptomatic donors, we consider it was probably due to the low level of DENV-1 and DENV-3 circulation. Pathogen inactivation of platelet concentrates using a photochemical treatment (amotosalen) of blood products and ultraviolet A light inactivation was also implemented.

The management of a dual outbreak of ZIKAV and DENV infection was challenging because we had to test all blood donors for both pathogens, which was time consuming and expensive. In addition, in our blood bank centre, the mean delay between blood donation and production of fresh blood product available for transfusion is generally 24 hours. During the outbreaks, the mean delay was 3 days.

This report serves as a reminder of the importance of quickly adapting blood donation safety procedures to the local epidemiological context. Moreover, it should help in anticipating the needs in other parts of the Pacific region, such as in New Caledonia (South Pacific), where an outbreak of ZIKAV infection started in February 2014.

Our findings suggest that ZIKAV NAT should be used to prevent blood transfusion-transmitted ZIKAV. As recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, blood safety authorities need to be vigilant and should consider deferral of blood donors returning from areas with an outbreak of ZIKAV infection. In areas endemic for _Aedes_ species, a preparedness plan to respond to future outbreaks of ZIKAV infection should include emergency plans to sustain the blood supply.

[The response of the health authorities in French Polynesia in dealing with maintenance of a safe blood supply during a significant outbreak of a virus disease new to the area is outstanding. The logistical complications due to the geographic isolation of the islands were overcome with scientifically sound, innovative approaches for blood screening.
