Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Ponoka County, Division No. 8, Alberta
Started: 6 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The diseased animal is an 8-and-a-half-year-old beef cow.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: on [6 Dec 2021], a private veterinarian visited a farm reporting an 8-and-a-half-year-old beef cow (born [13 Apr 2013]) that was injured and displayed some neurological signs. Samples were taken as part of the national surveillance program for BSE in Canada. Rapid tests conducted at the provincial laboratory in Edmonton, Alberta were non-negative which was reported to Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). These results were confirmed by CFIA's OIE BSE reference laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta on [16 Dec 2021], as an Atypical (H-type) case of BSE. The carcass was held and did not enter the human food or animal feed chains. The detection of atypical BSE in Canada underscores the ongoing effectiveness of Canada's robust targeted BSE surveillance program. Canada continues to have in place an enhanced feed ban that includes strict controls for the exclusion of specified risk materials from the entire animal feed chain and fertilizers.

Control measures to be applied in domestic: official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country; therefore, this detection will not change the negligible risk status of Canada (https://www.oie.int/en/disease/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy//#ui-id-2).

The following has been extracted from "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) OIE Portal" at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy/#C.

"Atypical BSE refers to naturally and sporadically occurring forms, which are believed to occur in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and which have only been identified in older cattle when conducting intensive surveillance.

"In the early 2000s, atypical prions causing atypical BSE were identified as the result of enhanced surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The number of cases of atypical BSE is negligible.

"Indeed, whilst to date, there is no evidence that atypical BSE is transmissible, recycling of the atypical BSE agent has not been ruled out and therefore measures to manage exposure risk in the feed chain continue to be recommended as a precautionary measure.

"BSE is an OIE-listed disease and must be reported to the OIE, as indicated in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The occurrence of atypical BSE is not considered for the purpose of official BSE risk status recognition as it can spontaneously occur in any cattle population." - Mod.CRD
