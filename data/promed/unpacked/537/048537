Since the last week of July [2015], Executive North Regional Health officials have reported up to 16 Legionnaires' disease cases in [Portugal's] 2nd largest city of Porto, or Oporto, according to a health ministry press release (computer translated). The press release states 12 cases confirmed; however, local media put the case count at 16.

According to the official health ministry information, 10 of the cases occurred in residents of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Porto), while 2 cases were considered travel-associated. At least 2 patients are still hospitalized for their illness and they are responding favorably to treatment, health officials note.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by the bacterium _Legionella_. Additional symptoms include: headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion and diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 10 days after significant exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria. Most cases of Legionnaires' disease can be traced to plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for _Legionella_ growth, such as whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, cooling towers, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.

Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person. Groups at high risk for Legionnaires' disease include people who are middle-aged or older -- especially cigarette smokers -- people with chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems and people who take medicines that weaken their immune systems (immunosuppressive drugs).

16 people have been infected with the _Legionella_ bacterium in Oporto, 5 of whom have been admitted to hospital with Legionnaires' disease. 6 cooling towers have been closed off as a result, but the National Health Board has not specified where.

A hotel in the region has been shut down after a French and a Swedish tourist staying at the unit became infected with the bacterium, but the head of the Health Board has said that no link has yet been made between those cases and the others.

Portugal's national health authorities said on Wednesday [9 Sep 2015] that there have been no new cases of Legionnaires' disease uncovered by the investigation currently underway into the outbreak.

At a news conference in the city [Oporto] on Monday [7 Sep 2015], the director-general of health, Francisco George, said that since the last week of July [2015] there had been 16 cases of Legionnaires' [disease] reported in the Greater Oporto region, 2 of them picked up abroad.

Of the 5 people who were in hospital on Wednesday afternoon, George told Lusa, all are doing well.

There is another patient in hospital in Lisbon with the same disease, but that case is not related with those in the north of the country, he said.

On Saturday [5 Sep 2015], Porto's Hotel Boa-Vista undertook a treatment of its internal water system on suspicion of contamination by the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' [disease]. Apart from one Swedish and one French citizen who stayed in the hotel and contracted the disease, there is one other person who also stayed there and is currently in hospital in Lisbon.

The last major outbreak of Legionnaires' [disease] in Portugal was in November 2014, when 12 people died and 375 were infected in Vila Franca de Xira, north of Lisbon. [See prior ProMED-mail posts for this 2014 outbreak in Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal.] The [2014] outbreak was brought under control in 2 weeks.

[This Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Oporto, Portugal, was initially reported by ProMED-PORT in posts: Legionelose - Portugal (PO), casos confirmados, surto (?) 20150905.3625785 and Legionelose - Portugal (02) (PO), casos confirmados, surto (?), informações oficiais 20150907.3626549.

There are apparently at least 2 outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in Oporto. One outbreak is affecting people who stayed at Oporto's Hotel Boa-Vista and involves 3 people: a citizen of France, a citizen of Sweden and an additional person currently hospitalized in Lisbon.

A 2nd outbreak involves 16 patients who reside in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto, 2 of whom are said to have acquired Legionnaires' disease abroad.

Genotyping of _Legionella_ isolates will help establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens will suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens [most Legionella colonies on specialized medium are detected within 3-5 days. - Mod.JW]. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Porto, also known as Oporto in English, located in Northern Portugal, with a population of 1.4 million in 2011, is the 2nd-largest city in Portugal, after Lisbon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto). - Mod.ML
