PPV-CR: a new strain of _Plum pox virus_ from sour cherry
---------------------------------------------------------
Until 2012, 7 strains of _Plum pox virus_ (EPPO A2 list) were known:
- PPV-D (Dideron)
- PPV-M (Marcus)
- PPV-C (Cherry)
- PPV-W (Winona)
- PPV-EA (El Amar)
- PPV-Rec (recombinant between PPV-D and PPV-M)
- PPV-T (Turkey)

Recent studies have showed that PPV isolates naturally infecting sour cherry trees (_Prunus cerasus_) in the Samara and Saratov oblasts of the Volga Basin in Russia corresponded to a new type of strain, which was called PPV-CR (PPV Cherry Russia). Affected sour cherry trees showed mid-rib yellowing on the lower leaves; chlorotic or light-green patterns as well as ring spots on leaves in the middle part of the tree; and slight spotting and leaf deformation on top leaves.

This new strain is not limited to the Volga basin, as later studies detected 9 isolates of PPV-CR in the Greater Moscow area.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools) and grafting, as well as with infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. For some PPV strains, resistant cultivars are available in several types of stone fruits.

The new PPV-CR strain shares conserved unique amino acids with the other cherry-infecting PPV-C isolates which may be connected with the ability to infect cherry species or adaptation to these hosts (see link to reference below). Isolates have been obtained from different localities and environmental conditions, which suggests that the new strain is well established and competitive. A specific RT-PCR test has been developed for distinguishing PPV-CR from other viral strains.
