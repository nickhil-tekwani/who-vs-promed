A new outbreak of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported in Guizhou province, China.

The farm affected lost all of its over 23 000 birds after 7167 died and another 16 717 were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading.

The source of the outbreak is unknown, but it is being controlled by movement controls, screening, disinfection and modified stamping out.

[The HPAI H5N6 virus has been detected in poultry in China, Laos, and Viet Nam since its initial emergence in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6.

The HPAI H5N6 outbreak described in the media report above, on a commercial poultry farm, has been reported to the OIE in follow-up report no. 16, submitted 31 Aug 2016. It included the following statistics:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 23 884 / 10 113 / 7167 / 16 717 / 0

(available, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20863)

A map showing the locations of all 36 outbreaks in China reported since the HPAI H5N6 epizootic started on 23 Aug 2014 is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15957.

China applies a stamping-out policy without vaccination for the handling of all HPAI strains in poultry.

This virus can infect humans. According to WHO risk assessment, "although influenza A(H5N6) has caused severe infection in humans, until now human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human to human transmission and close contacts of the case remain healthy. However, the characterization of this virus is ongoing and its implication to the evolution and emergence of a pandemic strain is unknown. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information."

In view of its recent resurgence in humans, China's authorities have issued in January 2016 a press release reassuring the public that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N6 (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/15/c_135013921.htm). - Mod.AS
