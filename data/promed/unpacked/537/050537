In the discussion of the Japanese encephalitis [JE outbreak in Andhra
Pradesh and measures being taken or not taken to contain it, I have seen no
mention on ProMED-mail of what I suspect is one of the major reasons the
response is not emphasizing vaccination; religious beliefs.
Many Indians believe that vaccination violates fundamental precepts of
their religious beliefs because they interpret it as ingesting an animal
substance. I have heard this argument myself not only from stringently
devout Jains, from whom one might expect it, but also from devout Hindus
and Parsees, not with regard to JE vaccination but with regard to rabies
vaccines.
Rabies vaccines cultivated from monkey tissues or egg yolks, for example,
are not acceptable for religious reasons to at least a dozen of my Indian
friends--who, incidentally, are all college-educated, and include one
medical doctor.
This antipathy toward vaccination explains the use of a homeopathic
response to JE. No matter how JE vaccines are made, the belief will be that
they are animal products, and their use will be resisted for that reason.
Which brings up another point: most of the pigs at large in India are not
being raised by anyone as food. They are street pigs. They are a vital
part of the garbage disposal system. I'd be surprised if more than 10% of
the total Indian population ever eats pork: most Hindus don't, Moslems
don't, and Jains certainly don't.
