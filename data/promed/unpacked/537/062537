Health authorities have admitted to overreacting to a health scare at Auckland Airport but say it's better to be safe than sorry. They swung into action after it was suspected dozens of Japanese students who had just landed had contracted the flu. While ambulance staff were ready for the worst, the students at the centre of the scare came through the arrival gates wondering what all the fuss was about. Their flight, NZ90 from Tokyo, was halted on the tarmac just after 9 am this morning [13 Feb 2012], with 73 of the Japanese homestay students onboard suspected of carrying an unknown strain of influenza.

One passenger on the flight said there were air staff everywhere, all wearing masks, "just sort of shepherding us to different places". Passengers were left wondering why authorities took 2 hours to board the plane when they were told 2 hours before landing there was an issue. A woman passenger said it was "just confusion", and nobody knew what was happening. She said paramedics were uncoordinated in the way they were checking passengers' temperatures and pulses. She said even the captain kept coming on the intercom telling people how sorry he was, that he had no idea what the situation was, or when they could get off the plane. She said ground staff panicked when he told them he had "a bit of a cold".

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service says it took time to deal with the alert. "It does take time, and I know that can be frustrating. But it's important to get it right," said Dr Julia Peters of the Auckland Regional Public Health Service.

The health service says passengers who were sitting in seats away from the student group were disembarked 1st and then assessed for signs of illness, provided with general health advice, and cleared to leave the airport and continue their journeys.

Passengers travelling in the student group, or in seats close to this group, were separately assessed, and about 40 students were found to have a mild respiratory illness with symptoms of coughs or runny noses, it said.

None of the unwell passengers showed signs of influenza or had a feverish illness, and none required hospital assessment. These passengers were cleared to leave the airport at 12.38 pm today [13 Feb 2012], were provided with health advice, and were able to complete their journeys in New Zealand, the health service said.

The man running the homestay trip, Stuart Cundy of Let's Homestay, told ONE News he understands only a few of the students showed visible flu-like symptoms, and from that, another passenger raised the alarm.

"The whole group was actually vaccinated back in November [2011], leading into the Japanese winter. There's no influenza; there's no flu, and that's the official word from the authorities," Cundy said. The diagnosis was that a few boys in the group had mild viral illnesses, little more than the common cold. "In hindsight, we overreacted to this. But that's much better than under-reacting," said Dr Richard Hoskins of the Auckland Regional Public Health Service.

Four hours after landing, the largely healthy students left for Tauranga, after what was an eventful start to their 10-day New Zealand holiday.

[The over-reaction of the Auckland Health authorities may have been a response to a report of a current outbreak of influenza in Japan which has affected more than 2.1 million people. According to Japan Today [12 Feb 2012; http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/flu-outbreak-hits-more-than-2-11-million-nationwide], a flu epidemic sweeping across Japan has now affected people in all 47 prefectures.

The Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases said on Sat 11 Feb 2012 that as of 5 Feb 2012, the number of flu patients in Japan topped 2.11 million, an increase of 380 000 over the previous week. The number of patients visiting hospitals and clinics for flu treatment had exceeded the number during the peak week of the swine flu outbreak in 2009, when 1.89 million patients sought medical help. The institute said its figures are estimates based on data sent by 5000 medical institutions across Japan. The data showed that most patients tested were found to have been infected by the A strain of the virus, known in Japan as the "Hong Kong" strain. The institute's estimates suggest that although patient numbers decreased in 11 prefectures, they increased in 36 others.

"In previous years, this time of year would have marked the peak of the virus, but this year [2012], we are preparing for the possibility that the infection rate will continue to climb. The institute added that it believes one of the causes of the large number of infections this year may have been the unusually high number of low-humidity days, which create conditions in which it is easier for the virus to attach itself to the mucous membrane in the throat.
