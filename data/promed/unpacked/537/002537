Texas: first equine case of West Nile virus infection
-----------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests on a sick horse that was euthanized on Sat 29 Jun 2002
near Katy in far west Harris County, indicate that the animal was infected
with West Nile virus (WNV), a form of "sleeping sickness" first detected in
Texas in 2 dead blue jays on 18 Jun 2002 on the north west side of Houston.
According to the Texas Department of Health (TDH), another 29 infected
birds have since been found.
"We were notified today (Wed 3 Jul 2002) that tests run on samples of the
horse's blood and spinal fluid were positive for WNV. The tests were run
both at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) in
College Station, and at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL)
in Ames, Iowa," said Dr Linda Logan, Texas' state veterinarian and
executive director for the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the
state's livestock health regulatory agency. "The NVSL is running additional
confirmation tests on the blood samples, but more than likely, we are
seeing Texas' first case of WNV in a horse. Diagnosing WNV infection must
be based on laboratory confirmation, as the signs of the disease, including
staggering or the inability to rise, can mimic other diseases, including
rabies, or other encephalitic diseases, such as western equine encephalitis
(WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)."
WNV has spread to 20 of the United States, following the migratory flight
patterns of birds along the eastern seaboard and west as far as Texas. In
2001, 738 horses, donkeys, or other members of the equine family were
diagnosed with the disease in the US, and about 20 per cent of the animals
had to be euthanized, due to the severity of their illness. "Blue jays,
crows, and more than 70 other species of birds can carry the virus, but it
is the mosquito that puts the disease cycle in motion," explained Dr.
Logan. "After feeding on infected birds, mosquitoes ingest the virus, and
about one per cent of the pests then become infected and capable of
spreading the virus to horses or humans. There have been no documented
cases of animals or humans spreading the disease. Dogs and cats appear to
be resistant to the disease."
"Home and stable owners should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites,"
said Dr Joe Garrett, a veterinarian with the TDH's Zoonosis Control
Division. "We continue to work with other agencies to urge horse owners to
have their animals vaccinated against WNV, and with the diagnosis of this
disease in the Houston area, all possible preventive efforts are important
to stop the spread of this disease," said Dr Richard Ferris,
area-veterinarian-in-charge for the US Department of Agriculture's
Veterinary Services in Texas.
"We are investigating other potential cases in horses in Harris County and
are awaiting test results. If you live in the Houston area, protect your
horses from mosquitoes. While a vaccine is available for horses, the animal
must receive 2 doses of WNV vaccine 3 to 6 weeks apart, and full protection
does not begin until at least 4 to 6 weeks after the second dose of vaccine
is administered," he said. "I'd urge owners to take action now to get
horses protected." "If your horse becomes ill and goes off feed, sways,
develops head tremors, muscle twitches or cannot rise, contact your
veterinarian, so he or she can collect and send in samples to us for
diagnostic testing," said Dr Lelve Gayle, executive director of the TVMDL.
Laboratory confirmation of cases is particularly important for tracking the
movement of WNV within the state.
