----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The gene sequences of the virus were different from those that previously caused swine fever outbreaks in Japan, according to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry.

The report on genotype from National Institute of Animal Health (in Japanese, with figure) is available at
http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/publicity_report/press/laboratory/niah-neo/083106.html [for an updated version, see comment]

2. A total of 5 wild boars were found around the farm to be dead and positive for classical swine fever. (TBS News, 20 Sep 2018)
For a map with the locations of the infected farm and of 4 wild boars found dead, as well as for the boars that were tested and found to be positive (in Japanese) see https://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/sangyo/chikusan/kachiku-eisei/11437/CSF-hassei-taiou.data/22-2_9.20_1600-kakudaiboushikentoukai.pdf [scroll down to page 8; translated key of the map's signs, are included in the commentary below].

3. The following is the URL showing official reports from Gifu Government (in Japanese).

[ProMED-mail thanks Fumiaki Kura for the submission above.

The event map (in Japanese) referred to in the submission above, includes the following signs:
Blue circle (low right) = affected farm.
Blue circle (high left) = compost center.
Yellow circles = dead boar, CSF positive (month/day presented; one of the dead boars was found on the infected farm).
Green circle = dead boar (CSF negative).
Green square = captive boar (CSF negative).
Figures (1-15) in small black circles = pig holdings inside the surveyed area.
Survey target area (surrounding large circles):
- (red) Within the 10 km [6 mi] radius from the farm and compost center
- (black) Within the 10 km [6 mi] radius from the confirmation site of a dead boar.

An updated dendrogram is available at http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/shibo-inoshishi-idenshikensa-kekka.data/20-3_9.19_1700_sibou-inoshishi-keitouzyu.pdf. It addresses globally known CSFV strains of the 3 genotypes (1, 2, 3), presenting the recent Japanese data of 3 domestic pigs from the Gifu affected farm (sampled on 24 Aug, 3 Sep, and 8 Sep 2018), and of 2 wild dead boars sampled on 13 and 15 Sep 2018. According to the above, the current event is caused by CSF virus strain genotype 2, subgenotype 2.1, which is closely related to strains Mongolia/2014a and China/2015.

Additional information has been received from 3 other sources, including 2 EpiCore Surveillance Project members; all are gratefully acknowledged. One of the sources submitted the following information:

"The 1st case of dead wild boar was found in an irrigation canal on 13 Sep 2018, and the 2nd (infant, gender undetermined) was on 15 Sep 2018 near the pig farm where the swine cholera virus [ASF] infections were detected (approx. 7 km [4.4 mi] and 3.5 km [2.2 mi] distant from the farm respectively). Both cases have been confirmed as positive: both were genetically analysed at national level(rapid tests were also conducted at municipal level).

The virus isolated from the 2 boars was the same virus type of the pig farm. However, it is regarded as different from the classical one detected before in Japan, thus authorities said it was originated from the imported, suggesting the possibility of oral infection from feeding stuff. Infection route among the current cases was not yet clarified and further virological investigation would be carried."

Another source included a Japanese media link, according to which there was a considerable delay, mainly on the prefectural level, in tackling the event following its initial reported suspicion on 23 Aug 2018; see, in Japanese, at http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2018091990090029.html.

Our request for information (archive no. 20180919.6038246) on the fate of 2 wild boars reported to have been found dead on 21 Aug 2018 in an area within 3 km (2 mi) from the Gifu city farm, remains pending. -Mod.AS
