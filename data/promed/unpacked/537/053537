Possible Source Of vCJD Cluster In Queniborough
-------------------------------------------------
Investigators trying to find out what caused the cluster of 5 deaths from
the human form of mad cow disease, [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(vCJD), in the Leicestershire village of Queniborough say that meat
supplied locally was probably to blame. An interim report into the cases of
vCJD) in Queniborough has ruled out baby food and school meals as likely
sources of the infection. It has also discounted drinking water supplies,
and the occupations of the 5 victims, who lived within a 3-mile radius of
one another. Local health authority experts do not think that
Queniborough's disproportionate death toll from the disease is a
coincidence. The only common link between the victims was that they all ate
beef or beef products.
The investigation will now concentrate on the local meat supply chain. Dr
Philip Monk, of Leicester Health Authority, told the BBC: "Meat is the only
factor that we can establish that potentially links all the cases. We have
looked for occupational exposure, animal bites, environmental exposure and
we cannot find any common factor between all of the cases in that list of
things. They may be relevant factors for other people with vCJD, but they
don't explain our cluster."
However, Dr Monk also indicated it had been established that the victims
did not use one common butcher.

[The Leicestershire vCJD "cluster" was first reported in November 1998,
after the disease claimed 3 lives within 12 weeks that year. Subsequently,
a 19-year-old man died from the disease in May of this year, and a fifth
person, a male farm worker, died in September. This report does not
directly link the cluster of vCJD cases to meat consumption, it merely
eliminates some suggested explanations. The National CJD Surveillance Unit
has been unable to confirm a link between vCJD and meat consumption in a
comparison of a larger group of vCJD victims with a non-vCJD control group.
The "clustering" suggests some more specific factor is involved, which has
still to be identified. - Mod.CP
