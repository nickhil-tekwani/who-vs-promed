First Report of Frogeye Leaf Spot (_Cercospora sojina_) in Wisconsin.
Alemu Mengistu, USDA, ARS, Crop Genetics and Production Unit, Stoneville,
MS 38776; and N. C. Kurtzweil and C. R. Grau, Department of Plant
Pathology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 53706. Plant Dis. 86:1272,
2002; published on-line as D-2002-0912-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication
29 Aug 2002.
Frogeye leaf spot, caused by _Cercospora sojina_ [Cs], is an economically
important foliar disease of soybean (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.) in areas
where growing conditions are warm and humid.
Soybean fields in Wisconsin were surveyed in 2000 and 2001 and reddish
brown, circular to angular spots varying in diameter from 1 to 5 mm were
observed on soybean leaves in 4 fields in Dane and Iowa counties, and in 5
and 6 fields in Lafayette and Green counties, respectively. Soybean plants
were in growth stages between R3 and R5 during sampling.
Disease incidence ranged from 30 to 100 percent with 5 to 10 percent of
leaf area covered with leaf spot in 2000. In 2001, trace levels of the
disease were detected in Dane County, but no symptomatic plants were
present in the other counties. Symptomatic leaves were collected from all
locations in 2000 and Dane county in 2001.
For each year, 10 leaves were randomly picked from all samples, placed in a
100 x 15 mm petri dish dampened with Whatman No.1 filter paper, and
incubated overnight at 24 degrees C. Fungal sporulation developed after 24
h. 15 spores were removed from the 10 leaves, placed on acidified PDA
(APDA), and incubated in the dark at 24 degrees C. Cultures with dark
pigmentation and associated conidia and conidiophores were observed after 3
weeks.
The conidiophore, spore type, and leaf symptoms correspond to the
description of _C. sojina_ [Cs] (1). Conidiophores were light-to-dark
brown, 1 to 4 septate, and fasciculate. The conidiophores were also
geniculate and measured 52 to 120 x 4 to 6 micrometers. Conidia were 0 to
10 septate, hyaline, elongate to fusiform, and measured 40 to 60 x 6 to 8
micrometers. Cultures were maintained on APDA, and spores for inoculations
were produced on this medium.
In pathogenicity tests, spores from the 2000 collection were harvested,
bulked together, and used to inoculate the susceptible soybean cv.
Blackhawk. 20 plants were inoculated and 20 served as noninoculated
controls. 10-day-old plants were inoculated with a spore suspension of 300
000 spores/ml by spraying inoculum over all leaf surfaces. Control plants
were sprayed similarly with sterile distilled water.
Plants were incubated in an enclosed, transparent fiberglass box with a
humidifier that provided 95 to 100 percent humidity. Lighting in the growth
chamber was adjusted to 18-h light and 6-h dark during the inoculation
period. Plants were removed from the box after 48 h and placed in a growth
chamber with a 12-h photoperiod. The light output in the growth chamber was
300 micromol/m -2/s -1 and the temperature was maintained at 24 plus or
minus 3 degrees C. The experiment was repeated once.
Typical field symptoms appeared on each of the inoculated plant 8 days
after inoculation, but no symptoms were visible on control plants. Cs was
reisolated from all symptomatic plants.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of Cs from soybean in Wisconsin.

[Frogeye leaf spot on soybean was first reported in Japan in 1915 and
observed for the first time in the USA in 1924. The disease is present
worldwide and occurs in several US states. It is usually a minor disease,
but yield losses of 25 percent or more have been reported. Cs survives in
infected seed and in infested soybean residues. Options for fighting the
disease include use of resistant cultivars, disease-free seed, and crop
rotations of 1-2 years.
Do any of our Canadian readers know whether this disease has been reported
in Canada? - Mod.DH]
