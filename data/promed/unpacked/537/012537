Escherichia coli outbreaks, and the table of contents for this week's

Escherichia coli O157: superbug or mere sensation?=20
The recent outbreak of Escherichia coli food poisoning in central Scotland
has resulted in 18 fatalities, and members of the public have yet again been
alarmed by stories of an imminent "superbug" crisis. But is E coli O157
(O157) infection really a growing problem, and is there anything special
about O157 that warrants the name superbug? O157, first recognised as a
human pathogen in 1982, has made headline news--notably in the 1993
"Jack-in-the-box" fast-food-chain outbreak of 600 cases in the USA [This was
preceeded by outbreaks associated with another well known chain. MHJ], the
1996 outbreak of nearly 10 000 cases in Japan, and the Lanarkshire and Forth
Valley outbreak of 490 cases.=20
Case numbers have been steadily increasing in recent years but, despite the
high media profile of O157, the increase is not catastrophic, says Bernard
Rowe (director of the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens at the Central Public
Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, UK). According to Rowe, part of the
rise in incidence is probably due to a combination of better and more
widespread testing for O157. On average, there have been about ten O157
outbreaks per year in the recent past in England and Wales. To put this
figure in perspective, 660 proven cases of infection were reported last
year, compared with about 40 000 cases of campylobacter and 30 000 cases of
salmonella infection during the same period.=20
Infection with O157 usually presents as bloody diarrhoea, but it can also
cause non-bloody diarrhoea. Around 10% of cases, especially in young
children, develop into haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). On average 2=AD7%=
of
patients with HUS die, but in some outbreaks in institutions for old people
mortality has been as high as 50%, says Rowe. Antibiotics are generally
unhelpful--the only treatment for HUS is supportive, for example, dialysis
after renal failure.=20
"There's no doubt", says Rowe, "that [O157] is a very nasty infection and it
can be fatal in a very short space of time". O157 is a non-pathogenic gut
bacterium in cattle, the main carrier of the organism. Consequently, beef
is the human food source most likely to harbour the strain. But O157 can
also be present in milk, on fruit, or on vegetables that have come in
contact with bovine faeces. The outbreak caused by apple juice in the USA
last year probably resulted from apples contaminated in orchards grazed by
cows. But, warns Rowe, O157 "was also detected recently in 2=B76% of sheep=
at
slaughter"....
Nevertheless, sensible public-health measures should go a long way towards
checking the spread of O157. The abattoir, says Rowe, is "one of the key
places" to set up an effective hurdle to block the spread of the organism.
In the UK, however, it may be a while before the public are convinced that
abattoir practices are adequate--an unpublished government report on poor
abattoir practices has recently made headline news. As many other obstacles
as possible should be put in place to stop O157 getting into the mouths of
vulnerable people. These include: attempts to eradicate the microorganism
from cattle, or to minimise its spread; improvements in food processing and
handling practices; and emphasis on the importance of adequate cooking to
those preparing food. O157 will always fall at the final hurdle--in the
kitchen. Says Rowe,
"It's killed by heating to 70=BAC for 2 minutes. It's not a superbug".=20
