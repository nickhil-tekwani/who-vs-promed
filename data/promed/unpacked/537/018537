The presence of both recombinant and non-recombinant strains of Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus on tomato in Reunion Island

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) was 1st detected in Reunion in 1997,
based on symptoms and partial sequence data between the conserved
nonanucleotide and the 1st 5' quarter of the capsid protein (CP) gene
(Peterschmitt et al., 1999). A 516-bp portion of the C4 gene of the same
isolate of TYLCV from Reunion was subsequently sequenced (Acc. No.
AJ842312) showing that it belonged to the mild strain (TYLCV-Mld[RE]) and
the so-called non-recombinant group (Navas-Castillo et al., 2000).
In April 2004, strong symptoms of stunting, yellowing and leaf curling,
resembling the symptoms of TYLCV disease, were observed on tomato plants in
Saint Gilles, in the North West region of Reunion.
22 symptomatic tomato leaf samples were collected and tested for the
presence of begomoviruses using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
with 2 sets of primers designed to amplify 2 regions of the A component of
TYLCV: primers V2790 and C837 amplify a 800-bp fragment spanning the
intergenic conserved region (IR) nonanucleotide sequence and 2 thirds of
the CP gene, while primers TY1944 (TTGTTTTGCCTGTTCTGCTA) and TY2460
(CATCTCCATGTGCTTATCCA) amplify a 516-bp portion of the C4 gene. The latter
region was chosen to differentiate the Israeli strain (syn. TYLCV [Israel];
Acc. No. X15656) from the mild strain (TYLCV-Mld; Acc. No. X76319).
All of the leaf samples produced PCR products of the expected size with
both sets of primers. For 3 samples a 483-bp fragment of the C4 gene was
sequenced using the primer set TY1944/TY2460 (Acc. Nos AJ842309, AJ842310
and AJ842311) and a 685-bp fragment of IR/CP region was sequenced using the
primer set V2790 (ATCCGTATAATATTACCGGATGG ) and C837
GCAAATCATTCTTCACTGTTGC) (Acc. Nos AJ842306, AJ842307 and AJ842308).
The sequences were aligned with those of known TYLCV strains using DNAMAN
(Lynnon Biosoft, Quebec). The 685-bp fragment showed 98-99 percent
nucleotide identity with TYLCV, TYLCV-Mld and -Mld[RE]. However, the 483-bp
fragment showed a 98 percent nucleotide identity with TYLCV, but only 77
percent nucleotide identity with TYLCV-Mld and TYLCV-Mld[RE].
This is the 1st report of the presence of the Israeli strain, which belongs
to the so-called recombinant group of TYLCV, from Reunion.

[TYLC is one of the most devastating viral diseases of cultivated tomato in
tropical and subtropical regions. It is spread efficiently by an insect
vector (_Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt]), and the difficulty of its management is
compounded by the existence of distinct biotypes, of which the 'B' and 'Q'
biotypes are of key interest in southern Europe. The disease is difficult
to identify because of great variation in symptom expression. Infected
seedling transplants may serve as the route for long-distance spread of the
virus and, when introduced into areas of high Bt populations, results in
extensive and rapid spread of the virus. High levels of resistance to TYLCV
were detected in 7 of 9 accessions of _Lycopersicon peruvianum_ and in all
5 accessions of _L. chilense_ tested. In contrast, plants of 7 accessions
of _L. hirsutum_ and 3 of 4 accessions of _L. pimpinellifolium_ were highly
susceptible. Plants of accession CIAS 27 (_L. pimpinellifolium_) showed
moderate resistance to TYLCV.
