Abstract
--------
Background
In the 6 Southeast Asian countries that make up the Greater Mekong Subregion, _Plasmodium falciparum_ has developed resistance to derivatives of artemisinin, the main component of 1st-line treatments for malaria. Clinical resistance to artemisinin monotherapy in other global regions, including Africa, would be problematic.

Methods
In this longitudinal study conducted in Northern Uganda, we treated patients who had _P. falciparum_ infection with intravenous artesunate (a water-soluble artemisinin derivative) and estimated the parasite clearance half-life. We evaluated the ex vivo susceptibility of the parasite using a ring-stage survival assay and genotyped resistance-related genes.

Results
From 2017 through 2019, a total of 14 of 240 patients who received intravenous artesunate had evidence of in vivo artemisinin resistance (parasite clearance half-life, >5 hours). Of these 14 patients, 13 were infected with _P. falciparum_ parasites with mutations in the A675V or C469Y allele in the kelch13 gene. Such mutations were associated with prolonged parasite clearance half-lives (geometric mean, 3.95 hours for A675V and 3.30 hours for C469Y, vs. 1.78 hours for wild-type allele; P<0.001 and P = 0.05, respectively). The ring-stage survival assay showed a higher frequency of parasite survival among organisms with the A675V allele than among those with the wild-type allele. The prevalence of parasites with kelch13 mutations increased significantly, from 3.9% in 2015 to 19.8% in 2019, due primarily to the increased frequency of the A675V and C469Y alleles (P<0.001 and P=0.004, respectively). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms flanking the A675V mutation in Uganda were substantially different from those in Southeast Asia.

Conclusions
The independent emergence and local spread of clinically artemisinin-resistant _P. falciparum_ has been identified in Africa. The 2 kelch13 mutations may be markers for the detection of these resistant parasites. (Funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and others.)

[The results of the study are worrisome. Artemisinins are the cornerstone of malaria treatment in tropical Africa and this report is in support of a previous report of emerging resistance to artemisinins in Rwanda (reported by ProMED in April 2021; 20210417.8313098).

When resistance to chloroquine emerged in the early 1980s in Africa, it spread all over the continent in 5 years. Increased monitoring, at least with analysis of genetic markers for decreased susceptibility to artemisinins, is needed and analysis of parasite clearing times also provides important information (see Cheeseman IH et al. A major genome region underlying artemisinin resistance in malaria. Science. 2012; 336(6077): 79-82; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1215966).
