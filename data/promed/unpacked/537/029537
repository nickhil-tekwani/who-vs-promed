Newfoundland and Labrador is dealing with its 1st outbreak of infectious salmon anemia at an aquaculture site.

Miranda Pryor, executive director of the province's aquaculture industry association, said they've detected the virus in the wild before, but Friday's news that it had hit an aquaculture site near Conne River was a first.

The virus is being contained to one site, but Pryor said 450 000 salmon at the Gray Aqua Group site will be destroyed as a result. Pryor said the outbreak was first suspected 2 weeks ago, but the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] only confirmed the virus on Friday [6 Jul 2012].

A release says the tests are conclusive.

The CFIA said people don't need to worry about an effect on human health or food safety. Guy Gravelle, senior media relations officer for the agency, said the risks the virus poses are to fish health and the economy.

The CFIA will oversee the destruction and disposal of the affected salmon and the cleaning and disinfection of the entire facility, he said.

Infectious salmon anemia is a naturally occurring virus that poses no risk to wild species such as lobster, cod, and herring.

"We are taking this confirmed finding very seriously and are co-operating fully," Gray Aqua Group vice-president Clyde Collier said in a release.

Although the issue is new for Newfoundland aquaculture, it isn't the 1st time a company has been ordered to destroy salmon infected with the virus. Earlier this year [2012], a Nova Scotia fish farm was ordered to destroy hundreds of thousands of salmon after a similar outbreak outside Shelburne Harbour. Outbreaks of infectious salmon anemia in New Brunswick in the late 1990s dealt a blow to the aquaculture industry there at the time and the federal government provided tens of millions of dollars in compensation.

Pryor said the outbreak is probably a "matter of scale." "Our industry has grown a lot in recent years," she said.

[This highly contagious disease can be insidious, with an initially low mortality rate; however, the cumulative mortality can sometimes exceed 90 percent if the disease remains unchecked.

Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a member of the genus _Isavirus_ in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Hemorrhagic kidney syndrome is an old name for the disease in Atlantic salmon. In coho salmon, it has also been called icterus syndrome.

ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry.

The differential diagnoses for infectious salmon anemia include other causes of anemia and hemorrhages, as well as winter ulcer and septicemias caused by _Moritella viscosa_.

Outbreaks of infectious salmon anemia can be diagnosed by virus isolation, the detection of antigens and RT-PCR. A few isolates from sick salmon have been difficult to culture, even when viral nucleic acids can be found. The avirulent isolates carried subclinically in wild salmonids can usually be detected only by RT-PCR.

Infectious salmon anemia is an OIE-listed disease, as well as a regulated aquatic animal disease in Canada under the Health of Animals Act and supporting regulations that are administered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
