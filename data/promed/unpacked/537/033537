Mumps found in 10 cases in Oxford County
----------------------------------------
Public health officials have scheduled 2 immunization clinics next
week [11-13 Aug 2008] following an outbreak of mumps in Oxford
County, Ontario, Canada. A total of 10 cases of mumps have been
confirmed, primarily in Norwich Township. A percentage of the
Netherlands Reformed community who live there have not received the
MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. "All 10
were unimmunized people," said Mike Bragg, director of Oxford County
Public Health and Emergency Services.

Mumps is a viral illness with symptoms that include fever, headache,
muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling and pain in salivary glands. Some
children may also experience cold symptoms. Complications from mumps
can be serious, including encephalitis, meningitis, arthritis or
deafness. One in 3 men may develop painful swollen testicles that, in
rare cases, result in infertility. Pregnant women with mumps are also
at an increased risk for miscarriage during their 1st trimester.

Every year there are on average about 20 cases of mumps in Ontario.
Other provinces with current outbreaks of mumps include British
Columbia and Alberta. The Netherlands is also reporting an outbreak.

Outbreaks of mumps in Canada have shown that young adults, who have
received only one dose of mumps vaccine, may also be at risk of
developing the disease, Bragg said. Oxford County public health
received a report 30 Jul 2008 from an out-of-county hospital that
blood work from a patient from Norwich indicated a diagnosis of
mumps, a reportable disease.

An investigation revealed the cases of mumps date back to May [2008].
The MMR vaccine for these groups in the Norwich area is available
from family doctors and clinics offered by public health. The 1st
clinic will be held at the Norwich Community Centre on Monday [11 Aug
2008] from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. A 2nd clinic will be at the Norwich
Township office in Otterville on Wednesday [13 Aug 2008] from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.

In 2005, an outbreak of measles spread quickly throughout the
unimmunized population of Rehoboth Christian School in Norwich, whose
651 pupils are members of the Netherlands Reformed community. A final
tally of labconfirmed reports topped out at 283 cases of rubella
within county borders.

[Religious communities which decline MMR vaccine continue to be at
risk of mumps and rubella infection in addition to the highly
contagious measles virus infection. Recently ProMED-mail reported a
chain of outbreaks of measles virus infection through
vaccine-rejecting communities in Europe, and a possible Canadian link
to a measles outbreak in one such community in The Netherlands
(Measles, anthroposophic community - The Netherlands (02):
(Hague) 20080802.2370; Measles, anthroposophic community - The
Netherlands: (The Hague) 20080731.2353).
