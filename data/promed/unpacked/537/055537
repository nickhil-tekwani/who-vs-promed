When hearing about hepatitis A, many people think about contaminated food and water. However, in the USA, hepatitis A is more commonly spread from person to person. Since March 2017, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) has been assisting multiple state and local health departments with hepatitis A outbreaks, spread through person-to-person contact.

Since the outbreaks were first identified in 2016, 35 states have publicly reported the following as of 4 Jun 2021:

- Cases: 39 529
- Hospitalizations: 24 062 (61%)
- Deaths: 374

The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent HAV [hepatitis A virus] infection.

The following groups are at highest risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection in these outbreaks and should be offered the hepatitis A vaccine in order to prevent or control an outbreak:

- People who use drugs (injection or non-injection)
- People experiencing unstable housing or homelessness
- Men who have sex with men (MSM)
- People who are currently or were recently incarcerated
- People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C

One dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine has been shown to control outbreaks of hepatitis A. Pre-vaccination serologic testing is not required to administer hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccinations should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained or records are unavailable.

NR: not publicly reported.

"Outbreak-associated" status is currently determined at the state level in accordance with each state's respective outbreak case definition.

Outbreak-related hepatitis A deaths are defined at the state level in accordance with each state's respective hepatitis A-related death definition. Some states are reviewing death certificates on a regular basis to actively find hepatitis A-related deaths, while other states are utilizing passive surveillance.

Outbreak start date is defined at the state level and may represent the earliest onset date of an outbreak case (AR, AZ, KS, UT), the left censor date for which cases are considered part of the outbreak based on the state outbreak case definition (AL, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, ID, IL, IN, KY, LA, MD, MA, MI, MN, MO, MS, NV, NH, NJ, NC, OH, PA, SC, TN, VA, WA), or when a state declared a hepatitis A outbreak (NM, WV).

[With the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was less reporting of these outbreaks and probably less surveillance and reporting as public health personnel in states focused their activities on the pandemic. At one point, state-generated numbers were updated weekly but as can be seen in the table above, only 10 of the 26 still apparently active outbreaks have been updated in the past month.

We have seen these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations in our midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly fed the fire of these outbreaks, and they still need to be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and in directly looking at the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
