CDC is doing a great job under the circumstances
------------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not a perfect
organization. Okay? Have we gotten that out of the way? Let's move on then.
Reports of recent Senate hearings indicate that at least some in the US
Congress want to know why CDC is doing what it is doing, why they are not
doing it faster, why they are not doing it better. For all the years that
Congress has funded the National Institutes of Health at justifiably high
levels, Congressmen (with photographers in tow) have taken the short ride
to Bethesda to see the marvelous work done there. Few have bothered to
travel to Atlanta to see how the CDC stands between us and them, "them"
being the organisms that threaten US citizens at home and abroad as well as
disease agents that cause untold misery to our friends and enemies worldwide.
CDC employees respond to reports of hideous diseases, such as Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, putting themselves at risk of their lives. They discover
viruses (Ebola, Sin Nombre, and more) and other organisms (_Legionella_
species) causing hitherto unknown fatal diseases, are the focus for
constituting influenza vaccines, develop and distribute reagents and
information to those who need them, and provide reference diagnosis and
epidemiologic assistance for studies and control of many other diseases.
This all makes for fine TV documentaries, but most of us take the CDC for
granted. "It's what they should be doing," we say. Routine stuff, not the
glamour of research. When people do not become ill, who gets the credit?
How many people do not become ill?
When the first President Bush indicated that the federal government would
not get involved in educating people about the mode of transmission of HIV
and AIDS, who got the blame for the subsequent AIDS epidemic? When the
Reagan administration appointed people to run CDC and those people changed
the emphasis from infectious diseases ("under control", "no longer a
threat") to the use of seat belts, who paid the price for that? As recently
as today we are hearing ignorant statements from ignorant people regarding
anthrax. Politicians seem to be hedging their bets as to whether one of our
foreign foes is behind the current attack or whether we have a domestic
nut, perhaps one of their supporters, on the loose.
So far 2 [now 4] people with anthrax, already dying when they were first
examined, were not saved from death. This is CDC's fault? No scientific
evidence was available that would have suggested risk, and when risk was
noted retrospectively, was it CDC's fault that the risk was unrecognized?
Sounds to me as though there are those who are looking for a fall guy. CDC,
the governmental organization in the front lines, the organization that
does the dirty work, does not have the budget -- and therefore does not
have the political clout -- it requires. It may have too many
administrators, too few experts in too many areas, may have made too many
promises (or perceived promises), may have a large budget, and may not
always spend that money wisely -- but it is clear that it does not have a
large enough budget. One cannot throw a few million dollars at a potential
problem and then walk away, assuming all is now well. Perhaps Congress
should transfer Tony Fauci from NIH to CDC, send a billion dollars along
with him, and fund CDC properly. Good public health practice requires
day-to-day vigilance, constant and elevated funding, not a
disease-of-the-week approach.
If Congress (the ultimate overseer and therefore the organization
ultimately responsible for everything) did its job as well as CDC does its
job, perhaps we wouldn't be having a problem with terrorists and CDC could
go back to being just a cog in the wheel, rather than the wheel itself.
Blame, if any, lies not with the messenger. Support would be a better
avenue to success.
