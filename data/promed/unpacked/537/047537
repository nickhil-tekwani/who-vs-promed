Soybean rust -- are we out of the woods?
----------------------------------------
By XB Yang, Department of Plant Pathology, Iowa State University
15 Dec 2005 -- In the discussion board portion of a website, I recently
read a message with a similar subject title by a producer. This question is
also one producers in the North Central Region are asking because of the
light occurrence of soybean rust this past season. Development of the
disease was surprisingly slower than most of us had anticipated.
In this article, I will address the questions raised by producers by
reviewing what we learned this past growing season, which was summarized
during the National Soybean Rust Symposium held last month [November 2005].
Where was rust found in 2005?
The disease was 1st detected in late February 2005 in central Florida. To
everyone's surprise, the disease spread slowly early in the growing season,
and widespread disease wasn't detected until late August 2005. The severity
of the disease was less than that reported during the 2004 season.
No rust was found in Missouri this year [2005]; however, the disease did
reach Kentucky and Texas, which is as far north as and further west than
last year. The drought in areas of the Midwest may have contributed to the
slow development of soybean rust.
What's new this season?
To many scientists, finding soybean rust in Texas is considered important.
If the disease eventually establishes itself there -- which will be known
after this winter [2006] -- it could be a key factor in spore movement
toward the northern production region. It will be easier for spores to
spread north if significant disease occurs there next spring.
This past season, 2 separate spore-trapping ne2rks [? - Mod.SH], one led by
the USDA Rust Lab in Minnesota and another by the University of Arkansas,
found that spores moved out of Florida and reached as far north as
Wisconsin. Since the USDA team uses the DNA approach, it is a sure thing
that spores can reach the northern region.
However, the presence of spores does not necessarily mean there is an
outbreak of the disease. We don't know whether these spores remain alive
after long-distance travel or whether they can establish themselves after
depositing on soybean crops.
In 2005, the disease developed more slowly than anticipated in kudzu plants
in southern states compared with those in South America, which is good
news. If such slow development is due to the biology of US kudzu and not
the drought, the risk of soybean rust in the northern region is reduced
significantly. We need another year to reach a conclusion.
Why is it too early for a conclusion?
Because this past season was very dry and unfavorable for disease
development, it is too early to conclude that slow development was due to
the biological nature of the pathogen and its unsuitability to the Midwest
climate rather than dry weather conditions.
Some think the disease is a tropical disease and would not develop in the
northern soybean production region. A counter argument is that southern
corn rust is also a tropical disease, but it can periodically cause damage
in the Corn Belt.
In a recent journal article, soybean rust was compared with other rust
diseases in the Midwest in terms of temperature suitability. Development of
soybean rust is much slower than wheat leaf rust and common corn rust but
similar to southern corn rust. Besides temperature and leaf wetness, which
seem generally suitable for soybean rust in the North Central Region, other
factors may affect the disease, such as rain.
Every disease has its unique epidemiological nature; plant pathologists are
still investigating factors affecting the development of soybean rust.
Without knowing what determines its slow development, we are unable to make
a no-risk prediction for the northern soybean production region, which
accounts for more than 70 per cent of the nation's soybeans.
In the past season, the national soybean rust sentinel plot program was
successful in providing producers with early warning information. At the
National Soybean Rust Symposium, the general message was that we should
continue to monitor the development of soybean rust using the program. A
monitoring system is being developed for the next growing season with funds
from the federal government, industry, and check-off dollars.
What is the risk for next season?
With our current knowledge of soybean rust, the way to assess the risk here
in the North Central Region next season should be similar to what was
recommended last year [2004] (See the 28 Feb 2005 special issue of the ICM
Newsletter).
The analysis of risk is in 3 phases:
1. March or early April, check the overwintering status of soybean rust in
the Gulf Coast region. Overwintering in regions west of the Florida
Panhandle increases the risk of spores spreading to the North.
2. April to June, watch for outbreaks of soybean rust in regions from west
of the Florida Panhandle to Texas. If they occurred, the risk for spores to
move north is high.
3. July and August, if the weather conditions in the northern soybean
production region are cool and wet, make sure you monitor the crops,
because these conditions are suitable for the disease to occur.
What is different this year [2005] is that we should pay extra attention to
Texas. If the disease can overwinter there, the risk for spores to move to
the northern region increases. However, keep in mind that whether the
spores can establish and develop in soybean fields is yet to be determined
by seasonal conditions.

[This is the last posting on the Asian strain of soybean rust (Asian
strain) in the United States for 2005. I think it is an excellent summary
which will be useful for plant pathologists as they prepare for the
upcoming soybean crop in 2006.
