Outbreak at an end, says government, but minister warns that migratory
birds are still a danger
----------------------------------
Agriculture Minister Somsak Thepsuthin says Thailand has completely stopped
the bird-flu outbreak, after the last area to be affected by the virus was
declared safe.

However, Somsak stopped short of saying Thailand is completely in the
clear, as the virus could still be spread by migrating birds and that the
country will need to monitor the disease for another 6 months.

Somsak said Uttaradit, the last area to suffer an outbreak, had passed the
21-day monitoring period, but the province would still be monitored for
another 69 days.

"We can't announce yet that Thailand is totally free of the bird-flu virus,
because we can't control birds and other fowl which migrate from other
countries. The birds may bring more viruses," the minister said.

"We will have to wait 6 months more, in line with rules of international
organisations on animal-disease outbreaks." If no more fowls die of the
virus [in that time], the government will regard Thailand as completely
free of the virus."

The avian influenza virus swept through 10 Asian nations earlier in 2004,
resulting in more than 100 million chickens dying or being culled -- more
than 37 million in Thailand alone.

The disease also jumped to people, killing 16 in Vietnam and 8 in Thailand.
Somsak said it was up to provincial livestock chiefs to decide when to
allow farmers to start operating again.

He said farmers would have to be trained in closed-system farming before
they could get a new licence. Closed-system farming involves breeding
chickens in a more compact environment to help prevent the spread of disease.

The ministry would ask villagers who have fighting cocks and other
indigenous chickens to register the birds with livestock officials.

Somsak said the Agriculture Ministry would compensate farmers Bt100 (USD
2.45) for every bird culled during the outbreak and would find other
measures to help them if the compensation rate was not enough.

The ministry had allocated Bt 2.5 billion (USD 61 180 130) for compensation
and that Bt 1.4 billion (USD 34 260 872) had already been paid to the
farmers. The ministry needed to make sure the residual funds were enough to
compensate the remaining farmers.

"As a result, we can now only compensate at the rate of Bt 100 per
chicken," he said.

[Thailand had to learn the hard way that there are no shortcuts in
obtaining the official internationally recognised status of an HPAI-free
country (6 months following the last stamped-out outbreak). The current
official announcement is in compliance with OIE's requirements, as spelled
out in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (for further details, see
update 63). - Mod.AS]
