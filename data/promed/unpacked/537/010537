Despite visiting the infected farm on a number of occasions, finding salmonella and seeing an unusual number of dead chickens, Bavarian health authorities took no action, leading to widespread illness and multiple deaths across Europe during the summer of 2014.

An outbreak of salmonella which led to hundreds of people falling ill across Europe during the summer of 2014 and was linked to several deaths, has been traced back to contaminated eggs from a farm in Bavaria, German media has revealed. The farm is owned by the Bayern Ei company, one of Germany's largest egg producers, which operates 4 chicken factories, where hens lay some 1 million eggs a day. At the farm in question, in the southern region of Lower Bavaria, where hundreds of chickens were being found dead each day, company bosses initially told employees the death rate was due to chickens dying from heat.

According to the investigation carried out by reporters from Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung and Bayerischen Rundfunk, the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authorities knew about the presence of salmonellae at the farm, having found evidence of the infection in 2 separate investigations. However, the authorities turned a blind eye and took no action to take products from the farm off the market, since "the responsible customer" is aware that "eggshells are not sterile," and should wash their hands after handling an egg.

The outbreak of salmonella in summer 2014 caused at least 287 people in the UK to fall ill after eating contaminated eggs, and at least 151 in Austria, while dozens of cases were also reported in France, Germany and Luxembourg. The illness was implicated in the deaths of another 2 people.

Despite people falling ill from the same rare _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype Enteritidis] PT [phage type] 14b strain which had been found at the farm, alleges the report, Bavarian authorities did not take action until French authorities on 9 Jul 2015 raised the alarm through a rapid alert system to all European counterparts of a "foodborne salmonellosis outbreak," listing the code of the egg carton from which 1 family was known to have fallen ill, revealing the source of the eggs.

A month later, the Bavarian authorities sent samples from the farm for testing, and found PT14 on the eggshells. "No further action" was warranted though, decided the authorities, since "depopulation," or killing of the potentially infected chickens at the farm, whose live and laying cycle had come to an end, had already begun.

[A classic vehicle for non-typhoid (and non-paratyphoid) salmonellae, eggs continue to play a part in this zoonosis. The risk of egg-related salmonellosis can be lessened at the source, and adequately cooking egg products and hand washing lowers risk at the "finish" -- in the kitchen. - Mod.LL
