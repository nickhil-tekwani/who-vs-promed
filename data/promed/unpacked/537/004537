Re: Avian influenza (147): Germany (Bavaria)
--------------------------------------------
The most recent outbreak of HPAIV (highly pathogenic avian influenza)
H5N1 in Germany occurred in poultry at a huge duck-fattening unit. A
total of about 165 000 fattening ducks were kept strictly indoors in
several units. In a private laboratory RNA of AIV (avian influenza
virus) H5N1 was detected in samples from one unit holding 44 000
ducklings of about 4 weeks of age which were supplied to the farm at
one day of age by the end of July [2007].
Clinically overt disease and mortality rates increased and the
diagnosis was confirmed by the regional laboratory at Erlangen
(Bavaria) on Fri 24 Aug 2007. Samples were transferred to the
Friedrich-Loeffler Institute on the Isle of Riems immediately and
confirmed as containing HPAIV H5N1 Asia on Sat 25 Aug 2007. All ducks
on the farm were culled by local authorities between Saturday and
Sunday [25-26 Aug 2007].
Immediate epidemiological inquiries, paralleling the culling actions
on the farm during the weekend, initiated extensive trace-back
investigations. In particular, the hatchery supplying the day-old
ducklings, and all farms which had received deliveries from this
hatchery, were tested virologically by the responsible regional state
laboratories. However, no evidence of further infections at other
farms connected through trading or located in the restriction zone
has been found. Thus, the outbreak appears to be an isolated case.
The farm itself is situated in a so-called HPAIV risk area. Such risk
areas have been defined by the federal states of Germany in regions
with a potentially high risk of transfer of HPAIV H5N1 from wild
aquatic birds and relate, in general, to the vicinity of rivers,
ponds, lakes etc. In such areas all poultry has to be kept indoors.
HPAIV H5N1 had been detected 6 weeks ago, in a number of wild birds
(mute swans, grebes) in several locations in Southeastern Germany,
including the city of Nuremberg, which is situated approx. 50 km (31
mi) southeast of the location of the farm.
Further epidemiological investigations are ongoing to elucidate the
origin of the virus and the route of incursion. The results of
molecular phylogenetic studies are expected soon.

[This is most helpful and timely information on the outbreak in
question, addressing -- among others -- our request for clarification
on the species involved (see ProMED-mail post 20070827.2812).
The German Veterinary Services submitted on 27 Aug 2007 a
notification to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) on
this outbreak. The notification referred to the species involved as
"birds," for which the following figures were provided:
susceptible: 169 857; cases: 4000; deaths: 4000; destroyed: 129 857.
No further data on the affected population was available. For said
notification, including a map, please refer to
