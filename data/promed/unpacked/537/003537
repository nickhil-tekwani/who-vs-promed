The National Institute of Health (El Instituto Nacional de Salud; INS) report that the outbreak in the indigenous population of the Kogui community in Dibulla, La Guajira, was caused by whooping cough, a highly contagious infection [with the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_] that causes coughing and affects breathing. According to the entity, the field investigation began last Wednesday [16 Mar 2022] in different hospital centers in the city of Santa Marta, and identified a total of 17 hospitalized children from the Kogui indigenous community, 5 of them in the intensive care unit and 12 in a state of acute malnutrition. All currently under treatment with antibiotics, with good response and evolution. "The indigenous government authorized the entry into the area only of the indigenous IPS [health provider institute], from 23 Mar to 2 Apr 2022," they explained.

"As previously reported, the cause of the outbreak was not due to an unknown or atypical respiratory virus. The samples analyzed by the INS National Reference Laboratory confirmed the detection by PCR of the respiratory [bacterium] _Bordetella pertussis_ [the cause] of whooping cough," they added in a press release. The INS response team, in addition to verifying the nutritional conditions of the affected minors, established that all the children were unvaccinated, given that no vaccination record was found and the adults responsible for the children reported that they were not vaccinated. For its part, the Ministry of Health, which leads the Expanded Immunization Plan-PAI, has given guidelines to ensure [vaccination] coverage.

"The departmental health secretariats, in this case, the La Guajira Health Secretariat, must ensure and verify compliance with the vaccination program in their territory, and the benefit management companies (EAPB) must ensure the vaccination program in their affiliated population", indicated the National Institute of Health. On the other hand, the agency lamented the situation and invited the health secretariats and indigenous EAPB in the area to review and ensure vaccination in their population.

"It is an unfortunate situation that children die and become ill from this disease. Secretaries, EAPB, and parents or guardian adults must commit to the vaccination of children under 5 years of age." Alfonso Torres Villafañe, legal representative of the EPS [health promoting entitities] Gonawindúa, reported last Wednesday that 21 Kogui children have died from a respiratory condition since December last year [2021]. He pointed out that the epidemic outbreak has been especially serious in the community of Taminaka, located in the Kogui -- Malayo -- Arhuaco reservation, on the northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, at the head of the Palomino river basin, 2 days by bridle path from Santa Marta.

According to what Torres Villafañe stated, all the deceased children are in the range of 0 to 5 years. "In many cases, this respiratory infection evolves into bronchopneumonia very quickly," said the indigenous leader. Taminaka is made up of 292 families equivalent to 1492 people. Of this population, 365 are under 5 years of age.

For his part, the secretary of health of the district of Santa Marta, Deimer Marín, reported that currently 10 minors are being treated at the Julio Méndez Barreneche hospital and 5 at the Prado clinic. Likewise, the ombudsman's office asked the government of Magdalena and the mayor's office of Santa Marta to join efforts to safeguard the population.

[Pertussis, caused by _Bordetella pertussis_, a Gram negative coccobacillus, is a very contagious disease only found in humans.

In the US, DTaP, and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time.

Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccines.

In the US, in 2014, over 10 per cent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).

Colombia's routine pertussis immunization program includes a pentavalent vaccine, which contains DTP (whole cell pertussis component), administered at 2, 4, and 6 months, with a booster of DTP given at 18 months and 5 years. In 2013 Colombia's Ministry of Health recommended a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy (to be administered starting at 26 weeks gestation) (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/countries/lapp-colombia.html).

The Kogi, or Cogui, meaning "jaguar" in the Kogi language, are an indigenous group that resides in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains in northern Colombia. They have remained isolated from the rest of the world since the Spanish conquest, rarely interacting with the modern world and not allowing outsiders inside their ancestral lands (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogi_people).

The Kogui live in "indigenous reserves" in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (https://blog.maxar.com/earth-intelligence/2020/amazon-conservation-team-assists-census-of-indigenous-peoples-with-maxar-capabilities), an isolated mountain range in northern Colombia, separate from the Andes range that runs through the centre of the country, reaching an elevation of 5700 m (18 700 ft) just 42 km (26 mi) from the Caribbean coast. The range is in the departments of Magdalena, Cesar, and La Guajira (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta).
