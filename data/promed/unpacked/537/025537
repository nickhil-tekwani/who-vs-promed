Kitgum gets 64 new cases of hepatitis E
---------------------------------------
Sixty-four new cases of the deadly hepatitis E virus were reported
this week in Kitgum district. This, however, is a reduction in the
infections from 90 cases reported the previous week. According to the
Ministry of Health, the disease is receding. The ministry said the
cumulative number of hepatitis [E] infections now stands at 8617.

Only one new death was reported in Lokung sub-county in the week,
which brings the cumulative deaths to 127 in 41 weeks. "On the whole,
the trend of the hepatitis E outbreak continues to recede in all the
sub-counties of Kitgum district," a statement from the ministry
stated. Layamo sub-county had 15 of the new cases, while Agoro and
Padibe reported 10 each. Kitgum Town Council had 6, Mucwini had 5,
while Lagoro and Paloga reported 4 each. Madi Opei, Kitgum Matidi,
and Namukora reported 2 cases each, while Lokung, Akwang, Omiya
Anyima, and Amida reported one case each. The statement said Layamo,
Agoro, Padibe, and Kitgum town council had registered the highest
number of cases.

The disease, which is spread through consumption of food and fluids
contaminated with infected faecal matter, broke out in October last
year [2007]. The most affected were people living in camps for the
internally displaced and those returning to their villages after the
LRA [Lord's Resistance Army] insurgency.

The disease's long incubation period had been responsible for its
spread, according to the Minister of Health, Dr Stephen Mallinga. He
said recently that the heavy rains in Kitgum had increased
transmission of the disease because people returning from camps had
limited safe drinking water. The problem was compounded by lack of
pit latrines, with people easing themselves in bushes from where the
virus found its way into the water sources. According to Mallinga,
there was need for the water ministry to sink more boreholes. He said
the Min Health was working with UNICEF (UN Children's Fund) and the
World Health Organisation (WHO) to provide better services in the region.

[Although the outbreak of hepatitis E infection in the Kitgum
district of Uganda may be beginning to decline, the number of new
cases is substantial, bringing the overall total in the Kitgum
district to 8617. Heavy rainfall, movement of internally displaced
persons (IDPs), and the consequences of internal strife are combining
to frustrate the efforts of the Ugandan authorities to provide
adequate sanitation and sources of clean water in this district of Uganda.
