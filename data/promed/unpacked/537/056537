United Nations veterinary doctors have reported an increase in Bor of "pest des petits ruminants" (PPR), also referred to as goats' plague, a contagious goat disease.

According to Col. Shiba Kumar, a veterinary doctor running a UN clinic in Bor, PPR is highly contagious and a dangerous disease to goats. He said one of the symptoms of the disease is diarrhoea. "You can also see a thick discharge from the nose," he said on Monday [26 Aug 2013], adding that the animal can die of dehydration quickly. PPR cases are common in all the 5 payams [sub-counties] of Bor county as well as in the other counties, but lack of accessibility to the UN clinic in Bor makes it difficult for farmers to bring their animals for treatment.

Out of 1651 goats treated at the UN clinic from October 2012 to July 2013, many were found to have been infected with PPR. During this period, 5624 cattle were also treated.

Goat farmers in Bor are happy that their animals can get treatment unlike in the past. Manyang Akol is one such farmer. "You just take your goats to the clinic in Bor, and they get treated from any kind of diseases. To me, I thought this disease was a curse, and I even went to the church and asked the people to pray for my animals. I offered one he-goat to the church as well, but nothing changed," said Akol.

The UN mobile veterinary clinic has treated a total 13 313 animals including goats and cattle in Pibor, Boma, Jalle, Yuai and Malual-chat.

In cattle, trypanosomiasis, haemorrhagic septicaemia, tuberculosis (TB), east [coast] fever, and brucellosis were found to be the commonest diseases, according to Col. Shiba Kumar.

Kumar cautioned farmers against consuming raw milk, as its consumption can lead to transmission of TB and brucellosis from animals to humans.

[Bor is the capital of Jungoli State in the Republic of South Sudan (map at http://tinyurl.com/o6req5z).

As the veterinarian, Col. Shiba Kumar rightly remarked, PPR is not a new disease in the affected region or in the country; in fact, PPR is one of the diseases regarded as endemic in most, if not all, of eastern, central, and western Africa (map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap).

Undoubtedly, farmers are very fortunate to have an animal clinic run in the region, where various bacterial and other diseases of cattle or goats can indeed be successfully treated. Unfortunately, PPR -- a capripox, highly pathogenic, infectious viral disease -- is not one of them, though supplementary treatment can occasionally somewhat reduce mortality. The best way to reduce the serious losses caused by PPR in goats is prevention. This can be done by appropriate biosecurity and particularly by vaccination. A very efficacious live attenuated vaccine is available.

PPR is characterised by enteric as well as respiratory symptoms and is also named "stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome." The causative agent, a morbilivirus, is closely related to the rinderpest virus. It is not zoonotic.
