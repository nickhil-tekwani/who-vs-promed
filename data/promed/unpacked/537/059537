YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (10):
==========================
Not to get off the subject of yellow fever in Asia, but does anyone know if
the YF vaccine offers any cross-protection to SLE?
Frank
[This and previous comments on ProMED are a revisitation of some old
questions. It may be that much institutional memory has been lost but it
also may be that these questions, regarding cross-protection among
flaviviruses, are newly important. There is no substitute for an adequate
review of the literature and I highly recommend to anyone with such questions
that they get themselves to a library and jump into the data. A good place
to begin would be Tom Monath's outstanding series "The Arboviruses:
epidemiology and ecology" published by CRC Press in 1989. In particular,
check out volume 4, Chapter 42 (St. Louis encephalitis) by Ted Tsai and Carl
Mitchell. This review also has some excellent references on the subject of
cross-protection among flaviviruses, including: Bond JO and Hammon WMcD
(1970) Epidemiologic studies of possible cross-protection between dengue and
St. Louis encephalitis arboviruses in Florida. Am J Epidemiol 92:321. I
contacted Jim Bond, (formerly of PAHO and before that with the Encephalitis
Research Center in Tampa) who is happily retired in Maryland
(jquake@aol.com), and he graciously provided the following, which may be of
use: (1) Wisseman CL, Kitaoka M, and Tamiya T (1966) Immunological studies
with Group B arthropod-borne viruses. V. Evaluation of cross-immunity against
type 1 dengue fever in human subjects convalescent from subclinical natural
Japanese encephalitis virus infection and vaccinated with 17D strain yellow
fever vaccine. Am J Trop Med Hyg 15:588, (2) Hatgi JN, Wisseman, Jr CL,
Rosenweig AC, Harrington BR, and Kitaoka M (1966) Immunological studies with
Group B arthropod-borne viruses. VI. Hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody
responses to 17D yellow fever vaccine in human subjects with different
degrees of complexity of pre-vaccination Group B virus experience. Am J Trop
Med Hyg 15:601, (3) Pond WL, Ehrenkranz NJ, Danauskus JX, and Carter MJ
(1967) Heterotypic serological response after yellow fever vaccinations.
Detection of persons with past St. Louis encephalitis or dengue. J Immunol.
98:673. Jim added that much of this and more was summarized in his doctoral
thesis (University of Pittsburgh) entitled "Cross protection between dengue
and St. Louis encephalitis arboviruses: an epidemiological and laboratory
study" (available as No. 68-7498 from University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor,
MI).
James Porterfield's chapter ("Antigenic characterization and classification
of Togaviridae") in "The Togaviruses: biology, structure, replication",
edited by Walter Schlesinger (Academic Press), is now a bit dated (published
1980) but contains some excellent discussion and useful references. The
chapter I wrote with Jack Poland ("Laboratory Diagnosis") in "St. Louis
encephalitis", also edited by Tom Monath (American Public Health Association,
1980) also contains some useful information and references--- Moderator=
