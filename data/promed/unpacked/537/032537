Jordan's Health Ministry on Thursday [8 Sep 2022] confirmed the 1st monkeypox case in the kingdom, the state-run Petra news agency reported.

The patient was a Jordanian citizen in his 30s who had recently traveled to several European countries and returned to Jordan on 20 Aug 2022, according to the ministry.

The patient, who is currently in good condition and recovering at his home in isolation, started to develop symptoms on 25 Aug 2022, including a fever, sore throat, muscle soreness and swollen lymph nodes, it added.

The ministry said it was tracking down people who had contact with the patient to inquire about their health conditions.

The 2nd case of monkeypox has been detected in Russia in a man who returned from a trip to Europe, the St. Petersburg Directorate of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing told journalists on Thursday [8 Sep 2022], TASS reported.

"The directorate of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing for the city of St. Petersburg is informing of the detection of a new case of monkeypox. The disease was diagnosed in a man who returned from a trip to European countries. The patient has been hospitalized with typical symptoms at a medical institution specializing in infections. The patient's life is not in danger," the sanitary watchdog's statement says.

The specialists curtailed the possibility of the further spread of monkeypox in Russia after the 2nd domestic case was detected.

"The possibility of the further spread of the infection has been curbed. In Russia, a set of measures on reducing the risks of importing and spreading monkeypox continues to be in effect, which includes reinforced sanitary and quarantine control on the border," reads the statement.

[5] UK: 2nd virus strain
Date: Thu 8 Sep 2022
Source: Express [edited]
https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1666104/monkeypox-symptoms-virus-second-strain-symptoms


The UK is under threat from a number of viral entities in 2022. Monkeypox is one of them, and the UK is continuing to assess whether or not the virus poses a new threat as a 2nd strain is detected.

Monkeypox continues to remain a virus to keep an eye on. Alongside the likes of COVID-19, polio, and hepatitis, the virus has experienced a renaissance since reappearing in the country for the 1st time since 2018. While the virus has not spread at the same speed as COVID-19 did in early 2020, it has nevertheless given cause for concern in the scientific community. Although feelings of anxiety have mellowed while the number of new cases has declined, the virus has recently sprung back into the minds of many in government as a 2nd strain of the virus is detected in the UK.

In a statement, the UKHSA said they had "confirmed that an individual has been diagnosed with monkeypox linked to recent travel to West Africa" and that this individual "does not have the current outbreak strain circulating in the UK."

In response to the new case, the individual with the 2nd strain of the virus has been admitted to the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) unit at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and contact tracing of the individual is underway. The hope is that by isolating those who may have come into contact with the patient that the spread of the 2nd strain of monkeypox may be halted.

In a statement, Incident Director for the UKHSA, Dr Sophia Maki said: "We are working to contact the individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.

"UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed and the risk to the general public is very low. We remind everyone who is planning to travel to West and Central Africa to be alert for the symptoms of monkeypox and to call 111 if you have symptoms on your return."

Why is there such a strong response to just one case of monkeypox? The reason for such a robust response is because it is not yet known how this 2nd strain differs from the original strain of monkeypox first seen during the spring. As a result, measures need to be taken to prevent its spread.

[A 7 Sep 2022 Reuters report states that the European Union said on Wednesday [7 Sep 2022] it had secured an additional 170 920 doses of the monkeypox vaccine developed by biotech firm Bavarian Nordic amid concerns about the outbreak of the disease. The new order more than doubles the EU's supply of the vaccine, bringing the total number of doses directly purchased by the EU to nearly 335 000 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-secures-more-doses-bavarian-071341145.html). One hopes that the vaccine will provide good immunity against this new African strain, should it spread. - Mod.TY]

[6] Possible neurological problems
Date: Fri 9 Sep 2022 05:47 EDT

Monkeypox's effect on the skin -- the disfiguring rashes -- and the flu-like symptoms have been well described, but few have investigated the neurological and psychiatric problems the virus might cause.

There are historic reports of neurological complications in people infected with the related smallpox virus and in people vaccinated against smallpox, which contains the related vaccinia virus. So my colleagues and I wanted to know whether monkeypox causes similar problems.

We looked at all the evidence from before the current monkeypox pandemic of neurological or psychiatric problems in people with a monkeypox infection. The results are published in the journal eClinicalMedicine (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00374-1/fulltext).

A small but noticeable proportion of people (2%-3%) with monkeypox became very unwell and developed serious neurological problems, including seizure and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain that can cause long-term disability). We also found that confusion occurred in a similar number of people. It's important to note, though, that these figures are based on a few studies with few participants.

Besides the severe and rare brain problems, we found evidence of a broader group of people with monkeypox who had more common neurological symptoms including headache, muscle ache and fatigue. From looking at the studies, it was unclear how severe these symptoms were and how long they lasted. It was also unclear how many people with monkeypox had psychiatric problems -- such as anxiety and depression -- as few studies looked into it. Of those that did, low mood was frequently reported.

We don't know what factors are driving these neuropsychiatric problems in people with monkeypox. We would want to know whether the strain of monkeypox virus and the severity of infection affects these problems. However, we were unable to look into this properly because it was not consistently reported in studies.

Although we found that people with monkeypox infection can have neuropsychiatric symptoms, the studies in our paper cannot say with any certainty that it's the virus causing these problems. Future research exploring this will need to follow up people with no neuropsychiatric conditions before becoming infected with monkeypox.

If it is the virus that is causing these problems, the biological processes underlying it are unclear and could involve the virus directly entering the nervous system, a reaction by the immune system or something else entirely. It's also possible that the stigma people experience from monkeypox infection and the effect of disfiguring skin rashes could contribute to psychological distress such as low mood.

Our research focused on the evidence before the current monkeypox pandemic. Most of the data were from west Africa and in people hospitalised with an infection, whereas the current pandemic has predominantly affected North America and western Europe. It is unclear to what degree the symptoms of previous outbreaks will mirror what we are seeing now.

Important research has come out since we finished our paper. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine included over 500 people with monkeypox from 16 countries in the current outbreak. Although no cases of encephalitis or seizure were reported, headache and fatigue were found in more than a quarter of people infected with monkeypox and low mood in up to one in 10 people.

However, there have been 2 recently reported cases of monkeypox-confirmed encephalitis in Spain. Further surveillance is needed to determine the true extent of more serious problems like encephalitis and seizure.

The monkeypox outbreak remains a global concern, and ongoing public health measures, including improving access to vaccination, are needed.

Although monkeypox mainly causes flu-like symptoms and skin problems, our latest study -- and subsequent studies -- shows that neuropsychiatric symptoms are not uncommon. We are not expecting a tide of serious brain problems, but complications such as encephalitis and seizure may occur in a small proportion of people. We need more research to find out if these symptoms persist over time and whether they're caused by monkeypox.
