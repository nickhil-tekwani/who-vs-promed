The stables at Saint John's Rockwood Park are closed to the public and wagon rides cancelled due to the presence of the highly contagious horse disease called strangles.

That brings the total number of lab-confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 3 since strangles hit the province last month [May 2018]. All 3 are "south of Fredericton", but in separate locations, said Nicole Wanamaker, manager of provincial veterinary services. She declined to reveal exactly where, citing privacy reasons. Cases have also been reported in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

Strangles can cause excess mucus, cough and fever in horses as well as abscess swelling under the jaw and throat, obstructing the airway and making it difficult for them to chew and swallow. They may become lethargic and have a reduced appetite. The bacteria is primarily spread by direct contact between horses or shared environments, such as water troughs, but the bacteria can also be transferred via people's hands or clothing.

The infection does not affect people or other animals.

The actual number of cases of strangles in New Brunswick could be higher than 3, said Wanamaker. Her office is waiting for the lab results on some other swab samples. But strangles is not a reportable disease, so her office doesn't necessarily hear from private veterinarians who treat horses, she said. In addition, it can take up to 2 weeks after exposure for an infected -- and contagious -- horse to exhibit symptoms. And even when they do, it can be mistaken for a cold or allergies.

Doley said she didn't think much of it when a new horse at Rockwood Stables developed a runny nose. "If we hadn't have had this horse checked [by a veterinarian], I would've thought she just had allergies," she said. "And if someone hadn't have said to me, 'Have you heard that strangles is out there?' we probably wouldn't have called the vet. I wouldn't have thought of that immediately. I mean horses, like kids, get runny noses all the time."

Now, she's got 5 of approximately 16 horses under quarantine, including the one confirmed case, 3 sick horses and another horse that was exposed to the sick horses, but isn't showing any symptoms. Lees Doley's horse Cody is one of the 5 quarantined at Rockwood Stables. He was exposed to the 4 sick horses but does not have any symptoms of strangles. "For the safety of the horses, we have decided to close the barn to the public," reads a sign posted on the stable door [Mon 4 Jun 2018]. The closure will remain in effect until the "flare up" across the Maritimes [provinces] is under control, the notice states.

Strangles can be treated with antibiotics and most affected horses will recover within 3 or 4 weeks. Doley said all of her sick horses have already improved. "All the fevers are gone. All the runny noses are gone. None of them are coughing. They're all eating." She's swabbing her horses every week, hoping to get negative results 3 consecutive times. Only then will she reopen to the public, she said, noting this month will be a definite financial hit to her business, which operates year-round on land leased from the City of Saint John.

Veterinarian Mitch Downey said the disease can be also costly to treat and people working with animals must take precautions. "Oftentimes, it's complete changing of clothing, footwear, bathing, washing diligently. Disinfecting all instruments, tools used on the premises," he said. "It's very time-consuming but obviously very important in terms of preventing spread of bacteria."

Other biosecurity measures recommended by the province include not allowing any new animals on the premises, restricting visitors, monitoring the behaviour and temperature of horses and isolating any sick horse as soon as possible.

Vaccine available
-----------------
A preventive vaccine followed by a booster is available for about 65 USD. It doesn't work in the midst of an outbreak, but many horses north of Fredericton have been getting it, according to Wanamaker. She said it's about 60 or 70 per cent effective. "It won't stop the disease," said Wanamaker. "It will at least reduce the severity of the clinical signs, and hopefully the horse won't maybe have as high of a fever, the abscesses may not appear, things like that."

Wanamaker recommends horse owners talk to their veterinarian to determine if the vaccine is the right option for them. She is also encouraging horse owners and veterinarians to report any cases of strangles.

The first case of strangles in New Brunswick was confirmed on [18 May 2018], according to the Department of Agriculture's provincial veterinary service. On [28 May 2018], the department issued an advisory about a 2nd case being confirmed at a different barn from the previously diagnosed case. A no-movement policy was implemented at the 2nd unidentified location, which will remain in place for at least 2 weeks while the horses are being monitored, the advisory notice states.

The department issued advice about the 3rd case on [1 Jun 2018].
