Detection of the dreaded hantavirus in 2 people from SPSR Nellore
district led a team headed by Dr Ramesh from the Integrated Disease
Surveillance Project of the National Institute of Epidemiology,
Chennai to visit the habitations of the patients on Friday and
Saturday [14-15 Oct 2011].

Hantavirus [infection can cause] a life-threatening disease, spreading
to humans through the droppings and urine of rodents, especially deer
mice [deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, do not occur in India. -
Mod.TY]. The symptoms of the disease are chills, fever and muscle
aches, in addition to dry cough, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting,
and shortness of breath.

The indications are similar to leptospirosis, dengue, Japanese
encephalitis, and chikungunya, and the only way of prevention is to
avoid exposure to rodent urine and droppings, according to district
malaria officer, Dr M Kanakadri.

A 66 year old woman from the Nawabpeta area of Nellore town succumbed
to the disease after 3 weeks treatment in a corporate hospital at
Chennai few days ago.

However, an agriculture labourer of Nellipudi village in Vakadu mandal
survived with treatment at the same hospital, although he too was
tested positive for [a] hantavirus [infection].

In-charge epidemiologist Dr Veera Pratap has denied a report in a
vernacular daily about the death of a 50 year old woman due to the
virus at Chinnapadug-upadu village near Nellore. Dr Pratap, who
assisted Dr Ramesh and his team during their visit to the district,
said that the woman tested negative for [a] hantavirus [infection].
However, she was also treated at the same hospital in Chennai where
the other 2 cases were under treatment.

The team came to study all the cases that were treated during the same
period in the hospital, since the symptoms were similar, though the
tests proved negative for some. They visited the homes of the patients
and elicited information about the symptoms from the relatives.

"They want to send a detailed report to the virology wing in New Delhi
to seek their advice to deal with the hantavirus before it spreads,
since the virus is new to our region," Dr Pratap said.

Meanwhile, the medical and health wing officials have started
collecting blood samples from the family members of the patients and
people living in the locality as a precautionary measure. The district
medical and health officer, Dr N Dasaradha-ramaiah, told this
newspaper that they will send the samples for testing.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information indicating the
tests used to make the diagnosis of a hantavirus infection and,
especially, the identity of the hantavirus involved in these cases. It
would also be of interest to have a clinical description of these 2
cases as well.

It would not be surprising if Seoul hantavirus is found in this area,
as it is widely distributed around the world in _Rattus norveigicus_.
Thottapalayam virus is a hantavirus harbored by the Asian house shrew
(_Suncus murinus_) in the Indian subcontinent and China. However, it
has not been associated with human disease. A newly identified but not
yet named genetically distinct hantavirus was found in the Chinese
mole shrew (_Anourosorex squamipes_) captured in Cao Bang Province,
Viet Nam. This shrew species occurs in South East Asia, extending
westward to Bhutan and Assam in northern India. It has not yet been
associated with human disease either. A 4 Feb 2010 ProMED-mail post
(archive no. 20100205.0385) mentioned serological evidence of
hantavirus infections and 2 fatal and other cases in India with
serologic evidence in 2 different test formats for a Puumala virus, a
hantavirus commonly found in Europe.
