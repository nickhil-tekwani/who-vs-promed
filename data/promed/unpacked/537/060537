Dog owners have been warned after claims of a case of deadly Alabama rot was diagnosed in Christchurch.

Support group Dog Friendly Dorset has issued an alert for the St Catherine's Hill area. Posters put up in the area warn: "A case of Alabama rot has been diagnosed. Please be vigilant for symptoms in any animal you care for, and contact your vet if concerned."

The posters said symptoms to look out for include skin lacerations, ulcers, and sores. Affected dogs may be lethargic with a loss of appetite and possible vomiting.

Alabama rot is a disease that damages blood vessels in the skin and kidneys. It causes blood to clot in the vessels that damages the lining and the tissues of the kidneys. This causes ulcers on a dog's skin but can also cause fatal kidney failure.

The support group urges people to keep to dry paths and to try to keep dogs out of muddy or wet areas. Owners are also urged to wash mud off of their dogs after walks and to check for wounds.

The warning comes after a "probable" case of the disease was discovered in New Forest last week. The New Forest Dog Owners Group spoke out after illness in a dog who had been walked in the Wilverley enclosure.

Numerous studies have been carried out into Alabama rot in recent years. Experts have compiled lists of affected areas and do their best to warn dog owners.

David Walker, a director and medicine specialist at Anderson Moores veterinary practice, said, "This is understandably a worrying disease for dog owners; however, it is still very rare, and we're advising dog owners to remain calm but vigilant and to seek advice from their local vet if their dog develops unexplained skin lesions.

"Most dogs initially present with an unexplained skin lesion/sore that is often below the elbow or knee and may involve the paw.

"This may appear as a patch of red skin with or without a defect in the skin (ulcer). Some dogs will go on to develop kidney failure after the skin lesion, and signs may be things like vomiting, tiredness, and no appetite."

And he added, "If anybody is concerned, they should contact their vet."

[Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), a rare disease affecting dogs, has been reported in the UK since 2012. It is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting small vessels of the kidney and skin, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. Dogs affected by CRGV typically present with skin ulcers on their legs or paws, although some dogs have shown ulcers(s) on their head, muzzle, tongue, flank, and belly. The ulcers vary in severity and can look as simple as a small cut or area of redness that could be mistaken for a cut pad, bruise, or sting. It is important to remember that most skin ulcers will not be caused by CRGV.

The underlying etiology remains unknown, although clinicopathological and histological findings resemble features of certain forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in people, for which plasma exchange (PEX) is considered an important component of therapy (ref 1).

A seasonal distribution is reported with most cases occurring between November and May each year. CRGV in the UK has affected dogs of many different breeds, both large and small, of any sex and with a wide age range. There have been reports of multiple dogs from the same household being affected. Compared to other problems seen in dogs, this is still a very rare condition.
