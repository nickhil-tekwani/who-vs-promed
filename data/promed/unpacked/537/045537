A person who stayed in a cabin on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park [Arizona] in mid-September 2015 contracted a rare tick-borne fever, the park announced on [Fri 2 Oct 2015]. The National Park Service and Coconino County Public Health Services District are now investigating the positive case of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF).

TBRF is a rare, but treatable and curable, bacterial infection that occurs in the western USA, according to the park's news release. People contract the disease after being bitten by infected soft ticks, which typically feed on rodents. The ticks tend to bite people when they are sleeping and infections are associated with situations where people are staying in cabins in mountainous areas where rodents are present.

Flagstaff had several cases of the relapsing fever in the summer of 2014, when students staying in cabins at Camp Colton on Hart Prairie were bitten by ticks. 2 trapped mice tested positive for the disease, and the cabins were sealed and thoroughly disinfected before the camp was allowed to reopen.

Federal and county agencies are examining a group of cabins on the North Rim managed by Forever Resorts, which is where the visitor stayed, said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman with Grand Canyon National Park. So far, officials found 1 cabin where there was evidence of a chipmunk nest. The buildings are all rodent-proofed, but "there is always a bit of human error," Davis said. An integrated pest management company treated the cabin on [Fri 2 Oct 2015], she said

The visitor who tested positive for the relapsing fever has been successfully treated for the disease with a course of antimicrobials. Davis also noted that the individual did go to other places in the Four Corners area [SW corner of Colorado, NW corner of New Mexico, NE corner of Arizona, and SE corner of Utah] where TBRF is endemic. As a part of its investigation, the park is working with county health district officials to contact individuals who stayed in the North Rim cabins. So far, no one else reported symptoms consistent with the tick-borne fever, Davis said. Tests that could include samples of nesting materials and droppings from the cabin, along with trapped rodents, are expected to be conducted next week [week of 5 Oct 2015].

Common symptoms of TBRF include high fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rash may also occur. The disease is characterized by recurring, or relapsing, episodes of symptoms that usually last about 3 days, disappear for 7 days, then return.

Though the disease is uncommon, 2 outbreaks have occurred on the North Rim of Grand Canyon in the last 42 years. In 1973, 62 cases were reported nationally. In 1990, 17 cases were reported.

[Coconino County is located in the north central part of the US state of Arizona and the county seat is the city of Flagstaff; Coconino County contains Grand Canyon National Park, the Havasupai Nation, and parts of the Navajo Nation, Hualapai Nation, and Hopi Nation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconino_County,_Arizona). A map of Arizona showing the location of Coconino County can be found at http://geology.com/county-map/arizona-county-map.gif. - Mod.ML

The following is a discussion from our posting of a 2002 outbreak (archive no 20030829.2179):

"Relapsing fever is tick-borne in the USA but may also be louse-borne. Louse-borne disease remains endemic in parts of central and east Africa and the South American Andes. Although the clinical illnesses can be quite similar, the tick-borne form is associated with more relapses (as many as 13, but averaging about 3, as compared with the louse-borne form, with as many as 5 but usually only one) and a much lower mortality rate if left untreated (2-5 percent versus as high as 40 percent). In the USA, a majority of the reported cases are from California and Washington.

As stated in the Emerging Infectious Diseases paper, a 1927 case of relapsing fever diagnosed in Washington state was thought to have been acquired in Montana (1), and soft ticks collected in 1936 in southwestern Montana were found to be able to transmit _B. parkeri_ to mice in the laboratory (2).

Although various species of _Borrelia_ (at least 15) can [cause] tick-borne disease, it is not entirely clear that in 1936, they could be readily differentiated. More specific serologic identification is now possible (3). It is important to note that only one species, _B. recurrentis_, is associated with the louse-borne form.

Unlike hard ticks such as _Dermacentor_ (one of the vectors for Rocky Mountain spotted fever) and _Ixodes_ (Lyme disease), _Ornithodoros_ soft ticks are night feeders, feeding quite quickly (5-20 minutes) and painlessly. Outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever, like this one, are often associated with sleeping in cabins.

The diagnosis can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright's stain of the peripheral blood. Without any concentration of blood, as shown in the Emerging Infectious Diseases case above, spirochetes can be seen extracellularly. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 3 and 4 are useful.

Louse-borne relapsing fever has been imported into the USA. In 1976, a case of a woman from Ethiopia was reported from Dayton, Ohio in which the organism was detected in her blood and in lice. It was claimed to have been the 1st case of louse-borne relapsing fever in the USA in the 20th century (5). More recently, the louse-borne disease has been diagnosed in immigrants from Africa coming to Europe (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below).
