In Singapore, 5 more people have come down with the mosquito-borne
[disease] chikungunya, said the Health Ministry (MOH) on Wednesday [13
Aug 2008].

They include 2 foreign workers at Kranji Way, bringing the total
number of cases linked to the northern industrial area to 30, said
the ministry. The 2 (a 48-year-old Indian and a 34-year-old Chinese
national), have no recent history of travel overseas prior to their
onset of illness, said the authorities.

The Ministry said it has also been notified of 3 other cases not
related to the Kranji cluster.

So far this year [2008], there have been 103 cases of chikungunya
fever in Singapore.

Like dengue fever, chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne disease,
characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea,
vomiting, joint pain with or without swelling, and low back pain. The
best way to prevent chikungunya fever is to take precautionary
measures to prevent mosquito breeding.

[Singapore is struggling to halt chikungunya virus transmission,
despite active efforts to find and eliminate _Aedes_ virus vector
breeding sites, illustrating the difficulty of vector control campaigns.

The outbreak began in January 2008 -- see ProMED ref. (03) below. As
of last year [2007], Singapore's total population stood at 4.59
million, up from 4.4 million in 2006. Of these, 3.58 million were
citizens and permanent residents:
