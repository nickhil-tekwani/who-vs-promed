RABIES BOOSTER VACCINATIONS IN HIGH RISK EXPOSURE SUBJECTS
Phyllis Catharina and her staff (ProMED-mail 23 August 98) obviously are
at high risk of respiratory and other exposure to rabies from bats and is
asking a practical question: how to reliably, without adverse effects and
least costly to provide protection for herself and her staff.
We, like other rabies research and service laborites in the tropics, have
faced this problem for years. Staff at the Thai Red Cross Institute
(Bangkok), which manufactured mouse brain (SMB) and Semple vaccines for
decades up to the early 1980's, never used SMB for "pre-exposure"
vaccination of staff. The high incidence of adverse reactions with the Thai
products and its low immunogenicity precluded this. The old Lilly duck
embryo vaccine (also a poor excuse for a rabies vaccine) and later HDCV
were used exclusively till the much less expensive and highly immunogenic
Vero cell (PVRV), Purified Duck Embryo (PDEV) and Chick Embryo (PCEC)
vaccines became available.
We have at least 10-12 workers and some graduate students exposed in the
laboratory on a daily basis, either doing routine FAT and RFFIT tests as
well as research. Since using the "second generation vaccines", we have
done first annual boosters and then every two year boosters and RFFIT's on
these people. They have had consistently high titers (way over 0.5 IU/mL)
and we have relaxed our surveillance a bit since then; usually giving
boosters every 3 years. The second generation vaccines (PVRV, PDEV and
PCEC) have a far lower prevalence of serum sickness-like reactions with
boosters than HDCV and, as a matter of fact, I have never seen such a
reaction in our staff. This was born out in a post-marketing study of PVRV
carried out at our institute (see reference).
Our unpublished data for PDEV and PCEC are similar; though minor local
reactions at injection sites are not uncommon (redness, itching etc.). We
have also done several studies relating to the persistence of antibody
levels (see references) and one looking at persons with remote immunization
using nerve tissue derived vaccines (SMB and Semple) and then receiving
boosters or new PET with a second generation tissue culture vaccine. The
response was gratifying in virtually all such persons - showing that SMB
and Semple vaccines did result in long lasting immunity ( up to 50 years)
in virtually all subjects that received a complete course (but not ALL,
which may have much to do with the quality of the SMB and Semple vaccine
lots that they had received).
The second issue is that of whether SMB and tissue culture vaccines protect
against bat rabies strains. This question should be addressed to Henri
Tsiang of Pasteur Paris whom I am copying with this. He and his group have
studied bat strains in Europe and, I believe, have found reduced
neutralization responses. This has, however, not been the case with North
American bat rabies variants and I don't know enough about South American
bat rabies but there must be people out there who have done studies in the
lab. The Australian bat rabies strain (sorry the official name is not
rabies but Australian Lyssavirus variant), seems to be neutralized by
modern tissue culture vaccine induced antibodies.
In any case, Phyllis should be quite safe in using one of the second
generation tissue culture vaccines with a booster every 2-3 years. She
should check antibody levels annually till she is satisfied, as we are now,
that doing RFFIT less frequently is safe in her situation. There are rare
non- responders (I believe Jean Smith had one technician in her lab in
Atlanta) who are best removed from this type of work. Patients with HIV
disease also do not respond well to rabies vaccines. This may be of
importance to Phyllis who lives in Brazil which has many similarities with
Thailand. We had several non and low responders among Thai AIDS patients
who had been bitten by street dogs.
I hope that Henri Tsiang will comment regarding bat rabies and immune
response to tissue culture vaccines.
