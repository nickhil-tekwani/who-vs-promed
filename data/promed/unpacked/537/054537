"'Mad Cow' Fear Leads U.K. to Destroy Parts of All Donated Blood" Wall
Street Journal (11/25/98) P. A1; Stecklow, Steve
The United Kingdom will destroy nearly all blood plasma donated in Britain
due to concerns about the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
also known as mad cow disease, replacing the blood products with plasma
from the United States. The move comes two and a half years after the BSE
scare struck the United Kingdom, which resulted in the slaughter of 2.5
million cattle.
Some scientists are concerned that the disease could be spread via blood
transfusions from individuals who once consumed tainted meat. And while
some experts feel the destruction of all blood plasma is drastic and
unwarranted, a spokeswoman for the National Blood Service in Britain
explained, "We're erring on the side of caution." Other officials recalled
the problems with the blood supply earlier in the AIDS epidemic and noted
that they did not want to make the same mistake with BSE.

I cannot find a Dept. of Health news release on its News Release Web site
to "authenticate" the Wall Street Journal report, but I am not surprised at
the story, it was very much expected and Health Minister Frank Dobson was
quoted as saying very recently that delay was only due to difficulty in
organising sufficient overseas supply.
Here is the relevant extract from the new IFST Position Statement on BSE
(which contains a reference to, and URL for, the October 1998 Risk
Quantification for CJD Transmission via Medicinal Products and Medical
Devices by the EU Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical
Devices. This included a major section dealing with blood). I also append
a blood-related quote from the EU Scientific Steering Committee risk
assessment in January 1998.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blood and CJD
The work mentioned earlier, implicating the lymph system in the
transmission of TSEs, gives rise to the possible role of human blood as a
possible transmission agent of CJD, particularly of nvCJD.
SEAC reported on its meeting on 24 October 1997
"The Committee reviewed the safety of blood and blood products and has
provided advice to Government, as follows:
The Committee have recently concluded that the transmissible agent of nvCJD
is indistinguishable from that of BSE but distinctly different from any of
the forms of classical CJD. Recent research (some unpublished) suggests
that the pathogenesis of nvCJD differs from that of classical CJD and the
former may have more involvement of lymphoreticular tissues possibly
involving circulating lymphocytes. Therefore it is logical to seek to
minimise any risk from blood or blood products by reducing the number of
lymphocytes present. SEAC recommends that the Government should consider a
precautionary policy of extending the use of leucodepleted blood and blood
products as far as is practicable. It will be for the National Blood
Authority to devise a strategy to implement such a policy. It will take
time to achieve full implementation and SEAC recommends that planning
begins soon while the risk assessments suggested below are carried out. It
is not possible at present to estimate accurately the risk of transmitting
nvCJD by blood transfusion.
The magnitude of the risk will depend, inter alia, on the number of blood
donors who are incubating nvCJD and this is not known. However, SEAC
recommends that risk assessments, making assumptions of various possible
incidences of nvCJD, be carried out to inform decisions on any measures
which may be necessary to protect recipients."
SEAC's advice and that of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological
Safety of Blood and Tissues (MSBT) was accepted by the UK Government. has
taken account of their views in its response.
Precautions to protect patients against the theoretical risk of contracting
nvCJD from blood products were announced in the UK. The announcement
followed a recall of blood products in November 1997, when some
contributing donors were confirmed as having developed nvCJD, and a review
of the current evidence by the UK Committee of Safety of Medicines (CSM).
The National Blood Service will be allowed to import plasma to manufacture
blood products. Recombinant factor VIII - the synthetic version of factor
VIII used in the treatment of haemophilia - is to be made available to
children under the age of 16 years and to new patients. The CSM has also
advised that recalls should include blood products if donors have
subsequently been identified as being strongly suspected of having nvCJD.
The previous recall was confined to products to which confirmed cases of
nvCJD had contributed. All products manufactured from British donor plasma
will be reviewed to determine which should be made from plasma sourced from
other countries which do not have clusters of cases of nvCJD.
This of course ignores that plasma from other countries (and especially
where donors sell their blood) may carry serious risk factors of its own.
On 21 October 1998 the EU Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and
Medical Devices adopted an Opinion on the Risk Quantification for CJD
Transmission via Medicinal Products and Medical Devices. This includes a
major section dealing with blood. It may be found on the europa Web site at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scmp/out12_en.html>
