Outbreaks of gastroenteritis linked to lettuce, Denmark, January 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 11 linked outbreaks of gastroenteritis with a total of 260
cases have occurred in Denmark in mid January 2010. Investigations
showed that the outbreaks were caused by norovirus of several
genotypes and by enterotoxigenic _E. coli_. Lettuce of the Lollo
Bionda type grown in France was found to be the vehicle.

From 18 to 20 Jan 2010, a series of outbreaks of gastroenteritis
were reported to Danish authorities. Outbreak investigations were
initiated by the Danish food control authority in cooperation with
Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the National Food Institute, the Food
and Veterinary Administration, as well as the medical officers and
several clinical microbiological laboratories in Copenhagen. The
epidemiological, microbiological, and food investigation are still
ongoing; here we report on the current status of the investigation of
these outbreaks.

Epidemiological examinations and findings
-----------------------------------------
The link between lettuce and illness was discovered in the 4th week
of January 2010 based on an analysis of 5 outbreaks. These outbreaks
had been reported during week 3 to the regional food control
authority, which covers the eastern part of Denmark. As of 8 Feb
2010, 11 outbreaks have been included in the cluster. A further 8
outbreaks in Denmark which are currently under investigation may also
be associated with lettuce. Taken together, the 11 outbreaks
comprised approximately 480 potentially exposed persons and
approximately 260 cases with symptoms of gastroenteritis (see Table
[available from the source URL above. - Mod.LL]) The 11 outbreaks all
took place in the eastern half of the country (on the islands of
Funen and Zealand). Norovirus was initially suspected as the
etiology, but the Kaplan criteria were not fulfilled in all
circumstances and attack rates were sometimes higher than expected
for norovirus, indicating the possibility of the presence of more
than a single disease agent.

Although norovirus outbreaks are not rare in winter, such a high
number of outbreaks was clearly above the seasonal average and
initial investigations generally indicated a food source. All
outbreaks occurred in groups of people (company employees, course
attendees, etc.) who had lunch delivered from catering companies. The
food in each case included sandwiches or Danish-style open sandwiches
(smorrebroed). Comparison of ingredient lists identified lettuce --
which was often found in the sandwiches -- as the only relevant
common food item. All lettuce used by implicated catering companies
was of the Lollo Bionda type and trace-back of the lettuce showed
that in each outbreak 1 of 2 suppliers had been used. Both suppliers
bought the lettuce from the same wholesaler who in turn bought it in
France. The lettuce was reported to be produced in France, grown
outdoors in the southwestern part of the country.

Questionnaire studies were performed for several of the outbreaks.
These showed a link between illness and consumption of sandwiches
containing lettuce. In one larger group of people, a retrospective
cohort study was performed. 8 different food items were available and
were inquired about. Questionnaires were distributed to 60 persons of
whom 44 responded; 34 reported to have been ill. Pooling of the 3
types of sandwiches that contained lettuce gave a relative risk of
6.2 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.0-38).

As described in the next section, enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
was found in cases of the outbreak cluster, but also in patients not
part of any of the 11 known outbreaks. When interviewed, these
patients were found to have been infected in Denmark (most ETEC
infections in Denmark are believed to be travel-related). Onset dates
ranged between 14 and 21 Jan 2010. Preliminary interviews suggested
that these patients had also been infected through consumption of
sandwiches made by catering companies. Possible additional outbreaks
uncovered this way are currently under investigation. Because of
these results, we believe that the infections occurred predominantly
in the form of outbreaks caused by wholesale lettuce as opposed to
lettuce sold in retail.

Microbiological examinations and findings
-----------------------------------------
Heads of lettuce could be collected from 2 of the implicated catering
companies and were analysed for norovirus at the Danish National Food
Institute. Norovirus of genogroup II was recovered from lettuce from
one outbreak on 22 Jan 2010. Subsequent analyses of remaining lettuce
for the presence of _E. coli_ were negative.

So far stool samples from 25 patients known to be part of one of the
outbreaks have been examined for viruses at the SSI. Of these, 23
were positive: norovirus of genogroup I was found in 2 patients,
genogroup II in 12 patients, and mixed infections with these viruses
in 9 patients. Preliminary sequencing results show the presence of at
least 3 different genotypes. Results of the examination for other
virus types are pending, but sapovirus has been detected in samples
from 2 patients.

Initial analysis of the same samples for pathogenic bacteria
(_Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, _Shigella_, and _Yersinia_) was
negative, but examination for diarrhoeagenic _E. coli_ revealed the
presence of ETEC in 11 cases of 24 examined at the SSI. They were
serotyped as _E. coli_ O6:K15:H16 containing genes for both the LT
and ST toxins. In addition to these cases, an unusually high number
of 16 further ETEC patients was found through the routine diagnostics
of stool samples performed at the SSI in January 2010 (see above); 15
of them were also found to be of serotype O6:K15:H16. Furthermore,
_Staphylococcus aureus_, _Clostridium perfringens_, and _Bacillus
cereus_ were recovered from 2, 3, and 2 outbreak cases, respectively
(of 24 examined).

Control measures and European perspective
-----------------------------------------
Based on the fact that lettuce of the same kind from the same
supplier was present in all outbreaks, lettuce from the French
supplier in question bought after 1 Jan 2010 was recalled from the
Danish market on 22 Jan 2010 by order of the Danish Food and
Veterinary Administration. A rapid alert (notification number
2010.0081) was issued on 25 Jan 2010 following the virological
confirmation of norovirus in the lettuce. Trace-back indicated that
only a small part of the incriminated batches had been sold through
retail, most had been sold to catering companies and restaurants. The
available evidence indicates that contaminated lettuce is no longer
on the market in Denmark.

Two urgent inquiries were released through the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control's food- and waterborne diseases
network, mentioning the norovirus outbreaks (26 Jan 2010) and the
ETEC findings (28 Jan 2010), and following this, the information was
also distributed through the norovirus network formerly known as
DIVINE-NET. In response, Norway reported having 3 outbreaks caused by
Lollo Bionda lettuce. It appeared that part of 2 batches of lettuce,
which had caused disease in Denmark, had been exported to Norway and
that this was the direct cause of the Norwegian outbreaks. To our
knowledge, no countries apart from Denmark and Norway have reported
on outbreaks caused by Lollo Bionda lettuce. Information from French
authorities on the possible cause of the contamination is pending.

Discussion
----------
Contaminated lettuce was shown to be the source of widespread illness
of norovirus and ETEC in Denmark in January 2010. Epidemiological
investigations of several outbreaks combined with trace-back analyses
indicated that particular batches of Lollo Bionda lettuce were the
source of the outbreaks. This was confirmed when norovirus was
directly detected in the lettuce. As several infectious agents have
been detected in the samples taken from the cases, we believe that
the lettuce was contaminated with multiple agents. How the lettuce
became contaminated is as yet unknown, but it will be important to
establish this in order to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.
Since neither norovirus nor ETEC are zoonotic agents, we speculate
that human fecal matter may have been the source of the
contamination, possibly via contaminated water.

Neither norovirus nor ETEC are generally covered by routine analyses
of stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis (in Denmark and
other European countries). Surveillance for both agents is therefore
incomplete and the extent of the infections may have been more
widespread than what we describe here. Furthermore, both disease
agents can be extremely difficult to detect in food. In this
outbreak, the detection methods used for analyses for ETEC in the
lettuce may not have been optimal, for instance the lettuce was
stored frozen between the viral and the bacterial analyses. Norovirus
is the disease agent giving rise to most food-borne outbreaks in
Denmark (1). However, series of linked norovirus outbreaks occur
relatively rarely and ETEC outbreaks are also quite rare. The last
large such outbreak occurred in 2006 and was also caused by imported
fresh produce (2).

[The 23 positive isolations of norovirus from patients were
heterogenous. Of these norovirus of genogroup I was found in 2
patients, genogroup II in 12 patients, and mixed infections with
these viruses in 9 patients. Furthermore sequencing results indicated
the presence of at least 3 different norovirus genotypes. This degree
of heterogeneity suggests that the lettuce was subjected to multiple
exposures to norovirus, perhaps through contaminated irrigation
water, rather than from a unique source. Alternatively these
noroviruses were isolated fortuitously since there are many reports
of norovirus-related gastroenteritis throughout Europe at the present
time. - Mod.CP]

[Lettuce as a form of fresh produce eaten raw can easily transmit
enteric pathogens. The following is an edited discussion on
enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ adapted from
<http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index4.html>.

Numerous types of diarrheagenic _E. coli_ strains have been
identified worldwide, including enterohemorragic (EHEC),
enteroinvasive (EIEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), Shiga toxin-secreting
(STEC), and entero-aggregative (EAEC) _E. coli_ strains. The
prevalence of these strains and the burden of disease they cause are
however unequal. Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC) strains are a major
cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries and of
travellers' diarrheas in visitors to these countries.

Disease burden
--------------
ETEC are an under-recognized but extremely important cause of
diarrhea in the developing world where there is non-adequate clean
water and poor sanitation. They are the most commonly isolated
bacterial enteropathogen in children below 5 years of age in
developing countries, and account for several hundred million cases
of diarrhea and several tens of thousand deaths each year. Disease
caused by ETEC follows ingestion of contaminated food or water and is
characterized by profuse watery diarrhea lasting for several days
that often leads to dehydration and malnutrition in young children.
ETEC was thought to account for approximately 200 million diarrhea
episodes and 380 000 deaths annually. A more conservative estimate,
about 170 000 deaths every year, was more recently suggested.
Repeated ETEC infections and persistent diarrheas in children in
developing countries are not rare, as observed in infants living in
the Nile delta area, who experienced between 4.6 and 8.8 diarrheal
episodes per year, with ETEC accounting for 66 percent of these
episodes. The peak incidence of ETEC diarrhea in developing country
settings occurs in the 1st 2 years of life, with a declining
incidence with age thereafter. Surveillance of hospitalized cases of
ETEC diarrhea has shown that a large proportion of cases also occur
in individuals over 10 years of age. ETEC are prevalent in surface
water sources in developing countries such as Bangladesh, which
explains the endemicity of the disease in these countries. In young
children, the tendency of ETEC to cause dehydrating diarrhoea is
lower (approximately 5 percent of episodes) than that of rotavirus
(approximately 36 percent of episodes). However, because the
incidence of ETEC diarrhea in children is considerably higher than
that of rotavirus diarrhea, the absolute number of dehydrating
diarrhea episodes due to ETEC is around 70 percent of that due to rotavirus.

ETEC also are the most common cause of travelers' diarrhea that
affects individuals from industrialized countries travelling to
developing regions of the world. Each year, there are an estimated 10
million cases of LT-related ETEC travelers' diarrhoea worldwide.
Thus, up to 60 percent of US visitors to Mexico develop the disease.

Once attached to the intestinal epithelium, ETEC elaborate both the
heat-labile (LT) and the heat-stable (ST) toxins, which induce the
watery diarrhea. The heat-labile enterotoxin LT is an 86 kDa protein
which, like the cholera toxin, with which it shares 82 percent amino
acid homology, is made of 5 B subunits that bind to GM1 ganglioside
receptors in the intestinal epithelium, and a single enzymatically
active A subunit, the ADP-ribosylating activity of which leads to
activation of cellular adenyl cyclase, efflux of chloride ions and
watery diarrhea. The heat-stable toxin (ST) is an 18-amino acid-long,
highly folded peptide, which also causes disruption of chloride
channels in the cell and secretory diarrhea. LT is expressed in about
66 percent of ETEC strains, either alone or in combination with ST,
and thus is significantly responsible for the worldwide disease burden of ETEC.
