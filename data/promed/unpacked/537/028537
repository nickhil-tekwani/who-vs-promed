With respect to the 23 Mar 2007 ProMED-mail
posting noting "[More information on the strain
of rabies involved would be of interest, as well
as the control measures that have lead to the
marked reduction in rabies cases in Ontario. -
Mod.MPP]":
Information on the Ontario situation can be
obtained from the following publications:
1. Rosatte et al., 2006. Journal of Wildlife Diseases 42(3) 589-605, and
2. Rosatte et al., 2001. Journal of Wildlife Diseases 37(2) 265-279.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Rosatte for
sending this references. Following are the
[edited] abstracts from the references mentioned
above.
1. Rosatte R. et al: Behavior, movements, and
demographics of rabid raccoons in Ontario,
Canada: Management implications. Journal of
Wildlife Diseases. 2006. 42(3) 589-605.
During 1999-2003, 127 cases of raccoon variant
rabies were reported in raccoons (_Procyon
lotor_) and striped skunks (_Mephitis mephitis_)
in Ontario, Canada. Raccoons accounted for 98
percent (125/127) of the reported cases with
behaviors/conditions including aggression,
fighting with dogs, ataxia, vocalizations,
appearance of being sick, and the presence of
porcupine (_Erethizon dorsatum_) quills. Of the
rabid raccoons, 78 percent of were adults.
Juveniles were underrepresented (22 percent)
compared with the adult/juvenile ratios found in
non-rabid Ontario raccoon populations. Of the
age-known raccoons, 83 percent were ï¿½ 3 years of
age, and 22 percent of the rabid adult female
raccoons had evidence of having had a litter
during the year in which they were found to be
rabid. The majority of rabid raccoons were
reported during the fall, winter, and spring,
suggesting a relationship between raccoon
behavioral activities such as denning and
breeding and the timing of rabies outbreaks.
Multiple cases of raccoon rabies occurred at
several barns, suggesting that those structures
serve as focal points of rabies transmission as a
result of denning activities. Movements of 5
rabid raccoons (range 1564-4143 m) were not
different from movements of non-rabid raccoons in
Ontario. Government staff submitted 66 percent of
the rabid animals, stressing the importance of
those agencies in rabies control and surveillance
operations. Increased knowledge of the behaviors
of rabid raccoons should assist in the
development of management strategies for rabies.

During 15 Jul to 4 Oct 1999, rabies control
programs were implemented with the objective
being to contain the 1st 3 confirmed cases of
raccoon rabies in Canada. The strategy, called
point infection control (PIC), involved the use
of 3 tactics: population reduction (PR),
trap-vaccinate-release (TVR), and oral rabies
vaccination with baits (ORV), to control the
spread of raccoon rabies. A total of 1202
raccoons (_Procyon lotor_) and 337 skunks
(_Mephitis mephitis_) were captured and
euthanized using 24 719 trap-nights in the 3 PR
zones around the location of the 3 rabies cases,
near Brockville, Ontario. That represented an 83
percent to 91 percent reduction in the raccoon
populations in an approximate 225 sq. km. area
around the 3 rabies cases. Raccoon density in the
PR zones declined from 5.1-7.1 sq. km. to 0.6-1.1
sq. km. following control. All tested specimens
were negative for rabies by the fluorescent
antibody test (FAT). In addition, 1759 raccoons
and 377 skunks were intramuscularly vaccinated
against rabies and released using 27 956
trap-nights in an approximate 485 sq. km. TVR
zone implemented outside of the PR zones. A total
of 856 cats from both PR and TVR areas were also
captured, vaccinated, and released. Cost for the
3 PIC operations was CanD 363 000 (USD 315 625)
or about CanD 500 (USD 435) per sq. km. To
further contain the outbreak, about 81 300 baits
containing Raboral V-RG oral rabies vaccine were
aerially distributed on 8 and 27 Sep 1999, to
create an 8 to 15 km.-wide buffer zone (an area
of 1200 sq. km) of vaccinated raccoons
immediately beyond the PR and TVR zones. This was
the 1st time that V-RG was used in Canada to
orally vaccinate free ranging raccoons against
rabies. Baiting costs were CanD 241 000 (USD 209
550) or about CanD 200 (USD 174) per sq. km.
including post baiting assessment costs. As of 31
Aug 2000, 35 additional cases (38 in total) of
raccoon rabies have occurred in the control and
vaccination zones. This number is far below the
level of rabies prevalence in USA jurisdictions
where raccoon rabies was epizootic. In the
future, PIC methodologies will continue to be
used in Ontario to contain isolated cases of
raccoon rabies.
