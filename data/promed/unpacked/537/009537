A state of emergency has been declared at a farm in Russia's southern
republic of Kalmykia over an anthrax outbreak, the regional
emergencies department reported on Sunday [2 Jan 2011].

Anthrax was detected in the meat of a cow that had been culled on
suspicion of the disease at the livestock farm in the Gorodovikovskiy
district of Kalmykia. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of the
anthrax [bacteria], the emergencies department said. Overall, 512 head
of livestock, 256 head of small cattle [i.e. sheep & goats], 21
horses, and 64 pigs have been vaccinated to contain the spread of the
anthrax outbreak in the district, the emergencies department said.

Anthrax most commonly infects wild mammals and domestic cattle and
sheep, which ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Humans can be
affected when exposed to blood and other tissues from infected
animals. Anthrax can be highly lethal, but in some forms it responds
well to antibiotic treatment and there are effective vaccines against
the disease.

[The Russian authorities are to be congratulated on catching this case
relatively early. This presumes, of course, that there have not been
any human cases which then triggered the investigation.

As it is winter in Kalmykia it is more probable that this case was the
result of contaminated feed, not grazing, and if so the owner was
fortunate to apparently have had just one affected animal. In Muslim
areas of Russia dead animals get tossed out, but the sick are
slaughtered and butchered. However most Kalmyks are Buddhists and
their customs may differ. Subsequent reports may provide more details.
