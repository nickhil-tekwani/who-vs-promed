Rabies case in quarantine in South East England
-----------------------------------------------
Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and the
Health Protection Agency have carried out a full and thorough
investigation following confirmation of rabies on 25 Apr 2008 in a
dog which had originated in Sri Lanka and which died of rabies in a
UK quarantine facility.

That investigation has now concluded. In the light of the findings of
the investigation, restrictions placed on the quarantine facility on
25 Apr [2008] can be lifted. This also allows us to lift the
precautionary restrictions placed on 4 other dogs that had been
released from the same facility when they completed their quarantine
period after the dog that died of rabies arrived from Sri Lanka.

A full tracing exercise for animals and humans that may have been in
contact with the infected dog was carried out and satisfactorily
concluded. Medical advice and treatment, where appropriate, was given
to all people who had been in contact with the dog and were
considered to be at risk. Even if someone has been bitten by an
animal with rabies, prompt post-exposure treatment is highly
effective in preventing rabies in humans.

In addition, results from tests on 4 dogs, which were humanely
destroyed on 25 Apr 2008 because they were considered to be high
risk, show that these dogs were not in the later stages of rabies and
were not, at the time they were destroyed, infective to other animals
at the quarantine.

Defra worked closely with the Health Protection Agency and the
Department of Health to ensure that any risks to human and animal
health were minimised. The Health Protection Agency is content that
restrictions are being lifted.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[Subscribers are reminded that this case involved an 8-week-old puppy
brought to the UK by the charity "Animal SOS Sri Lanka", founded to
"help improve the lives of stray dogs" on the South Asian island.
ProMED-mail questioned the advisability of allowing the transfer of
stray dogs, collected in countries with endemic "urban" rabies, into
rabies-free countries.

Investing the efforts and financial means of the dedicated charities
in well-maintained animal shelters within Sri Lanka, deserves
consideration. Such policy could contribute to improve (or save) the
lives of a larger number of animals without exposing their health and
welfare to (long-distance) transport-related stress and without
putting the health and indeed the very life of other animals and of
humans at serious risk. - Mod.AS]
