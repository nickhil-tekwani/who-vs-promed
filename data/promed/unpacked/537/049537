A total of 116 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bareilly have been reported from 20 states and the District of Columbia. The 16 new cases are from Florida (1), Georgia (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Massachusetts (4), Missouri (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (2), Rhode Island (1), and Wisconsin (3).

Among 100 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 28 Jan 2012 to 31 Mar 2012. Ill persons range in age from 4 to 78 years, with a median age of 31. 50 percent of patients are female. Among 71 persons with available information, 12 (17 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 14 Mar 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

The investigation has not conclusively identified a food source. The investigation is ongoing into individual food items and their sources. CDC and FDA are working together on the investigation and will provide updates as soon as they are available. If a specific food source is identified for this outbreak, public health officials will alert the public and take further steps to prevent additional illnesses.
