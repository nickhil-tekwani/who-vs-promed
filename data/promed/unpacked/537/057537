The Tembusu virus, a mosquito-borne virus that could be transmitted to humans [but see comment], has been reported in Taiwan for the 1st time, according to the Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI).

The virus was 1st detected at a duck farm in December last year [2019] during a government investigation into reduced egg production, said AHRI Director Chiu Chui-chang.

According to the official, the waterfowl at the farm had been laying eggs at an unsatisfactory rate, but they had not been found to have contracted any known disease. It took genome-sequence mapping to identify the virus in the birds, wrote CNA.

In 2010, the Tembusu virus was identified as the culprit behind an outbreak at a number of duck farms in eastern China that reported a drop in egg production. Symptoms include anorexia, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, and paralysis.

Chiu pointed out that the pathogen has also been detected in Malaysia and Thailand but that information about the virus is scarce because it's not listed as an infection the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) requires to be notified about.

Despite the fact that the virus is zoonotic [see comment], Chiu downplayed the health risk the virus poses to humans. Citing studies, he said the Tembusu virus has a low mortality rate among birds and that it is not likely to inflict major losses in the relevant industries.

[Tembusu virus (TMUV) belongs to the Flaviviridae family, _Flavivirus_ genus, and Ntaya virus group. The TMUV prototype strain MM1775 (TMUV-MM1775) was first isolated from _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1955. Since 2000, many TMUV strains have been isolated from birds and mosquitoes, including chicks, ducks, geese, pigeons, sparrows, and _Culex_ mosquitoes.

TMUV consists of several genetically closely related virus strains with noticeable pathogenicity for poultry, such as Sitiawan virus (STWV), duck TMUV (DTMUV), Perak virus, and Baiyangdian virus. STWV was isolated from sick broiler chicks in Sitiawan District of Perak State, Malaysia, in 2000. STWV-infected chicks showed encephalitis, growth retardation, and increased blood sugar levels. In 2010, DTMUV, also called duck egg-drop syndrome virus, was found to extensively infect ducks with high morbidity (up to 90%) and mortality (5-30%) rates in southeast China. DTMUV outbreaks also occurred in layer and broiler duck farms in Pekin ducks in Malaysia in 2012 and in Thailand in 2013.

Evidence for human susceptibility to TMUV is conflicting. In a 2013 published report, investigators did a study to examine TMUV infection in humans. They investigated TMUV as a possible infection in duck industry workers in Shandong, China. Of 132 serum samples tested, 95 (71.9%) had TMUV antibodies. In oral swabs detection, 63 (47.7%) samples were positive for TMUV RNA. Nucleotide sequences of 277 bp coding the partial NS3 protein showed more than 99.5% identity with other duck TMUV strains, which can cause severe egg drop in ducks. These findings contribute to the realization that TMUV may be overlooked as a zoonotic transmission in China (ref 1).

It seems unusual that nearly half of duck industry workers were TMUV RNA positive, suggesting that they had been exposed to the virus and were infected within a relatively short period of time, assuming that TMUV does not persistently infect humans. Additional studies of duck industry workers would be of interest. However, a 2016 publication reported that subsequent in vivo research showed that duck TMUV failed to cause viraemia or clinical symptoms in subcutaneously inoculated rhesus monkeys, but the duck TMUV-specific humoral immune responses could be induced by limited infection (ref 2).

On the other hand, avian TMUV replicates well in mammalian cells, and mice are susceptible to duck TMUV via intracerebral inoculation, exhibiting clinical lesions typical of many other encephalitic flaviviruses. Therefore, the possibility exists that this virus might emerge as a zoonotic pathogen, though the risk of human disease is not as high as that caused by other flaviviruses (ref 3).

Taiwan is an island off the southeastern coast of mainland China, which is the epicenter of DTMUV outbreaks. According to a recent paper (ref 4), Taiwanese researchers have conducted a survey on mosquitoes collected from wetlands, pig farms, and parks in northern and central Taiwan between April and September 2019. They identified novel TMUV strains in _Cx. annulus_ and _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes. A novel Tembusu virus strain TP1906 (TMUV-TP1906), isolated from a_Culex annulus_ mosquito pool collected from the north, was found to be most closely related to STWV, which, as indicated above, causes encephalitis and retarded growth in chickens. They considered this as the 1st time that the TMUV strain was isolated from the _Cx. annulus_ mosquitoes.
