Viet Nam: 2 more human avian influenza cases reported
-----------------------------------------------
A 36-year-old man from Viet Nam's northern Thai Binh province has just been
found to have contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, while a woman who
died on 21 Jan 2005 was confirmed to be infected with the virus, raising
the total number of bird flu infections in the country to 10.
Samples from the patient, who is receiving treatment at the Tropical
Disease Institute in Hanoi, tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the local
newspaper the Pioneer reported on Mon 24 Jan 2005, quoting Vietnamese
Deputy Minister of Health Tran Chi Liem. Earlier, samples from the
patient's brothers had also tested positive for the virus. The tests were
made by the National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute. The 3 brothers ate
duck, and a dish made from raw duck blood, at a local market on 29 Dec
2004, before exhibiting symptoms of avian influenza. The 47-year-old
brother died on 9 Jan 2005 at the Tropical Disease Institute in Hanoi. The
42-year-old brother, who spent some time looking after his elder brother,
was admitted to the institute on 13 Jan 2005. The 36-year-old brother
received medical checkups at the institute last week [3rd week of January
2005]. The 36-year-old patient, who lives in Hanoi, and his younger
brother, who lives in Thai Binh, are now under treatment at the institute.
They are in stable condition.
The 35-year-old woman from southern Dong Thap province was admitted to the
Hospital of Tropical Disease in Ho Chi Minh City on 20 Jan 2005 and died on
the following day. She did not slaughter or eat sick or dead chickens, but
she often had a bath in a canal which contained dead fowl, her relatives said.
Among the 10 cases of avian influenza virus infection, 8 have died. Among
the dead, 7 were from the southern region and one from the northern region.
The 1st case in the [current] outbreak of avian influenza in Viet Nam was
reported on 28 Dec 2004. Since January 2005, avian influenza has stricken
404 communes of 25 cities and provinces nationwide, killing and leading to
the forced culling of more than 557 600 fowl, according to the Department
of Animal Health.

Viet Nam: raw duck blood blamed for human avian influenza cases:
person-to-person transmission discounted
-----------------------------------------------
3 brothers in northern Viet Nam who contracted avian influenza all drank
raw duck blood at a family feast, newspapers said on Mon 24 Jan 2005,
calming initial fears that the killer virus had managed to jump from human
to human.
Deputy Health Minister Tran Chi Liem was quoted in the Nguoi Lao Dong
(Laborer) paper as saying the trio had dined on duck before one of them
died of avian influenza A (H5N1), a fact backed up by the World Health
Organization (WHO). "We can confirm that this is the clinical factor of
infection," Liem said. "Recently, through quick tests of the family
members, we found another member also infected with the H5N1 virus. Now
samples from him are being re-tested." The triple outbreak in one family
had sparked fears in the southeast Asian nation that a version of the
virulent avian influenza virus had managed to jump from person to person, a
possible precursor to a killer human flu pandemic.
One of the brothers died of bird flu on 9 Jan 2005, but then his
42-year-old younger sibling, who had been looking after him, went down with
the virus. He is now recovering, but, in another twist, the 3rd brother,
aged 36, then contracted the disease. Only now has it emerged that the trio
shared a meal of duck meat and blood, a Vietnamese delicacy. In the
interview with Nguoi Lao Dong, Liem ruled out the possibility that the
virus had jumped from person to person. "In Viet Nam, there has not been
any case in which the H5N1 virus infection spreads from human to human," he
said.
The H5N1 poultry virus is known to have killed 27 people in Viet Nam and 12
in Thailand over the past year [2004]. The Tuoi Tre newspaper said latest
tests showed a 35-year-old woman had died from bird flu on 21 Jan 2005 in
Ho Chi Minh City. It said the woman, from the Mekong river province of Dong
Thap, swam in waters used to dispose of poultry. If confirmed, her death
would bring to 28 Viet Nam's toll from bird flu, which erupted again last
month [December 2004] and has now spread to 23 provinces and cities out of
Viet Nam's total of 64.
The WHO also said preliminary findings pointed to the family meal in which
raw duck blood and organs were served. The Health Ministry has said people
could not get infected from eating well-cooked meat, but physical contact
with sick chicken or ducks was a known way of poultry-to-human
transmission. The WHO's main fear is that a virus could mutate [undergo
genetic reassortment] if it infects a person sick with ordinary [human]
influenza, or gets into an animal hosting a human influenza virus, such as
a pig. If H5N1 merged with a human flu virus, it could produce a strain
capable of sweeping through a human population without immunity, killing
millions of people worldwide. The WHO has warned more human cases would
emerge in Viet Nam as people travel and feast ahead of the Tet lunar new
year festival early next month [February 2005]. In larger cities such as
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, people have started to stay away from chicken,
but it is still on the menu in rural areas, where 2/3rds of Viet Nam's 82
million people live.

[Several correspondents have suggested that the timings of the apparent
infection of 2 of the 3 brothers favored person-to-person transmission of
infection rather than contraction of infection from a common food source.
The new data presented above, together with the involvement of a 3rd
brother, undermine such calculations. - Mod.CP]
