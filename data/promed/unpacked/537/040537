U.S. Decides to Retain Smallpox Virus Stocks
--------------------------------------------
The Bush administration, reversing a course set 2 decades ago, has decided
that the world's remaining stocks of smallpox [virus should be retained
until scientists develop new vaccines and treatments for the disease, a
process that could take years if not decades. The decision, disclosed by
senior administration officials, is likely to provoke criticism from
international health officials, who have long favored the destruction of
the microbe.
A succession of administrations have endorsed the goal of destroying the
virus, which was eradicated as a disease in the 1970's. But some American
scientists and Pentagon officials have argued for retaining smallpox
[virus stocks, and in 1999 President Clinton declared that they should be
maintained, at least temporarily, while more research was conducted. The
Clinton administration privately assured other nations that it would
support a move to kill off smallpox [virus in 2002 when the issue was
considered by the World Health Organization, which has long advocated
destruction of the virus.
The Bush administration's new policy, which is now being described to
America's allies, sets no such deadline and establishes some stringent
conditions, reflecting a new assessment of the dangers posed by
bioterrorism. The United States stopped routine vaccinations for smallpox
in 1972. How long vaccines continue to protect against the disease is not
known, but the immunity is believed to fade over time. Americans under 30
are completely vulnerable to the disease.
Administration officials said the remaining American smallpox [virus
samples, which are stored [in a laboratory at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, should not be destroyed until the nation
develops at least 2 licensed antiviral drugs, a vaccine that can be taken
by the entire population, and other defensive measures. Russia also has
smallpox strains stored at a research laboratory in Siberia.
The eradication of smallpox as a disease is considered one of medicine's
greatest triumphs, and experts said the Bush administration's decision is
likely to anger many doctors and scientists, particularly those in
developing nations ravaged by the disease only a quarter of a century ago.
But administration officials said that after the terrorist attacks of 11
Sep 2001 and the spate of anthrax letters that have killed 4, infected 13
others, and put 30 000 Americans on antibiotics, the administration had no
choice but to abandon the nation's long-standing commitment to eradicating
the officially declared stocks as soon as possible.
Officials said that an interagency group that has been considering bio-
defense measures had unanimously endorsed the policy shift without
reservation. The group is made up of representatives of the Defense
Department, State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and
other cabinet departments. But the officials said they expected the
decision might be criticized by individuals and groups long associated with
the international campaign to destroy the virus to ensure that it does not
re emerge and to celebrate the world's triumph over the contagious disease,
which killed one-third of those it infected.
Jonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert at the Washington office of the
Monterey Institute of International Studies and the author of "Scourge: The
Once and Future Threat of Smallpox," said the policy would create a certain
amount of ill will internationally and arouse suspicions about American and
Russian intentions. In particular, he said, India and Brazil, which had
lobbied hard for the virus's destruction, would resent the continued
American and Russian monopoly on the stocks. The Clinton administration had
assured their officials in 1999, he said, that the United States would
support destruction after research on the virus was completed in 2002. It
was that compromise that permitted the agreement 2 years ago, Mr. Tucker
said. The new policy, however, is likely to be received with relief by many
countries, notably Russia. Russia has vigorously argued that there are
clandestine stocks of smallpox virus throughout the world and that
retaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to fight a
possible outbreak, whether because of terrorism or other factors.
Reached late tonight by phone in Moscow, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director
of Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, the
Siberian based research laboratory where smallpox [virus strains are
stored, called the American shift wise not only for Russia and the United
States, but also for the entire world. In the Soviet era, Dr.
Sandakhchiev's lab specialized in turning viruses like smallpox [virus
into weapons of war. American officials said that he had privately warned
that North Korea, among other countries, was secretly keeping smallpox
[virus stocks. It was intelligence from Soviet defectors and other sources
about Moscow's vast germ warfare program that prompted the Clinton
administration to question the immediate destruction of the virus. Western
and foreign officials said at the time that fear of a possible epidemic in
a now largely unvaccinated world helped shift Mr. Clinton's personal views
against immediate destruction. But the previous administration remained
committed in principle to destroying the virus, a commitment that the Bush
administration has now refused to make. Those familiar with the conditions
set by the Bush administration say destruction of the virus will not even
be considered until a new vaccine is produced that can be given to all
Americans. The vaccine available today cannot safely be administered to
people with HIV or to others with immune deficiencies.
The conditions also include the development of reliable medical diagnostic
tests and environmental detectors, which do not yet exist. And they include
the ability to defeat genetically altered strains of smallpox. It would
take at least a decade to meet the administration's criteria, and that is a
conservative estimate, Mr. Tucker said. He called the position of the
administration too open-ended and warned that it would have its work cut
out in trying to persuade other nations to accept that the virus would not
be destroyed by the time President Bush leaves office. A committee of
scientific experts is scheduled to consider the issue of destroying the
virus early next month. The new American position is expected to be
unveiled formally at that session, if not before, officials said.
Administration officials said that they had already discussed the new
stance with Britain, America's closest ally in the war against
international terrorism, and that other allies were now being notified.
Over the weekend, officials said, Tommy G. Thompson, the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, discussed the policy by phone with the head of
the World Health Organization. Its officials, in Geneva, could not be
reached late tonight for comment.
