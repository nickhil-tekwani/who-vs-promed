TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS - SWITZERLAND

The number of notifications of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Switzerland
was the highest ever recorded in 2004, with 134 cases, and a further
significant increase in 2005 is already apparent. By mid-August 2005, 141
cases had been notified (provisional data). This is an increase of 55 per cent
compared with the same time period in 2004, when 91 cases had been notified. A
total of about 200 cases (180-230) is projected to be notified by the end of
2005. This is about double the average number of cases notified annually
between 1999 and 2004. The increase has been observed in all affected regions
of Switzerland.
Analysis of the data from the last year has shown that 96 per cent of patients
live in a district (canton) with TBE-endemic areas, and 85 per cent were
probably infected where they live. 8 per cent were probably infected in
another region which has endemic TBE areas, and 6 per cent were probably
infected in another country. Only 1 per cent of tick bites were reported by
patients to have occurred in regions without known risk areas.
Other risk factors for exposure in 2004 were as follows. Half of the patients
in 2004 reported leisure walking in the countryside, 11 per cent were hikers,
and 4 per cent were mushroom pickers. 20 per cent had occupational exposure to
ticks, for example, as forestry workers and farmers. 10 per cent of cases were
in joggers and orienteers, 4 per cent were in [Boy] scouts and campers, and
another 13 per cent were probably exposed through other activities, such as
sports activities or living near a forest.
This increase in TBE cases is evidence that the general public in affected
regions is still insufficiently aware of TBE, and that the use of the safe and
reliable vaccine needs to be increased. A working group of experts is
currently looking at ways to do this. There is growing opinion that all people
over 5 years old in endemic areas should be vaccinated, with the exception of
people who are never likely to be exposed. Since children under the age of 6
rarely suffer serious complications from TBE (an average of 2 children per
year are admitted to hospital with TBE), vaccination is not recommended for
young children.
Other preventive measures should not be overlooked: these include wearing
clothes that cover most of the body and fit closely around ankles, wrists,
etc.; staying away from undergrowth in forest areas; use of insect repellent;
checking the body and clothes for ticks after possible exposure; prompt
removal of any ticks; and noting the time of any bites. It is particularly
important to note that while TBE only occurs in certain regions, _Borrelia
burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme borreliosis, can be carried by ticks
throughout Switzerland.

[Tick-borne encephalitis virus now appears to be endemic in ticks in much of
Eastern, Central, and some parts of Western Europe. Tick-borne encephalitis
now ranks as an emerging disease in Europe, to the extent that vaccination is
being recommended for at-risk groups in some parts of the continent. - Mod.CP]
