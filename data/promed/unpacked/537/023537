Re Avian influenza (222): China, Egypt, S. Korea, Viet Nam
----------------------------------------------------------
In this posting on avian flu vaccination in China, there apparently
has been a mistake which requires correction [in the commentary to
item (1) - China]:
3. Recombined fowl pox vector gene engineered vaccine (subtype H5).
(FAO table: Strain: A recombinant virus from A/Goose/Guangdong/1996
and human influenza vaccine virus H5N1. Type: Inactivated recombinant).
Comment: This is incorrect. It is a live recombinant avian pox virus
vectored H5. A similar vaccine has been on the market for some time
developed by Merial and sold under the label 'Trovac'.
4. Recombined live vaccine against Avian Influenza and Newcastle
Disease. (FAO table: Strain: A recombinant avian pox virus expressed
H5 from A/Goose/Guangdong/1996. Type: Live recombinant avian pox
virus vectored H5).
Comment: This is incorrect. It is a live vectored vaccine based on
the insertion of the avian influenza H5 gene into the lentogenic
Newcastle disease live vaccine strain La Sota (see Ge et al., J.
Virol. 81, 150-158, 2007) which is widely used for vaccination
against ND. A similar vaccine is under development in our laboratory
(Veits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103, 8197-8202, 2006)
whereas others (Park et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103,
8203-8208) developed an H7 vaccine using the same vector approach.

[Prof Mettenleiter's correction is appreciated; the data on vaccines
3 and 4, derived from the summarised introduction to the Chinese
document cited (see below), did not match the vaccines 3 and 4
derived from the FAO table. The confusion is regretted.
For clarity, we present the complete, unabridged description of the 4
vaccines, as appearing in the Chinese document "POULTRY AVIAN
INFLUENZA VACCINATION IN CHINA", October 2006, by the Veterinary
Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, P.R. China;
<http://www.agri.gov.cn/ztzl/gdztzl/P020061023368529330005.pdf>.
"There are 4 vaccines applied in China against HPAI, namely the
inactivated vaccine (subtype H5, N28 strain), the recombined
inactivated vaccine (subtype H5N1, Re-1 strain), recombined fowl pox
vector gene engineered vaccine (subtype H5) and recombined live
vaccine against Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease. All these 4
vaccines are developed by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory.
H5/Turkey/England/N28/73(H5N2) (N28 strain in abbreviation), harvest
infected chicken embryo fluid, inactivate in formaldehyde, emulsified
with oil adjuvant to produce the vaccine against AI. It is used to
prevent AI subtype H5. Poultry will be immunized 14 days after
vaccination. This vaccine should be kept in 2-8 deg C with validity
of 12 months.
H5N1 Rel strain, harvest infected chicken embryo fluid, inactivated
in formaldehyde, emulsified with oil adjuvant to produce the
recombined inactivated vaccine (subtype H5N1, Re-1 strain). This
vaccine is used to prevent AI of chicken, ducks and geese caused by
subtype H5. Poultry will be immunized 14 days after vaccination. For
ducks and geese, booster vaccination should be applied 3 weeks after
the first vaccination. This vaccine should be kept in 2-8 deg C with
validity of 12 months. The seed virus of Re-1 strain is a recombined
low pathogenic virus strain using reverse gene manipulation
technique. It has better efficacy compared to subtype H5N2. Within
the effective immunity period, vaccinated chicken, ducks, geese and
other poultry can be protected from wild strains of H5N1.
Recombined fowl pox viruses (strain rFPV-HA-NA, expressing HA and NA
genes of AI virus) were inoculated chicken embryo fibroblast, harvest
virus cultures, add appropriate stabilizer into virus cultures to
produce the recombined fowl pox vector gene engineered vaccine
(subtype H5) after a freeze and dry process. This vaccine is used to
prevent AI caused by subtype H5 virus. Poultry will be immunized 7
days after vaccination with 9 months of immunity period. The vaccine
needs to be kept under -15 deg C with validity of 2 years. It is easy
to use DIVA to distinguish vaccination or wild virus infection by this vaccine.
Recombined Newcastle viruses (rL-H5 strain expressing HA gene of
subtype H5 AI) were inoculated SPF chicken embryos, harvest allantoic
fluid of infected chicken embryos, add appropriate stabilizer to
produce the recombined live vaccine against Avian Influenza and
Newcastle Disease after a freeze and dry process. This vaccine is
used to prevent subtype H5 AI and Newcastle disease of chicken. It
should be kept under -20 deg C with a valid period of 18 months".
