The following background is abstracted from Gideon <www.GideonOnline.com> and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2]

Most cases of Chikungunya in the Philippines are reported in the center and south of the country.
- Epidemics were reported in 1954, 1956, 1968 and 1985 to 1986.
- In 1986, an outbreak (3 cases) of Chikungunya was reported among U.S. Peace Corps volunteers stationed in the Philippines (Mindanao, Cebu and Mashbate).
- In 2009, several Filipino tourists acquired Chikungunya in Thailand.
- Cynomolgus monkeys (_Macaca fascicularis_) are implicated as reservoirs in this country.

Seropositivity toward a related agent, Getah virus, has been reported among humans on Palawan, without signs of overt infection.
- Getah virus has also been identified in Nueva Ecija Province.

[There have been many more outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in the Philippines than have been reported in ProMED-mail. ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for filling in gaps of occurrence of these outbreaks. It would be of interest to know how important cynomolgus monkeys (_Macaca fascicularis_) are in maintenance of chikungunya virus in nature in the Philippines. - Mod.TY
