Portugal: Adenovirus Type 3 Responsible for Deaths of 8 Children
---------------------------------------------------
The type of adenovirus responsible for the death of 8 children in the
Guimaraes e S. Joao do Porto hospital since the beginning of 2003 was
finally identified. Of the 49 serotypes of this virus that are known, one
of the most aggressive is serotype 3. Having been identified in earlier
years, it has not undergone mutations [This statement suggests that
adenovirus type 3 infection is a recurrent problem in this hospital. -
Mod.CP].
Identification was made through collaborative work between epidemiologists
and virologists of the Ricardo Jorge National Institute of Health, which
concluded that adenovirus type 3 was the agent that caused all of the fatal
acute respiratory infections in the Northern region in the past few months.
The most recent fatal case was confirmed at the end of last week. Last
Thursday, there was another child admitted to the S. Joao Hospital in
serious condition. All precautions have been taken to avoid the risk of
intra-hospital spread of this disease.
Serotype 3 is frequently the cause of acute respiratory disease
(characterized by fever, pharyngitis, cough, and in some cases pneumonia,
which is seen principally in children less than 2 years of age), similar to
[the symptoms of] serotypes 4 & 7, which were developed into a vaccine that
has been used to prevent acute respiratory illness in military recruits in
the USA [not for pediatric use and no longer available. - Mod.CP]. There is
no vaccine available for serotype 3.

[Adenovirus infections are rarely fatal even in young children. Further
information would be appreciated regarding the circumstances surrounding
these deaths and the size of the population at risk. - Mod.CP]
[One child died of, & its sibling survived, an adenovirus infection (serotype
not given) in Singapore in April 2003 -- see SARS post below; 2 military
recruits died of adenovirus infection (serotypes 3, 4 & 7 implicated) in the
USA in 2000 (reported in 2001); and 6 children died of suspected adenovirus
infection in the USA in 1999 -- see refs. below. - Mod.JW]
