Rat Fever on the rise
----------------------
Epidemiology Unit officials, Wed 22 Oct 2003, urged the public to
refrain from working on moist surfaces and wading in muddy water
to avoid contracting a rapidly spreading disease -- leptospirosis,
also known as Rat Fever.
The disease occurs in cycles and becomes widespread
immediately after heavy rains. There were less than 200 [cases]
per year prior to 1991, but the annual number has gradually
assumed near-epidemic proportions in the ensuing years, rising to
around 1200 suspected cases in 1994, and peaking at nearly 1500
cases since then. This year up to October [2003] around 2200
suspected cases have been detected, according to assistant
epidemiologists Doctors Ananda Amarasinghe and Nihal
Abeysinghe.
"The disease has not reached epidemic proportions, but it could if it
is allowed to spread", they warned. The disease had formerly been
widespread in areas such as Moneragala, Ampara, Matara, and in
the North Western province and Galle. However, at present it has
spread to areas on the outskirts of Colombo including Kaduwela,
Homagama, and Mirigama. Dr. Amarasinghe and Dr. Abeysinghe
said that they were closely monitoring the progress of the disease
to prevent it from infecting city dwellers.
People living in unsanitary environments such as slums are most at
risk, they pointed out. Leptospirosis is usually transmitted from
infected animals who in turn contaminate water with their urine.
Human beings who come in physical contact with such water can
get leptospirosis, Dr. Sarath Gamini de Silva, Consultant Physician,
National Hospital, told media personnel at a seminar at the Health
Education Bureau. He said that the highest-risk groups were paddy
farmers and sugar cane plantation workers.
"Ideally such persons should wear boots and gloves to protect
themselves. Anyone with open wounds or cuts should refrain from
working in muddy soil until their wounds have healed", he
emphasised. "While rodents were the chief carriers, the rat is not
the only carrier. Cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, cats, foxes, and deer are
also carriers of the disease", he emphasized.
Chlorination of identified contaminated water, rodent control by
destroying rat holes, and keeping paddy fields free of weeds and
bushes are some of the steps being taken by the Health Ministry to
control the spread of the disease.

[The onset of flooding is a classical epidemiological feature for
outbreaks of leptospirosis, as seen in this case and in many of the
postings below. Sporadic cases are not uncommon but are often
diagnosed incorrectly. The multiple organ systems that can be
affected by this infection can cause sporadic cases to be
misdiagnosed as hepatitis, dengue, or viral meningitis, among
others. - Mod.LL]
