The government unveiled measures taken so far to contain diseases that affect cashew nuts in Coastal [Pwani] Region. After learning about the disease in the area [ProMED-mail post 20131210.2104254], the ministry directed experts to analyse and identify the source, preventive measures, and treatment.

It was discovered that the disease was caused by fungus of fusarium wilt type. Naliendele Research Institute is going on with tests for the disease cure. About 1000 acres [405 acres] of cashew nuts have been affected by the disease, leaving the citizens with nothing. The government procedure is to distribute seedlings to the affected areas.

[Different strains of the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ cause wilting diseases with serious losses in many crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits and vegetables. Each pathovar is highly specialised attacking only a single crop species. In some cases, other _Fusarium_ species may also be present and contribute to the disease (for example guava wilt, ProMED-mail post 20120719.1206910). Depending on the host, symptoms may include leaf yellowing, shoot necrosis, browning of vascular tissues and root rots. Plants may be stunted and may die. Disease incidence can range from a few plants up to large areas within a planting. _F. solani_ has been reported to cause seedling wilt on cashew (_Anacardium occidentale_).

The fungi occur in soils worldwide and are commonly found on roots of healthy plants. Most strains cause no damage to their hosts, but severe strains can block the water conducting xylem and lead to wilting and dieback. Disease severity may depend on fungal populations in the soil, inoculum levels and temperatures. Once introduced to an area, the fungi may survive indefinitely on the roots of asymptomatic reservoir hosts. Thus, resistant crop varieties and rotation crops can contribute to an increase in soil inoculum.

Spread occurs mainly on contaminated plant material, with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water and human activities (for example on farm machinery and tools). Disease management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures to avoid spread to new areas. For some fusarium pathogens, flooding of fields has been reported to reduce fungal survival in the soil.

An undiagnosed disease of cashew was reported in Tanzania, Pwani region, in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131210.2104254). At the time, international experts were asked to provide support in identifying a cause, which has apparently lead to the diagnosis reported above.
