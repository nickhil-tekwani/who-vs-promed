The changing seasons' weather brings a high risk of disease outbreaks to the winter-spring rice crop in the northern provinces, said [the] Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. [He] requested agriculture sectors to enhance measures to prevent the outbreaks and their impacts on the rice crop. Cold weather with high humidity and prolonged drizzle was favourable for harmful insects that could spread diseases on rice.

According to the Plant Protection Department, the rice fields in the north-central region (provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien-Hue) were at high risk of rice blast disease, one of the most dangerous diseases to rice crops. At present, 3600ha of rice in the region was infected with some light diseases.

In the Red River delta and northern mountainous regions, the rice blast disease will break out and badly damage the rice crop from mid-April till mid-May [2020]. About 5-20% of the crop will be attacked by the disease, the department said.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50%. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die, and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Use of certified clean seed is essential, farm-saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

The fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence, including host resistance breaking strains. Environmental factors may also affect plant resistance. Both resistance and defense-regulator genes have been found to be involved in host resistance against blast (see links below) and could potentially be combined ("pyramided") to develop rice varieties with broad-spectrum host resistance against blast that cannot be as easily overcome by the fungus as varietal resistance based on single genes.
