Anthrax, Azerbaijan
-------------------
Report type: immediate notification

Confirmed: 20 Jul 2022
Reported: 22 Jul 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 2 Apr 2022
Causal agent: _Bacillus anthracis_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Hajally village, Barda, Aran [region]
Started: 17 Jul 2022
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 155 / 8 / 8 / 0 / 0 / 140
Affected population: Vaccination was performed on 20 May 2022. All affected calves were not vaccinated due to less than 3 months age during the last vaccination campaign.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc)
Epidemiological comments: The farmer keeps the cows in a closed shed. He grows fodder on his own farmland, and sometimes buys fodder from outside. He takes the animals for a walk in his living area from time to time. During the vaccination campaign conducted in May [2022], 14 cattle were not vaccinated because they were pregnant or the calves were too young.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, disinfection, movement control, quarantine

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Azerbaijan Food Safety Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (real-time multiplex PCR) / 20 Jul 2022 / positive
Cattle / bacterial culture / 21 Jul 2022 / positive

[At first this is straightforward: unvaccinated stock came down with the disease because of not having been vaccinated during the vaccination campaign the previous May (2022). But how did they get exposed if housed? Their grazing was limited. They were fed farm-grown fresh fodder and occasionally with purchased fodder. Fodder can be contaminated when it comes from a farm that had recently suffered anthrax when the crop is from the field where the cases occurred -- not an everyday event but it happens.

We recently saw this in some outbreaks in Saskatchewan, and by the nature of events the source farm and recipient farm can be at a distance from each other. Calves are rarely afflicted with anthrax, as they prefer to suckle, not graze, but in this case they might have fed on the hypothetical 'contaminated' fodder.

All this is on the presumption that there was not an unreported outbreak in a neighbor's herd and the infection was spread to the reported herd via haemophagic tabanid female flies. These flies cannot see calves, as they are too small, but calves are curious and would lick any extravasated contaminated blood from a dead cow.

By the way, there is no reason to not vaccinate pregnant cattle, as long as it is not a rodeo. Handled quietly, they should handle it well and not abort.

With heartfelt thanks to my colleague Mod.CRD. - Mod.MHJ
