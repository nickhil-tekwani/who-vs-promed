Budgerigar fanciers in crisis after mystery virus sweeps UK
-----------------------------------------------------------
Budgerigar fanciers all over Britain are facing a crisis after a mysterious
virus left hundreds of birds dead. Yesterday the Budgerigar Society advised
its members to stop trading birds and cancel shows. The decision was made
after one breeder in Middlesbrough lost his entire collection of more than
200 budgerigars, a stock he had built up over several years.
One senior figure within budgerigar circles said the mounting fear among
fanciers was similar to that felt by farmers afraid their animals would be
struck down during the foot and mouth disease epidemic. There have been
unconfirmed reports of outbreaks in Teeside, Humberside, East Anglia, West
Midlands, and the West Country. "This is a problem that has never occurred
before in our history," said David Whittaker, general secretary of the
Budgerigar Society. "We have had to ask members to stop showing birds and
to stop people moving their birds around until we can identify this virus."
There was no known cure for the condition and experts did not know how it
was transmitted, he said, adding: "It could be an existing virus which has
mutated. Work is carrying on at the moment and as soon as we know we will
post it on our website." Mr Whittaker asked people to check the website,
[see 2 further]. He appealed for fanciers to
share information and not to try to hide if they believed their birds might
be affected. "Only by working together, and fanciers admitting they have a
problem, will the society be able to address the situation properly. Anyone
making contact can be reassured that their situation will be treated with
the strictest confidence."
Roy Cooke, secretary of the Northern Budgerigar Society, said the disease
was similar to influenza. He added: "It is scary because it is a bit like
foot and mouth disease, you don't know when it is going to strike. It is
something that has come out of the blue and it can mean a lifetime's work
is thrown away."

The new budgerigar disease
--------------------------
Dr Baker has advised that since the membership has become more aware of the
situation they are speaking to him more freely and sharing information. He
is also receiving more specimens, which will greatly assist in identifying
the disease and members should continue to contact the Office and or Dr
Baker direct to continue this trend.
He has indicated the disease is very probably caused by a paramyxovirus
infection (PMV), however, he still awaits confirmation of this. There are
at least 9 types of paramyxovirus and in many of these there are a large
number of subtypes, all of which can infect birds. The classical type
affecting budgerigars is type 5 (also known as Kinitachi virus) which
caused high mortality in aviaries in Japan in the mid 1970s; there was also
a small outbreak of this in the UK in 1993. Budgerigars are also
susceptible to PMV type 1 which is the cause of Newcastle disease, there is
a subtype of type 1 which affects pigeons; homing pigeons have to be
vaccinated against this if they take part in competitions. Two fanciers
have independently commented on the large number of domestic pigeons around
at the time of the outbreak but this may just be coincidence, PMV2 and PMV3
have also been seen in psittacine birds including budgerigars.
Dr Baker further advises that it is important to identify the type of PMV
involved and this will be done. If it is type 1 of either the Newcastle
disease type or the pigeon type vaccination should be available with
commercially available vaccines, although these are not licensed for
budgerigars this should not be a major problem. Indeed one fancier who
almost certainly has the disease has very recently vaccinated his birds
with the pigeon vaccine, it will be interesting to see how he gets on.
There is no treatment for the other types apart from supportive therapy.
There is no information on carriers with regard to PMV5 or the other
strains in psittacines. In domestic poultry carriers do occur but not
usually beyond 2 months after infection although prolonged carriage for
over a year has been reported. The strain of PMV1 affecting pigeons does
produce carriers but not for more than one month after infection.
Dr Baker has also confirmed that the disease is transmitted "bird to bird"
and it can be carried on shoes and clothing. Extreme care should be taken
in this respect at all times. Further information will be communicated as
soon as we receive it from Dr Baker and I once again thank you for your
support over this stressful period.

[Budgerigars, small parrots (family Psittacidae, subfamily Psittacinae) are
natives of the drier parts of Australia, found in the wild in great numbers
and now adopted worldwide as a very popular pet bird. Most probably, the
British veterinary authorities are currently seriously engaged in
investigating this outbreak. They should exclude at least two List A
diseases, namely Newcastle disease and avian influenza, and rule out any
possible public health risks. The identification of the involved disease
agent is anticipated with interest and concern. - Mod.AS].
