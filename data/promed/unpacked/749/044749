Chile: Sunblotch detected in Peruvian avocados
----------------------------------------------
There has been a new incident that has fuelled the controversy revolving around the entrance of Peruvian avocados to Chile [see ProMED-mail post 20130421.1660967]. The University of Chile detected the sunblotch viroid in some Peruvian avocado that had been imported to the country.

[Of] 24 fruits from 2 lots of avocado from a supermarket in the Chilean capital, 3 were contaminated by the viroid.

Gonzalo Bulnes, Chilean Hass Avocado Committee, expressed his concern about [the work of] Chilean authorities to protect national avocado crops. He said that "reservoirs and irrigation works have forced the avocado industry to uproot more than 20 percent of the Hass [variety] avocado area in the country. The SAG [national agricultural and livestock service] allowed the entry of Peruvian avocados without the corresponding restrictions, and that will end up destroying the Chilean avocado industry."

The Hass Avocado Committee [had] made an appeal [against] the decision by the SAG to allow Peruvian imports of avocado, and this recent analysis of the University of Chile will be added to the legal process.

[_Avocado sunblotch viroid_ (ASBVd; type member of genus _Avsunviroid_) affects avocado and a few other members of the family _Lauraceae_. It causes one of the major diseases of the crop, with serious reductions of yield (up to 95 percent losses), fruit quality, and tree vigour. Symptoms may include yellowish, depressed streaks on young growth twigs and on fruits, which can look like they are sunburnt ('sunblotch'), as well as, occasionally, vein yellowing on leaves and bark cracking. However, symptoms may not be visible in some trees, but these still show significant yield reduction and act as pathogen reservoirs.

ASBVd is transmitted with infected budwood or rootstocks for grafting, by cutting tools, pollen (via pollinating bees) and with seed. Asymptomatic trees have an extremely high rate of seed transmission of up to 100 percent, and the resultant infected seedlings are also asymptomatic. Disease management relies on the use of certified viroid free grafting material and seeds. Reliable diagnosis requires molecular techniques. Orchards should be tested every 3 years and pathogen reservoirs, with or without symptoms, must be removed.

This is an ongoing argument between the two countries (see ProMED-mail post 20130421.1660967). AVSBVd has been reported from most avocado-growing areas, including central and northern America, and Peru claims that it is also present in Chile.

However, it is not really relevant whether ASBVd is present in both countries or not. Even for areas were the viroid is already present, introduction of new strains or spread to new areas within a country must be avoided. Since germinating seed of purchased avocado fruit is easy, for example for the home garden, and considering the extremely high rate of seed transmission of ASBVd, introduction of the viroid from an infected area by traded fruit would be almost a certainty over a period of time. To protect national avocado industries, regular molecular testing and certification of source orchards would be a minimum requirement to lower the risk of commercial trade of avocado fruit between countries.

The Hass avocado variety is available all year round and accounts for about 80 percent of avocados eaten worldwide. It arose from a spontaneous mutation in a US garden in the 1920s and carried a patent until 1952.
