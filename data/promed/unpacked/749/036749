2003/071 First outbreak of Citrus tristeza virus near Siracusa, Sicilia (IT)
During surveys for the selection of superior old citrus lines done near
Siracusa (Sicilia, Italy), trees in several blocks of mandarin (_Citrus
reticulata_ cvs. Fortune, Nova), Satsuma (_C.unshiu_), and grapefruit (_C.
paradisi_ cv. Marsh) showed stunting, decline, dieback, reduction of fruit
size, and often pinholing near the bud-union line.
As these symptoms are often associated with Citrus tristeza closterovirus
(CTV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest), further tests were done. Young shoots were
collected from 600 Fortune, 300 Nova, 400 Satsuma and 20 Marsh grapefruit,
and tested by DAS-ELISA and immunoprinting ELISA using CTV polyclonal
antibodies. All samples tested positive.
Total RNA was extracted from 50 of these plants (25 Fortune, 15 Nova, 5
Satsuma, 5 grapefruit) and tested by RT-PCR. The presence of CTV was confirmed.
Studies were done to trace the history of plants growing in the affected
blocks. All trees had been propagated from infected budwood most probably
illegally imported from Spain 10 years ago. It is estimated that in the
area of Siracusa approximately 10 000 trees are now infected, with some
evidence suggesting that natural spread is occurring.
Additional surveys are being done better to estimate the incidence of the
disease, to verify its dissemination by aphid vectors and to characterize
virus strains present in the area.
Sporadic detections of CTV-infected trees have been noted previously in
Italy, but this is the first report of a significant outbreak in a
citrus-growing area, and thus is a major threat to the Italian citrus
industry. Citrus is grown in Sicilia on 100 000 ha, mostly on susceptible
sour orange rootstocks.
The situation of CTV in Italy can be described as follows: Present, found
in the area of Siracusa, Sicilia. In other parts of Italy, it has been
found erratically and is not established. Under official control.

[CTV is aphid-transmitted and the disease (quick decline in USA; Hassaku
dwarf in Japan) is considered the most damaging of all citrus diseases.
Sour orange rootstocks are susceptible to CTV and are a major factor in
perpetuating the disease. Use of certified budstocks and resistant
rootstocks are the primary disease management strategies for this disease.
Inoculation of budstock with mild CTV strains can also be a protective
measure in disease control.
