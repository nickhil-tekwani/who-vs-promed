Cholera in Africa: Upsurge of cases in the Great Lakes region.
Since January 1998, 13,440 cholera cases and 778 deaths have been reported
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The provinces of Katanga,
Nord-Kivu, Sud-Kivu and Orientale are currently the most affected by
cholera outbreaks. The provinces of Kinsasha and Equateur have reported
only a few cases. Although the outbreak is in regression in the province of
Katanga, the situation in Sud- Kivu, Nord-Kivu and Orientale provinces is
still of serious concern. Many activities to prevent further spread and to
treat affected populations are being undertaken by the MOH in collaboration
with WHO, UNICEF, MSF and other NGO's.
>From 1 April to 18 May, 77 cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been
reported in Bujumbura Province, Burundi. The districts of Buyenzi, Bwiza,
Cibitoke and Musaga are the most affected. Health education and activities
to improve sanitation are being carried out by the MOH.
Cases of cholera started to be reported in Rwanda in March in Cyangugu
prefecture, which is on the border with the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. Although the number of cases is not very high at present, there is
major concern about further spread to other areas of the country.
In Uganda, the dramatic cholera outbreak, which started in late 1997, is
still affecting the country with over 20,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths
reported since the beginning of the year.
The current cholera outbreak affecting the Great Lakes region confirms
earlier forecasts of a potential spread from [the eastern African
countries affected by major outbreaks last year to countries in the central
and southern part of Africa.
