This is a brief update about a highly localised and contained anthrax
incident in northern Victoria near Stanhope.
Anthrax has been confirmed on 3 dairy farms and one beef farm in a
very localised area. The disease appeared on the index farm on Fri 19
Jan 2007 and the Victorian Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
responded promptly by tracing movements of livestock and products
from the property, by destroying the affected carcasses and
implementing vaccination on the affected farm and neighbouring properties.
Subsequently, on Fri 2 Feb 2007, anthrax was confirmed on 3 other
properties in very close vicinity, but not neighbouring the index
property. DPI responded by quickly establishing a Local Disease
Control Centre, which is operating out of the DPI office in Tatura.
On each of the 4 farms on which the disease has been confirmed,
routine control measures have been implemented including quarantine,
incineration of carcasses, and vaccination of cattle. These measures
are usually quickly effective in controlling the disease. Livestock
and product movements from all the affected farms have been traced to
enable containment of all potential contamination.
Because infection has occurred on a small number of farms in a highly
localised area DPI has decided to implement a strategic vaccination
program. This proactive vaccination program is nearing completion
according to an agreed strategy that takes in a 2-neighbour-deep ring
and at least 1 km around each/all case farms. This forms a
vaccination zone that takes in approximately 60 properties, most of
which have already been vaccinated. Vaccination is being carried out
rapidly by local private practitioners on contract to DPI and who
have been working long hours over the last 4 days.
No new cases have been detected on any farm since Sat 3 February
2007. The situation continues to be well contained.
Anthrax has never been previously reported on any of the 4 farms
identified in this incident, although the farms are in an area where
anthrax has historically occurred.
DPI routinely manages anthrax incidents, which are usually sporadic,
in accordance with well-established guidelines detailed in the
Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN),
<http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/programs/eadp/ausvetplan_home.cfm>,
and consistent with international standards of the OIE and the World
Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Surveillance and Control
of Anthrax in Humans and Animals. Procedures include vaccination of
livestock on the property, and any introductions, for a period of 3
years, disposal of carcasses by incineration, and vaccination of
neighbouring flocks -- if indicated -- on the basis of risk
assessment. In our experience very few (ca. 1 in 20) experience
further cases of anthrax in the 7 years following completion of the
vaccination program.
Farmers in north central Victoria know, and are encouraged on an
on-going basis, to be vigilant to report any sudden cases of
unexplained cattle death to their private veterinarian or Department
of Primary Industries.

Knackery workers treated for anthrax
--------------------------------------
The co-workers of a Victorian knackery worker infected with anthrax
while handling affected cattle carcasses have been given antibiotics
as a precautionary measure, authorities have said.
Several workers at the Stanhope facility who were considered at risk
had been provided with medications by their own doctors, Department
of Human Services (DHS) spokesman Bram Alexander said. "The knackery
worker has been up and about today and is recovering well," Mr.
Alexander said. "He is expected to leave hospital in a few days and
he has been keen to let people know that he is okay." The 34-year-old
was diagnosed with a skin infection early last week, the 1st such
case in the state for 10 years, but has responded well to antibiotic
treatment at Goulburn Valley Health Hospital.
At least 25 head of cattle on 4 farms around Stanhope, in Victoria's
north, have died as a direct result of the disease, prompting fears
among neighbouring farmers of a widespread epidemic.
Today [Tue 6 Feb 2007], Victoria's Department of Primary Industries
(DPI) said there was no cause for alarm as anthrax was a common
occurrence in Australia and had been for 150 years. However, as many
as 5000 head of cattle would be vaccinated by the end of the week, a
DPI spokeswoman said. "The vaccination program is targeting all farms
and cattle within an 8-km radius of the outbreak in Stanhope," she said.
"It's important to understand that this a routine precautionary
measure. There is no public health risk, only an occupational risk
for those who work in the industry. Anthrax is not contagious as far
as concerns over humans contracting it from live cattle go."

[That some 2 dozen animals died in this outbreak and presumably the
majority on the 19th January farm -- mortality stopped within 24
hours on the other subsequent 3 farms -- reinforces the advice we
have given frequently that when incubating cases are suspected,
vaccination will do nothing to stop them. First treat the exposed
animals with a long acting antibiotic to stop incubating infections.
Then wait 7-10 days before vaccinating.
The cause of this outbreak awaits the results of local
investigations. The value of "no prior history of disease" on a farm
is the length of a piece of string. Sometimes it is true, though, but
single sporadic bovine deaths frequently get less attention than they
deserve and therefore an ongoing anthrax problem can be invisible to
the livestock owner. But if true, alternative causes need to be
examined. A constant feature of the recent (2005 and 2006) epidemics
in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and North and South Dakota, is that if the
primary outbreak(s) are not handled quickly; effectively there are
soon many affected animals on site and the potential for spread by
hemophagic flies becomes real. In all 4 states significant numbers of
infected animals on the 1st farms affected clearly contributed to the
resulting epidemiology of spread. - Mod.MHJ]
