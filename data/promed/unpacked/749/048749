Belize Newcastle Disease
------------------------
Source of virus: We have not been able to trace the source of virus
at index farm. At the time we were just recuperating from extensive
floods caused by tropical depression 16. The Spanish Lookout
community was cut off (not accessible by roads) by the flooded
rivers. Many animals died from the flash floods and flood. The
affected area is close to the river and the farmers remarked that
only those whose water supply was river water seemed to be initially affected.

The index farm did not report any movement of live birds since
September [2008] and table eggs were being sold to the local
distributor. To our dismay none of the layer farmers in the area
(except broiler breeder farm) vaccinated their birds hence the virus
struck a highly susceptible population. We will have a CFIA programme
specialist in Belize (8-21 Feb 2009) and hope to trace the source
then with her assistance.

Vaccination: We do not purchase vaccine from Mexico, only from USA
and recently from Europe.

If you need further information please feel free to contact us.

[We are most grateful to Victor Gongora for his information on the
initial stages of this epidemic. It remains an epidemiologic puzzle
how this index outbreak with a Mexican virus associated with fighting
cocks on the US/Mexico border in 2003 finds it way to Belize.
Latterly Mexico's information to OIE on this disease is notable by
its incompleteness (2006-7) and absence (2008). Up to June 2008
Guatemala had reported no cases since October 2003. The farmers in
the Spanish Lookout area had be warned of the regional risk but
unfortunately did not take it seriously. According to OIE Belize had
not had Newcastle Disease since 1997. - Mod.MHJ]
