Tilapia lake virus [TiLV] - follow-up report no. 1
-------------------------------------------------
[We present some comments from the follow-up report; for the full text, and a map showing the 2 clusters, please refer to the source URL above. - Mod.AS]

Agent: Tilapia lake virus
Date of start of the event: 01 Aug 2011
Date of confirmation of the event: 01 Mar 2014
Reason: emerging disease
Date of immediate notification: 21 May 2017
Follow-up report no. 1:

Affected population: TiLV outbreaks in pond-cultured tilapines (mainly tilapia hybrids) were diagnosed in approximately 15 farms located in the Jordan valley. Massive outbreaks are (typically) season-dependent: high water temperatures (full summer) are predisposing [(either by favoring viral replication or by weakening fish (low oxygen etc)].
These episodes were recorded in fish weighting over 60 grams (over 10 months of age). Involvement of juveniles cannot be excluded, but due to culture systems (green water), these cannot be promptly observed.
Clinical symptoms include lethargy, erratic swimming, ocular lesions and skin ulcerations.

Epidemiological comments: Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) outbreaks are recorded mostly during the hot season (July-October). Outbreaks occurring in other periods are rare.
In aquaculture systems, morbidity and mortality includes fish over 60 grams, although involvement of small fish is not excluded.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Kimron Veterinary Institute, Fish diseases laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test type / Result
Tilapines (tilapia) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / Positive
Tilapines (tilapia) / pathogen isolation on cell culture / Positive

[OIE's disease card on the emerging 'Tilapia lake virus" (TiLV) is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/Aquatic_Commission/A_TiLV_disease_card.pdf.

Article 4 in the said card addresses the geographic distribution as follows (references excluded):
"TiLV has been reported in Colombia, Ecuador, and Israel and most recently, Egypt and Thailand. However, a lack of thorough investigation of all mortality incidents means that the geographic distribution of TiLV may be wider than currently [reported]. For example, reports of mortality in tilapia in Ghana and Zambia in 2016 have not been attributed to TiLV but the available information does not indicate that the presence of the virus has been investigated. A partial genome from Thailand showed relatively high variation to strains from Israel (around 97 percent nucleotide identity)."

On 26 May 2017, the FAO published an exhaustive special global alert (no. 338) addressing Tilapia lake virus; the document (6 pages) is available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7326e.pdf.

The initial notification of the disease to the OIE was titled, in OIE's WAHID publication, as "Tilapia syncytial hepatitis" while the current follow-up report has been submitted by Israel under the title "Tilapia lake virus", similar to the title of OIE's relevant disease card. For consistency, ProMED-mail's thread bears the original title (Tilapia syncytial hepatitis). Reporting of this emerging fish disease from other affected countries is pending. - Mod.AS
