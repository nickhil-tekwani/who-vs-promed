Saskatchewan mare positive for equine infectious anemia
-------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System reported a horse in Vanscoy No. 345, Saskatchewan, tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) on 30 Jun 2022.

The owners requested the horse be tested after learning a horse it had been stabled with had been diagnosed with EIA. The horse was also showing clinical signs compatible with EIA. Reports indicate other horses reside on the property, which is now under official quarantine. Movement controls will remain in place until the confirmed cases have been destroyed and follow-up testing has taken place.

The Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System has reported 2 new equine infectious anemia (EIA) cases. On 7 Jul 2022 the first horse, which participated in rodeo events, tested positive prior to export to the US from Prince Albert No. 461, Saskatchewan. The horse was not showing clinical signs of disease.

A horse in Northern Sunrise County, Alberta, was also confirmed positive on 7 Jul 2022. The horse showed no clinical signs, but the owner requested testing due to previous contact with other recently positive horses through pony chuckwagon activities.

Both horses are under official quarantine until follow-up testing is performed and confirmed cases are euthanized. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency might require further action at trace-out activity, and owners and caregivers have been advised to implement improved biosecurity protocols.

About EIA
---------
Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:
• progressive body condition loss;
• muscle weakness;
• poor stamina;
• fever;
• depression; and
• anemia.

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards [183 m] away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

On 11 Jul 2022 the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) reported 2 positive cases of equine infectious anemia in the state. Two quarter horses, one in Fort Bend County and another in Parker County, tested positive, and the facilities are under official quarantine until they meet TAHC requirements for release. The Parker County case has been euthanized. Veterinarians and owners at both properties are closely monitoring potentially exposed horses and have biosecurity measures in place.

Three quarter horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), a bloodborne illness that hasn't been seen in the state since 2014. EIA does not infect humans, but it is transmitted between horses and other equine species by bloodsucking insects or infected medical equipment.

There is no treatment for EIA, which can cause fever, decreased appetite, severe anemia and sudden death. Other symptoms include weakness, jaundice, rapid breathing and limb swelling. Horses that survive the disease are lifelong EIA carriers and must be permanently quarantined or euthanized.

One of the infected horses, located in Berkeley County, was euthanized. Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health regulatory agency is discussing options with the owners of the other 2 infected horses in Barnwell County.

Owners should get an annual Coggins test for their horses, which screens for EIA, officials said.

The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) also released the following tips for horse owners to prevent EIA infection:
- Require proof of a recent negative Coggins test at time of purchase or for new horses entering the premises. Require an EIA test for horses which have spent time at a premise where EIA-positive horses have been identified.
- Only participate in events that require evidence of a negative Coggins test for every horse entering the event to prevent disease introduction and spread.
- Practice good fly control by regular mucking of stalls, proper disposal of manure away from horse stabling areas and use of fly sprays or natural predators to minimize fly presence.
- Use a sterile needle and syringe for all injections or treatments.
- Disinfect any surgical or dental equipment thoroughly between horses. Remove all debris and blood with soap and water before disinfection.
- Use a sterile needle each time when puncturing a multi-dose medication bottle. Consult a veterinarian to demonstrate how to use sterile technique when drawing up medications.
- Separate horses with fevers, reduced feed intake and/or lethargy from your other horses and contact your veterinarian.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often inapparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include
- jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes);
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate;
- swelling of limbs;
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes; and
- blood-stained feces.

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress: illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical."

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized.

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes, or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the US." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia)

It is unfortunate that there is no vaccine in the US. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seem to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see the following ProMED post: Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG
