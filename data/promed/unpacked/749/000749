During an official survey conducted on the potato harvest 2013, one outbreak of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 List) was detected in the Marne department (Champagne-Ardenne region), France. The bacterium was found on ware potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_ from 33 ha [81.6 ac]) and farm-saved seed potatoes (from 3 ha [7.4 ac]), which had been produced on one farm. Samples were collected in November 2013, tested (IF, PCR, pathogenicity test), and the final confirmation was received in February 2014.

A survey is being implemented to determine the extent of the outbreak. Infected potato lot(s) will be destroyed under the supervision of the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation], all machinery used by the grower will be disinfected, and an intensive survey will be carried out in the municipality where the outbreak was found, as well as in its immediate vicinity. In addition, all potato waste resulting from the harvest has been buried in a dedicated area which, along with its surroundings, will be placed under surveillance.

During an official survey conducted in 2013, one outbreak of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ was detected in the district of Humenne, Slovakia. In December 2013, the identity of the bacterium was confirmed on ware potatoes in one sample. Official control measures were taken.

The NPPO of Finland recently informed the EPPO that over a period from January to May 2014, _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ has been detected on ware potatoes on 4 farms [see also link below]. The extent of probable contaminations has been determined as being the entire areas of the farms. The origin of these infections is not known. On the 4 farms concerned, all potato lots have been inspected and no further findings were made. Official control measures were taken.

[_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ causes ring rot disease of potato. Yield losses of up to 50 per cent have been reported. Many solanaceous species, including tomato and aubergine (eggplant), are also susceptible The pathogen has also been found associated with symptomless infections of sugar beet and sugar beet seed.

Symptoms on potato may include wilting and yellowing of leaves, rot of the vascular ring of tubers with emerging bacterial ooze, and extensive tuber rot followed by internal hollowing, cracking, and mummification. Wilting symptoms may occur late in the season and are often masked by the natural senescence of the crop. Symptom expression depends on host cultivar and is favoured by cool climates. Tubers with ring rot are often subjected to secondary invasions by other bacteria and fungi, which can result in total loss of tubers in the field or in storage.

The pathogen is spread with infected seed tubers or other plant material, plant-to-plant contact, soil, and by mechanical means (for example during harvest or grading). The bacteria can survive for several years on dry surfaces and for over a month in water. They can overwinter in unharvested potatoes or crop debris. Ring rot can pass through one or more crop generations without causing symptoms, and latently infected tubers are an important means of spreading the disease. Laboratory tests are needed to detect latent infections.

Disease management is expensive and may include cultural practices and plant hygiene measures before and after harvest, but the use of certified clean seed potatoes is vital. Illegal farm-saved seed potatoes are known to pose a serious risk for the spread of ring rot.

In Finland, the current outbreak was first detected in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130720.1835754).
