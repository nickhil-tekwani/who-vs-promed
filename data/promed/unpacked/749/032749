PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa: A new case of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
had been detected in a cow in a quarantine zone in South Africa's KwaZulu
Natal province, the FMD Control Center said on Wednesday.
The quarantine zone had been established in September over a 10-kilometre
(6-mile) radius around 2 farms which reported an outbreak of the disease in
pigs and buffalo in September in the Camperdown area in the east of the
province.
FMD, a highly contagious viral infection which occurs in cloven-hoofed
animals, killed 70 pigs there last month.
More than 3,000 heads of livestock -- pigs, cattle, sheep and goats -- were
put down to prevent the spread of the disease after the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health on 19 Sep 2000 removed South Africa from the
list of countries deemed free of FMD disease. Since then, several countries
have restricted their imports of South African meat, and authorities fear
that major clients, especially in the European Union, might follow suit.
Officials said the quarantine zone may be modified and a ban on picking
strawberries in the zone may be announced later in the day.
The Foot and Mouth Control Center was set up last month jointly by the
agriculture ministry and the KwaZulu-Natal veterinary service to take all
necessary measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Livestock is being
checked in 16 districts of the province.
Before the outbreak, South Africa had not seen FMD since 1956.
