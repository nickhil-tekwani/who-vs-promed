An unknown illness has reportedly killed at least 50 people in Ette community, Olamaboro local government area [LGA] of Kogi state.

Ujah Alewo, the lawmaker representing Olamaboro constituency in the state house of assembly, disclosed this via a motion introduced during the plenary session on Tuesday [17 Nov 2020]. He said there is no confirmed diagnosis of the illness, of which symptoms include headache, sore eyes, loss of appetite, inability to urinate or defecate, and convulsion before death.

Olamaboro shares a boundary with Igbo-Eze north LGA in Enugu state, where the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has confirmed an outbreak of yellow fever, of which symptoms also include jaundice and headache.

The Cable had reported that the disease has spread to 2 more LGAs in the state; it already killed at least 76 people in 3 states.

Alewo said the illness has defied treatment with herbs and at the local health centres. "More worrisome, all efforts to seek a solution, using the local herbs and treatment at local health centres, with referrals to neighbouring clinics and hospitals at Ogugu and Okpo in Olamaboro, respectively, were not successful," ThisDay quoted him to have said. "The reports reaching my constituency office from the community leaders confirmed that over 50 people within the economic and productive age of 25-40 years died from September [2020] to date, thereby stalling agricultural, social, and economic activities, which directly affect the food security of the agrarian and artisan Etteh people."

He added that the deaths have caused panic among residents in the affected community, and he called on the state government to intervene. The NCDC and Saka Haruna, the state commissioner for health, have been contacted for their responses.

[The above report does not indicate that samples have been taken for laboratory diagnosis. Until laboratory tests are done, it is not possible to establish the cause of death. It is tempting to speculate that this is yellow fever (YF) spillover from YF outbreaks in neighboring states, but laboratory confirmation is needed to rule YF, COVID-19, or other etiological agents in or out. This outbreak should be investigated by field epidemiological teams promptly. ProMED-mail awaits with interest further information about this outbreak. - Mod.TY
