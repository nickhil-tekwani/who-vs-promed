RABIES, FOX - EUROPE

RABIES is retreating in continental Europe, thanks to the oral vaccine
being dropped on woodland by aircraft.
However German animal biologists are giving a warning that the decline may
be matched by increases in tapeworm (_Echinococcus granulosus_)
infestations. It is flourishing in the rapidly increasing fox population
and may be transmitted to humans.
World Health Organisation figures demonstrate the effectiveness the of the
oral vaccination campaign over the past decade. In 1983 there were more
than 9,000 registered cases of rabies among animals in Germany. Last year
the number had dropped to 153; this year, experts expect only about 70.
Statistics comparing the first quarter of 1983 (just before the aerial
vaccination began) with the first quarter of this year are even more
remarkable. Seriously affected areas such as France, Belgium, Switzerland
and northern Italy are now almost free.
Quoted figures of infected animals for the first quarter of each year:
1983 1997
Austria 404 5
Belgium 208 6
France 802 1
Germany 2,764 34
Italy 93 0
Switzerland 213 0
The Netherlands 1 0
After the Second World War, a mutated rabies virus infected Polish foxes.
It spread westwards at about 30 miles a year and rabies became a feature of
Central Europe. Traditional culling by farmers, hunters or poison gas
(pumped into foxes' dens) made little impact. Only the oral vaccine has
shown significant results.
German scientists have noted, however, that if vaccination is suspended
[before areas are rabies-free], as it was by cash-strapped regions of
Germany in 1994, [fox] rabies returns rapidly. The German fox population
has increased between three and fivefold. So many are now straying into
urban areas that the anti-rabies vaccine has had to be placed in some city
parks.
It is claimed by some that the foxes have brought with them a secondary
problem, an increased incidence of Echinococcus infestations. Dr Ferdinand
Ruhe, Gottingen, says: "The vaccination of foxes has encouraged a parasite
that is an even more serious threat than rabies." Not all biologists agree
about the dimensions of the problem and the long incubation time makes it
difficult to prove the connection between the beginning of the mass
anti-rabies campaign and the increased incidence of the parasite. "We do
not yet have reliable data about the spread of this dangerous parasite,"
says Professor Peter Kern, who has been treating human patients. [However]
"First tests do suggest, though, that many more people have been infected than
previously suspected, especially in southern Germany."
[However, according to a German visitor I had earlier this year, with whom
we worked on his fox rabies and echinococcus data, the explosion in the
German fox population is not as simple as it appears, i.e. merely the
removal of the previous culling action of rabies.
The present fox density in Germany is extraordinarily high and this may be
more in response to the various active 'green' policies in action in that
country, legal limitations on population control, and landscape management.
Before they had rabies to the extent they did prior the recent rabies
emergency, e.g., between WWI and WWII, the fox population was a fraction of
what it is now. In areas where rabies continues to persist, the fox
densities quoted by my visitor are of the order of 1-2 per 500 acres if my
memory of our conversations is correct, but certainly of that order. -
