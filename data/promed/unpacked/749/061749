Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine strategies in GAVI [Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]-eligible countries are
focusing on infant immunization but this strategy may not be optimal
in all settings. We aimed to collect all available population based
data on pneumococcal meningitis throughout life in the African
meningitis belt and then to model overall meningitis risk to help
inform vaccine policy.

Methods: After a systematic review of literature published from 1970
through the present, we found robust population-based _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ (Sp) meningitis data across age strata for 4 African
meningitis belt countries that included 35 surveillance years
spanning from 1970 to 2005. Using these data we modeled disease risk
for a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 persons followed throughout life.

Results: Similar to meningococcal meningitis, laboratory-confirmed
pneumococcal meningitis was seasonal, occurring primarily in the dry
season. The mean annual Sp meningitis incidence rates were 98, 7.8 to
14, and 5.8 to 12 per 100 000 among persons <1, 1 through 19, and 20
to 99 years of age, respectively, which (in the absence of major
epidemics) were higher than meningococcal meningitis incidences for
persons less than 1 and over 20 years of age. Mean Sp meningitis case
fatality ratios (CFR) among hospitalized patients ranged from 36-66
percent depending on the age group, with CFR exceeding 60 percent for
all age groups beyond 40 years; depending on the age group, Sp
meningitis mortality incidences were 2- to 12-fold greater than those
for meningococcal meningitis.

The lifetime risks of pneumococcal meningitis disease and death were
0.6 percent (1 in 170) and 0.3 percent (1 in 304), respectively. The
incidences of these outcomes were highest among children age <1 year.
However, the cumulative risk was highest among persons age 5 to 59
years who experienced 59 percent of pneumococcal meningitis outcomes.
After age 5 years and depending on the country, 59-79 percent of
meningitis cases were caused by serotype 1.

Conclusions: In the African meningitis belt, Sp is as important a
cause of meningitis as _Neisseria meningitidis_, particularly among
older children and working age adults. The meningitis belt population
needs an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine and policy
discussions should consider vaccine use outside of early childhood.

[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the
sub-Saharan African region known as the "Meningitis Belt" each year
during the hot, dry season, between December and June, and every 8-12
years large outbreaks occur
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>).

The "Meningitis Belt" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia
and Eritrea in the east
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>). Attack rates
during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per
100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as
high as 1000 per 100 000. [World Health Organization: Meningococcal
meningitis fact sheet.
[<http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf>]. While
in endemic disease the highest attack rates are observed in young
children, during epidemics, older children, teenagers and adults are
also affected.

Although epidemics of meningitis are mostly associated with the
meningococcus, there is evidence that increases in pneumococcal
meningitis cases occur in parallel in sub-Saharan Africa during the
hot and dry season [Mar ID, Denis F, Cadoz M. Epidemiologic features
of pneumococcal meningitis in Africa. Clinical and serotypical
aspects (author's transl). Pathol Biol (Paris). 1979; 27(9):543-8;
Leimkugel J, et al. An outbreak of serotype 1 _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ meningitis in northern Ghana with features that are
characteristic of _Neisseria meningitidis_ meningitis epidemics. _J
Infect Dis 2005, 192:192-199; Yaro S, et al. Epidemiological and
molecular characteristics of a highly lethal pneumococcal meningitis
epidemic in Burkina Faso. _Clin Infect Dis 2006, 43:693-700; and

_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ serotype 1 clone from The Gambia:
expansion of ST217 hypervirulent clonal complex in West Africa. _BMC
Microbiol 2008, 8:198]

Bacterial meningitis in Africa is associated with high mortality and
risk of neuropsychological sequelae. The 3 leading causes of
bacterial meningitis (_S. pneumoniae_, _Hemophilus influenzae_, and
_N. meningitidis_) are vaccine preventable, and routine use of
conjugate vaccines in African children could provide substantial
health and economic benefits through the prevention of childhood
meningitis cases
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2005/s03/en/index.html>;
Peltola H. Burden of meningitis and other severe bacterial infections
of children in Africa: implications for prevention. Clin Infect Dis.
2001;32(1):64-75).

The predominant pneumococcal serotype in sub-Saharan Africa has been
found to be serotype 1; this serotype is not included in the
heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (that contains
serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23), but it is included in the
decavalent PCV (that contains serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C,
19F, and 23F).
