The invasive Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus], which is capable of spreading the Zika virus, has been found in Michigan, but officials emphasized that there is no evidence of Zika or other exotic virus-infected mosquitoes in Michigan or the United States this year [2018].

Officials from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Wayne County Health Department announced that the mosquito was identified on 16 Aug [2018] in southern Romulus.

"Finding Asian tiger mosquitoes in Michigan is no reason for great concern. Many of our neighboring states have found them previously and have not seen Zika transmission from this species," said Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS chief medical executive. "However, it is always a good idea to take precautions against mosquito bites, since other mosquito species can carry diseases like West Nile virus."

The presence of the mosquito was discovered in Michigan for the 1st time in 2017. Recently, the species has been found in Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Windsor, Ontario.

This year [2018], 69 birds have tested positive for WNV from 21 of Michigan's 83 counties.

[_Aedes albopictus_ is gradually moving northward. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's map of geographic areas suitable for this mosquito includes Michigan http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html. This mosquito can enter diapause and survive winter conditions. It may be that this mosquito is becoming established in the Upper Midwestern states.

The main risk that this mosquito presents is less for transmission of Zika virus than for transmission of La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon viruses, to which it is susceptible. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like the Upper Midwest of the USA. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible. - Mod.TY
