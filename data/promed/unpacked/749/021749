Avian influenza has killed a 23-year-old market worker in Indonesia, a senior
government official said on Saturday [18 Feb 2006], citing test results from
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The man, the
country's 19th victim of the H5N1 avian flu virus, died on 10 Feb 2006 in a
Jakarta hospital. He had worked at a traditional market transporting chicken
eggs.
"We have received the test result from CDC Atlanta. The victim was positive,"
Hariadi Wibisono, Director-general of control of animal-borne disease at the
Indonesian Health Ministry, told Reuters. He said that brought the total
number of confirmed Indonesian human cases of H5N1 virus infection to 27 -- 8
of those who have had the disease have survived. Of Indonesia's confirmed
fatalities, 8 have been in 2006, making Indonesia the country with the most
bird flu deaths so far in 2006. [The 19th victim] was not among the so-
called "cluster" cases Indonesia has experienced, in which several members of
the same family become infected by the virus.
A Minister this week said reporting of new cases among fowl, which in turn
could lead to more human cases, is not as efficient as it should be. "We will
repair the reporting system which so far has often been late. Frequently, the
media reports are faster than the reports from the ministry's own team,"
Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono said. "There is an increase in the
intensity of bird flu cases (among fowl) in several areas in West Java," he
said, although in remarks on Friday [17 Feb 2006] he suggested that cases in
the country overall were decreasing.
Controlling the virus is a huge, if not impossible, task in Indonesia, an
archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The government has
resisted the mass culling of fowl seen in some other nations, citing the
expense and the impracticality in a country where the keeping of a few
chickens or ducks in backyards of homes is widely practiced in cities as well
as the countryside. Agencies have concentrated instead on selective culling,
and on public education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention.

[The 27th confirmed case and 19th death in Indonesia increases the global
total of human cases of avian influenza to 171, 93 of which have been fatal.
So far during 2006 the number of cases and fatalities has been highest in
Indonesia. In contrast, as of 13 Feb 2006 there have been no cases and no
fatalities in Cambodia [in 2006], 4 cases and 3 deaths [reported] in China,
one case and one death in Iraq, no cases and no deaths in Thailand, 12 cases
and 4 deaths in Turkey, and no cases and no deaths in Viet Nam. - Mod.CP]

Bulgarian health authorities have [placed] a man in an isolation [facility]
and were testing him for [avian influenza virus infection] on [Sat 18 Feb
2006] after 2 of his ducks died, but said he was not showing symptoms of the
disease. The man, from the southern Bulgarian village of Preslavtsi, has been
in close contact with the dead ducks, which are being tested by veterinary
authorities for the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has killed more than 90
people since late 2003.
"We are keeping the man in an isolation chamber as a precautionary measure,"
said Todor Gogovski, the doctor on duty at the hospital at the southern city
of Haskovo. "We are testing him for bird flu and are awaiting the results, but
so far he does not show the symptoms of the disease. He just has a running
nose and does not have high temperature."
Bulgaria detected its first outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian flu in a wild
swan on the Danube River town of Vidin, close to the Romanian border, at the
end of January. The Balkan country, which lies on one of the major routes of
migratory birds from Europe to Africa, has stepped up measures to prevent the
spread of the disease to domestic fowl and urged people to avoid contact with
wild birds.

[It is unlikely that this patient will be confirmed as a case of H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection. The patient's symptoms are mild and not typical.
Furthermore, in spite of the increasing recovery of H5N1 virus from migratory
species of wild birds worldwide, there has been no direct transmission of H5N1
avian influenza virus infection from any species of wild bird to humans. -
