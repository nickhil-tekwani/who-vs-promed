MALTA, Mont. -- The once-high hopes of reintroducing one of North America's
rarest mammals into Montana have diminished this year -- the indirect
victim of a plague by Mother Nature and land management politics of humans.
For the first time in 6 years, officials at the Charles M. Russell National
Wildlife Refuge in north-central Montana have decided not to introduce any
more black-footed ferrets at the refuge, considered the second most
successful reintroduction site in the country. The decision not to
introduce ferrets this year has less to do with ferrets than it does the
prairie dog, a small burrowing rodent. Prairie dogs not only make up more
than 90 percent of the ferret's diet, they build and then begrudgingly
share their intricate system of underground tunnels with the ferrets. But
sylvatic plague, known as the bubonic plague in humans, has killed off
prairie dogs on thousands of acres in the region since the early 1990s.
The plague, [caused by the agent _Yersinia pestis_ which is spread by
fleas and hard to predict, struck again this year on the Fort Belknap
Indian Reservation in northern Montana, another reintroduction site. The
Fish and Wildlife Service has said prairie dog losses from plague, poisons,
shooting and other factors have become so high, the prairie dog itself may
be warranted for listing as a threatened species. The black-footed ferrets
were once thought to be extinct or near extinct. But a remnant population
was discovered in 1981 on a ranch near Meeteetse, Wyoming. Reintroduction
began in 1991 in Wyoming and has occurred in a handful of other Western
states since. As of last year, about 1 200 ferrets had been reintroduced
into the wild, but with just moderate success. The goal is to establish at
least 10 separate, self-sustaining populations with a total number of 1 500
ferrets by 2010. So far, just 6 sites in North America have been identified
as high quality -- healthy enough to sustain a growing ferret population. A
number of those are in South Dakota and so far have been unaffected by plague.
Reintroductions have been successful at the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands
site in southwest South Dakota. About 25 "kits," or juvenile ferrets, from
that site are expected to be sent to another site in the state. At the
Montana refuge, biologists are timid about reintroducing more ferrets.
While shooting is banned there and the plague has not been detected, they
don't want to add more ferrets until they are confident the prairie dog
population in the refuge and on adjacent land is healthy and growing.
At Fort Belknap, where officials counted only a half-dozen ferrets last
spring and just one new litter this year, more ferret releases are planned
this fall, despite the plague outbreak. Tim Vosburgh, a tribal biologist,
admits it's a gamble. "This year is going to be critical in determining
whether ferrets will be on Fort Belknap," he said.

[Prairie dogs are very sensitive to the plague agent. Plague can sweep
through a prairie dog colony rapidly, leaving the entire population
deceased. Prairie dogs are excellent sentinels for plague. Although the
re-establishment of the black-footed ferret is worthy in re-establishing
the species, it is prudent on the part of the wildlife managers to wait
until the plague cycle is no longer affecting the prairie dogs, since these
two seem to co-habitate. -Mod.TG
