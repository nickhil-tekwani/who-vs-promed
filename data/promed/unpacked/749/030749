Comment on Influenza (41): WHO Update archive number 20120526.1145928
------------------------------------
It was interesting to read this latest WHO influenza update, particularly how the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus appears to be predominating mainly in its country of origin, Mexico, compared to the rest of the world (where data have been reported), and where the seasonal influenza virus subtypes (A/H3N2 and B) have been predominating. Notably seasonal A/H1N1 virus seems not to feature significantly in the presence of the the pandemic virus, which may not be unexpected.

Just reviewing some of the seroprevalence literature published over the past 3 years from around the world (1-15), since the pandemic, although the seroprevalence studies from Mexico (16, 17) have reported relatively similar levels of antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 in their populations (noted that not all of these studies were performed at exactly the same time) this seems to be the only country where the pandemic virus appears to be persisting -- even when many countries report similar age-related cross-reacting seroprevalence rates, particularly for their younger and older age groups. Even in some of their nearest country neighbours, i.e. the USA and Canada, it is the seasonal influenza viruses (A/H3N2 and B) that are vying for predominance in those populations -- reflecting the situation elsewhere in the world.

Of course there will be fluctuations in the influenza incidence reported and in the laboratory samples received for influenza testing and sub typing, but it is intriguing why the A(H1N1)pdm virus seems to be predominating in the country of its origin, when one might expect the opposite, i.e. surely the new virus would have spread quickly through its country of origin, leaving most of the surviving population immune, then gradually worked its way through the rest of the global population, predominating in countries where the population was still naive to this virus -- as might be expected for a pandemic strain.

Of course this is just a snapshot of the situation at this point, but now with hindsight regarding the earlier debates and controversies over whether the A(H1N1)pdm was typical of a true pandemic virus (18-20), it might be timely to review these opinions once again -- even if any further clarification is just for reasons of scientific and public health posterity.
