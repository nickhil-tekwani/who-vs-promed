[3] Canada: additional report (Saskatchewan)
Date: 7 Sep 2007

<http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/09/07/west-nile.html>

The number of confirmed West Nile virus infections in Saskatchewan
continues to rise and is expected to reach record numbers before the
mosquito season ends.
On Friday [7 Sep 2007], the Saskatchewan Health Department said the
total number of confirmed infections of the potentially debilitating
virus now stands at 826 -- a jump of more than 25 percent from one
week ago when the total was 647.
No more deaths have been linked to the virus. That number still stands at 3.
According to Phil Curry, the province's expert on the variety of
mosquito that carries the West Nile virus [_Culex tarsalis_ -
Mod.TY], the wet, warm summer of 2007 was almost perfect for the
breeding of the bugs.
Dr. Ross Findlater, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, said
he expects the number of people infected this year [2007] to be the
highest since 2003. That year, there were 947 infections and 7 people died.
Saskatchewan has more West Nile cases than any other province in
Canada, according to federal government statistics.

Virus Update No.12 [edited]
<http://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?archive=2007-09-01&item=2233>

The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health advises it is
investigating a human death that may be related to a West Nile virus infection.
The investigation is underway to confirm a West Nile virus infection
and the role West Nile virus may have played in the death of a man in
his 60s, who was a resident of the Interlake health region. If
confirmed, this will be the 3rd human death related to a West Nile
virus infection in Manitoba in 2007.
As of end of day Wednesday [5 Sep 2007], 90 additional positive human
test results for West Nile virus have been reported in Manitoba since
last week. These new results mostly reflect exposures to infected
mosquitoes before mid-August [2007].
To date, a total of 455 individuals have tested positive for West
Nile virus (WNV) this year in Manitoba. Of these, 20 test results
were identified by Canadian Blood Services routine screening. The
donated blood units were discarded as planned.
Ongoing mosquito surveillance indicates that current numbers of
active West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes are decreasing. However,
infected mosquitoes continue to be present in most parts of southern Manitoba.
The number of cases of the more severe type of West Nile virus (i.e.,
WNV neurological syndrome) in previous years has ranged from one to
35 cases per summer. The total number of cases of all types of West
Nile virus in previous years has ranged from 3 to 143. To date in
2007, 139 WNV human cases have been classified of which 32 are WNV
neurological syndrome.

**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above.]
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.
