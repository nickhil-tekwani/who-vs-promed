Khanh Hoa girl is 1st bird flu patient of the year [2010]
---------------------------------------------------------
A 3 year old girl in the central province of Khanh Hoa has tested positive
for [avian influenza] H5N1 [virus infection], becoming the country's 1st
bird flu patient this year [2010], the Ministry of Health reported in Hanoi
on Monday [22 Feb 2010].

The girl, who lives in Ninh Hoa District's Ninh Than Commune, fell sick
with fever, sore throat, cough, and a runny nose on 27 Jan 2010. She was
admitted to Ninh Hoa Hospital the next day and was confirmed to be infected
with the virus on 12 Feb 2010, according to the Ministry. The girl was
recovering, the Ministry reported.

An inspection conducted in Ninh Than showed no sign of the avian flu in the
commune, and the poultry raised by the girl's family showed no signs of
sickness. However, the Ministry's inspectors found that about a month
earlier, ostriches had died of [an undiagnosed disease] at a farm a
kilometre [0.6 mi] from the patient's home.

According to the Ministry, 112 people have been infected by avian influenza
H5N1 virus since 2003, and 57 have died. Also on Monday [22 Feb 2010], the
Ministry reported that the total number of emergency cases related to daily
life accidents admitted to hospitals nationwide had doubled from the
previous year during the 6-day Tet holiday starting 13 Feb 2010. The death
toll in traffic accidents during the holiday increased 29 per cent
year-on-year, while fatalities from fights were 3.4 times higher than the
year before [2009], the Ministry said. Food poisoning cases also increased
by 70 per cent over more than the 1100 recorded during last year's holiday,
the Ministry said.
