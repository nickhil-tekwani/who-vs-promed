Three EU states ban pig imports from Britain
----------------------------------------------
The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain have banned imports of pigs from Britain
in an attempt to quarantine an epidemic of swine fever discovered this week
in English farms. Swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease fatal to
pigs but not
communicable to humans.
In the first cases of swine fever recorded in Britain in 14 years, infected
pigs were found in England on a breeding farm in Norfolk, an Essex farm and
another in Suffolk. Under European Union regulations, all pigs on infected
farms must be slaughtered and their carcasses destroyed.
A spokesman for the British agriculture ministry said the supply chain had
been contaminated. All of the cases in Britain appear to stem from a single
breeding unit, thought to be in Norfolk, which supplied pigs to nursery
units elsewhere over the last 10 weeks, an agriculture ministry spokesman
said. A further 1 000 pigs are to be slaughtered Sunday at a Norfolk farm
which also took pigs from the breeding unit, even though swine fever has
not been detected there. Checks on 10 other farms which took in pigs from
the breeding unit have found no trace of the illness.
The culled animals were all "related to the same company, but for the
moment it is a question of identifying them and controlling" the epidemic,
the spokesman added. The British government's chief veterinary officer, Jim
Scudamore, said it could be several weeks at least before the outbreak can
be beaten.
"At the moment," he told BBC radio, "the cases are all linked to one farm
and if any other cases turn out to be linked to that farm too, then
hopefully we will be able to deal with it quite quickly. The difficulty
will be if it has spread any further, and we're visiting a lot of farms at
the moment to see if there has been any spread. We are very concerned. This
could have a major impact on the pig farming industry."
Individual EU member states are able to impose interim bans until the next
meeting of the European Commission's scientific veterinary committee
decides its long-term response. British officials will be travelling to
Brussels in the next 2 weeks to discuss with the committee the necessary
measures to stamp out the disease.
The Netherlands was the first to ban imports of live British pigs,
effective last Thursday at 8:00 p.m. The Dutch were followed by Belgium,
which decided Friday to prohibit imports of live pigs from Britain. Spain
decided not only to ban imports of live pigs but also of fresh meat and all
other pork products. The embargo will stand until 20 Aug when the EU
Veterinary Committee is due to meet. In addition to these initial measures,
the Netherlands has also decided to test pigs imported from Britain since 1
Jul for the presence of the virus. Belgian authorities are monitoring pork
products originating from British animals since 15 Jun. Imports of pork
products from Britain into France have been strictly controlled since the
outbreak of the disease, the French agriculture ministry said, adding there
had been very few pig imports in recent weeks.
The last outbreak of swine fever in Britain was in 1986, but several
outbreaks were reported in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain in 1998.
