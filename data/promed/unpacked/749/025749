High-pressure oxygen treatment may help long COVID
--------------------------------------------------
Patients with long COVID may see some improvement after breathing pure oxygen in a high-air-pressure environment, according to data from a small Israeli trial.

Researchers randomly assigned 73 patients with post-COVID symptoms lasting at least 3 months to receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) or a sham treatment. Patients in the HBOT group spent 40 sessions breathing pure oxygen in a chamber in which the air pressure was 2 to 3 times higher than normal, allowing the lungs to receive more oxygen than they normally would. Shortly after the last treatment, the HBOT group showed "significant improvement" compared to the sham group in thinking skills, energy, sleep, psychiatric symptoms, and pain, according to a report published on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022] in Scientific Reports. Symptomatic improvement was associated with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of structural and functional brain healing and improved delivery of oxygen-carrying blood to the brain, the researchers said.

HBOT is often used to treat wounds that are not healing well and has recently been tested as a treatment for traumatic brain injury, but this is the 1st randomized trial to test it for long COVID. Larger studies are needed to confirm the findings and to identify patients who might benefit, the researchers said.

[Researchers have analysed data from the COVID Symptom Study app (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v2) to discover who is most at risk of developing long COVID. They found that older people, women, and those who had a more severe infection (with 5 or more symptoms in the 1st week of becoming ill with COVID-19) were more likely to develop long COVID.

They found that long COVID affects around a tenth of 18-49 year-olds who get COVID-19, increasing to just over 1 in 5 (22%) in people over 70. The researchers also found people with asthma were more likely to develop long COVID. This was the only clear link they found to existing health conditions in people who developed long COVID.

Researchers from University Hospital Zurich have backed up these findings. Their research also found that people with low levels of certain antibodies (IgM and IgG3) in their blood may be more likely to develop long COVID. When they combined this antibody data with the other factors (such as the person's age, number of initial COVID symptoms, and history of asthma), they were better able to predict who would go on to have long COVID.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics on people with self-reported long COVID said it was most common among those aged 35-69, females, people living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care, or teaching and education, and people with another health condition or disability. This study was based on 305 997 people who responded to the Coronavirus Infection Survey (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/latest) in the 4 weeks to 2 Jan 2022.

There is no specific treatment for the myriad of symptoms reported by long COVID cases, and symptomatic management of individual symptoms is the current course of action until concrete therapeutic options may become available. - Mod.UBA]

Earlier omicron infection may protect against BA.4/BA.5
-------------------------------------------------------
Young and middle-aged adults who were infected with earlier versions of the omicron variant of the coronavirus are likely to have "strong" protection against reinfection with the currently dominant omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, researchers say.

That will not be the case if they were infected with a variant that circulated before omicron, however, according to a study from Qatar. Researchers there found that after taking vaccination status into account, infection with a pre-omicron version of SARS-CoV-2 appeared to be only 15.1% effective at preventing a symptomatic BA.4/BA.5 reinfection and 28.3% effective at preventing any BA.4/BA.5 reinfection. A previous omicron infection, however, was 76.1% effective against symptomatic BA.4/BA.5 reinfection and 79.7% effective against any BA.4/BA.5 reinfection. The study did not assess the severity of reinfection. In a report posted on medRxiv on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022] ahead of peer review, the researchers point out that the findings may not be applicable in older people, given that in Qatar only 9% of the residents are older than 50.

The study also showed that protection from infections with earlier pre-omicron variants was weaker against BA.4/BA.5 than it was against BA.1/BA.2, "indicating that these 2 new variants have greater capacity to escape the immune-system response," said study leader Laith Jamal Abu Raddad of Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.

COVID-19 vaccines linked with longer periods for some women
-----------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with short-term lengthening of the menstrual cycle for some women, according to a new study.

The findings are drawn from 3858 female nurses in the United States and Canada who have been filling out questionnaires about their periods twice a year since 2011. As of December 2021, 91% of them had been vaccinated against the coronavirus. Before the pandemic, 15% reported irregular cycles; that rose to 22.7% in 2021, the researchers reported on Wednesday [13 Jul 2022] in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Vaccinated women had a 54% higher risk of increased cycle length compared to unvaccinated women, regardless of vaccine type and even after taking pandemic stress and health-related factors into account, the report said. On closer analysis, vaccination was only associated with change to longer cycles in the 1st 6 months after vaccination and among women whose cycles were short, long or irregular before vaccination, not among women with normal length, regular cycles.

"A normal menstrual cycle is characterized by tightly regulated inflammatory and immune mediators" that may be temporarily affected by the body's immune response to the vaccines, the researchers said. They call for monitoring of "menstrual cycle health in vaccine clinical trials and increased attention to sex-based differences in vaccine response."

[Researchers led by Alison Edelman at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, USA, analysed anonymised data from thousands of women who regularly logged details about their menstrual cycles using a fertility tracking app called Natural Cycles. Of the 3959 women who participated in the study, 2403 were vaccinated and 1556 were unvaccinated. Most received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.

The researchers analysed data from 3 consecutive cycles before vaccination, and from 3 afterwards -- including the cycle or cycles in which vaccination took place. For unvaccinated individuals, data was collected for 6 consecutive cycles.

The research was sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health (the government agency that supports biomedical research) and published in the peer-reviewed journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Women who received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during a single menstrual cycle had a small increase in cycle length -- meaning a longer time between bleeding -- of just over half a day, on average, compared to unvaccinated women. Although statistically significant, natural variability in unvaccinated women's cycles meant that many of them similarly experienced these sorts of changes month to month. The study reported no difference in the proportion of individuals who experienced a clinically significant change in cycle length of 8 days or more.

Additional information is clearly needed especially as booster vaccinations are rolled out in many countries. - Mod.UBA]

A total of 55 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 55 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 7.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 29.8%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 12.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 10.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.27 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 570.83 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.39 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
