A Milk Cow Tests Positive: FMD in South Korea Spreads
------------------------------------------------------
A milk cow in central South Korea tested positive for foot & mouth disease,
the first such case since several pigs were stricken with the deadly animal
disease a month ago, officials said Sat 8 Jun 2002.
South Korea has been struggling to allay international concerns about the
possible spread of the highly contagious disease during the soccer World
Cup, calling such concerns groundless as outbreaks have been restricted to
districts some distance from tournament venues. The nearest World Cup city
is Suwon, 25 miles north of the affected region.
The government has slaughtered tens of thousands of pigs since an outbreak
of the disease in Ansung, 60 miles south of Seoul on 2 May 2002. No cattle
in the area had been found infected.
But on Fri 7 Jun 2002, a farmer in the area reported that one of his cows
was showing symptoms of foot & mouth disease. Tests confirmed that the cow
was infected with the disease, officials said. As a preventive measure,
authorities slaughtered 130 milk cows in nearby areas. The area is about 1
mile from the farm where the disease was first reported on 2 May 2002.
Infected animals first suffer blisters on their hooves and mouths that
spread to internal organs, killing the livestock. The disease spreads among
cloven-hoofed animals such as cows and pigs, but is not dangerous to humans.

[Although several cows have been included in the precautionary slaughter in
S.Korea since the beginning of the outbreak, this case -- provided it is
formally confirmed by the authorities -- becomes the first case in bovines.
The decision of S. Korea about her future control steps, with special
reference to mass vaccination, is anticipated with great interest. - Mod.
