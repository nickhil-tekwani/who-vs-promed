At least 15 people have died, and 1569 have contracted hepatitis E in Namibia since the disease outbreak was confirmed in the capital Windhoek in December 2017.

According to information from the Ministry of Health, the deceased included 6 pregnant women among other categories from the Havana and Goreangab informal settlements. The outbreak has since spread from the capital to other administrative regions of the country. However, the cases are largely confined to 5 informal settlements in the Katutura local government area of Windhoek.

Speaking during an assessment tour of emergency responses in the affected settlements, US ambassador to Namibia Lisa Johnson said Washington will help Namibia fight the hepatitis E outbreak. "We are seeing that there are still new cases in the areas of Windhoek every week, and that's actually not unexpected; it does take months to get the hepatitis E outbreak under control. We will continue to assist, and I think by mid-July 2018, the National Health Emergency National Committee will have some sort of 6 months response review to see how we are doing altogether and what needs to be done next," Johnson said.

The US embassy in Windhoek is negotiating with the Namibian health ministry to weigh the possibility of deploying a 2nd team of epidemiologists from the CDC to provide Namibia with medical and technical assistance.

Hepatitis E is a liver infection that is spread through direct contact with fecal material from an infected person or by indirect fecal contamination of food or water sources. Pregnant women who get infected are at greater risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and death.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1. Control of the outbreaks is not rocket science; providing clean water is the answer.

The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G. Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015;61: 607-608:

"Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).

Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19)."
