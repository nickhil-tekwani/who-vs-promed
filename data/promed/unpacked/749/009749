A 3rd polio case in Balochistan for 2017 was reported on [Mon 18 Dec 2017]. According to officials of the provincial health department, the new case has surfaced from Gulistan tehsil [sub district] of Qilla Abdullah [Killa Abdullah] district in Balochistan.

The virus has been detected in a 16-month-old child in the area. His parents had refused to administer polio drops to him, which is why he contracted the virus, officials said.

The 1st case was reported in July this year [2017] from Chaman area of the same district, Qilla Abdullah. The 2nd case was reported recently from Zhob district of Balochistan.

Qilla Abdullah is considered to be a high-risk area for polio in the province.

A 3-day polio campaign starts in Balochistan today [18 Dec 2017].

The new case has taken the count of polio victims reported in 2017 to 8 from across Pakistan.

[As the last update announcement by WHO, contained in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative weekly update from last week stated, there had been a total of 6 cases of polio confirmed in Pakistan during 2017. The update also announced an early report of a case of polio in Balochistan to be officially counted in this coming week's update. That would bring the total number of reported cases of WPV1 associated disease in Pakistan to 7. That being said, the End Polio Pakistan website lists the national total as 8 with 3 cases reported from Balochistan (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces), supporting this is most likely a newly confirmed/reported case.

According to the information available on the End Polio Pakistan website, there have been 3 cases reported from Balochistan, 2 from Qilla Abdullah district and 1 from Zhob district (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2017).

[2] immunization drive begins
Date: Mon 18 Dec 2017

Amid stringent security, a 3-day anti-polio campaign has started in selected districts of Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) on [Mon 18 Dec 2017], said Radio Pakistan.

Polio teams will go door-to-door and administer oral polio vaccine drops to children under the age of 5 in 8 districts of Punjab, 20 districts of Balochistan, and 17 districts of K-P and Fata during the immunisation campaign.

In Punjab, nearly 7 million children will be given anti-polio vaccines while in Balochistan more than 1.7 million children and in K-P and Fata, 5 million children will be given polio vaccine drops.

Pakistan is one of just 3 countries in the world, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria that have endemic polio, a once-common childhood virus that can cause paralysis or death. However, immunisation efforts have, in the past, been hampered by militants. In January 2016, a suicide bomber killed 15 people outside a vaccination centre in Quetta in an attack, claimed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and another militant group, Jundullah. Militants in Pakistan have previously alleged the immunisation campaigns are a cover for Western spies.

Local officials said they had recruited Muslim clerics to promote the immunisations for children after past programmes were met with resistance and even violence by extremists.

In Polio's Worst-Hit District, Vaccinators Strain for Access
-------------------
Shahwalikot, a district in southern Afghanistan that is largely controlled by the Taliban, has the sad distinction of being the polio capital of the world. Four new cases have been reported there this year [2017], out of 20 worldwide - the indirect consequence of a war that is also killing and maiming children in increasingly large numbers.

On Monday [18 Dec 2017], vaccinators began another dangerous attempt to immunize children in Shahwalikot, as the United Nations urgently appealed to all sides of the conflict to let them work. But after a day of going door to door and village to village in Shahwalikot, in Kandahar Province, they had gained access to just 3 of the 28 zones they needed to reach. They said the Taliban had promised to eventually let them into 11 others.

Pleading for cooperation before the immunization campaign began, Toby Lanzer, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan, said the surge in polio cases in Shahwalikot had the potential to ultimately put hundreds of thousands of Afghan children at risk [see statement below in [4]).

"In the past days, yet another case of wild poliovirus was found," Mr. Lanzer said. "The outbreak of polio in Shahwalikot means that Afghanistan remains one of only 3 countries in the world that is still polio-endemic, and polio eradication is at risk globally. This week's campaign in Kandahar is more important than ever."

Worldwide, new polio cases are down 50 percent this year, according to the World Health Organization. Last year, 34 cases were reported: 18 in Pakistan, 12 in Afghanistan and 4 in Nigeria. This year so far, 20 cases have been reported - 8 in Pakistan and 12 in Afghanistan, 4 of those in Shahwalikot alone.

All 4 new cases appeared in Taliban areas of control, health workers in Shahwalikot said. Dr. Sardar Wali, the district polio officer, said that while the Taliban had made access difficult, government forces had also disrupted his staff members' work, by raiding and burning one of their facilities last week.

"They detained a vaccinator and burned the center," Dr. Wali said. "In response, the Taliban banned the polio campaign in 11 zones under their control, and we do not know if they will allow the ongoing campaign."

Abdul Ghani, the district governor of Shahwalikot, confirmed that government forces had raided a polio center. He said the raid was carried out by Afghan commandos who did not explain themselves to his office. In the past, government forces have raided clinics on the suspicion that they treated insurgents.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, denied that the militants were denying access to health workers.

"Our policy, across the country, is that we have no issue with vaccinations, and we provide assistance," Mr. Mujahid said. "We completely deny that we have gotten in the way. In some areas, the local people have an issue with vaccinations - a mentality issue - and we have struggled to change that, too."

Mr. Mujahid said the Taliban had set conditions for the vaccination campaign, which they routinely communicated to health organizations. They include that the vaccinators be hired from within their area of control and that they not be accompanied by security forces, he said.

Polio workers often venture into areas rife with danger, particularly the risk of improvised roadside bombs.

[A 25 year old vaccinator], began his work Monday at 8 a.m. and kept on giving children drops until 5 p.m., taking a break for an hour to have lunch and offer prayers. His work was limited to the government-controlled areas of Shahwalikot, going door to door on foot once he had reached a village. "Working for the polio drive is exhausting, but I consider it a big service to help save a child from the incurable disease," He said.

He lamented that in many areas he had visited, there was a lack of awareness about the virus, and he said that people treated the health workers with suspicion. "You are putting yourself at risk, and the people are not cooperating with vaccinators," Mr. Ahad said. "They ask nonsensical questions: 'What is the benefit of the polio drive? Why are you coming here and the government is still fighting and not stopping night raids?' The villagers are in complete suspicion, and that is why it is so difficult."

[This report highlights the challenges confronting the polio eradication effort specifically and all vaccination activities generically in the more conservative zones in Afghanistan (and Pakistan). If in fact the Taliban have begun supporting the vaccination activities, there are years of distrust that have to be overcome from back when the Taliban were contributing to the rumors that scared parents away. Once rumors begin they are hard to counter as seen with resistance to measles vaccine in the Americas and Europe -- all based on fake news published by a disreputable former physician in the UK. - Mod.MPP]

Statement by Toby Lanzer, UN Humanitarian Coordinator: Polio vaccination in Shahwalikot [Shah Wali Kot] now crucial
Campaign to start on [Mon 18 Dec 2017]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The district of Shahwalikot in Afghanistan's Kandahar province has the highest number of polio cases of any district in the world, putting at risk hundreds of thousands of children. In the past days, yet another case of wild poliovirus was found. A polio vaccination campaign throughout the district is now more urgent than ever. The health authorities with support from UNICEF and WHO are to vaccinate thousands of children in the district starting on [Mon 18 Dec 2017].

International humanitarian law stipulates clear responsibilities for all parties to the conflict to facilitate the work of health workers, whether governmental or non-governmental, at all times. I call on the authorities and all people with influence, including the leaders of the communities in Shahwalikot, to ensure that this polio vaccination campaign takes place by helping health workers, facilitating their task, and protecting them and their supplies so that all children are protected against polio.

The outbreak of polio in Shahwalikot means that Afghanistan remains one of only 3 countries in the world that is still polio-endemic and polio eradication is at risk globally. This week's campaign in Kandahar is more important than ever. Together, with the support of all actors on the ground, we can help Afghans rid themselves once and for all of this terrible disease.

[There were 3 cases referred to from Shahwalikot that were reported during October and November (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). As mentioned above, the combined efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan may well be the "final stroke" to interrupt transmission of the WPV1 in the area (and thereby, hopefully, worldwide).

After preparing this for posting yesterday (18 Dec 2017), today's media had further notification of a 4th case reported in Shahwalikot last week (see section [3] above for details).

[5] declared polio-free

The World Health Organisation has declared Gabon a "polio-free country", given the lack of new reported or suspected cases in the central African country.

According to a WHO statement obtained by AFP on [Sat 16 Dec 2017], the UN health agency nonetheless recommended taking the necessary steps to continue monitoring for possible signs of the disease.

Gabon's Health Minister Denise Mekam'ne Edzidzie also urged families on [Sat 15 Dec 2017] to "continue to immunise children and prevent a resurgence of this disease."

Polio is a highly-infectious viral disease which mainly affects young children and can result in permanent paralysis. There is no cure and it can only be prevented through immunisation.

Cases of polio have decreased by 99 percent since 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries and 350 000 cases were recorded worldwide.

[Positive news as another country in Africa is declared polio-free. The most recent confirmed case of WPV associated disease in Gabon was reported in 2011 (https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx) when there was an outbreak associated with an importation from Angola (see ProMED post Poliomyelitis - worldwide (07): update 20110512.1462). Of note, reviewing the surveillance data available, since 2000, there has only been one confirmed WPV associated case in Gabon (in 2011), with "compatible" cases reported in 2000 (3 cases), 2001 (3 cases), and 2015 (3 cases).
