[The following information has been summarised from the data on the
above URL. - Mod.AS]

Since the initial detection of FMD in the Miyazaki Prefecture on 23
Apr 2010, the number of infected holdings (= outbreaks) has risen to
a total of 56, as of Sun 9 May 2010.

The outbreaks are located in 3 clusters: in Tsuno town (3 outbreaks,
including outbreaks No 1 and 5, the 2 1st outbreaks in Japan; see
comment), Kawaminami (about 3 km from Tsuno; 51 outbreaks) and Ebino
city (about 60 km west of the other 2 clusters; 2 outbreaks).

Out of the 56 outbreaks, 30 were cattle farms (dairy or beef), 25
were pig farms, and one was a mixed buffalo and pig farm (outbreak No 5).

The accumulated number of animals on the affected farms, as of 9 May
2010, is 4747 head of cattle and 59 607 pigs, a total 64 354 head.

[Japan's follow-up report No 3, submitted to the OIE on 5 May 2010,
included map showing the locations of the 2 main separate clusters;
see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9219>.
Its epidemiological comment says: "13 additional outbreaks were found
between 29 Apr and 5 May 2010. All affected farms are located in the
movement control areas established on 20 and 28 Apr 2010. Destruction
of animals in affected farms is ongoing."

The Japanese control policy is based on stamping out; the army has
been recruited to assist in the control activities.

The 1st clinical identification of the disease in Japan was done in
cattle, a species demonstrating pronounced clinical signs; but it may
be assumed that the disease started earlier, most probably in pigs by
the digestive route. This is partly based upon the identification of
the virus, on 23 Apr 2010, in buffaloes from a mixed farm (buffalo
and pigs) in Tsuno Town (outbreak No 5). Notably, this outbreak, No.
5, had started already on 26 Mar 2010 according to the official
Japanese report.

Japan is the world's major pork importer; according to FAO's
statistic data, it imported during 2007 (last available figures) pork
for the value of more than USD 3.4 billion. It will be interesting to
obtain data on the quantities of pork (not heat treated) imported
during 2010 from SE Asian sources.

Spread of the virus from pigs may take place, in addition to direct
and indirect contacts, also by aerosols. Wind borne spread of FMDV
serotype O was clearly demonstrated in the UK during the 1967/8 major
epizootic and confirmed experimentally. It was shown that pigs are
very prolific producers of the virus which, in given weather
conditions, can be windborne to long distances: from hundreds of
meters to several km or even more, while cattle are highly
susceptible for respiratory infection. - Mod.AS]
