Laboratory tests on samples collected in August have confirmed the presence
of the Marburg haemorrhagic fever virus in northeast DRC, a regional WHO
official told IRIN on Tuesday. "We have received three positive laboratory
tests" for Marburg, he said. The samples were collected from patients in
the Durba area of Province Orientale between 11-20 August. However, there
has been no laboratory confirmation of haemorrhagic fever among more recent
suspected patients, and there were currently no "active" cases reported
from the area, the official said. "The hypothesis is that the disease is
somehow endemic there," he said. "We are now considering sending a team to
proceed with further investigation," he added. Tests results from samples
collected by MSF in Durba earlier this month are still awaited.
In response to the laboratory confirmation of the presence of haemorrhagic
fever in northeastern DRC, Ugandan health authorities have recommended a
series of measures to prevent the possible spread of the disease into the
country, the OCHA report said. The recommendations of a national task force
include enhanced surveillance in the Arua and Nebbi areas, the
dissemination of guidelines for handling suspected cases and the provision
of protective clothing in border areas. The affected area of the DRC is
some 300 km from the Ugandan border.

[An investigation by collaborating teams from various countries will begin
investigating this outbreak/epidemic on 4 October if adequate preparations
can be made with respect to safety of the investigators and appropriateness
of the investigation. This is a dangerous situation, medically and
politically and we wish them well. Stay safe! - Mod.CHC
