BRUSSELS -- Gerard Kiely, the European Commission's agriculture spokesman
was cited as saying that the U.S. is using strongarm tactics to win
favorable trade treatment by banning imports of beef and live cattle, sheep
and goats from the EU, adding, "We seriously regret this decision because
it's not well-founded, and we had no prior warning of it."
Mr. Kiely went on to suggest that the U.S. had an "ulterior motive" for
imposing the ban last week, questioning whether the move was meant to
pressure the EU into exempting the U.S. from a proposed ban on certain
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics deemed at risk of harboring so-called mad-cow
disease because they are made with certain beef
byproducts. Mr. Kiely also cited U.S. criticism of the commission's
refusal to recommend EU ratification of a "veterinary equivalency" accord
with the U.S. until the U.S. offers more concessions on imports of animal
products from EU countries where a disease has broken out.
