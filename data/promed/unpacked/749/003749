The bluetongue [BT] epidemic is back in Sardinia and the 1st measures are being taken. Until 13 Nov 2022, animals can be transported in and out of the island only after negative results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for BT virus [BTV] serotype 3, as ordered this morning by the director of the Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety Service, Antonio Montisci. For Coldiretti Sardegna, the measure is "another heavy blow in particular in this case for the bovine sector, reservoir of the virus, and above all for the meat sector which has over 200 000 head and exports most of the calves for fattening beyond the Sardinian borders."

In case of positivity of even one animal, the movement will be blocked. Since 2000, BTV has appeared regularly on the island, this year [2022] with serotype 3 variant -- reports Coldiretti -- for which there is still no vaccine. So far, 108 outbreaks have been recorded on the island, with 30 200 animals involved, 872 cases, 692 with clinical symptoms, and 154 deaths. The most affected part of Sardinia is the southwestern area.

"A new blow for Sardinian animal husbandry: it will be necessary to assist the livestock more by integrating the feed," notes the president of Coldiretti Sardinia, Battista Cualbu. "And this applies both to animals affected by bluetongue and to those who suffer the consequences indirectly due to the prior PCR blocking of trade. This is combined with the prices of feed doubled as well as all other costs. The PCR itself will also weigh on farms' budgets, costing 25 euros [about USD 24.8] which will certainly increase."

[BTV was first reported in Sardinia in 2000 and has become endemic. A national surveillance plan for BTV was put in place in Italy in 2002, allowing periodic testing of sentinel animals. The 1st cases of BTV-3 on Italian territories were identified in late 2017, in Sicily. Its circulation in Sardinia was initially evidenced in sentinel animals located in the province of Sud Sardegna, in September 2018. The strain was demonstrated to be almost identical to the BTV-3 strain identified in Tunisia in 2016 and 2017. A similar scenario had been observed during earlier incursions of (other) BTV serotypes originating from Northern Africa into southern Europe and may be suspected for the current event.

Currently, Sardinia is declared endemically infected by BTV serotypes 1, 3, and 4, as illustrated in the EC Bluetongue map, presenting the BTV status of the Member States and their 'infected' and 'free' zones as of 28 Jul 2022, available at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-10/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map_0.pdf. While BTV-1 and 4 are shown as endemic in several EC Member States, BTV-3 is currently restricted to (southern) Sardinia. No inactivated BTV-3 vaccine has, so far, become commercially available. - Mod.AS
