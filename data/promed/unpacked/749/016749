[The Global "Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" monthly report is distributed by the UN Food & Agriculture Organization, FAO. The current report, covering October 2016, has been compiled by Dr Teresa Scicluna from the EuFMD STP programme. The guest editor of this report is Dr Jonathan Rushton, professor of animal health and food systems economics, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool. The report includes the following hitherto unpublished data on the diagnostic activities addressing the recent FMDV Asia 1 outbreak in Vladimir oblast, Russian Federation, declared resolved on 17 Nov 2016 (see 20161120.4642801). - Mod.AS]

Russian Federation
------------------
A FMD outbreak due to serotype Asia 1 occurred on 16 Oct 2016 on a mixed species farm of cattle, goat, sheep, and pigs in Vyshmanovo, Sobinsky, Vladimirskaya Oblast. Clinical cases were observed only in cattle. The FGBI-ARRIAH, OIE Reference Laboratory, rapidly confirmed the diagnosis on [19 Oct 2016], examining bovine samples using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antigen (Ag) detection ELISA and complement fixation test.

The summary of animals involved and location of outbreak are reported in Table 5 [see below] and Map 2 respectively [available at the source URL above]. No information on the source of infection was provided.

Control measures applied following the outbreak were movement control inside the country, disinfection, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, official destruction of animal products, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, zoning and emergency vaccination which is being carried out within a zone around the outbreak area where 17 666 cattle and 1332 small ruminants were vaccinated.

The previous outbreak of FMDV serotype Asia 1 in the Russian Federation was reported to the OIE in 2006 in Amurskaya Oblast, which is on the other side of the country.

Table 5. Summary of the animals involved in the FMD outbreak, that occurred on [16 Oct 2016] in Sobinsky, Russian Federation.
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 814 / 90 / 0 / 814 / 0
Sheep / 11 / 0 / 0 / 11 / 0
Swine / 54 / 0 / 0 / 54 / 0

The FGBI-ARRIAH examined 18 samples in which FMDV serotype Asia 1 was detected. These isolates were subjected to genotyping. Work is under way to study the antigenic relationship between field isolates and their relative FMDV vaccine strains. Studies on the immunological properties of the FMDV Asia 1 field isolates are also ongoing. The laboratory personnel were involved in the epidemiological investigations of FMD outbreaks. The same laboratory examined 8531 sera for post-vaccination monitoring.

The FGBI-ARRIAH provided support to the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation and to the Veterinary Services of the Russian Federation Subjects by respectively, supplying materials and technical advice. The same institution provided services and information for the 6th Meeting Cross Border Trade and TADs Risk Reduction, held [11-13 Oct 2016].

[According to the information above, isolates of the FMD Asia 1 virus strain from the affected farm "were subjected to genotyping". Results have not become available yet.

Further studies address, reportedly, the following 2 issues:
1. the antigenic relationship between the field isolates and their relative FMDV vaccine strains;
2. the immunological properties of the FMDV Asia 1 field isolates.

Both studies mentioned are suggestive of the view, expressed earlier, that the causative virus strain behind this event is suspected to have been a vaccine strain. Final detailed results and the route of introduction into the affected farm in Vyshmanovo are pending. - Mod.AS
