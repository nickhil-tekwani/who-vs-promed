Members of the public have been warned about the operation of rogue health officers at Nairobi City Hall who have been injecting travelers with water instead of the recommended yellow fever vaccine.

In a notice, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko sounded the alarm to city residents and Kenyans over the unscrupulus health officials. Sonko said that the officers are luring unsuspecting Kenyans with cheaper prices of Sh 1000 [USD 9.92] for the vaccine, which goes for around Sh 2500 [USD 24.79] in authorized health facilities.

"Members of the public are urged to be extra careful, as it has emerged that rogue county health personnel where yellow fever booklets/certificates are issued are not administering genuine yellow fever vaccine to residents," a public notice from the governor read.

"I won't allow any county staff to participate in any graft allegations; its unethical, and rules should be followed, especially when administering health services. I have directed the detectives to unearth the matter and those involved to be prosecuted. Members of the public are hereby notified to use our cashless platforms to pay and access services," [he stated].

There are 7 county employees believed to be involved in the scam who have since reportedly been arrested in a crackdown by city county authorities.

Earlier in the week, this writer went for a yellow fever jab at city hall and was asked to pay Sh 1200 [USD 11.90] to an Mpesa [municipal employee?] but to add Sh 1000 [USD 9.92] in cash. Upon demanding a receipt, he was dismissed[?] and informed that, "a person had bought the drugs [and] that was why he wanted the extra cash," and that is why there are no receipts for the extra money.

Kenyans traveling abroad are required to be vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine to prevent possible infection.

[Administration of fake yellow fever (YF) vaccine by health officials is alarming. Not only does this pose a risk to the individuals receiving the fake vaccine who might be exposed to YF virus and be unprotected, there is a risk to the general public should a viremic individual introduce the virus into an area where the vector mosquitoes are abundant enough to permit ongoing transmission of the virus. This also damages public confidence in health officials in general. Fortunately, the governor is aware of this situation, is taking steps to inform the public, and instructing the police to investigate and prosecute the offenders. - Mod.TY
