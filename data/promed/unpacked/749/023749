Sudan (Western Equatoria): suspected cases of acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 10 May 2004, WHO reported cases of acute hemorrhagic fever
syndrome in Hai-Cuba, Yambio, Western Equatoria Region, southern Sudan. A
rapid assessment team is in the field to investigate the situation.
Clinical samples have been collected and preliminary results are expected soon.

[This formal statement from WHO indicates that as yet there has been no
resolution of the disease situation in southern Sudan. Reports of a similar
outbreak in southern Sudan in May 2003 (see references below) similarly
appears to have remained unresolved. - Mod.CP]
