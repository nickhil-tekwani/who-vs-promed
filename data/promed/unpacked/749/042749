First record of bacterial canker caused by _oseudomonas syringae_ pv.
_syringae_, on apricot trees in Turkey
R Kotan (<recepkot@hotmail.com>, Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of
Agriculture, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey), F Sahin (as R
Kotan), Biotechnology Research and Application Center, Atatürk University,
25240 Erzurum, Turkey). Accepted for publication 18 Apr 2002
During the spring and summer of 1999 and 2001, a serious disease with
typical bacterial canker symptoms was observed on nearly 80 percent of
apricot trees (_Prunus armeniaca_ L.) grown in commercial orchards and home
gardens in the provinces of Erzurum, Erzincan, and Artvin in Turkey.
Initial characteristic symptoms were small water-soaked lesions on blossoms,
young expanding leaves and twigs. Subsequent development of the disease was
expressed as blossom blast, dried leaves attached to trees, twig dieback,
bark necrosis and trunk cankers.
A fluorescent, gram-negative bacterium was consistently isolated from
diseased tissues onto King's B medium. 33 bacterial strains [, ...] oxidase
and arginine dihydrolase negative, and levan positive [were isolated]. None
of these isolates utilised erythritol and DL-lactate as sole source carbon
(Jones et al., 1986). Fatty acid analysis of the isolates identified the
bacterium _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _syringae_ [Pss] with similarity
indices of 66-87 percent (Janse et al., 1992).
All isolates [induced] ... a hypersensitive response on tobacco plants (_Nic
otiana tabacum_ L. Samsun) (Klement, 1982). Pathogenicity of the strains was
confirmed by spray inoculating one year-old host twigs with 100 [million]
CFU/ml bacterial suspensions in sterile water (Sahin et al., 1999).
Inoculated and sterile-water-sprayed controls were maintained in the growth
chamber with 90 percent RH for 6-7 days at 24 degrees C (plus or minus 2
degrees). Symptoms similar to the original were observed on the inoculated
plants within 5-7 days. No symptoms developed on controls. Bacteria
reisolated from inoculated plants were identified as strains of Pss.
To our knowledge, this is the first record of the occurrence and outbreak of
a bacterial canker disease on apricot trees in Turkey.

[Bacterial canker of apricot is also referred to shoot die-back. The major
European producers are France, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Pss also infects
peach. In summer the bacterium persists latently on leaves and branches.
Infection usually occurs in cold humid conditions, penetrating through
wounds. Pss is spread by wind and rain. Copper sprays after leaf fall are
usually used in disease management although development of resistance to the
pathogen can be a consequence. A useful reference is the following:
