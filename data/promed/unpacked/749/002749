A woman has become the 7th person to be diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis (JE) in New South Wales (NSW). The woman in her 40s is from the Berrigan area in the Riverina region, NSW Health said on Wednesday [9 Mar 2022]. She was treated in hospital before being discharged and is recovering at home.

NSW Health is urging the community to stay vigilant and take precautions against mosquito bites. The virus is spread by mosquitoes and can infect animals and humans. The virus can't be transmitted between humans and can't be caught by eating pork or other pig products.

There is no specific treatment for JE, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases. The best thing people can do to protect themselves and their families against JE is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.

NSW Health recommends:
- Avoid the outdoors, bushland and wetlands at peak mosquito times -- dawn and dusk
- Wear long sleeves and pants, socks and shoes
- Use insecticides (e.g., permethrin)
- Use and reapply repellent (e.g., DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus)
- Use mosquito nets for children, and mosquito coils
- Empty and reduce all water-holding containers around your house.

[Transmission of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in eastern Australia continues with a 7th human case in New South Wales state. Iype Joseph (<iypejoseph@rgcb.res.in>) of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (Trivandrum, Kerala, India) submitted a comment stating that he had not found any reports about the tests they used to diagnose the patients. This is very important in this particular situation, as the disease is being reported from that area for the 1st time. He adds that if one uses antibody tests to diagnose (as is usually done in the clinical setup), due to flavivirus cross-reactions, the conclusions can be erroneous. ProMED would be interested in learning which tests are in use to diagnose JE virus infection.

This report and the previous ones comment that avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available currently in Australia. Recent reports indicate that the authorities are currently establishing the priorities for people to receive the JE vaccine and vaccination efforts will begin soon. - Mod.TY
