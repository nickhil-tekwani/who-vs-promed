[This is a transcript from a video that is found on the original
website. - Mod.TG]
Several cases of the mysterious Kunjin virus have been diagnosed
across at least 3 states.

Jessica Van Vonderen: And there's another potentially deadly virus
infecting horses. It's called Kunjin, a mosquitoborne virus with
terrible clinical signs. This year alone 6 Queensland horses have died
from the illness and recently 7 animals in South Australia were
euthanized. Simon Royal has this report.

Dr Liz Herbert, equine specialist: They are walking around and then
they just fall down. Their face gets these little fasciculations and
they are lifting their lips and they are kind of standing like that.

Kerry Rose, horse owner: He was pretty much lifeless and one mosquito
bite sent him down for 15 days.

Dr Lorna Melville, veterinary virologist: It is pathetic, really. It
is very, very sad and for the owners it must be heartbreaking to see
their animals in that sort of state.

Simon Royal: For the past 6 months, equine vet specialist Liz Herbert
has been at the centre of mysterious disease affecting horses. Sick
animals were being detected in Victoria, New South Wales, and in
Queensland. Then the 1st one here turned up in February [2011] at her
clinic on Adelaide's outskirts.

Mary Carr: When I 1st saw it, I thought I haven't seen anything like
this before. They had neurological signs and we needed to follow up
and find out what was going on.

Simon Royal: What was going on turned out to be Kunjin virus. It's a
member of the same family as Murray Valley encephalitis, and West Nile
and like them it is spread by mosquitoes. One of the 1st horses seen
was Kerry Rose's former racer, Money Asset.

Simon Royal: Money's story is much like that of the virus itself --
good news, bad news. Most infected horses do not get sick but when
they do, it can be a death sentence, as the virus attacks their brain
and nervous system.

Mary Carr: Weakness, muscle tremors, some of them have facial
paralysis they might have drooping lips or difficulty eating.

Simon Royal: The horse was so sick he couldn't stand for 2 weeks, so
the Roses made a sling. They moved the prostrate animal but still the
pressure sores came; they stayed with the horse constantly.

Kerry Rose: He was at the point where we had to make the decision
where we had to euthanize him; so she came up with a miracle cure.

Liz Herbert: I gave him this drug and my guess is that he was going
to get up anyway but the next day he got up and I am considered the
hero trust me it was just timing he was just ready to get up.

Simon Royal: It cost a lot of loot to make Money Asset well. When it
was over, they threw a party. For other horses, experts warn parties
may be premature. Kunjin won't cause the mass disruption of equine
influenza caused because it is not spread from horse to horse. And Liz
Herbert says it not as serious as Hendra because it doesn't spread
from horses to humans but she does fear an even bigger outbreak of
Kunjin when the mozzies season starts again. Primary Industries has
been using the lull to see how far the virus has spread: 1000 samples
of horse blood have been collected across South Australia in 3
months.

Mary Carr: The information that we are looking for from the survey is
to see how many horses are infected. Those horses are likely to have
antibodies or immunity which will protect them next season. But we
also need to see what percentage of horses have not been infected
which may infected by the virus next year.

Liz Herbert: My fear is that we will have more than apparently the
virus can replicate inside the mosquito. It doesn't even need a host.
It's here -- the mosquitoes are still here -- and then pick up and
then we should have more virus and more clinical signs and more sick
horses and probably more dead horses.

Simon Royal: But that's not the end of Kunjin's surprises. On the
weekend a Kunjin conference organized for vets was told by Darwin
veterinary virologist Lorna Melville that Kunjin is not new to
Australia.

Dr Lorna Melville, veterinary virologist: We have had Kunjin
basically forever as it's very common. If we take a random sample of
the horse population in the Northern Territory you will probably find
90 per cent of the horses up there have antibodies.

Simon Royal: What is new is scientists have isolated a small crucial
mutation in the virus found here.

Dr Lorna Melville: Well it basically means that this virus behaves
differently when it infects an animal. So the virus in the Northern
Territory when it infects an animal doesn't make them sick; well not
to any great degree, but when the viruses affects horses down here
with the local strain it has resulted in a lot of horses with severe
neurological signs and in a number of cases having to euthanized.

Simon Royal: And that last bizarre twist may in fact be Kunjin's
Achilles' heel. The vet says the mutated version is strikingly similar
to West Nile virus for which there is an effective vaccine in the
United States. It's hoped the same vaccine will also work against
Kunjin and the race is now on for Commonwealth authorities to make
sure it's safe to use in Australia before the mozzies return.

Dr Liz Herbert: My biggest hope is that we have the vaccine available
and that we are able to immunize the horses and keep the disease
away.

[It would have been helpful if the veterinarian had shared what drug
she gave the horse. That information may a play a role in the recovery
of other horses, or perhaps in triggering an immune response in the
face of the physiological consequences of this virus.

Let us hope the regulatory agencies are successful in importing the
US West Nile virus and that it is a good preventative.

Until recently, West Nile (WN) and Kunjin (KUN) viruses were
classified as distinct types in the Flavivirus genus. However, genetic
and antigenic studies on isolates of these 2 viruses indicate that the
relationship between them is more complex.

Kunjin (KUN) and West Nile (WN) viruses belong to the Japanese
encephalitis (JE) antigenic complex of the _Flavivirus_ genus in the
family Flaviviridae (1). The _Flavivirus_ genus comprises >70
antigenically related, positive-stranded RNA viruses (2,3). KUN and WN
viruses are maintained in a natural transmission cycle involving
mosquito vectors and bird reservoir hosts, with humans and horses
believed to be incidental hosts (4,5). Clinical symptoms (the work was
done in people) most commonly associated with infection with KUN and
WN viruses include febrile illness or mild encephalitis. WN virus has
been associated with fatal cases of acute meningoencephalitis and
fulminant hepatitis (6).
