Nigeria: Yellow Fever DREF Operation No MDRNG031 Final Report
-------------------------------------------------------------

SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) declared a Yellow Fever (YF) outbreak and activated a multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Centre for coordination of Yellow Fever response on 12 Nov 2020. The outbreak, which mainly affected the 3 states of Delta, Enugu and Bauchi, had already recorded a total of 222 suspected cases, 19 confirmed cases, and 76 deaths between 1 and 11 Nov 2020.

As of week 4 of 2021 [week ending 30 Jan 2021], the outbreak had escalated to 14 states -- Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Delta, Ebonyi, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, Kogi, Osun, Oyo, Plateau and Taraba. Most of the cases were males, with ages ranging from 1-55 years and presented with fever, headache, fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain, vomiting with or without blood, epistaxis, blood in stools/urine, convulsion, and unconsciousness.

In November 2020, the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) launched this DREF Operation with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) for CHF 139 033, to support health education, active case finding, vector control, community engagement, social mobilization for Yellow Fever mass vaccination campaign and psychosocial support in the 3 most-affected states (Bauchi, Enugu and Delta) based on the incidence of confirmed cases. In February 2021, an Operation Update was approved, allowing a 2-month no-cost timeframe extension of the operation. This was to enable the National Society to efficiently complete activities outlined in the EPoA and ensure effective delivery of operational objectives which were delayed as a result of the late transfer of funds to the National Society because the NRCS office was closed due to COVID-19 cases and for end of year holidays.

Yellow Fever (YF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease occurring in tropical regions of Africa and South America. YF is a completely vaccine-preventable disease.

[Additional cases of yellow fever (YF) after the week 4 2021 date cited in the above report have not been reported. The intensive vaccination campaigns appeared to have halted transmission in the 3 most affected states. The challenge for the Nigerian health officials will be to sustain vaccination efforts, probably by including the vaccine as part of routine childhood vaccination efforts. YF is endemic in the country in sylvatic (forest) and savannah ecosystems and represents an ongoing risk of spill-over into human populations. - Mod.TY
