Anthrax kills 8 in Indonesia
----------------------------
A total of 8 people died and 6 others were hospitalized after
consuming beef meat contaminated by anthrax in the Indonesian remote
island of Sumba, the local press said Friday.
The casualties have prompted the local government to isolate the Kodi
district in the impoverished East Nusa Tenggara province from cattle
traffic to prevent the spread of the animal-borne disease, reported
major national newspaper _Kompas_.
Laboratory tests have confirmed that the casualties and the ill
persons were positive for having anthrax, Deputy East Nusa Tenggara
Governor Frans Lebu Raya was quoted as saying. He said all cattle in
the area, about 1500 km east of Jakarta, have been vaccinated.
The Indonesian language newspaper gave no details about when the
incident occurred [see previous reports, noted below, for this
information], but the anthrax patients were still in the hospital
Thursday. The province has been declared vulnerable to anthrax since
1994, with more than 1150 cows infected in several regencies.

[This is merely an update on _The Jakarta Post_ report of 17 April
2007. At that time 5 had died and 12 others were undergoing
"intensive" treatment after showing symptoms. It would seem that 3
may have been released from hospital. - Mod.MHJ]
