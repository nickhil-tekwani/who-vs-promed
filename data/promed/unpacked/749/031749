Study reaffirms that H7N9 rarely spreads person to person
---------------------------------------------------------
A detailed epidemiologic study of the 1st 9 months of the H7N9 avian flu outbreak in China reinforces the image of the illness as one that rarely spreads from person to person but may possibly do so when there is prolonged, close contact between the sick and the healthy. The lengthy report published today [5 Feb 2014] by The New England Journal of Medicine covers 139 human H7N9 cases recorded through November 2013. All but 2 of the patients were hospitalized, and 47 (34 per cent) died. More than 80 per cent of the patients were exposed to animals, mostly poultry, before they got sick [ref: Li Q, Zhou L, Zhou M, et al. Epidemiology of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. N Engl J Med. 2014 Feb 6; 370(6): 520-32 (early online release); http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1304617].

Monitoring of close to 2700 contacts of the H7N9 patients turned up no additional cases, according to this report by a large team of mostly Chinese authors. However, they say person-to-person transmission might have occurred in 4 family clusters involving close contact. That conclusion is similar to what the World Health Organization said in May 2013, after the 1st wave of H7N9 cases subsided. The agency reported then that there had been 4 clusters of 2 or more case-patients who were in close contact, suggesting the possibility of limited human transmission.

This new report says an epidemiologic investigation was conducted for every confirmed H7N9 case, with the 1st 82 cases probed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the rest by local disease-control agencies. All but one of the cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or virus isolation; one was confirmed by serologic testing. Among the 139 cases identified, the median age of patients was 61, 71 per cent were male, and 73 per cent lived in urban areas. 58 patients (42 per cent) were 65 years or older, and just 4 (3 per cent) were children under age 5, all of whom had mild cases. Of patients with available information, 73 per cent had underlying medical conditions.

A 2 year old boy and a 25 year old woman were the only patients who avoided hospitalization. Of the 137 hospital patients, 125 had pneumonia or respiratory failure. For the 47 patients who died, the median duration of illness was 21 days -- which contrasts with a median of 11 days for fatal H5N1 cases in China, the authors report. Data on animal exposures were available for 131 of the 139 patients. Of these, 107 reported recent exposure to animals at live markets, including chickens (82 per cent), ducks (22 per cent), and swine (6 per cent). 9 patients worked with poultry, 6 of them at poultry markets. The authors say their findings add to the evidence suggesting that infected poultry are the source of H7N9 infection in patients who had poultry exposure, though this suspicion can't be verified without extensive testing of poultry. Other evidence for this link includes case-control studies and the observed drop in cases after live-poultry markets were closed last spring, they note.

The 4 family clusters described in the report include 2 in Shanghai, one in Jiangsu province, and one in Shandong province. The family groups affected included a father and 2 sons, a father and daughter, a married couple, and a father and son. In each instance the family members had prolonged, close, unprotected contact, such as eating together, providing care, and going to medical visits together, the report says. None of the secondary case-patients reported having any contact with animals before they got sick, and in the father-son cluster, neither patient reported any direct contact with poultry. The researchers observe that 3 of the clusters, excluding the married couple, involved blood relatives, adding, "Similar family clusters of H5N1 cases that occurred after common exposures to poultry or limited human-to-human transmission have been identified."

They also note that studies have shown that H7N9 viruses can bind to human receptors in both the upper and the lower respiratory tract, and that the pathogen can spread among ferrets via droplets. "These studies support the observation that limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus might occur," the authors comment.

The investigators also monitored 2675 contacts of the 139 case-patients, excluding secondary patients in the 4 family clusters. Of that total, 53 per cent were healthcare workers, 26 per cent were relatives, and 20 per cent were social contacts. As of [1 Dec 2014], all the contacts had been monitored for at least 7 days. 28 (1 per cent) of them experienced respiratory symptoms during the 7-day period, and PCR testing of throat swabs were negative for H7N9 in all 28 cases. These findings "suggest that the risk of secondary transmission of H7N9 virus, including to health care personnel, is low at this time," the report says. "However, in 4 family clusters, limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus could not be ruled out and may have occurred."

In other observations, the researchers comment that the age distribution among H7N9 patients is both older and wider than that among H5N1 patients in China, whereas the case-fatality ratio (CFR) for H7N9 (34 per cent) is lower than for H5N1 in China and globally. (The global CFR for H5N1 is roughly 60 per cent).

[This detailed analysis provides quantitative support for the prevailing conclusion that avian H7N9 influenza virus (in contrast to avian H5N1 influenza virus) is only rarely, if ever, transmitted from human to human. According to CIDRAP http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/infectious-disease-topics/avian-influenza-bird-flu: "Clusters of [H5N1] illness with at least two epidemiologically linked cases have been identified in 10 countries and have accounted for about 25% of all cases. Most clusters have involved two or three people and most have occurred among blood relatives; the largest cluster involved eight people (though the index case did not involve confirmatory tests). Persons involved in case clusters probably acquired infection from common-source exposures to poultry, but person-to-person transmission has occurred on occasions."

As a side issue, this analysis demonstrates that that the ability of avian influenza viruses to bind to human-type receptors in either/or both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts is a poor indicator of transmissibility. Likewise, spread of avian influenza virus among ferrets via droplet infection is a poor indicator of transmissibility in human hosts. - Mod.CP
