Kyrgyzstan: rabies becoming widespread in Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------------------------------
The main sources of deadly infection are now wild animals such as wolves
and foxes. According to the deputy chief of the Republic's
Quarantine-Requiring Infections Center, Tatyana Samsonova, wild animals
would approach inhabited places in their search for food. They attack
domestic animals, and domestic animals in their turn become spreaders of
infection.
For example, in Narin, rabid foxes had bitten 2 dogs, 3 cats, and several
sheep. In Batken 15 animals were identified as rabid, including wolves,
dogs, horses and cows.
In affected areas urgent preventive measures have been launched and human
vaccinations have begun. 1100 domestic animals and 11 wolves were shot.
[Presumably under a stray dog control programme. - Mod.MHJ] Supplies
of anti-rabies antibody preparations are still inadequate. The vaccines
that are available are provided free of charge. During 2004, 6 people died
from rabies in Kyrgyzstan.

I have studied the situation with rabies at your request. The main source
of rabies is wild animals: wolves and foxes. Homeless dogs, cats, and
probably rats, also play a role in the disease's epidemiology.
There have been 2 human deaths from rabies, both the result of animal
bite. One homeless man in Osh died from an animal bite, but nobody knows
what animal it was. The 2nd case was a woman in Suzak (Osh region, Southern
Kyrgyzstan). She was bitten by a dog, but didn't visit a doctor until
clinical signs appeared, at which point her status was severe and nothing
could be done to prevent her death. The dog was killed by her family
shortly after the attack.
In my opinion, In Kyrgyzstan -- as well as across the world -- natural and
focal rabies are increasing each year. Though farm animals are vaccinated
against rabies, the problem of wild animals spreading the disease remains.
The reasons are well-known: lack of vaccines and funds.
