At least one person has died of suspected pulmonary anthrax and about
8 people were affected with cutaneous anthrax in Zhemgang as of 15
Sep 2010, according to the officials of the national centre for
animal health (NCAH).

A total of 25 cattle, 8 horses/mules, 4 pigs and 6 cats were also
reported dead due to the anthrax outbreak.

According to the officials, the outbreak of anthrax in the dzongkhag
could have 1st occurred in a farmer's cattle herd in Bloktong village
in Panbang dungkhag. In the 2nd week of July 2010, dried meat from
farmer T's herd was taken to a village called Pongchaling to be
served to those carrying out construction work. A couple of weeks
later, a pig was reported dead at Pongchaling after having been fed the meat.

Later, a series of deaths occurred in his herd in Kagtong, where he
lost 7 cattle. The meat from dead cattle was also consumed and sold
to his neighbours. By then, T had developed lesions in the lower
region of his neck. Similar lesions developed in other people, who
were involved in dressing the carcasses. Some also reported swelling
of arms, legs and abdominal pain. Among others, one had complained of
heaviness in the chest with breathing difficulties and was taken to a
basic health unit. The person succumbed to the illness.

Officials recorded a 2nd outbreak on 25 Aug 2010 in villager RT's
herd in a Narang village. He lost 3 horses and 7 cattle.

On 28 Aug 2010, another outbreak occurred in SD's herd in Dophu
village, where he lost 4 of his cattle. The disease spread to more
herds, and the last was detected in Pongchaling village, where a
government JX breeding bull died.

The blood smears collected from the dead animals were examined at the
regional livestock development centre in Zhemgang and the national
centre for animals' health (NCAH). The findings, along with clinical
symptoms and history, indicated the disease to be anthrax. The
officials said the pigs were affected after being fed meat waste,
while cats were fed raw meat.

Upon visiting the area on 2 Aug 2010, a team from the regional
livestock development centre in Zhemgang conducted awareness meetings
among farmers; about 90 kg of dried meat was disposed of, and
in-contact animals were provided with [authorised] antibiotics.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease primarily of herbivorous animals,
although other mammals and some birds have been known to contract it,
and is caused by the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_. Humans generally
become infected directly or indirectly from affected animals or
occupational exposure to contaminated animal products. The officials
said the animals dying of anthrax should be buried at least 2 meters
deep after being covered with lime, or they should be incinerated.

[This appears to be a parallel report to that we posted on 7 Sep
2010, but this time with a more disorganised series of events
involving, possibly, the same farms, but in differently defined
locations. And now, there is one human death with what sounds like
pneumonic anthrax. It reads like what probably happened.
