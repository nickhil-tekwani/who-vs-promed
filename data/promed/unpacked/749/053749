More patients have skin disease; Number rises from 12 to 20
--------------------------------------------------
The number of patients infected with a rare skin disease at 2 acupuncture
clinics has jumped from 12 to 20, says Toronto's medical officer of health,
Dr. Sheila Basrur. "This infection is unsightly and annoying but not likely
fatal, unless you are severely immunosuppressed," Basrur said on Mon, 23
Dec 2002.
7 city health officers have been working full-time to reach the 130 who
received acupuncture treatment at the clinics on Bathurst St.in North York
[north of Toronto] and also in a private residence between April and
November 2002, she said. The patients are being told by Toronto Public
Health that they should get tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and a skin
infection due to _Mycobacterium abscessus_.
"We've now reached about 80 percent of them," Basrur said of the patients
who live in Toronto. She said she could not provide statistics for patients
who live outside the city. 87 live in Toronto, 25 in York Region, 8 in Peel
and the rest are scattered around southern Ontario, she said. The Clinic
operator could not be reached for comment.
The clinics were verbally ordered closed on 13 Dec 2002, and this was
followed up with a written order on 19 Dec 2002, Basrur said. The clinics
will remain closed until public health officers are convinced that proper
infection control practices are in place, she added.
A provincial government spokesperson said the Ministry of Health is moving
toward regulating Ontario's estimated 10 000 acupuncturists, but he said he
could give no estimate on when this will happen.
"There are definite plans for regulating acupuncture," Dave Jensen said
yesterday. "We're establishing an advisory committee.... I can't give you a
definite timetable, but we're moving forward with this. It'll take some
time because we want to do this right." The process was well in place when
news broke about the infections at the Toronto clinics, he said.
Meanwhile, established acupuncturists have levelled criticism at the
provincial government, saying they have been trying for years for some
minimum standards for training and regulation. Toronto acupuncturist Luheng
Han said patients in Greater Toronto get a false sense of security when
they see certificates on the walls of clinics stating that acupuncturists
have a "holistic licence."
"This is just a business licence," said Han, who studied acupuncture in
China, where it takes 4 to 5 years to become certified as an acupuncturist.

[_M. abscessus_ is one of a number of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTB)
known as rapid growers because they produce growth on solid media within 7
days. This organism is part of the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ complex and was
formerly known as _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_. Rapid growing NTB
are probably the most common mycobacteria to cause skin and subcutaneous
infections, which can be community-acquired from trauma or nosocomial.
Nosocomial outbreaks of infections due to these organisms are generally
related to subcutaneous injection with or wound contamination by nonsterile
water. Such events in relation to postinjection abscesses (1), wound
infections following open heart surgery (2), and augmentation mammaplasty
(3) are well described.
In a 1995-96 outbreak of _M. abscessus_ injection-related infections
reported in 1999 (4), 87 cases were associated with injection of an
unapproved medication. Of interest, the medication was reputed to be
adrenal cortical extract but was found to contain only hydrocortisone that
was prepared with unsterile water. A larger outbreak was reported from
Columbia in which 350 patients developed skin infections after receiving
injections from contaminated multidose vials (5). The current treatment of
choice for _M. abscessus_ infection is felt to be clarithromycin.
In this reported acupuncture-associated outbreak, little clinical or
epidemiological information is available. It is most likely, however, that
a contaminated aqueous solution, perhaps used on the acupuncture site, is
the source of the infection. The infection control procedures used in
these clinics are not elucidated, but if the acupuncture needles were not
single-use or adequately sterilized, a risk of blood-borne virus exists.
