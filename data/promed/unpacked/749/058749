Three New South Wales [NSW] residents have been bitten or scratched by bats carrying the potentially fatal lyssavirus -- one in the heart of Sydney. Four flying foxes have tested positive for lyssavirus this year [2014], 3 involving human contact. The Baird [NSW Premier Mike Baird] government will next week [week of 27 Oct 2014] announce its anti-bats package giving councils outside metropolitan areas extra powers to move on nuisance flying fox colonies.

Environment minister Rob Stokes said the "protection of human health is always our 1st principle. We will announce a plan to allow councils to receive approval for 5 years to do what it takes to protect the community," he said. Mr Stokes said after discussing the impact of flying foxes on fruit crops, he had made AUD 4 million [about USD 3.5 million] available for netting. The government will also allow farmers to shoot all types of bats to help disperse them.

His federal counterpart Greg Hunt last night [22 Oct 2014] backed a strong response to nuisance colonies and a one-stop shop is being finalised to help control bats. "Public safety must be a priority. We are well aware of the health concerns from large numbers of flying foxes, particularly when they are in residential areas," Mr Hunt said.

A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the 3 exposures Â­- occurred at Centennial Park (a wildlife worker), the Hunter (a veterinarian), and Albury (where a member of the public was exposed). In the past month, 32 people required rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following high-risk exposures to potentially infected animals. 5 had reported local bat exposures, while the remaining 27 people had animal bites or scratches while travelling overseas.

Communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said they were concerned about increasing bat exposure in the October-November birthing season, with people eager to rescue pups that have fallen from their mothers on to the ground. "So far this year [2014] we have had 3 people who were bitten or scratched by infected bats," she said.

Since lyssavirus was identified in the mid-1990s at Ballina on the north coast, there have been 3 human cases in Queensland where all have died. Less than one per cent of bats carry the disease.

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species.

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus, which is closely related to rabies virus. It was first identified in 1996, and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

Hopefully these control measures are restricted to urban areas and do not pose a conservation threat to these amazing animals. Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove a more effective preventive measure.
