Some 80 cases of sheep pox have been recorded in the province of Saida since last April [2016], according to a statement made by the Provincial Veterinary Inspection of Saida on Mon [4 Jul 2016].

Veterinary inspection services have detected these cases in 70 foci spread over the communes of Maamoura, Sidi Ahmed and Ouled Khaled.

"To cope with this zoonosis [sheep pox is not a zoonosis. - Mod.AB], 20 000 doses of anti-sheep-pox vaccine were acquired exceptionally to protect livestock," said the same official, who explained the occurrence of these cases by the marketing in Saida of livestock coming from other neighboring provinces.

The veterinary services have vaccinated to date 14 000 sheep head against sheep pox. Last year [2015], some 800 000 head were vaccinated, an operation that mobilized 30 veterinarians from public and private sectors. An annual sheep pox vaccination campaign is expected to be launched in early September 2016.

Saida province has 800 000 head of sheep according to the veterinary services of the province.

[The immunity conferred by a good anti-sheep pox & goat pox vaccine is strong and lasts well over a year. If, as announced in the present article, all the animals of the province of Saida were vaccinated in 2015, there should be no new outbreaks in 2016. At most, one could detect some erratic cases on sheep coming from other parts of the country and incubating the disease while being transferred to the province.

It is, therefore, surprising to record 70 outbreaks of the disease in one quarter only.

Information on the vaccine used and the conditions under which the Saida vaccination campaign is usually performed are welcomed and would be helpful to better understand the situation. - Mod.AB
