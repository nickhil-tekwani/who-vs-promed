Malaysia Has 5 Deaths From Hand, Foot, Mouth Disease
----------------------------------------------------------
Malaysia said another child in Sarawak died 2 days ago from hand, foot and
mouth disease, bringing the total since December 2005 to 5 [3 deaths were
reported a week ago, see: 20060305.0712. - Mod. RY], in an outbreak the health
ministry has called an epidemic.
2 of the deaths were caused by enterovirus 71, the more virulent type
of the group of [entero-] viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth
disease, the World Health Organization said today [11 Mar 2006],
citing a Malaysian health ministry statement. All 488 kindergartens
and 9 primary schools in Sarawak state, on the island of Borneo, are
closed for 2 weeks, the WHO said.
Sarawak is trying to prevent a repeat of 1997, when 31 children died
from the disease, Ramlee Rahmat, director of disease control at the
health ministry, said by telephone yesterday [10 Mar 2006].
The nation of 26 million people is speeding up efforts to contain the
disease, which Ramlee said had infected 3269 children in Sarawak as
of 8 Mar 2006. That's more than 10 times the number of cases last
year [2005], he said. The cases tend to increase from February to
June [the HFMD seasonal epidemic pattern is slightly different
depending on geographic location, see also: 20060308.0744. - Mod.
RY], according to the Sarawak government's website.
"We hope to be able to contain the disease in 7 days, which is the
incubation period," Ramlee said. Hand, foot and mouth disease "is
endemic in Malaysia."
Should the number of cases continue to increase in Sarawak, the
education department will order the immediate closure of all primary
schools for 14 days, the Sarawak government said on its website.
Malaysia has outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth illness, characterized
by fever, mouth sores and blisters, about every 3 years, Ramlee said.
Sarawak had 2113 cases in 2003, and 3560 in 2000, according to the
website.
The disease is common in children, and in most cases, sufferers
recover without medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. The illness is
unrelated to foot and mouth disease found among cattle, sheep, and
swine. The enterovirus group includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses,
echoviruses and other enteroviruses.
Sarawak is reporting as many as 200 cases of hand, foot and mouth
disease daily, lower than an initial 300, the Star newspaper reported
on 7 Mar 2006, citing Health Minister Chua Soi Lek. The state has a
population of 2.18 million, according to the Sarawak government's
website.
The disease "has reached epidemic levels in Sarawak because of the
unusually sharp increase in the number of cases within such a short
period of time," Yap Soo Kian, press secretary to the health
minister, said in an interview.

Malaysia declared that an outbreak of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in
the eastern state of Sarawak has escalated into an epidemic, with
some 200 cases being reported daily.
Health Minister Chua Soi Lek said the disease had reached epidemic
proportions "because of the increase in the number of cases in the
beginning of this year [2006]."
State health officials have recorded a total of 3087 cases since 1
Jan 2006. The disease is spread by poor hygiene and causes fever,
rashes and painful blisters in the mouth and on the hands and feet.
All kindergartens in the state have been shut down to prevent the
spread of the disease, and hospitals are on alert to treat and
isolate people, Chua said.
"All the hospitals, especially in towns like Miri and Kuching and
Sibu, where it's the worst, the hospitals have to be ready for
isolations. We usually put them in isolation wards because it spreads
very fast," he told AFP.
Chua said authorities were on the lookout for outbreaks in the rest
of Malaysia, where it is endemic, and a public awareness campaign
would soon be launched.
"We have to go on a big information drive to make the people more
aware of the problem," said Chua, who sharply criticized
kindergartens that continue to remain open in Sarawak.
"The mentality is that if the school is not affected, then why should
they close down," he said, dismissing the offenders as
"profit-oriented."
Sarawak suffered outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in 1997,
2000 and 2003 in what officials say is a 3-year cycle. The 1997
outbreak killed 31 people.
Chua said the government was investigating why the disease was
rearing its head so regularly.
