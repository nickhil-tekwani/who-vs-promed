James S Porterfield Prize in International Virology 2012
--------------------------------------------------------
Closing date: 13 Jan 2012.

This prize (GBP 600) [about USD 1000] is to be awarded by open
competition to up to 2 students of virology registered for a degree at
any University worldwide.

The prize can contribute towards the costs of travel, subsistence,

research to be conducted by the student at an institution and in a
country other than their own. Prizewinners will be required to submit
a report of their work to the panel by 31 Dec 2012.

The criteria for award will be the academic promise of the student,

student's scientific education.

Eligible projects will be those in virology that require international
travel, and preference will be given for field or laboratory work on
arboviruses.
