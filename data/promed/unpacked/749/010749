Outbreak of mumps infects 106 persons in GIrona
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of mumps affecting 106 people in Girona [northern Spain] has been ongoing since December 2011 and up through the present is still continuing. In response to this outbreak, the Health Advisory Group of the Ministry has recommended that all individuals vaccinated with the triple vaccine [MMR] between 1994 and 1996 return for repeat vaccination. According to one report the Primary Care Centers in Girona reported 3 cases of mumps in the second half of December 2011, with further cases appearing during January, February and March 2012. The 106 identified cases all recovered without incident. The communities with the highest number of reported cases are Girones, Baix Emporda and Selva, although there have been cases in other communities of the region. The Health Council recommends the revaccination strategy as a means of controlling the outbreak and preventing further cases. The rationale for the revaccination is that between 1994 and 1996 vaccination was done using the triple vaccine [MMR] which contained the Rubini strain of mumps virus. The primary health care centers that have received the doses of vaccines are informing those individuals who should be receiving the vaccine. 50 percent of the identified cases in the Girona area are youths between the ages of 16 and 18 years, although the age range for mumps cases include individuals from adolescents through adults, ages 17 to 42 years.

[The mumps virus component of the triple MMR vaccine has been the weakest component of the triple MMR vaccine, tending to induce weaker and less persistent immune responses than the measles and rubella virus components. Different attenuated strains of mumps virus have served as the mumps component of the MMR triple vaccine at various times in the past. The Rubini strain was the mumps component of the MMR vaccine used in Spain previously, and may have been a less effective immunogen. Other strains used in the past, such as the Urabe strain, were latter withdrawn due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis. The Jeryl Lynn strain is now the mumps virus component favoured in most MMR vaccines, although later this strain was found to comprise two distinguishable substrains, JL1 and JL2. The JL1 strain was preferentially selected by propagation in Vero and chick embryo fibroblast cell cultures, whereas the JL2 strain was preferentially selected by passage in embryonated chicken eggs. Consequently differently produced MMR virus vaccines may differ in this respect. It remains to be seen whether the revaccination strategy involving deployment of a currently available MMR vaccine will provide better protect of the adolescent population.
