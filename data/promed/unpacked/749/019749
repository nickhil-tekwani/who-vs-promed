SMALLPOX, HUMAN REMAINS, LIKELIHOOD (02)
========================================

[see
Smallpox, human remains, likelihood: RFI 970305134937]
I agree with Frank [Fenner's comments to E. Vardas' message, comments that
can be found as a footnote to that message]. I would like to know the
environmental temperature and conditions under which the bodies have remained.
1. There is a paper showing that infected scabs containing 2.8 x 10 trillion
plauq-forming units per gram became negative on culture [were not shown to
contain virus] at nine weeks when kept at room temperature (25.8C to 26.4C)
and 85-90% relative humidity (Huq F. Effect of temperature and relative
humidity on variola virus in crusts. Bull WHO. 1976; 54:710-12).
2. Interesting also is the tale of stored smallpox scabs [that had been]
collected by variolators (persons who took scabs of smallpox patients and
inserted them into the skin or nose of healthy persons to elicit protection
against smallpox) who collected scabs from smallpox patients in Afghanistan,
Ethiopia and Pakistan between 1969 and 1976. Forty one of 45 samples failed
to yield variola virus on culture. Of the four positives, two had been
collected from patients within the preceding nine months; the interval was
unknown for the other two. Interviews with the variolators indicated that
they rarely found it possible to retain viable material for more than a year
and none considered material collected more than two years before to be
effective. A discussion of this and related issues is in Breman J and Arita
I (The confirmation and maintenance of smallpox eradication, New England
Journal of Medicine. 1980; 303:1263-73).
3. To assuage public [South African] concern, it would be useful to collect
specimens from the exhumed bodies for various virological analyses. A record
of environmental conditions [under which the bodies had been stored] is
needed. I would advise those taking and dealing with the specimens to be
successfully vaccinated against smallpox.

[So, Frank Fenner thinks the risks "are vanishingly remote" and Joel Breman
agrees but suggests vaccination against smallpox. Our readers should realize
that Drs. Fenner and Breman are two of the world's experts on this and other
viruses. They are writing in their usual, scientifically appropriate, very
conservative style. Joel's suggestion of vaccination is intended (I have
communicated with him about this) to assuage any fear or public concern about
digging up this cemetery, not because he sees any real threat to either the
workers or the population at large. Should one or more worker become ill
within a week or three of exhuming the graves and taking specimens, prior
successful vaccination will neutralize any such public fears and
unequivocally rule out smallpox. Not only is the rate of adverse events
after smallpox vaccination very low but I have been assured by other sources
that there already are laboratory workers in South Africa who have been
vaccinated against and are immune to smallpox.
Joel concluded a message to me by saying: "While there may be other opinions,
to me this is the best way to enlist public support and maintain credibility
that smallpox is gone and will not reappear from graveyards or elsewhere."
Fair enough. Let's leave the rest of this to the South Africans.-- Mod CHC]
