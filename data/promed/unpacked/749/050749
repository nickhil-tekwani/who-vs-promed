12 people affected by anthrax in Orissa
---------------------------------------
At least 12 people were suffering from anthrax after they ate raw beef at
Pindapathar village in Sundargarh district of Orissa. Of the affected, the
condition of 4 was stated to be critical at Sundargarh district
headquarters hospital, official sources said. The villagers fell ill after
eating the [meat] of the a dead cow last week, sources said.

A team of government doctors from the hospital and paramedics have set up
camps in the villages of the area. Door to door medical check-ups were
being conducted and the tribals were being told not to eat raw meat of dead
domestic animals.

A similar report of anthrax outbreak was reported 3 months ago at Kiralaga,
Raipur, and Suidih villages in the same block in which 9 people contracted
the disease, Dr RN Barla, a government doctor in the team, said.

[Searching Google using the terms "anthrax" and "Orissa" yields multiple
reports from the Indian press, which reflects the picture we have been
getting of repeated outbreaks. For example, in 2008 Sundargarh was
similarly afflicted; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080608.1826. It is clear
that this disease, especially in the tribal areas but presumably throughout
the state, is a significant livestock and public health problem and overdue
for a properly structured proactive control programme.
