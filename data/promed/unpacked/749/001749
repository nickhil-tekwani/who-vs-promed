Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 16 Mar 2006.
On 1 Apr 2006, the animals of the last infected
flock were culled and buried. Since that date, no
further cases of highly pathogenic avian
influenza subtype H5N1 have been diagnosed in
Israel. The restrictions will be lifted on 8 Jun 2006.
The cleaning and disinfection of infected
holdings and all the holdings within the
3-km-radius zone were completed on 1 May 2006.
After the cleaning and disinfection of all the
empty holdings, 30 days will elapse before
repopulation in the protection zone. On 22 Apr
2006, the first holding was repopulated in a surveillance zone.
In total 1 120 000 birds in 53 commercial farms
were destroyed in 15 localities within 9 days.
Pits were dug 6 metres deep on each of the sites.
None of the destroyed birds were moved from the
premises. Nylon sheets were placed on the bottom
and sides of the pits. After finishing the
disposal of the dead birds, the pits were covered with lime and closed.
In order to guarantee compliance with the
Veterinary Servicesï¿½estrictions, agriculture
inspectors and police surrounded the 10-km zones
and monitored vehicle movements around the clock.
A few attempts were made to violate the restrictions, but were stopped.
An epidemiological investigation was undertaken
to determine the index case and the mode of
spread of the disease. Personnel, vehicle and
equipment movements to and from the infected
holdings were thoroughly investigated. Any
possible contacts originating in the infected
premises were checked and observed for any possible transmission of the virus.
All farmers immediately received compensation
amounting to 100 of the estimated direct damage.
Indirect damage will be assessed and compensation paid to the farmers.
