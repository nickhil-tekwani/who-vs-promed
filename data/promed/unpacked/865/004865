Cowpox in Europe, additional information
----------------------------------------
As the Moderator correctly pointed out [in ProMED-mail Cowpox,
rodents, human - Germany, France ex Czech Rep. 20090225.0786], cowpox
virus is found widely in Europe and east of Europe.

In the rodent-borne viruses (ROBO) part of the EDEN project (Emerging
Diseases in a Changing European Environment, a large interdisciplinary
project funded by the European Union), we have widely screened for
cowpox virus in wild rodents in Europe, and it is common in many
rodent species all over Europe. Cowpox virus infection from wild
rodents can take place anywhere in Europe.

After the termination of smallpox vaccination around 1980, young age
cohorts have become susceptible to cowpox virus infection. It is good
to remember that, unlike many other rodent-borne viruses, cowpox virus
is a DNA virus; therefore, even though high seroprevalences are often
found in rodent populations, the viremia and shedding period is
relatively short, only 2-3 weeks. Consequently, the transmission
dynamics of cowpox differ from those of other common rodent-borne
viruses like hantaviruses and arenaviruses, which are RNA viruses, and
cause persistent infections in rodents with longer shedding period
than cowpox virus.

It is typical that high seroprevalence sites of cowpox virus in
rodents change from one year to another. Detailed ecological studies
on cowpox virus have been performed, for example, in the UK by M
Begon's and X Lambin's teams in Liverpool and Aberdeen Universities.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Henttonen for provision of this
additional information and for drawing attention to the EDEN project
(Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment), details of
which can be obtained at <http://www.eden-fp6project.net/>.

It may be that the short period of viremia and shedding
characteristic of DNA-containing viruses such as cowpox virus is
responsible for the divergence of opinion regarding the presence of
cowpox virus infection in Czech Republic rodents. However, the
disputed evidence concerns the presence of cowpox virus in rodents
bred in captivity, and not rodents in their natural environment. -
