A 3rd property in Colorado has been confirmed with vesicular stomatitis, according to the state's department of agriculture. The latest property is in Boulder County and is now under quarantine. The number of horses affected has not been disclosed. The department said several other premises surrounding the Boulder County property are being investigated for cases.

The announcement follows confirmation last week [week ending 20 Jul 2014] of 4 horses with the disease on 2 Weld County properties; 3 of the affected horses were on one property and one on the other.

Colorado is the 2nd state, after Texas, to report cases of the disease this year [2014]. In all -- excluding the latest Boulder County report -- there have been 15 horses and 2 cattle across the 2 states diagnosed with the disease, according to the latest update from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, part of the US Department of Agriculture. All cases confirmed by the agency so far involve the New Jersey serotype.

Vesicular stomatitis [VS] can be painful for animals and costly to their owners. The virus typically causes oral blisters and sores that can be painful, causing difficulty in eating and drinking. Equids, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids are all susceptible to the disease.

Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats, and above the hooves of affected livestock -- symptoms similar to those of foot and mouth disease. Vesicles are usually seen only early in the course of the disease. The transmission of VS is not completely understood, but components include insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and livestock movement.

While rare, human cases can occur, usually among those who handle infected animals. In humans the disease can cause flu-like symptoms and only rarely includes lesions or blisters.

Authorities say that veterinarians and livestock owners who suspect an animal could have VS or any other vesicular disease should immediately contact state or federal animal health authorities. Livestock with clinical signs of the disease are isolated until they are healed and determined to be of no further threat for disease spread. There are no vaccines approved by the US Department of Agriculture for VS.

Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease. Authorities also recommend against transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools or health care equipment between herds.

[To find Boulder County in Colorado, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/colorado_90.jpg -- it is just north west of Denver and at the south west corner of Weld County. The proximity of the 2 affected Colorado counties must make one suspicious of other affected premises in the river drainage of the South Platte River in that part of Colorado.

The above article has an outstanding photograph of an affected horse's tongue. You are strongly recommended to look at it, and then keep it in mind for as and when you might see a VS case yourself. - Mod.MHJ
