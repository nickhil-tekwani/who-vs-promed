Bali allots funds for anti-rabies vaccines
------------------------------------------
Anticipating an increase of rabies cases in Bali throughout 2011, the
Bali Health Agency promised to allocate Rp 13 billion (USD 1.44
million) to procure anti-rabies vaccines for humans, an official said.

The budget would be provided from the provincial and regency
administrations' coffers, agency head Nyoman Sutarga said. "The
province will disburse Rp 7.5 billion and the regency administrations
will provide the remaining Rp 5.4 billion to procure 36 000 vials of
anti-rabies vaccines," Suteja said at Sanglah Central Hospital. The
current stockpile of 70 000 vials are still sufficient until April
this year [2011], he said, adding "We will only use the Rp 13 billion
after we run out of stocks."

Despite the ongoing vaccination drive and efforts to stockpile
anti-rabies vaccines, the infection still continues to claim more
lives. Since the outbreak began in late 2008, continuing through the
end of 2010, 107 people have died of the infection, with the number
of fatalities increasing dramatically every year.

Rabies claimed 4 lives in Bali in 2008, and another 28 in 2009. Last
year [2010], the number of victims soared to 75. The epidemic
infected only a few villages in a regency in South Bali during its
initial stages. Presently, the epidemic has spread to hundreds of
villages located in all the island's 8 regencies and one city.

Most victims failed to receive immediate and proper medical treatment
after being bitten by infectious dogs, mainly due to difficult access
from their remote villages to hospitals capable of providing the
vaccine. The low level of public awareness on post-bite treatment has
also led to many bite victims' unwillingness to seek proper medical treatment.

Some hospitals in certain regencies reportedly have run out of
vaccine stocks, but Suteja said the problem was due to the lack of
coordination between the hospitals and designated rabies centers.
"It's a problem of coordination. In fact, the stocks of vaccines in
every regency hospitals are still safe," he said.

The Bali administration is set to allocate a total of Rp 48 billion
to handle rabies cases, including procuring vaccines for dogs and
culling street dogs. The central government and the provincial
administration have campaigned that the resort island would be free
from rabies by 2012.

To help cope with the rising number of cases, the local
administration is working together with non-government organizations
to vaccinate at least 70 percent of the island's estimated 500 000 dogs.

Local Udayana University scientists have introduced the use of
intradermal rabies vaccinations to more effectively combat the
life-threatening disease. The vaccination is proven to be capable of
giving a quicker and more protective antibody response as compared to
the conventional intramuscular method.

[Merritt Clifton has appended the following commentary on the current
situation in Bali. "The Jakarta Post has given the total number of
officially recognized human rabies deaths as 107, and on the same
day 2 more deaths were announced in Balinese media, bringing the
official total to 109. The total number of human rabies deaths,
including 20-plus that have reportedly occurred outside of hospitals
in remote villages, remains in the apparent range of 130-140.

"The most recent cases involved exposure reportedly occurring
approximately 3 months ago, i.e. toward the end of September or early
October 2010. The 12 most recent cases before these 2 also involved
exposure reportedly occurring in September [2010] or earlier.

"This may indicate that the effort to vaccinate all the dogs in Bali,
coordinated by the Bali Animal Welfare Association and funded by the
World Society for the Protection of Animals, is beginning to contain
the outbreak."

An increased availability of anti-rabies vaccine for post exposure
treatment of humans may enable human rabies to be eliminated by 2012
as planned, but achieving the complete eradication of rabies from the
animal population may be more challenging.
