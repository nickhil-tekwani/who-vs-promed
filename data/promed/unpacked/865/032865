A passenger en route from Havana, Cuba to Spain arrived at Miami
International Airport last week suffering from vision problems. He left
the airport to consult with an ophthalmologist in the city. After being
diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic viral conjunctivitis, the man returned to
the airport and departed for Spain. The doctor said that Cuban health
officials told him that as many as 12,000 Cubans have been treated for the
malady this year.
