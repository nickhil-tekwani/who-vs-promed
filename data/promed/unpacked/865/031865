From: Stephen A. Berger, M.D. <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following background data on visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil were
abstracted from the GIDEON software program:
Brazil accounts for over 90% of cases in the New World. The disease was
first described in 1934 and first reported from Rio de Janeiro state in
1977.
Ninety percent of cases are reported from the north (mouth of Amazon) and
eastern regions. The disease is endemic to Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Espirito
Santo, Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para, Paraiba,
Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Roraima and Sergipe.
20,191 cases were reported prior to 1990 (2,000 of these in 1984, 2511 in
1985, and 834 in 1988).
316 cases were reported from Natal during 1989 to 1993;
Piaui and Maranhao reported 1400 cases in 1994 (over 50% of Brazilian
cases).
Nine percent of volunteer blood donors and 37% of multiply-transfused
hemodialysis patients from Natal (Rio Grande do Norte) are seropositive
(1994 to 1996).
25 cases of HIV-Leishmania coinfection were reported to November 1995.
The etiologic agent is _Leishmania chagasi_, and the local vector is
_Lutzomyia longipalpis_. _Lu. forattinii_ has also been implicated in Mato
Grosso do Sul.
