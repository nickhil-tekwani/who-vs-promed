News of the response
Press conference in Beni
------------------------
- The coordinator of the response, Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, held a press conference this Mon 22 Oct 2018 in Beni. He reviewed several important developments in the epidemiological situation in Beni, community involvement, the impact of community resistance, dignified and safe burial (DSB), the security situation, and the meeting of the Committee of Experts. Emergency for the International Health Regulations (IHR).
- He recalled the importance for the population to respect the hygiene and precautionary measures recommended by the health authorities. He regrets the fact that the public continues to put themselves in danger despite the many tips they receive daily to protect themselves against Ebola. He gave the example of young people from a neighborhood in Beni who stole the body of a lady who died of Ebola on her way to the cemetery in agreement with her family. After manipulating the body, one of the youths became infected, became ill and recently died.
- The response coordinator also took the opportunity to ask the different health structures to strictly observe hygiene measures, especially the use of single-use equipment. This recommendation is of paramount importance because the sharp increase in cases confirmed, with a majority of children, in Beni was caused by non-compliance with the measures of prevention and infection control in "tradimodern" structures (between traditional medicine and modern medicine). The majority of the last confirmed cases in the city were infected by Ebola while they were at these health facilities which became the main factor of amplification of the epidemic.
- In order to be able to respond more quickly to DSB alerts within the community, he said WHO had started the training of 8 additional teams within the civil protection of Beni. In addition, to addressing the concern of families complaining of the delay in waiting for results after a community death, the coordination team decided to start using the rapid tests during the raids in the community to have preliminary results instantly.
- Dr Bathe also mentioned the risks run by the response agents. He obviously mentioned the deaths of 2 health workers of the rapid intervention medical unit in Butembo, but he said that the physical attacks of the teams are common. On average, the teams of the response are attacked by the population and sometimes injured, 3 to 4 times a week. This is the 1st time that our health workers, both locally and nationally, are facing so much violence in an Ebola response. He also stressed that the response time of the teams depends on the security situation because before deploying the teams in the field, a preliminary analysis of the security situation is necessary.

Vaccination
-----------
- No vaccination activity in Beni this Sun 21 Oct 2018.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 20 849 people have been vaccinated , including 9823 in Beni [North Kivu], 4391 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1672 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1145 in Butembo [North Kivu], 690 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], 105 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], and 50 in Mutwanga [North Kivu].

[There are a number of important points raised in the press conference:
The spread of rumors by the community that have no basis in scientific fact, such as those that led to theft of the body of a lady who died of Ebola on her way to the cemetery in agreement with her family, and not mentioned but a separate incident where the body of a fatal case of Ebola was unearthed after burial, is unfortunate. The best way to prevent such incidents is through enlisting respected community members to talk with the community and educate them on how to take personal responsibility to try to end the outbreak.

Children becoming infected as a result of re-use of single use equipment is inexcusable, whether it is a consequence of lack of knowledge of the inherent problem or carelessness. However, it may be there is insufficient equipment available to meet the needs of the health centers, which would be a major problem and should be addressed. The fact that it is occurring in traditional/modern medicine healthcare facilities makes it even more problematic as infections can spread rapidly in such settings.

The violence enacted against civilians and healthcare workers as well, where they are sometimes injured by the population, 3 to 4 times a week, is horrendous. Here are innocent people and workers trying to help end the outbreak to the benefit of the community, being attacked. There must be a way to improve security.

Implementation of rapid testing would be a positive step to yield results quickly in order to respond appropriately. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 22 Oct 2018. DRC - Ebola outbreak grows by 10 cases amid more attacks
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/drc-ebola-outbreak-grows-10-cases-amid-more-attacks
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Once again Beni, the epicenter of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) ongoing Ebola outbreak, was the site of rebel violence against both civilians and military members over the weekend as DRC officials confirmed 10 more Ebola cases, including 6 deaths in North Kivu province.

There are now 237 cases, including 153 fatalities, in this outbreak. In addition, 33 suspected cases are under investigation. 8 of the new cases are in Beni, a city of more than 200 000 people, including 5 of the fatal cases. And, of the 237 total cases, 202 have been confirmed.

Deaths, abductions in Beni
--------------------------
According to a report from Voice of America (VOA), Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Congolese army personnel and several neighborhoods in Beni on [Sat 20 Oct 2018] and into [Sun 21 Oct 2018]. At least a dozen civilians were killed, and 12 children abducted in the Rwenzori neighborhood. On [Sun 21 Oct 2018] people took to the streets to protest the growing violence.

"All immunization and awareness activities were suspended this [Sun 21 Oct 2018]," DRC officials said in their daily report yesterday [21 Oct 2018]. "Community monitoring activities have been slow and have been done by telephone."

In a separate attack, 2 medical workers with the Congolese army were shot dead by Mai-Mai militiamen from the Vulindi entry point, located at the entrance of the city of Butembo, the DRC health ministry said in an update on 20 Oct 2018.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the health minister of the DRC, said in the 20 Oct 2018 update, "It is a dark day for all the teams of the response that sometimes put their lives in danger in the service of the Nation. Health workers are not a target for armed groups."

Violence could slow response again
----------------------------------
Last month [September 2018], an attack in Beni suspended outbreak response efforts for almost a week, which enabled several transmission chains to go undetected. The lapse in surveillance caused a 2nd wave of the virus that is still wreaking havoc in Beni and Butembo.

"This latest attack is the 10th major incident of insecurity in or around Beni the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in the past 2 months. A double tragedy for the civilians there as it will be very hard to stop the outbreak if this violence continues," said Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, on Twitter.

Also over the weekend [20-21 Oct 2018], the DRC health ministry said that 22 young people in Butembo dug up the body of an Ebola patient and opened the body bag to make sure that no organs had been taken from the body, which is a rumor plaguing some neighborhoods in that city.

The ministry said the young people touched highly infectious bodily fluids, likely exposing themselves to Ebola. All 22 people agreed to get vaccinated.

As of yesterday [21 Oct 2018], more than 20 000 people in the DRC had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, including 9823 in Beni and 1085 in Butembo.

EU releases more money for outbreak
-----------------------------------
Today [22 Oct 2018] the European Union (EU) announced it was releasing Euro 7.2 million (USD 8.25 million) more to the DRC to fight the outbreak, bringing the total EU response to Euro 12.83 million (USD 14.7 million) in 2018.

"Overall EU support includes technical expertise, humanitarian air service, research funding, and humanitarian assistance," said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides in a press release.

"We are working closely with the World Health Organisation and the national authorities to fight the disease. We are not letting our guard down and we will continue our support for as long as it takes."

[The CIDRAP summaries come out a little after the original reports which can be found in earlier ProMED posts, but they pull together the more significant events of the week and are therefore worth reading.

What is new is that the EU is releasing more financial support to combat Ebola virus in this current outbreak in collaboration with the WHO and national authorities. This money is very much needed, thus this news is very welcome. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 22 Oct 2018. Ebola in DR Congo: UN chief 'outraged' by recent killings of civilians and health workers
[UN News, edited]
https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/10/1023792

The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres said on [Mon 22 Oct 2018] he is "outraged by the continued killing and abduction of civilians by armed groups" near Beni, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s North Kivu region, which has been grappling with an Ebola outbreak since August [2018].

Mr Guterres condemned [Sat 20 Oct 2018] attack in the town of Mayongose on the outskirts of Beni [North Kivu], in which at least 11 civilians were killed, and several more were injured and abducted. He said he is also "deeply troubled" by reports that on [Fri 19 Oct 2018], 2 Congolese health workers helping to combat the Ebola outbreak, were killed in Butembo by armed militia.

Such attacks continue to hamper humanitarian access in the conflict-torn region and prevent health workers from tackling the outbreak. This outbreak, the 10th to hit the DRC in 40 years, was declared in North Kivu province on 1 Aug 2018 and, given the worsening security situation in and around the city of Beni, the World Health Organization (WHO) elevated its risk level from "high" to "very high" on 28 Sep 2018. So far, more than 250 Ebola cases have been reported, causing over 140 deaths [see updated numbers above].

WHO suspended all of its activities for a period of 2 days after attacks in late September 2018 in and around Beni, which left more than 20 dead. The Secretary-General called "on all armed groups to immediately cease attacks against civilians and ensure humanitarian access to populations in need."

[The challenge is: how does one get the armed groups to cease their attacks? Perhaps if they had a clear picture of the devastation Ebola is causing to the DRC, especially on top of the ongoing violence, they might respond more cooperatively. - Mod.LK
