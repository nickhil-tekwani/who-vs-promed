A spokesperson for the Kona Community Hospital on the Big Island said an outbreak of scabies was confirmed on Monday [19 Nov 2018]. The hospital says it is working with the Hawaii State Health Department. Officials did not say how many people were infected with scabies but reported in a statement: "We did implement procedures and protocols per our policies for any infectious outbreak. Our interim chief nurse executive and infection prevention director have been coordinating management of the outbreak since then."

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, scabies is an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite. The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs.

The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash. The scabies mite usually is spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. If you never had scabies, symptoms could take 4 to 6 weeks to appear.

"Presumably at a hospital, it gets brought in by a patient. It gets transmitted to a healthcare [provider, and because it's highly contagious, healthcare] providers can transmit it to other healthcare providers and even potentially to other patients. So even if you're taking the best precautions with hand washing and gloves, it is transmissible," said Dr. James Ireland with the John A. Burns School of Medicine {university of Hawaii].

[Scabies is well known to cause hospital and nursing home outbreaks. Mass administration of ivermectin would be the best method to stop the outbreak. Although ivemectin is reported to be a safe and effective treatment for scabies and makes the handling of such an outbreak much easier, ivermectin is not FDA-approved for this use. - Mod.EP
