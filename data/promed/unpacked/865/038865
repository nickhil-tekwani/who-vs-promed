Infection with _Perkinsus marinus_, Brazil
------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 31 Jan 2013 from Dr Figueiredo Marques Guilherme Henrique, director, [Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply], Brasilia, Brazil

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 16 Dec 2012
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 30 Jan 2013
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: subclinical infection
Causal agent: _Perkinsus marinus_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: River Paraiba, Lucena, Paraiba
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Dec 2012
Outbreak status: resolved (31 Jan 2013)
Epidemiological unit: estuary
Water type: brackish water
Population type: wild
Production system: open
Affected animals
Species: oyster (_Crassostrea rhizophorae_)
Morbidity: 0 (scale 0-5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0-5)
Affected population: native species from Paraiba coast.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: within a study conducted at the Federal University of Paraiba on the occurrence of diseases affecting native oysters (_Crassostrea_ spp), samples in oysters without clinical signs were taken in the estuary of the river Paraiba (Paraiba State - Brazil). The samples tested positive in an unofficial private laboratory. The official veterinary services of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA) were reported and new samples were taken and sent to an official laboratory of the MPA. No apparent loss of balance has been observed in the wild populations affected. The main area of commercial farms of bivalve molluscs of the country (State of Santa Catarina) is at about 2700 km [1678 mi] away from the outbreak. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: since this is the 1st time that infection with _Perkinsus marinus_ is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, tracing forward, surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Official Central Laboratory of Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture - AQUACEN - Minas Gerais (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Oyster (_Crassostrea rhizophorae_) / gene sequencing / 30 Jan 2013 / Positive
Oyster (_Crassostrea rhizophorae_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 Jan 2013 / Positive

[_Perkinsus_ spp. are protozoans widespread in molluscs around the world. _Perkinsus marinus_ is a prevalent pathogen of oysters, causing massive mortality in oyster populations. The disease it causes is known as "dermo" (or "perkinsosis"). _P. marinus_ infections have appeared primarily along the East coast of the United States from Maine to Florida, and along the Gulf Coast of the United States and Mexico to the Yucatan Peninsula.
