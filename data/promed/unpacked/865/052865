As Guvenli Gida Consultancy Firm, we visited the factory of Gulsan Inc.
located in Kayseri on 7-8 Aug 2001 to investigate the claimed _Salmonella_
problem. The helva that is claimed to have a problem had been produced on
17 Oct 2000 with serial numbers 18-151; 18-153. No problem was detected
either in Gulsan Inc.'s analysis records, or in the acceptance of the
product by Australia. However, it has been reported by a member of the
Australian Health Department that in the analyses, done 10 months after
production and 2 months before the expiration date, 2 of the 10 samples
were positive for _Salmonella_. The contaminated samples could not be
obtained from the Australian Health Department, although requested. The
firm has been a producer in this area since 1948, and since 1985 the
production [has been done by modern equipment, within a 7500-square-meter
enclosed area in the industrial zone, where water and recycling facilities
have been designed and controlled under the supervision of the Ministry of
Industry.
Gulsan Inc. is a firm that has [shown its commitment to produce healthy
products. Although it had not faced any claims either in domestic or
foreign markets until the [recent claims of _Salmonella_ contamination,
because of the importance they give to the hygienic production and control
of raw material, they [included the sesame and tahini production line in
their system in 1996.
Tahini is produced from sesame seeds [that are sieved and wet-cleaned in
vats. These are the processes used to remove the outer skin of the seed.
Cleaned seeds are [heated to 120 degrees C and milled. The temperature of
the product after milling is about 130 degrees C, and the product, at this
stage, is called tahini. Helva is made by manual mixing of tahini and
acidified heated glucose syrup. The sugar concentration of the syrup is
[quite high; not [lower than 80 Brix [(the concentration of dissolved
sucrose) at a temperature of 140 degrees C. Helva is packed immediately
into jars by hot filling (80 degrees C).
Because of high temperature and [the inclusion of sugar in the production
process, helva is not a risky product in terms of _Salmonella_ growth.
However, contamination can occur due to improper hygienic conditions during
production, packaging, transportation, storage, and presenting stages,
which are the steps between process and consumption. Production and
packaging steps, which are among the responsibilities of the firm, were
inspected by Guvenli Gida Consultancy, and it is stated that ISO 9002 [(a
quality control system) is applied throughout the production line and that
the product traceability is under control. It was also [noted that all
the workers were permanent, so there were no seasonal workers in the
production line of helva; that all the periodic health controls for the
workers had been done; and that their records were kept. The firm has also
started to work with the Guvenli Gida Consultancy firm to establish the
HACCP [(Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, a food safety program)
system, which is required by Turkish Food Regulations. The firm is working
to meet the criteria required in the prerequisite programs.
Gulsan Inc. would be happy to have all [interested parties visit and see
how this traditional product is being produced under hygienic conditions.
