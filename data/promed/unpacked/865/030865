Vaccine call after 16 mumps cases
---------------------------------
People are being urged to make sure they have had the MMR [measles,
mumps and rubella] vaccination after 16 cases of mumps in [the Isle
of] Anglesey and Gwynedd in the last month. The National Public
Health Service for Wales (NPHS) says 15 of those affected had been
given the recommended 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

A total of 10 secondary school pupils in Amlwch on Anglesey are
understood to have been sent home with the illness. GPs in the 2
areas have been alerted to the problem. Health officials from
Anglesey's Local Health Board (LHB) have sent letters to parents
through Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones in Amlwch where pupils have become
ill. All the suspected cases have emerged since 27 Dec 2008.

The health service said it is possible, but not common, to get mumps
after being vaccinated with MMR which protects against measles, mumps
and rubella and is given as part of the routine childhood
immunisation programme. Dr Judy Hart, Consultant in Communicable
Disease Control, said: "The MMR vaccine is extremely effective in
protecting against measles and rubella, with 99 percent of those who
have received 2 doses protected for many years. However, while it is
still very effective compared to other vaccines, MMR does not provide
such high levels of protection against mumps infection compared to
measles and rubella." Dr Hart said one dose of MMR protects around 65
percent of those who receive it against mumps, with a 2nd dose of MMR
improving immunity to around 85 percent of recipients. "So it is
possible to see mumps in individuals who have been vaccinated with
MMR, although this is not common," said Dr Hart

"MMR uptake is very high on Anglesey so most school children are
protected. However, young people aged 16 and over were too old to
have received a routine 2nd dose of MMR before school entry when it
was introduced in 1996. They are more likely to be susceptible to
mumps and require a 2nd dose now."

Mumps is spread by coughs and sneezes and directly through close
personal contact. Symptoms include swelling on the angle of the jaw
on one or both sides of the face. Beforehand, there may be several
days of symptoms such as fever, headache, tiredness, muscle aches,
and loss of appetite. Anyone with these symptoms is being advised to
consult their GP and stay away from school or work until 5 days after
the start of the swelling, when they are no longer infectious.

Dr Hart added: "Anyone in a school or community where mumps cases are
reported who have not already been fully immunised with 2 doses of
MMR should be vaccinated immediately." There is no upper age limit
for vaccination. The NPHS has issued letters to GPs in Anglesey and
Gwynedd to alert them to the increase in suspected mumps.

[Outbreaks of mumps in children and young adults continue to be a
problem in the UK, often as a consequence of the poor uptake of the
triple MMR vaccine. However, MMR uptake is considered to be very high
in Angelsey so most school children are protected. The reason may lie
in the relative lower immunogenicity of the mumps component of the
triple vaccine and the observation that immnity is not always
sustained even after a 2nd immunisation.
