Equine infectious anaemia, France
---------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Jul 2015 from Dr Loic Evain, directeur general adjoint, CVO, Direction generale de l'alimentation, Ministere de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Foret, Paris, France.

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 21 Apr 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 4 May 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 12 Feb 2015
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Equine infectious anaemia virus [EIAV]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Alba-La-Romaine, Alba-La-Romaine-Ardeche
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 25 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

Affected population: The 25 horses were introduced on the quarantine site of a vaccine or antibodies production holding. They were tested during this introduction (Coggins' test). In the frame of this screening, a 5 year old gelding, born in France (Department of Orne) tested positive on 4 May 2015 without having shown any clinical signs. The gelding was euthanized on 5 May 2015. All the other equines tested negative.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 4 / 0 / 0 / 6.25
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: An epidemiological investigation was carried out in the various holdings from where the equidae originated. This investigation enabled exclusion of the hypothesis of the origin of the outbreak as coming from another equidae kept with the infected animal in the vaccine production holding, as all animals within this holding were negative with Coggins' test. Therefore, it was considered unnecessary to put under surveillance the holdings from where the equidae originated. Only the last holding, where the infected animal was kept, was placed under surveillance. Equidae within this holding which were in contact with the infected animal showed negative results to the Coggins' test (18 May 2015). Investigations are still ongoing to identify the source of this isolated outbreak.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of vectors; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestations; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures
Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
ANSES (National Food Security Agency) (National laboratory) / Equidae / Coggins' test / 4 May 2015 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
