[Results of the genotyping are of significance for China's provinces and for neighbouring countries, in particular in relation to relevant available vaccine strains.

At present, 2 FMDV serotypes are known to be circulating in China: serotypes A and O. It will be interesting to note if vaccinations (in response to the outbreaks) are being applied/considered.
