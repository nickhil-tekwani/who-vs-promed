[Regarding the moderator's comment on the previous post (see ref. below): "I
would hope things have improved at Russian universities in the last decade,
but have serious doubts. Can someone who has seen Russian research labs more
recently give us an update? - Mod.JW"]
Actually, things have gone backward. Soviet-era universities got priority
funding. Now they mostly haven't had much beyond basic operating costs in 15
years, and the lack of maintenance really shows.
If you know how paranoid U.S. and British labs have been in recent years
about animal advocates and journalists visiting their facilities, you
will be astounded to know that about 18 months ago our visits were very
warmly welcomed by the top officials at 4 Ukrainian and Russian
universities, and at one of them we were given complete freedom to roam the
labs and animal care facilities as we wished, for as long as we wished. The
scientists were practically begging us to raise hell, in hopes that might
help them get some very much needed improvements.
I have never seen more dilapidated labs anywhere -- not even in India.
However, the Ukrainians and Russians really were trying hard to do good work
and take decent care of their animals, even under the appalling conditions.
I didn't see anything that was the result of indifference on the part of lab
personnel. The problem was that everything they had was falling apart from
sheer weariness.
