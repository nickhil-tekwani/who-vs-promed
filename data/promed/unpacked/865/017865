Scientists cite parallels, differences in emergence of H7N9 and H5N1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In a lengthy perspective article in Lancet Infectious Diseases [see below and http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70167-1/fulltext], Chinese scientists find many parallels between the human outbreak of H7N9 avian influenza in China this year [2013] and H5N1 avian influenza as it emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, but also some major differences.

The Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak involved 18 cases with 6 deaths. So far this year [2013], there have been 135 H7N9 cases, including 43 deaths. H5N1 reemerged in 2003 and has caused 633 human illnesses with 377 deaths since then, according to the World Health Organization. Both viruses showed a predilection for infecting the lower respiratory tract, caused severe pneumonia with high mortality, and involved primarily poultry-to-human transmission, says the report by researchers from Hong Kong and Hangzhou. Also, both pathogens cropped up in growing megacities (Shanghai and Hong Kong) that lie on migratory bird flyways with major river deltas and many poultry farms in the vicinity.

Genetically, both viruses are reassortants that have internal genes from H9N2 viruses found in Asian poultry, and both have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their hemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 segments, the report says. Among the differences, the researchers note that the H7N9 cases were not preceded by poultry outbreaks, unlike the H5N1 emergence. Also, H7N9 patients on average were much older and were more likely to be male than those in the 1997 event.

Noting that the rapid increase in human H7N9 infections from March to May of this year [2013] is unprecedented for avian flu viruses, the authors comment, "Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear." In other observations, they predict that stringent measures to control H7N9 in poultry will stop the human epidemic, but caution that increasing problems with avian flu are expected as poultry consumption rises in China and demand increases. Also, they write that further research is needed on whether the widespread use of H5N1 poultry vaccines in East Asia, along with lax biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, contributed to the emergence of H7N9.

[The publication summarised above is entitled: "The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in human beings 16 years after influenza A H5N1: a tale of two cities", authored by Kelvin KW To and 4 others, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, September 2013;13(9):809-21; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70167-1/fulltext.

Abstract
--------
"Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality. Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are 2 rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia -- with suboptimal biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms -- predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation. Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear."

It seems likely that reliance on poultry production as a source of food to sustain developing populations has been a contributory factor in the emergence of avian influenza as a human disease. The authors of 'Tale of Two Cities' develop the idea that both pathogens cropped up in growing megacities (Shanghai and Hong Kong) that lie on migratory bird flyways with major river deltas and many poultry farms in the vicinity. - Mod.CP]

[From a veterinary perspective, the striking difference between A/H7N9 and the HPAI H5N1 is in their respective pathogenicity to animals (birds, particularly poultry). According to accumulated information, contrary to HPAI H5N1 which may cause severe disease in birds with high mortality rates, the A/H7N9 virus srain which has caused morbidity and deaths in humans in China, is of very low if any pathogenicity in birds.
