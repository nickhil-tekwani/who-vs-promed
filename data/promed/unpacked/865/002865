A 12-year-old girl was in critical condition at Children's Hospital in
Denver with the rare but sometimes deadly [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome=
HPS. Health officials said Sunday the girl lives in Loveland but may have
contracted the disease while visiting a ranch in Arizona in late April.
She was on intensive life support at one point but her condition has
improved, said John Pape, epidemiologist for the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment. Her name was not released. "It appears,
based on interviews, the disease probably was acquired in Arizona," Pape
said. "They were visiting family on a ranch in Arizona, and this girl had
done some work and cleaning in barns."
Colorado has had 23 cases of HPS since 1993 and three this year.
Pape said human HPS cases are rare, even though an estimated 10%-15% of the
mouse population carries the virus. "For whatever reasons, it doesn't make
the jump from mice to people very often. When it does, it's bad news," he
said.
An 18-year-old man from Costilla County died in an Albuquerque, N.M.,
hospital last month, the first death from HPS in Colorado this year.
Hantavirus infections have been documented across the country but are
concentrated in the western United States and especially the Four Corners
area of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.

[Loveland is about 17 km south of Fort Collins in north central Colorado. A
fatal case of HPS occurred last year just outside Loveland in a rural area
but the present case, which had onset more than a month ago, likely was
acquired in Arizona. The statement that "10%-15% of the mouse population
carries the virus" is a misquote or misstatement. John Pape knows quite
well that antibody prevalence (taken to indicate the presence of virus in
persistently infected rodents) can range from 0 to 40% or more, depending
on location and year. No serosurveys have been done in Larimer County,
where Loveland and Fort Collins are located, so the antibody prevalence
there is unknown. In addition, "mice" is understood (not stated) to mean
deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. - Mod.CHC
