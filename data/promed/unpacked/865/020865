I attach an abstract of an recent article by our colleagues in Queensland.
It is interesting to note the conclusion that even in a country with ready
access to health care and diagnostics, doctors failed to notify more than
50% of suspected cases and only 26% of notifications were received within 48
hours. The implications for mounting an effective public health response
are clear. This highlights the point that in countries with more difficult
access to diagnostic facilities, alternative surveillance strategies are
required.

clinically suspected cases of dengue imported into north Queensland. Aust N

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the timeliness of notifications by medical practitioners
of clinically suspected dengue importations into north Queensland (NQ).
Describe the features of the disease and determine the likely duration of
viraemia prior to implementating public health measures.
METHOD: Since December 1994, the Tropical Public Health Unit (TPHU) has
maintained a register of all imported cases of dengue into NQ. Only
confirmed viraemic cases were included in the study. Timeliness of
notifications was defined as the interval between the first medical
consultation in NQ and notification to TPHU. An Epi info database was
developed and used to analyse data.
RESULTS: There were 31 confirmed dengue importations into NQ during the
study period, including all 4 dengue serotypes. The largest source (39%) was
Papua New Guinea. The median time for notifications was 5.5 days. Doctor
notifications ranged from 0 to 21 days (median 2 days), remaining
notifications range from 1 to 42 days
(median 10 days) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of viraemia of public health
importance was 7 days (2-12 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Of concern, doctors failed to notify more than 50% of suspected
cases and only 26% of notifications were received within 48 hours.
Notification delays led to prolonged viraemia of public health importance
increasing the potential risk of secondary [sic infections.
IMPLICATIONS: General practitioners need to promptly notify all clinically
suspected cases of dengue in travellers recently arrived in NQ. The TPHU
intends to reemphasise to general practitioner the importance of timely
notifications and develop an
orientation package for new doctors.

[The whole point of making any disease notifiable is to get cases reported
fast so that public health action can be taken. We have harped on this
question many times in comments to ProMED in relation to yellow fever &
cholera reporting.
Unfortunately, doctors tend to concentrate on the individual patient without
taking into consideration the fact that the longer they delay reporting, the
more patients with that infectious disease they are likely to see. And
since there are no penalties for reporting late -- or not reporting at
all -- there is no other incentive. In fact, penalties for late reporting
would clearly be counter-productive.
When are health workers going to be trained to understand that public health
measures -- monitoring & prevention -- are at least as important as
treatment? - Mod.JW
