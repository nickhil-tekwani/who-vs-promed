The Canadian Food Inspection Agency recently announced that another brand of chicken nuggets was just recalled for salmonella. This time, the recall is on Crisp and Delicious chicken nuggets with a best before date of 19 July 2019. These nuggets are the latest in a massive nationwide outbreak that has resulted in over 500 illnesses.

The massive outbreaks have been going on since May 2017, when the government developed a new method of checking for salmonella in products. This latest product recall is the 15th investigation in those outbreaks, but it is the only one currently open. It is also the 1st salmonella outbreak of 2019 after the government had previously reported on 17 Dec 2018 that there were no active outbreak investigations.

This recent recall isn't only the newest, but it's also one of the biggest. So far, there have been 54 illnesses tied to this product alone. No one has been hospitalized, and no one has died from it. It also brings the total outbreak count up by a lot. As of 25 Jan 2019, the government reports that there have been 529 confirmed cases of salmonella illness across the country, with cases in every single province and territory.

The outbreaks have also led to 90 people being hospitalized, and 3 of the people who were infected have died. While the government reports that in 2 of those cases, death was unrelated to salmonella, they have not determined whether salmonella was related to the 3rd death.

Of the 529 people who have been infected with salmonella, the majority of them come from Ontario, where there have been 187 cases, and Quebec, where there have been 111 cases. People of all ages and genders have been infected.
