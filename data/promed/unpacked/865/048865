Vaccine Protects Monkeys from Ebola Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
Researchers have produced a vaccine that will protect monkeys from Ebola
virus infection. "Doctors have essentially been helpless against Ebola
virus," said lead researcher Dr. Gary Nabel, Director of the Dale and Betty
Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the US National Institutes of
Health. "Our studies show that animals can launch an effective immune
response against Ebola virus, and we can use knowledge of this response to
design a vaccine that protects non-human primates from infection.
"Although much more work needs to be done, we hope this moves us closer to
new vaccines and treatments for Ebola [hemorrhagic fever and other
[filoviruses."
The new vaccine was tested at a high-containment facility run by the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers, who report
their work in the journal "Nature," exposed 8 macaques to a lethal dose of
Ebola virus. Only the 4 animals given the new vaccine survived. The
vaccine worked on 2 levels. First, the monkeys were given injections of
DNA that produced in their systems certain proteins found on the surface of
the virus. These were sufficient to stimulate an immune response but did
not make the animals ill. The response was then boosted by exposing the
macaques to a modified cold virus [i.e., an adenovirus vector that had
been re-engineered to express another specific component of the
virus. This further increased the production of antibodies and T cells in
the animals to fight infection. More than 6 months after being [exposed
to Ebola virus, the monkeys in the study remain symptom-free with no
detectable virus in their blood. "We of course want to test the
multivalent vaccine for effectiveness against all 3 strains of Ebola
virus," said co-researcher Dr. Nancy Sullivan, "but we also need to look
more closely at the immune response induced by this vaccine so we can nail
down what is needed for protection."
News of the research has received a broad welcome. Dennis Burton and Paul
Parren at the Scripps Research Institute at La Jolla, California, commented
in Nature: "There's still some way to go before a human vaccine is
available, but this is a step in the right direction." If a human vaccine
does emerge, it could be administered swiftly to local people in an area
where the virus has broken out, as well as to medical and support personnel
who travel there, they said. But a more urgent requirement is to channel
resources into surveillance, hygiene and training in barrier nursing,
"which can be highly effective in containing an outbreak," they noted.

Sanchez, P E Rollin, Z-y Yang & G J Nabel. Development of a preventive
vaccine for Ebola virus infection in primates. Nature 408, 605-609, 2000
<http://www.nature.com/nlink/v408/n6812/abs/408605a0_fs.html>. The authors
describe an effective vaccine strategy for Ebola virus infection in
non-human primates that involves a combination of DNA immunization and
boosting with adenoviral vectors that encode viral proteins generated
cellular and humoral immunity in cynomolgus macaques. Challenge with a
lethal dose of the highly pathogenic, wild-type, 1976 Mayinga strain of
Zaire Ebola virus resulted in uniform infection in controls, who progressed
to a moribund state and death in less than one week. In contrast, all
vaccinated animals were asymptomatic for more than 6 months, with no
detectable virus after the initial challenge. The authors conclude that
these findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop a preventive
vaccine against Ebola virus infection in primates. The Zaire Ebola virus
was chosen because it exhibits the highest lethality of known Ebola
viruses. This is a very significant result, although the practicality of
such an immunization strategy in rural Africa must be open to question. -
