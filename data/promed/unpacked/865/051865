According to Dr. Yuval Hadani, director of the Western-Galilee Veterinary Bureau, as of today [2 Jun 2021], no active clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] are present in the beef cattle herd of Yodfat. Therefore, a countdown for the duration of 30 days is being started, during which time no animal from the herd is allowed exit beyond the declared zone.

[The FMD outbreak in Yodfat, Lower Galilee, in Israel's northern district ("Hazafon"; map at <tinyurl.com/3my78h6a>) had reportedly started in mid-May 2021, confirmed by the lab (Kimron Veterinary Institute) on 19 May 2021.

For the initial circular announcing the start of the outbreak, signed by the Director of the Field Veterinary Services, dated 20 May 2021, please see https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/yodfat-mouth-paws/he/animals_health_mouth_and_paws_pe_tlafaim-20-5-2021.pdf (in Hebrew).

This most recent outbreak during the current FMD season, which had started on 5 Jan 2021, is located about 23 km (14 mi) southern to Israel's border with Lebanon; all earlier outbreaks were situated closer to the border. The relevant circulars are available at https://www.gov.il/he/departments/topics/mouth_and_paws (in Hebrew). Notifications were submitted to the OIE.

FMD is known to present a seasonal pattern in Israel, though not occurring every year. During the 45-year period 1975-2019, the disease was absent in 13 years. Primary cases were restricted to the period between November and June, outbreaks peaking April-May. See 2 graphs, addressing the said periods, on page 23 of VSAH's annual report for 2019, available at https://www.moag.gov.il/vet/dochot-shnatiim/Documents/doch_shnati_2019.pdf (in Hebrew; graphs include titles in English).

Israel's FMD policy includes annual vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats. Most cases are seen in young unvaccinated animals, in adult animals whose previous vaccination had taken place long before, or those not vaccinated for various reasons. The beef cattle herd in Yodfat had been last vaccinated 12 months prior to the reported outbreak.

The causative agent, genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2, is -- likely -- circulating in southern Lebanon and probably in southwest Syria and/or elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean. Wild boars are abundant on both sides of the international fencing structure between Israel and neighboring Lebanon/Syria. It will be interesting to note if such animals have recently been sampled and tested. Swine are notoriously known as prolific emitters of airborne FMD virus. Wild boars may serve as an intermediate FMD virus transmitter. - Mod.AS
