The Chonburi Department of Marine and Coastal Resources has increased its patrols after yellow-band disease was discovered in coral reefs off Sattahip and Samaesarn islands.

The disease was found on 13 Oct 2022 by the Marine and Coastal Resources Research Center in the Eastern Upper Gulf of Thailand, according to Attaphon Charoenchansa, Director-General of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.

Yellow-band disease is a coral disease that attacks and kills colonies of coral, according to Attaphon. The cause of the disease varies from the coral being under stress from pollution, overfishing, and climate change. The disease can spread from one coral to another.

As a primary solution, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources joined hands with Naval Division 1 and other relevant agencies to separate the infected corals from the good ones to prevent the spreading.

Attaphon said the department still has not been able to pinpoint the exact cause of the disease; therefore, he urged Sattahip residents, tourists, or divers who stumble upon infected corals to dial 1362. The line is manned 24 hrs.

[In tropical waters, corals suffer 3 common diseases -- yellow-band disease, dark-spot syndrome, and white-plague (band) disease. Recent modelling work suggested that these diseases do not follow a contagious-disease model. Coral diseases may have multiple interacting causes.

Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the number of coral diseases, coral species affected, and disease outbreaks. The hypothesis that most closely matches the data is that environmental thresholds are exceeded, and then these environmental conditions either weaken the corals, which are then more susceptible to infection, or the conditions increase the virulence or abundance of pathogens. Exceeding such environmental thresholds will most likely become increasingly common in rapidly warming oceans, leading to more frequent coral-disease outbreaks, where diverse components of the parasite community will be implicated.
