As Awareness Spreads, More Dengue Cases Reported, Say Officials
-----------------------------------------------
As the campaign against the spread of dengue fever launched in February
2006 continues, more cases of dengue fever are being diagnosed.
This means that the campaign is succeeding, according to health officials,
because the increased awareness of the symptoms has resulted in more visits
to doctors and subsequent diagnoses.
"The increase in reported suspected and confirmed cases since the start of
the campaign means that the campaign is succeeding, because more people are
becoming aware of the signs and symptoms and are seeking treatment," said
Dr. Noha Dashash, assistant director of primary health care in Jeddah. "We
expected this increase in the initial phase, but by the end of the year
[2006], the numbers should decrease," she told Arab News.
However, health officials say more work needs to be done to remove the
breeding environments for the _Aedes_ mosquito, which serves as the vector
for the spread of the virus, such as eliminating sources of standing water
where the mosquito lays its eggs. There have been 5 reported fatalities
this year [2006].
Last week, Prince Mishaal ibn Majed, governor of Jeddah, met with the
campaign organizing committee and Jeddah Mayor Adel Fakieh as well as the
director of Jeddah health affairs, Dr. Abdul Rahman Khayyat, to discuss the
latest developments in the efforts to combat the disease.
By the end of last week, 1491 suspected cases were received at health
centers, and 821 of them were confirmed as dengue fever.
Khayyat said that a house-to-house combating program is being prepared with
the cooperation of over 100 health inspectors, including medical students.
The door-to-door campaign is ongoing, with the involvement of mosques,
schools and other institutions. It began 4 weeks ago in the 5 districts
where the disease is most prevalent: Ghulail, Al-Balad, Al-Muntazahat,
Al-Thaalba and Al-Hindawiya.
There are also training courses for physicians, educators and the private
sector.
"Even the doctors themselves didn't know about the disease. Now they can
diagnose it and treat the symptoms early, because there is no medical cure,
only preventive measures," said Dashash.
The house-to-house combating program focuses on encouraging residents to
eliminate standing water inside the home, such as water in mop buckets.
"40 teams will go to houses in 16 districts and take samples of suspected
breeding grounds," said Dashash to Arab News.
Construction sites are common places for standing water and therefore for
mosquitoes that may carry the virus. Many of the reported cases of dengue
have been laborers, including construction workers.
Mayor Fakieh said that a project for implementing a network for draining
surface water has begun in Al-Muntazahat, Quwaiza, Kilo 14 and Kilo 11
neighborhoods, where the cases are more prevalent.

Serious outbreaks of dengue fever have been reported in Chaiyaphum Province
from the start of 2006, with 34 current patients. Heavy concentrations of
dengue fever outbreaks are also reported in the provincial municipal area.
Authorities in Chaiyaphum Province are conducting mosquito spraying in

following a recent outbreak of dengue fever, with 21 children being
afflicted with the disease since the start of this month [May 2006]. There
are currently 34 hospitalized patients, with 7 in the Chaiyaphum municipal
area.
