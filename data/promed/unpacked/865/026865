Cross-reactive neuraminidase antibodies and protection
-----------------------------------------------
A paper entitled "Cross-Reactive Neuraminidase Antibodies Afford
Partial Protection against H5N1 in Mice and Are Present in Unexposed
Humans" has been published online in the February 2007 issue of PLoS
Medicine (Vol. 4, issue 2).

This paper concerns analysis of immune responses to H5N1 virus
exposure and evidence for cross-protection in mice. The following is
the authors' Abstract.
Background
----------
A pandemic H5N1 influenza outbreak would be facilitated by an absence
of immunity to the avian-derived virus in the human population.
Although this condition is likely in regard to hemagglutinin-mediated
immunity, the neuraminidase (NA) of H5N1 viruses (avN1) and of
endemic human H1N1 viruses (huN1) are classified in the same
serotype. We hypothesized that an immune response to huN1 could
mediate cross-protection against H5N1 influenza virus infection.
Methods and Findings
--------------------
Mice were immunized against the NA of a contemporary human H1N1
strain by DNA vaccination. They were challenged with recombinant
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) viruses bearing huN1 (PR8-huN1) or avN1
(PR8-avN1) or with H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/04. Additional naive
mice were injected with sera from vaccinated mice prior to H5N1
challenge. Also, serum specimens from humans were analyzed for
reactivity with avN1. Immunization elicited a serum IgG response to
huN1 and robust protection against the homologous challenge virus.
Immunized mice were partially protected from lethal challenge with
H5N1 virus or recombinant PR8-avN1. Sera transferred from immunized
mice to naive animals conferred similar protection against H5N1
mortality. Analysis of human sera showed that antibodies able to
inhibit the sialidase activity of avN1 exist in some individuals.
Conclusions
-----------
These data reveal that humoral immunity elicited by huN1 can
partially protect against H5N1 infection in a mammalian host. Our
results suggest that a portion of the human population could have
some degree of resistance to H5N1 influenza, with the possibility
that this could be induced or enhanced through immunization with
seasonal influenza vaccines.

[The question of the cross-protective potential of the neuraminidase
component of the influenza virion has been addressed previously and
left unresolved. Here the mouse experiments described above with
avian and human influenza viruses indicate that cross-protective
humoral responses can be demonstrated and that immunization with
exiting N1-containing seasonal influenza virus vaccine may have
potential to provide partial protection against the current H5N1
avian virus. - Mod.CP]
