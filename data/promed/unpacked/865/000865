White-tailed deer EHD infected
------------------------------
Reports from several south eastern Montana locations have confirmed that
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has surfaced in the resident
white-tailed deer populations. Reports from Glendive, Savage, Sidney,
Brockway, Angela, Circle, and Rock Springs suggest EHD has surfaced in the
local white-tailed populations.

This is an infectious viral disease of white-tailed deer and outbreaks can
occur annually. EHD and the bluetongue virus are basically
indistinguishable. Biting flies transmit both diseases and the disease is
seasonal and usually occurs late summer or early fall. A hard freeze can
kill the insects and stop the spread of the disease.

Usually EHD infects the deer and incubates for 7-10 days and once the virus
matures it results in death within 24 hours. Normally infected deer
gravitate to water.

Mule deer, antelope, and big horn sheep have shown occurrence of the
disease in the past. Current reports show white-tailed deer as the target
species to date. No extensive die-offs have been reported in south eastern
Montana.

Humans are not at risk by handling infected deer, eating venison from
infected deer, or being bitten by infected flies. Information is limited
concerning affects of EHD in domestic livestock. The virus has been
isolated from sick cattle and surveys have shown that cattle often have
antibodies to this virus, indicating frequent exposure.

Overall the EHD occurrence in southeastern Montana has apparently not yet
infected many white-tailed deer but a hard freeze is required to curtail
the spread of the disease.

[Since 1890, deer die-offs from diseases, which might have been EHD, have
occurred in various parts of North America. These early die-offs were
variously diagnosed as blackleg, blacktongue, bluetongue, mycotic
stomatitis, or hemorrhagic septicemia, or they were undetermined. The
causative agents were never confirmed. A review of the case histories,
signs and lesions, seasonal occurrence, and lack of a bacterial agent
suggests that they might have been EHD.

The 1st occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in 1955
when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) succumbed
in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new disease of deer
and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic disease" was suggested to describe its
main clinical and pathological features.

Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics have
occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming [US],
and Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred in Missouri,
Washington, Nebraska, Iowa [US], and British Columbia [Canada]. South
Dakota, Missouri, and Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of EHD
and the disease might be considered enzootic in these areas.

Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have succumbed.

The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ sp. biting
fly or midge. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated
vector in North America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large
numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics, which do not usually
recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and
the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks
of EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October,
being somewhat location dependant) and have ceased abruptly with the onset
of frost.

Experimentally, the disease can be transmitted to susceptible deer by the
inoculation of virus-laden material from infected deer by subcutaneous,
intramuscular, intravenous, or oral routes.

Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although molecularly
they are not the same disease.

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A
constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially
lose their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and fever
(affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body
temperature), and finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen
in the blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the
name 'bluetongue'. 8 to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs,
deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate and die.

A combination of case history, characteristic signs and lesions, and the
isolation of the virus are necessary for a diagnosis of EHD. Useful aids in
obtaining a diagnosis are the epizootic nature of the disease, its seasonal
occurrence, and its spectacular hemorrhagic lesions. Because of the
similarity of its symptoms to other diseases, such as bluetongue and
malignant catarrhal fever, the isolation and identification of the virus
are essential.

There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an
oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary
winter feeding program, but this is presently improbable as some areas with
winter feeding are viewed as one mechanism of spreading tuberculosis.
Additionally, vaccine companies have not been forthcoming with a
willingness to develop a vaccine that could be used for mass vaccination.
With more people adopting alternative livestock, such as various species of
cervids, the opportunity for vaccine companies is increasing. It may be
that lobbyists with the alternative livestock will need to be active in
congress to secure minor use, minor species (MUMS) dollars to be an
incentive for the vaccine companies.

Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect
upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically.
Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD
virus can infect domestic animals.
