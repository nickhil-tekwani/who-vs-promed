The Minister of Health, Carlos Albuquerque, announced yesterday [13 Feb
1998 that the government plans to intensify the fight against dengue. In
the Southeast Region (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais & Espirito
Santo) in January 1998 the disease has increased 7-fold compared to January
1997. It is planned to contract 14,000 new sanitary guards and train the
36,000 exisiting ones and carry out a prevention campaign. Their action
will be reinforced with a radio campaign.
In March [1998 the government will host an international seminar on the
biological control of dengue, to discuss the experience of other countries
in controlling dengue by using bacteria which destroy the larvae of the
vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_.
The minister is reported to have said that the epidemic is due to the
increase in rain and temperature provoked by El Nino, and that with the
reduction of these in March the epidemic will decrease in intensity, as it
has every year.

Espirito Santo -----------------
This state has recorded 11,000 cases so far [in 1998. The cities of
Vitoria, Guarapari & Cachoeiro do Itapemirim are affected, and 5 cases of
DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever have been confirmed.
Drs Flavio Nobre and Elcio Couto calculate that the number of actual cases
of dengue is 5 times the official figures. The State Secretary of Health
has trained 80 health agents with 50 vehicles for the anti-dengue campaign,
which will involve radio, TV, newspapers and leaflets to tell the public
about prevention.

[Predictions about the weather and dengue are uncertain at best. Rio had an
abnormally dry January this year, and that may have favored breeding of the
vector mosquito, rather than heavy rains elsewhere. El Nino may cause a
prolonged wet and hot season beyond March, so the epidemic may not go away
as it has in previous years. Hence the training just now of thousands of
prevention workers may not be too late to affect the course of the
epidemic. Let me declare my interest in this -- I have just begun a year's
study leave at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, so I wish Brazil
well in its campaign against dengue - Mod.JW
