The 1st case of white-nose fungus found in an Ontario bat colony
threatens the survival of a species. Canada's 1st reported case of a
disease that kills bats by the thousands has been discovered at a
hibernation site in the Bancroft-Minden area.

White-nose syndrome, a lethal fungus that has decimated populations
of bats in the northeast region of the United States, could pose a
threat to the survival of several species of bats in Canada. The name
of the disease refers to a ring of white fungus around the muzzles
and bodies of bats. The disease isn't fully understood yet, but
researchers know that it affects the bats during hibernation.

"It's a very significant threat," said John Dungavell, a wildlife
health policy advisor with Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.
Dungavell said the disease could be transferred by physical contact
among the bats, as well as carried by humans to various hibernation
sites. However, there are no known human health risks associated with
the syndrome.

The disease, which was 1st discovered 4 years ago in a cave near
Albany, New York, has been associated with the death of more than one
million bats in the eastern U.S.

Dungavell said the number of bats found in Ontario with white-nose
syndrome is still very small. Bancroft is about 200 kilometres west
of Ottawa. However, the impact of the disease and how quickly it
spreads can't be underestimated. Within 2 years, a site in New York
with the largest colony of little brown bats in the world dwindled
from 200 000 to 3000 bats.

"In terms of assessing the impact here in Canada, we have to look to
the U.S.," said Dungavell, adding the mortality rate in the U.S. has
been 80 to 99 per cent amongst infected bats. Dungavell stressed the
importance of bats to wildlife diversity as they contribute to insect
population management.

The Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre and the ministry are
encouraging the public to stay away from caves and to report any
unusual bat mortality by calling 1-866-673-4781. The ministry is also
advising the public not to touch any bats, as a small percentage
carry rabies.

[This is the 1st report of white nose syndrome (WNS) in Canada. While
this article does not mention it, there was a surveillance plan in
place for them to find the signs of this syndrome. Currently there is
no known treatment or cure and the impact on the bat population has
been devastating. It is possible that if this syndrome continues to
impact the bat population, it may have an influence on crops because
many bats function as pollinators for crops. Thus far, that has not
happened. This article does not tell us the species of bat in Canada
that this syndrome has infected. - Mod.TG]
