Variant CJD may be more infectious than sporadic CJD
----------------------------------------------------
Britain's Department of Health is greatly concerned that [the prion
responsible for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail may be more infectious than the
prion responsible for sporadic CJD.
Professor Robert Will, director of the National CJD Surveillance Unit,
said tests had shown that tonsils, spleen, lymph nodes, and appendix of
vCJD patients were all positive, whereas similar tests on patients with
sporadic disease were all negative.
He told a conference at the Royal Society of Medicine in London that
this implies that the new [variant infectious agent is present at greater
levels in these peripheral tissues. "Therefore, there could be a greater
levels of infectivity and...a greater risk of secondary transmission from
blood or surgical instruments."
He presented a list of common surgical procedures carried out in 41
cases of vCJD before the onset of clinical signs. In none of these
procedures had any precautions been taken apart from normal
sterilisation procedures. He pointed out that prion proteins are
remarkably resistant to sterilisation. The Department of Health has a
surgical instrument panel of experts considering these issues. The
Health Department announced in January [2001 it would spend GBP
200 million modernising National Health Service sterilisation
equipment and buying disposable surgical tools.
In the case of blood donations, Prof. Will said: "We have found 22
individuals who have received blood that was donated by someone
who developed vCJD. None of these individuals have yet developed
vCJD." [He doesn't say how long ago they received the blood. -

Prof. Will also questioned the findings of an official investigation last
year into the causes of a cluster of vCJD cases in Leicestershire, central
England. The inquiry report linked the cases to cross-contamination
caused when a butcher removed the cows' heads with the same
instruments used to cut meat from the carcass. "The problem with that
argument is that the butcher in question retired in December 1982,"
Prof. Will said. "At that stage, the incidence of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) would have been incredibly low. If you have a
cluster of 4 or 5 cases related to that particular practice it is a matter of
grave concern for the future." He said another flaw in the theory is that
although the cows' brains had been used to make pate, no cases of
vCJD had been identified in people known to have eaten the pate.
Prof. Will said that the mean age of onset of vCJD in some 106 cases
so far identified in the UK was 27 years and the mean age of death 29
years. The number of cases was doubling every 3 years. Diagnosis is
difficult, he said, as most patients usually presented with depression,
anxiety, or withdrawal symptoms, which cannot be distinguished from
common psychiatric disorders. As a result, cases had been mis-
diagnosed. However, one helpful clue is that half the patients
complained of painful tingling, often in their fingers or feet, in addition
to psychiatric symptoms, before they developed other neurological
symptoms.
