In the above article update of 24 Jul 2012, the following statement was made: "Sinus irrigation is a practice not recommended by mainstream medicine and can be dangerous."

On the contrary, our ENT colleagues routinely recommend sinus/nasal irrigation, especially in their post-op sinus patients.

The most conservative recommendations are to use distilled or boiled water. Few patients will go to that trouble. In reality, our ENT and Allergy colleagues recommend tap water only from the hot water tap if the temperature of the water heater is adequate: The CDC notes that water heater temperatures under 47 C [116.6 F] are inadequate [http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html].

[ProMED thanks Dr Thomas A Gillespie for his comment. Reviewing the literature, the most convincing studies of chronic sinusitis support the use of 2 percent saline for sinus nasal irrigation daily plus routine care. The use of 2 percent saline compared to routine care alone reported a 64 percent improvement in overall symptom severity and significant and clinically relevant improvement in disease-specific quality of life at 6 months (Rabago D et al. Efficacy of daily hypertonic saline nasal irrigation among patients with sinusitis: A randomized controlled trial. Journal of Family Practice 2002;51:1049-55) and 18 months (Rabago D et al. The efficacy of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation for chronic sinonasal symptoms. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2005;133:3-8).

A Cochrane review from 2007 concluded that " ... the beneficial effect of saline appears to outweigh these drawbacks for the majority of patients. The use of topical saline could be included as a treatment adjunct for the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis." (Harvey R et al. Nasal saline irrigations for the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007;(3):CD006394).

The conclusion is that irrigation with 2 percent saline for chronic sinonasal symptoms is supported by clinical trials, but irrigation with plain water without a proper diagnosis and follow up by an ear, nose and throat specialist is not evidence based. - Mod.EP]

[After arriving after long overnight flights at a number of internationsl airports and going to the airport men's room I have noticed Chinese passengers snorting tap water up their noses during their ablutions. I am not suggesting that they are at risk from airport tapwater, but I suppose they do that at home and I wonder whether there might not be a large number of undiagnosed amoebic meningoencephalitis fatalities in China? - Mod.JW]
