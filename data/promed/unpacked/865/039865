Officials with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency say 12 000 turkeys at a commercial barn in western Nova Scotia had to be euthanized after avian influenza was discovered at the farm.

The news was revealed during a Friday [4 Feb 2022] media briefing.

Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a highly contagious viral strain. [Probably it is avian influenza H5N1. - Mod.TG]

Prior to today [4 Feb 2022], cases were discovered in a wild goose and a backyard flock of chickens not meant for commercial production.

Speaking on CBC's Maritime Noon, Dr. Margaret McGeoghegan, a veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Atlantic division, said she wasn't at liberty to disclose a specific location for the barn.

She said there are other commercial producers in the area, and restrictions are in place for commercial operations within 10 km [6.2 mi] of the affected barn to prevent the virus from spreading.

"Because of the intensity of the production system, the risk there is very high, and also considering the fact there are lots of waterways and lots of exposure to wild birds," said McGeoghegan.

She said people in the industry are extremely concerned about the cases.

McGeoghegan said farms have strict biosecurity measures to try to prevent the virus from entering a farm. The virus, which is spread through airborne transmission, can be brought in inadvertently on shoes, equipment, and clothing, she said.

"Because this strain is as highly pathogenic as it is, when it hits, sometimes there are no clinical signs other than the birds are dead," said McGeoghegan.

On Friday [4 Feb 2022], the Nova Scotia Poultry Emergency Response Planning Committee -- which includes Chicken Farmers of Nova Scotia, Egg Farmers of Nova Scotia, and Hatching Egg Farmers of Nova Scotia -- released a statement saying the poultry industry is on high alert and asking for help from neighbors to help prevent the spread of avian flu.

It said the industry has been following "advanced biosecurity protocols" to prevent spread since the 1st suspected case was found in a wild goose east of Halifax. The industry is cooperating with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's instructions.

It is also putting out a call to anyone raising domestic fowl on their property to watch for signs of avian flu and take all precautions to keep their birds away from wild birds. It said if anyone sees a sick or dead wild bird, to report it online through the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative.

[Avian influenza spreads very easily between birds, from wild to domestic, or domestic to domestic birds. This is certainly a time to be practicing biosecurity: washing boots between barns, changing coveralls, even showering between barns, if possible. Vehicles need to be sprayed with an antimicrobial agent on tires, in the wheel wells, etc. to prevent tracking the virus into the facility. Although it is an airborne virus, one cannot be too careful. While some of these suggestions seem either obvious or over the top, the point is that biosecurity encompasses all aspects of the poultry facility. While the virus may be airborne, our movements are capable of carrying it into a facility, and awareness of this is the 1st step in prevention. Do not be around any backyard poultry while off-duty from your poultry employment. The risk of transmitting this virus is too great. Also, your health is important.

Please note, avian influenza can also be a human health issue.

"How can avian influenza (H5N1) infections be prevented?

"If you travel to an area where avian influenza (H5N1) is a concern, you should take the proper precautions. See your health-care provider or visit a travel health clinic 6 weeks before you leave.

"If you travel to an affected area, follow the precautions below:
Avoid high-risk areas (poultry farms and live animal markets).
Avoid contact with birds, including
- chickens
- ducks
- wild birds
Avoid surfaces that may have bird droppings or secretions on them.
Make sure that all poultry dishes, including eggs, are cooked well.
Wash your hands frequently:
- use soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds
- if soap is not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (carry travel-sized dispensers)
Monitor your health:
- see a health-care provider if you develop flu-like symptoms while travelling or upon returning to Canada
- explain that you have been travelling or living in an area where avian influenza (H5N1) is a concern."
