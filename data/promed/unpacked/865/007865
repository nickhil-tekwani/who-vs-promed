OIE concerned about Avian Influenza (AI) outbreaks in animals in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
OIE, FAO and the EU sent an expert from the OFFLU (OIE/FAO laboratory
network for Avian Influenza) to be part of the WHO/FAO/OIE/EU/ECDC
team currently assessing the situation in Turkey.
According to the latest information received from the joint team of
experts, as of 8 Jan 2006, a total of 13 AI (H5) outbreaks have been
confirmed by virus isolation in 8 provinces (Igdir, Erzurum, Sanli
Urfa, Erzincan, Agri, Bitlis, Yozgat, Ankara), mostly in backyard
flocks. Within the Ankara region, AI (H5) virus was isolated in one
wild duck. The official notification of the outbreaks by the Turkish
authorities is published on the OIE website <http://www.oie.int>.
The World Organisation for Animal Health expresses its concern about
the evolution of the situation of AI outbreaks in Turkey.
The OIE is particularly concerned about the very bad weather
conditions in Eastern Turkey that make any technical intervention
very difficult and that also favor a longer survival of the animal
virus in the environment.
Neighboring countries may also be susceptible to avian influenza
outbreaks and should therefore increase their levels of surveillance.
The OIE calls on the international community to support the Turkish
authorities in their action and strongly recommends implementing all
classical control methods (stamping out) to stop the animal outbreaks
and also to consider the use of vaccination as an additional tool, if
appropriate.
OFFLU (OIE/FAO laboratory network for Avian Influenza) strongly
recommends collecting and sending a maximum number of samples in
order to analyze the animal virus and to be able to exchange this
information with WHO laboratories.

[2] Turkey - vaccinations

Turkey should consider vaccines in bird flu fight
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey should consider poultry vaccination in addition to culling to
control its bird flu outbreak if the number of cases in animals
continues to rise, the head of the world animal health body (OIE)
said on Wednesday [11 Jan 2006]. "They must act quickly as soon as
new cases emerge to stamp out the virus. The problem now is that
there are cases throughout the country," OIE Director General Bernard
Vallat told Reuters in an interview. "If cases continue to come to
light, the 2nd option is to use vaccination in the area around
detected outbreaks. Of course, sick animals must still be culled," he
added. "The idea is that you create a protective area around an
outbreak through vaccination. This could involve an entire province,"
Vallat said.
The international community should provide logistical support and
vaccine stocks if Turkey took this option.
The outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, which has already spread to a
3rd of the country's provinces, has killed at least 2 children and
infected more than a dozen people. Health experts in Turkey have said
there is no sign so far of human-to-human transmission.
The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on
Wednesday [11 Jan 2006] the virus could become endemic in Turkey and
poses a serious risk to neighboring countries. More than 300 000
birds have been culled since 26 Dec 2005.
Vallat said it was likely that the virus had been around in poultry
flocks for a couple of months in the east of the country, where the
remoteness of the region and harsh weather had hampered efforts to
control it. "We think it was introduced around the same time as the
cases found in October [2005] in the west of the country. But given
the geographical location, detection was later," he said.
In addition, human contact with sick birds had been increased by
people bringing chickens inside their homes due to the low
temperatures, Vallat added. At temperatures of 4 C (39 F) and below,
it could exist in the environment for a month, he said. "This has
allowed it to spread among animals," he said. He also said
neighboring countries such as Iran needed to be on alert for the
appearance of the virus, but as in Turkey, the remoteness of the
region near the border could hamper efforts to detect and control any
outbreaks.

Bird flu virus could become endemic in Turkey - FAO
-----------------------------------------------
The bird flu virus could become endemic in Turkey and poses a serious
risk to neighboring countries, the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Wednesday [11 Jan 2006]. The
FAO urged neighboring countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Iraq, Iran and Syria to be on high alert, apply surveillance and
control measures and ensure that the public is fully informed about
the bird flu risk.
"The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 could become
endemic in Turkey," FAO said in a statement.
Juan Lubroth, senior FAO animal health officer, said the virus may be
spreading despite the measures already taken to combat it. "Far more
human and animal exposure to the virus will occur if strict
containment does not isolate all known and unknown locations where
the bird flu virus is currently present," he said. Turkey needed to
apply "a centrally coordinated and countrywide control campaign based
on efficient local actions carried out in a transparent manner."
Lubroth said infected poultry should be reported immediately, and all
internationally recommended control measures should be used in
outbreak areas, including bird culling, strict isolation and vaccination.
"Veterinary services should have all the necessary political support
and financial means to fully investigate and report any suspicion of
bird flu," Lubroth said. "They should ensure that poultry owners in
regions most at risk are fully aware of disease symptoms and control
measures to apply," he said.
He added the movement of poultry in outbreak areas should cease
unless permitted by veterinarians.

Turkey says bird flu outbreak under control as new human case emerges.
-----------------------------------------------
The Turkish health ministry said the new bird flu case in Turkey was
detected in a patient in the central city of Sivas. It was the only
test of the 61 carried out across the country to produce a positive
result for H5N1. A ministry official told AFP on condition of
anonymity that the patient was carrying the same H5N1 strain that has
killed more than 70 people in Southeast Asia and China since 2003,
before spreading west toward Europe. She is only the 2nd adult among
the 13 cases confirmed so far, the rest being children and teenagers
from several provinces under treatment in hospitals in Ankara, the
northern city of Samsun, and in Van in the east.
The Agriculture ministry said in a statement that 306 000 winged
animals had so far been culled in 15 of Turkey's 81 provinces. Among
them were the capital Ankara, the country's largest city Istanbul, as
well as remote eastern regions where the disease emerged last month
[December 2005]. Meanwhile, 3 new outbreaks of the disease among fowl
were detected in the west and southeast of the country, according to
local officials quoted by the Anatolia news agency. Slaughtering also
began in the western province of Aydin, where officials reported the
virus among poultry in the popular resort of Kusadasi, on the Aegean
coast facing the Greek island of Samos. Kusadasi is some 1650 km
(1000 miles) from Dogubeyazit, the rural eastern town close to the
Iranian border where the country's 1st flu deaths occurred.
Experts warned the public to be cautious during the 4-day Eid
al-Adha, the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice that began Tuesday [10 Jan
2006] and sees the faithful sacrifice sheep and cows often brought
from rural areas to cities for sale. Although sheep and cattle are
not affected by avian influenza, doctors say animals that have lived
in close proximity with infected poultry could carry the virus on
their skin or hooves.

China says bird flu outlook "not optimistic"
-----------------------------------------------
China, along with Viet Nam, has suffered numerous outbreaks in
poultry since October 2005, and Beijing has launched sweeping
measures to stop the virus spreading and infecting more people,
including a campaign to vaccinate all domestic poultry. Late last
month [December 2005], China announced its third death from bird flu.
Officials say the preponderance of small family farms, a lack of
well-trained local officials and the world's biggest poultry
population will make it hard to contain the disease in China.
The Agriculture Ministry has warned that the risk of the virus
spreading could be higher during the Chinese Lunar New Year, which
falls at the end of January this year [2006], as meat consumption and
the transport of live poultry increases. China's poultry industry,
which state media says lost 60 billion yuan (USD 7.44 billion at USD
1 = 8.062 Yuan) alone in the 4th quarter of 2005, is gearing up for
more losses, according to one senior official. "Prices of chicks have
fallen 80 percent, and the price of chicken in the markets is down 20
percent," Deng Fujiang, vice chairman of the China Meat Association,
told Reuters. Less severe poultry outbreaks in 2004 cost the industry
an estimated 30 billion yuan (USD 4 billion), and the final figure
for 2005 was likely to be far higher, he said. We don't even want to
think about the losses incurred last year," Deng said.
China has been strictly controlling the movement of poultry around
the country since last Autumn [2005], even going as far as to set up
special quarantine stations outside major cities to ensure no live
birds get in. It has done little to boost consumer confidence. "In
our surveys, 40 percent of people said they are either eating less
poultry, or have stopped altogether," Deng said.
