Changes to Western Australia's (WA) equine influenza (EI) movement
conditions from 10 Mar 2009 will allow horses from non-infected states
to enter WA without having to complete any isolation periods.

Department animal biosecurity director Dr Ashley Mercy said the
changes are supported by the WA horse industry and come as a result of
no new infected properties being detected since Christmas Day [25 Dec]
2007 [sic, must be typo, Australia has only been free of this disease
since July 2008 -- see ProMED archive (04) below. - Mod.JW].

"The national EI response program is on track to complete the testing
necessary to show that NSW and Queensland are free of EI," Dr Mercy
said. "We expect the testing to be finished by the end of March
[2009].

"There are no longer any restrictions on the movement of horses from
the white zones of NSW [New South Wales] and Queensland to the
adjoining states of Victoria, South Australia, and the Northern
Territory."

Dr Mercy said that under the new conditions, owners wanting to move
horses from the non-infected states will need to apply for a permit
to move to WA, and provide a declaration that the horses had been in
the non-infected state for at least 14 days. "Owners wanting to move
horses from the white zones of New South Wales or Queensland will
need to apply for a permit to move," he said. "Owners will also need
to provide a declaration that the horses have been in the white zone
for 14 days and have not had contact with horses recently moved from
other zones in those state.

"Horses from zones other than white zones will not be able to move
directly to Western Australia.

"Should any new cases of EI be found in Australia, movements to WA
would cease immediately."

The changes to the movement conditions have been endorsed by the WA
Equine Influenza Industry Group.

The conditions for used horse gear remain unchanged with gear needing
to be clean and declared to quarantine inspectors on arrival in WA.

Equine influenza is a notifiable disease. Horses showing any signs of
respiratory infection must be reported to a local veterinarian or to
the emergency animal disease hotline 1800 675 888.
