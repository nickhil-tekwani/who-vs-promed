A high-level team, headed by Additional Director General, Ministry of Environment and Forests Debabrata Swain, will visit Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) to assess death of elephants which were attributed to anthrax and in some cases elephant endothelial herpes virus (EEHV). The team will hold meetings with STR staff on [Thu 12 Oct 2017] and make a field visit on [Fri 13 Oct 2017].

The team comprises 2 Chief Wildlife Wardens, Director, Project Elephant and 3 veterinarians. A series of elephant deaths in STR and on its fringe areas were attributed to anthrax in 2016 as well as this year [2017]. Preliminary investigation as well as examination by Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) also confirmed several deaths caused by anthrax in a number of cases.

Wildlife disease experts are also looking at the prevalence of EEHV which affects the blood vessels. Though both the diseases appear similar, only a deeper investigation could zero in on the exact cause.

However, anthrax being dangerously contagious, the Forest Department has followed a strict protocol about preliminary investigation as well as disposal of carcasses so as to confine its spread. So far, it has worked and not communicated to cattle and human beings living in fringe areas of Similipal as well in other parts of Mayurbhanj. In fact, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had submitted a report to National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) earlier this year [2017] about an elephant death after allegations that it was buried in haste in Mayurbhanj. The WII report confirmed that the elephant had contracted anthrax and its disposal was carried out as per protocol.

In this background, the high-level panel's visit assumes importance as it will not only take stock of the situation but also look at best practices adopted by Wildlife Wing in preventing the spread.

Interestingly, the Centre for Wildlife Health, a state-of-art laboratory set up at the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is now ready for sensitive molecular tests on wildlife diseases. Set up with a one-time grant from Central Zoo Authority (CZA) in 2002, it is now receiving financial assistance from Forest and Environment Department of the State Government. The Centre recently reinforced itself with latest equipment and chemicals required for EEHV which needs sensitive tests.

According to Prof Niranjan Sahu, Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine, the exact reason of death cannot always be ascertained from clinical signs which are why detailed investigations are required. But collection of samples in such deaths is a challenge given the sensitivity of the cases. "However, the Centre has reached a stage where all critical investigations for anthrax and EEHV can now be conducted using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods," he told this paper.

The Centre has already collected 7 samples this year [2017] alone and has more from previous years which would be taken up for investigation shortly.

[In a previous report [Mon 3 Apr 2017 Anthrax - India (05): (OR) elephant 20170403.4944438] it was clear that there were problems diagnosing the cause of death in elephants in this park. This new investigation will help to clarify the true situation and on a personal note, welcome to the joys of genomic studies of real cases. It should be exciting and fulfilling for our Indian colleagues. And whatever the pleasures of the laboratory keep mud on your boots.
