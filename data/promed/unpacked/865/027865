The detection of one positive case of Chagas disease in El Negrito and 3 suspected cases in Santa Rita has prompted an alarm from health authorities in these municipalities who are already struggling to stop the spread of the [insect vector] which transmits the disease.

"We are worried. The insect that transmits the disease has increased and therefore we already have one positive and several suspected cases in the infested areas in the San Jose sector, in the high zone of the Mico Quemado mountain, where there are 17 communities", said Ronal Vallejo, Environmental Health Technician in El Negrito.

The Health Authorities in Santa Rita, where they also have the presence of the vector, share a similar concern and they have already done several laboratory tests on possible cases of people infected by the parasite from the ['chinche picuda', triatomine vector].

Despite the seriousness of the situation, Health employees face a number of obstacles in developing control measures to combat and prevent Chagas disease, one of which is the lack of vehicles necessary to go to the areas where the bug [insect vector] is. In Santa Rita, the car used for the campaign has been in poor condition since July [2012]. In El Negrito they have a vehicle, but in poor condition, thereby threatening the physical safety of the crew that currently runs fumigation activities.

Vallejo said that the San Jose sector is an endemic zone [for Chagas disease], and because of that, the Health Center, which provides coverage to 17 villages, receives on a daily basis the insect vector captured by the residents from both inside and outside of their homes. "The species are _Triatoma dimidiata_ and _Rhodnius prolixus_, both of which transmit Chagas disease, and although the [war against the vector and disease] is continuing the [insects] still appear in a good percentage of these communities where the majority of the houses are built of wattle and daub, adobe and wood, the habitats of the [insect vector]"

The official said the extermination activities are developed with the support of the central Ministry of Health, which provides the insecticide for killing the insect vector, and the municipality, which pays for the teams that fumigate the houses.

"This is a symptomatic disease; a person may have been bitten by the insect and have carried the parasite for approximately 20 years without presenting symptoms. For this reason it is important to take blood specimens in order to rule out this possibility," he explained. As part of the control program developed in El Negrito, Vallejo said that in November [2012] they will begin a serosurvey of children between 6 months and 15 years of age in the affected area, with the goal to know their health status and to verify they are not carriers of the parasite. In the event of a positive test indicating the presence of the parasite, they will be referred for appropriate treatment immediately.

The medication used is made in Uruguay and Argentina, and is acquired through special orders according to needed quantities due to its high cost.

Dolores Maradiaga, Environmental Health technician from Santa Rita, said there was permanent surveillance in the communities of Capulin, Guanchias Crick, Placido, El Sitio, and Tapiquilares, all communities high on the mountain. "We are awaiting laboratory results sent to Yoro on 3 suspected cases" she said.

A resident of the San Jose de El Negrito sector expressed concern about the threat. "We hope that the health authorities will not stop their assistance and will protect our lives from the [triatomid bug]."

[Over the past 7 years ProMED has focused on foodborne transmission of Chagas disease. Based on the present data it is not possible to know how much is traditional transmission by triatomid bugs, which role congenital transmission has, and if oral transmission is also involved. ProMED will be happy to post more details of the outbreak. - Mod.EP
