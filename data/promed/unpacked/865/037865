In central Gujarat [state], 5 more children have died in the suspected Chandipura virus outbreak in the last 2 days, taking the total number of deaths to 8 since Sunday [20 Jul 2014].

While 4 children, all below the age of 10, died at Sir Sayajirao General Hospital (SSGH) throughout Tuesday [22 Jul 2014]; earlier on Monday [21 Jul 2014], a 5-year-old boy from Vadagam in Lunawada taluka of Mahisagar district had been rushed to Modasa for treatment where he died on Monday.

On Sunday [20 Jul 2014], 3 children from Bara village in Devgadh Baria taluka in Dahod had died of the virus.

On Tuesday [22 Jul 2014], a 9-year-old child from Latipura village in Vadodara district's Padra taluka succumbed to liver dysfunction and intestinal bleeding. [Also,] a 5-year-old from Navapura in Vadodara taluka, a 4-year-old from Ghoghamba in Panchmahal district and a 3-year-old from Borkheda in Dahod district died of similar symptoms.

Dr Sheila Aiyer of SSGH's department of paediatrics said that the 4 children who died on Tuesday were brought in a critical condition of viral encephalitis. "They were unconscious and were suffering from convulsions and fits along with high fever when brought to us. We tried the supportive treatment recommended for viral infections, but the children were not responding," she said.

Vadodara district health officer Dr M T Chhari said that the blood samples of the patients have been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The 3 other patients who were admitted to SSGH on Sunday are stable even as one of them remained in the intensive care unit.

[It will be interesting to know if the etiology of these encephalitis cases is confirmed as due to Chandipura virus infections. ProMED would appreciate receiving results of the tests being done at the National Institute of Virology.

Mod.CP commented in a 2004 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20040923.2621): "As noted previously in ProMED-mail, Chandipura virus is a ubiquitous infectious agent on the Indian sub-continent which can infect humans and many other mammalian species. The high background of specific antibodies and virus RNA in the population of India combine to obscure any potential role of this virus in pediatric illnesses, and the matter remains unresolved. Until the data accumulated at the Institute of Virology in Pune are published in full, doubt will remain about the significance of Chandipura virus as a human pathogen."

Chandipura virus infections were considered relatively benign prior to the reports of encephalitis coming out of India in 2004. It would be interesting to conduct genomic analysis of Chandipura virus from the current outbreak, if confirmed, so that comparative genetic studies can be made of a current Indian isolate with those made during the previous outbreak as well as the prototype virus.
