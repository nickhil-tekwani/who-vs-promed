Investigating a virus that attacks the Pyrenees' Chamois
--------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Environmental Health and the Veterinary Faculty of the
Autonomous University [of Barcelona] are investigating the origin of a
virus that is attacking the population of Pyrenees Chamois.
The project began last year, when it was noted that some of these animals
were dying as a result of an infection of undetermined origin. The disease
debilitates the chamois, a protected species, affecting its immunological
system and leaving it defenseless. [Consequently], the affected animals may
become victims of whatever type of parasite, leading to death in a majority
of cases.
The ongoing studies are meant to discover the source of infection, as well
as to determine the actual range of the involved disease. One of the
hypotheses is that the chamois had contracted this virus upon the arrival
of an animal species that is not native to the Pyrenees, the ChamoisÂ’ habitat.
