There have been >12,000 cases of dengue, with nearly 400 deaths, over the
past few months in Indonesia, the Media Indonesia newspaper said on Monday.
Most of the cases have been children. Officials at a leading Jakarta
hospital said there is no sign of decrease in cases, which occurs during
the October-April monsoons season.
A doctor at Cipto Mangun Kusumo Hospital said 57 new dengue fever victims
arrived there as of midday Monday and 48 of them were children.

[Most of the cases have been in children? Molecular epidemiologic and
pathogenetic studies of some of the isolates from this epidemic might
provide useful information regarding topotype variations. Does anyone know
of a situation in which all four dengue viruses are so common that
surviving adults are immune to all dengue viruses? This might be such an
instance. We will try to keep a close watch on this apparently serious
situation. - Mod.CHC
