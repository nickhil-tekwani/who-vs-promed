26 typhoid cases erupt in Nueva Vizcaya town
----------------------------------
BAMBANG, Nueva Vizcaya - At least 26 persons here were infected with
typhoid fever within a span of only a week this month, raising fears
of a possible outbreak of the infectious disease in this town.
According to reports, 23 of the infected persons are students of the
town's national high school. The remaining 3 are teachers of the same
school.
Eloisa Ang, principal of Bambang National High School, confirmed the
report yesterday, 20 Jul 2002, as she expressed fears that more
students could be afflicted with the bacteria if no appropriate
measure is taken to prevent its possible outbreak.
The disease, she said, started following the heavy rainfall affecting
the province for the past 3 weeks. Students, she said, complained of
high fever during the second week of this month.
Dr. Anthony Cortez, the town health officer, said that the disease
could be traced from sample of water from ambulant vendors.

[_S. typhi_ is one of the only salmonellae that is solely a human
pathogen and not a zoonosis. Water-borne typhoid fever is always a
concern with the combination of heavy rainfall and suboptimal sewer
systems when water supplies (which may also be suboptimal) may become
more contaminated. With all the cases apparently concentrated in one
school involving students and teachers, one would be concerned about
a source of the organism in the school itself. Information about
these vendors and the relationship to the school students and
teachers is not given. - Mod.LL]
