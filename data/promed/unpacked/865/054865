EU bans beef imports from Paraguay due to epidemic concerns
-------------------------------------------------
The European Union (EU) decided on Thu, 20 Feb 2003 to ban beef imports
from Paraguay due to concerns over foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
The EU member states, following a proposal from the European Commission,
agreed to ban all imports of fresh beef from Paraguay due to serious
problems with control and supervision measures related to the disease, said
a press release from the commission, the EU's executive arm.
"A recent inspection carried out in Paraguay by the Commission's Food and
Veterinary Office (FVO) found some serious failures in animal health
controls, in particular concerning FMD. Failures were also found in the
performance of the competent authority and in the export certification
system of beef for the EU," the press release said.
In the light of the EU experience with FMD in 2001, the European Commission
deemed it essential to send a strong message to Paraguay and indeed other
countries to respect their commitments to put reinforced controls and
safeguards in place, it said.
The EU said it only imported de-boned and maturated beef (guaranteeing
destruction of the FMD virus) from regions where strict animal health
control measures were in place, while imports from other regions were banned.
In October 2002, Paraguay reported a FMD outbreak in an area not authorized
for export to the EU and guaranteed that appropriate measures would be
taken. Despite these guarantees, the situation has not improved much,
according to the statement.
The latest inspection revealed insufficient controls in the production
chain, including inadequate controls on the movement of animals between
zones authorized for exports and non-authorized zones, it added.
Between January and October of 2002, the EU imported 567 tons of beef from
Paraguay.
The EU said it would review the decision to ban exports of beef from
Paraguay when the Paraguayan authorities can give sufficient guarantees
that the deficiencies have been dealt with.

[No data on the outcome of the recent visit of the FVO inspection team to
Paraguay are yet available on the relevant EU web-site:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/inspections/vi/reports/paraguay/index_en.html>
The previous FVO mission to Paraguay took place 15-20 Jul 2002, and its
recommendations reportedly implemented.
The current decision of the EU follows OIE's announcement, which said:
"Following the isolation of foot and mouth disease virus from bovine
samples collected in Canindey'u Department, the status of "FMD free country
with vaccination" of Paraguay is suspended with effect from 4 Nov 2002".
The last follow-up report of Paraguay to the OIE on the evolvement of the
FMD outbreak there, is dated 11 Nov 2002 (posted by ProMED-mail; see 4th
reference). - Mod.AS]
