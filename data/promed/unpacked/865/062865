Up to 25 medical students at the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Kalaburagi district in Karnataka have contracted the vaccine-preventable disease, diphtheria. All the cases have been reported at GIMS Girl Hostel in recent days.

While 5 of the students were given treatment on an outpatient basis as their condition was found to be stable, 20 others remain in the hospital and are undergoing treatment.

All the 110 students residing in the girl's hostel were screened by the ENT [Ear, Nose, Throat] Department as they were suffering from fever, sore throat and patch over tonsils.

The 1st student was diagnosed on [30 Aug 2019] by doctors in the ENT department at the hospital. Hospital officials suspect that she was exposed to a patient in the outpatient department (OPD) who had diphtheria.

Diphtheria is an acute bacterial infection of the respiratory system, which can cause mild to severe illness. Symptoms, develop 2-5 days after infection, include fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands in the neck. Severe illness presents with swollen neck and thick gray or white patch of dead tissue in the throat and tonsils caused by the bacterial toxin.

Complications are blocking of the airway and absorption of the toxin into the blood stream that may cause damage to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral nerves and thus can lead to death. The severely ill patient must visit a hospital for a special medical care immediately to save life.

Diphtheria is spread from person to person, usually through respiratory droplets, from coughing, sneezing, and close contact. A person can also get infected by contacting with shared utensils contaminated with the bacteria. Some mild cases can transmit the bacteria to people around them. Recovered patients might not develop immunity against the disease. The best way to prevent diphtheria is to get vaccinated.

[A discussion of diphtheria in general and in India can be found in moderator ML's comments in ProMED posts Diphtheria - India: (Haryana) fatal, suspected 20120908.1285940; Diphtheria, fatal - India (02): (RJ), low immuniz. rate 20110719.2185; Diphtheria, fatal - India: (RN) low immunization rate 20110717.2162; and Diphtheria - Norway ex Mozambique: cutaneous, traveler 20140621.2556752.

Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. In India, under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), vaccines for 6 vaccine-preventable diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, poliomyelitis, and measles) are available for free of cost to all. UIP was launched in 1985 to attain the target to immunize all eligible children by 1990. However, the UIP has been reported to have failed to meet its goals (http://www.isical.ac.in/~wemp/Papers/PaperNilanjanPatra.pdf).

The news report above says that up to 25 medical students at the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences in the Indian state of Karnataka have diphtheria, but an additional 110 students residing in the girl's hostel, screened by the ENT Department, are said to be suffering from fever, sore throat, and "patch over tonsils", which may very well be diphtheria. The diphtheria outbreak in the medical students is thought to have started by exposure of the index case to a patient in the outpatient department who had diphtheria.

Healthcare workers are particularly at risk for exposure to communicable diseases, such as diphtheria, and healthcare workers can play a role in the spread of infection among themselves and their patients. For this reason, this group should be targeted for vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html). The CDC recommends that healthcare workers get a one-time dose of Tdap as soon as possible if they have not received Tdap previously (regardless of when previous dose of Td was received) (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html). If not fully vaccinated against diphtheria as a child, an adolescent, as these "medical students" may be, should receive catch-up vaccinations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/catchup.html).

Close contacts of the medical students with diphtheria should also receive antimicrobial prophylaxis and diphtheria vaccinations (https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-contacts.pdf). Contacts should also be closely watched for signs of illness.

Karnataka, with about 61 million residents in 2011, is a state in the southwestern region of India and is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the south; its capital and largest city is Bangalore (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka).

Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences is a medical college located in the city of Gulbarga, Karnataka that is run by the Government of Karnataka with an attached 750-bed teaching hospital; the institute offers a 4.5 year MBBS [Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery] course with a one-year compulsory rotating internship in affiliated hospitals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbarga_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences).
