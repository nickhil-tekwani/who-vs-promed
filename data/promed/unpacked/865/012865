[Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Mozambique.

"On 29 Jun 2022, a single VP1 sequence was received from the Botswana Vaccine Institute. The sequence was derived from a sample collected from cattle in Tete Province close to the borders with Zambia and Malawi. Genotyping revealed that it belonged to the FMD type O EA-2 topotype and was closely related to viruses from Zambia and Malawi."
