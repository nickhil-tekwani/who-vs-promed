On 25 Sep 2019, a rodent and guinea pig die-off was reported to the health authorities of the Aru Health Zone, Ituri Province, DRC, in the village of Omeyi in the Ongoyi health area. Subsequently a family cluster of 4 cases with the clinical symptoms consistent with the definition of bubonic plague was reported. Symptoms were high fever in 3 patients and high fever with a painful inguinal swollen lymph node in the 15-year-old patient. This family was admitted at the health center of Ekanga on 25 Sep 2019; unfortunately, the 15-year-old boy died on 26 Sep 2019. The other 3 patients were treated with doxycycline (200 mg/day for 5 days).

The DRC health zone team arrived on 27 Sep 2019 to spray the houses with deltamethrin, take human and wildlife samples, and raise community awareness of the measures to be taken. In response to this situation, the head of the Health Center of Ekanga alerted the Central Office of the health zone, and 225 villagers were given doxycycline preventively (single 200-mg dose for adults and children ). A plague rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was performed on the 3 other patients but only one was weakly positive, possibly due to antibiotic treatment. Two samples taken on the dying guinea pigs (lymph node aspirate) were strongly positive with the same RDT.

In total, 12 suspected plague cases (4 male, 8 female) and 3 deaths have been reported since 27 Sep 2019: 7 cases and 3 deaths from Omeyi, 3 cases from Ongoyi, 1 case from Doro and 1 case from Alembele village.

The provincial division of health is closely monitoring the situation and should send a team to the outbreak site on 7 Oct 2019. Rodent samples have been stored in ethanol for PCR diagnostic confirmation of bubonic plague.

The location of the village in proximity with the Ugandan border (20 km [12.4 mi] maximum) and with people seeking treatment in Uganda presents an additional risk of transborder outbreak as earlier this year [2019]. In March 2019, a 35-year-old woman died of pneumonic plague in Uganda after spending time in Atungulei village in DRC's Ituri province, and where her 4-year-old child had died days before. Further investigation revealed that finding her sick at her child's burial, her relatives took her to Uganda for treatment.

[ProMED is grateful to Drs. Adroba, Laudisoit, and Karesh for reporting this cluster of rodent and human plague occurring in Ituri, DRC. Although rodents and their fleas are the source of human plague, we don't often identify ill and dying animals in proximity and in advance of human cases.

From Mod.LL: "Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo'. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death."

Plague is endemic in this region of DRC, and this outbreak adds to the woes of a region where Ebola virus disease and measles have been occurring. Moreover, symptoms and signs of plague may overlap with those of Ebola and complicate diagnosis and provision of appropriate medical care. ProMED reported plague in an adjacent region of Uganda in March 2019 (Archive number 20190312.6363171). - Mod.LM
