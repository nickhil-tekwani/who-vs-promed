A Burlington [Ontario] long-term care [LTC] facility has essentially closed the home until further notice due to an outbreak of a respiratory virus [RSV] that has sickened some LTC residents and staff. Village of Tansley Woods LTC home assistant general manager Augustin James told the Post today [24 Dec 2014] that an outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was declared at the facility on 10 Dec [2014].

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website says symptoms of RSV infection are similar to other respiratory infections. The illness usually begins 4-6 days after exposure with a runny nose and decrease in appetite. Coughing, sneezing, and fever typically develop 1-3 days later. Wheezing may also occur. RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes into the air, creating virus-containing droplets that can linger briefly in the air, says CDC.

James said a total of 26 residents and 11 staff have contracted RSV in the LTC home since the outbreak with 12 residents and 3 staff still exhibiting symptoms. No official causes of death or hospitalizations that have occurred in the LTC home since 10 Dec [2014] have been related to RSV. Tansley's companion retirement residence, which can house 250-plus seniors, has not been impacted by the outbreak and remains open with no restrictions.

The LTC centre, which has a capacity for 144 residents, has been closed. While they are not encouraging visitors to the LTC facility at this time, James said family members can visit loved ones if they follow infectious disease isolation protocol such as wearing a gown and facemask and washing their hands. It is not until at least 8 symptom-free days for the last person with RSV that the facility can declare the outbreak over.

RSV can be serious, especially for some infants and older adults. RSV is the commonest cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children younger than one year old in the US, says CDC. The virus is recognized more often as a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults.

Irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties may be the only symptoms of infection in an infant. Most healthy babies infected with RSV don't need to be hospitalized, says CDC. In most cases, even among those who need to be hospitalized, hospitalization usually only lasts a few days, and full recovery from illness occurs in about 1-2 weeks. There is no specific treatment for RSV infection.

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are commonest in children and occasionally occur in older people in care facilities, such as the one above, during the colder months of the year. Mod.CP provided a helpful comment about RSV and its infections (ProMED-mail archive no 20131025.2021165): "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is highly communicable, but humans are the only known reservoir. The incubation period varies from 2 to 8 days. The virus is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons via respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. By 2 years of age, nearly all children have been infected by RSV at least once. Previous infection by RSV may confer only partial immunity to RSV, and so individuals may be infected repeatedly with the same or different strains of RSV.

"Predisposing factors for RSV infection include prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease, and immunodeficiency, and may also include other factors such as tobacco exposure, day care attendance, overcrowding, lack of breastfeeding, and admission to hospital during the RSV season. Epidemics in care homes for elderly people have been common in some years.

"Two major subtypes (A and B) have been identified based on structural variations in the G protein, and an increasing number of distinct genotypes are in circulation. The predominance of a subtype changes over successive seasons, but so far has not been associated with disease severity."
