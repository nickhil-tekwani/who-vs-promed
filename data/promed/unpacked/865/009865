Cuiaba Health Surveillance is investigating the deaths of 11 monkeys
in the Jardim Aquaius neighborhood during the 21 - 28 Oct [2011]
period. Expertise was brought to bear in the locality and the state
Secretariat of Health awaits the results done in the laboratory to
know the cause of death of the primates. The Ministry of Health
considers that with just one primate death, they must issue an alert
for the possible occurrence of human yellow fever [YF] cases. The
agency is also working on the [alternative] hypothesis [that the
primates] were poisoned.

Without knowing the results of the laboratory tests, the
Superintendency of Health Surveillance stepped forward and initiated
control and prevention measures so that possible urban disease [YF]
would not occur. According to the Secretariat, Brazil has not had
urban cases of the disease since 1942.

_Hemagogus_ and _Sabathes_ mosquitoes are the vectors that can
transmit the disease [YF virus]. These insects bite a monkey that has
the virus [viremia], and later the insects bite humans and could
transmit the disease [virus].

Also, according to the Secretariat, pest control and guidance [for the
populace] are being carried out in the neighborhoods near the
occurrence. Surveillance is also vaccinating people who have not
received doses of vaccine in the past 10 years.

>From 1992 - 2006 the state of Mato Grosso has had 22 cases of yellow
fever with 13 of these leading to death and 9 recovered. In 2007, the
state had a [human] case of the disease in the Juara municipality; in
2008 2 cases in Novo Sao Joaquim and Guaranta do Norte; and in 2009 2
cases in Feliz Natal. In 2010, no cases were registered nor have there
been any in 2011, either.

"These cases refer to its sylvan form. Mato Grosso has not registered
yellow fever in its urban cycle since 1942," explained Oberdan Lira.

[The program of epidemiological surveillance and control of YF in
Brazil has as its main pillars surveillance of epizootics in non-human
primates based on detection, notification and laboratory investigation
of ill or dead primates. - Mod.RNA]

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of YF virus transmission in Brazil
since 2009. Concern about spill-over of the sylvan (jungle) YF virus
transmission cycle with initiation of urban transmission is prudent.
In 2008, this occurred in neighboring Paraguay, just 15 km (9 mi) from
the national capital, Asuncion. Given the presence of sufficient
populations of _Aedes aegypti_ for dengue outbreaks in Brazil, concern
about the risk of urban YF virus transmission is real since this
mosquito also transmits YF virus efficiently. The preventive measures
being initiated, despite the unavailability of laboratory
confirmation, is prudent.
