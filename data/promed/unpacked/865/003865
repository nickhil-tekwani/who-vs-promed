The Secretary of Health, Arita Bergmann, signed, during a virtual meeting held on Wed 28 Apr 2021, Ordinance 341/2021, which declares a Public Health Emergency of State Importance (ESPIE) in Rio Grande do Sul due to the confirmation of the circulation of the yellow fever [YF] virus.

During the meeting, the creation of the Arboviroses Emergency Operations Center (COE) was also announced, with the participation of representatives from the Federation of Municipalities of RS (FAMUR) and the Council of Municipal Health Secretariats (COSEMS). Also announced was the publication of a manual with guidance on arboviruses (which are diseases transmitted by infected mosquitoes, such as yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses). The guidance manual is available at http://www.saude.rs.gov.br from the Secretariat of Health (SES).

The last Epidemiological Bulletin of arboviruses, referring to the period from 18-24 Apr [2021], states that there are 23 municipalities with confirmed [YF] virus circulation. This group, considered a red area, is formed by municipalities where dead primates were found that were infected by mosquitoes in forested areas that transmit the virus disease. Another 72 municipalities located in the vicinity are considered to be yellow areas, with the risk of also having the virus circulating. So far, the disease has not been detected in humans.

"RS is on alert; we already have a dengue epidemic, and currently we are in an emergency situation with regard to yellow fever," stated Secretary Arita Bergmann. According to the secretary: "What is necessary at this moment is an effective integration of the health care network with the Regional Health Coordinators (CRSs) and municipal health managers. In addition to the concern with the coronavirus, which we have been facing for more than a year, we need to be vigilant, preventing other epidemics from reaching Rio Grande do Sul."

Yellow fever is an acute febrile infectious disease that can be sylvatic [forest] or urban. The virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and not transmitted directly person-to-person. The cases that occur in Brazil are sylvan, when the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes that live in forested areas. There have been no cases of urban yellow fever transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ since 1942. In the forested areas, the deaths of non-human primates (epizootics) serve as sentinels for the arrival of the virus in a given region.

Rio Grande do Sul has not registered the presence of the virus that causes yellow fever since 2009. In January 2021, the case of a dead howler monkey in the municipality of Pinhal da Serra, in the Serrana region close to the border with Santa Catarina, was confirmed [as YF]. "Since the circulation of the yellow fever virus was detected due to the presence of dead non-human primates, teams have been present in the field in order to locate and monitor all events that have been recorded for 12 consecutive weeks since January [2021]," said biologist Marco Antonio Barreto de Almeida of the State Center Health Surveillance (CEVAS).

In the period from July 2020 to 26 Apr 2021, the State Health Surveillance Center (CEVS) registered 266 cases of dead monkeys. To face the spread of yellow fever, the expert says that "we need to vaccinate the [human] population, investigate the presence of dead primates, and also protect primates [from people killing them], as they are not responsible for transmitting viruses [directly] to humans."

The head of the Epidemiological Surveillance division, Tani Ranieri, stressed that "the vaccination strategy must be intensified immediately to increase coverage in red and yellow areas, mainly people living in rural, forested, and disturbed areas where rural and urban activities mix."

The vaccine against yellow fever, part of the calendar of the National Immunization Program (PNI), can be found in the Primary Care Health Units.

For prevention, Tani stressed that it is also necessary to train the service network to raise awareness about the specific characteristics of arboviruses and enable early treatment. "The signs and symptoms of various diseases overlap, but it is necessary that health professionals recognize differences, as in the case of Covid-19, where the lack of smell and taste is the main differential."

Tani explained that the [YF] vaccination schedule provides for the 1st dose at 9 months and a booster at 4 years. From 5-59 years of age, the vaccine is a single dose. Since 2018, the entire territory of RS has been considered as a vaccination area against yellow fever.

Representatives of the State Secretariat for the Environment, COSEMS, FaAMURS, municipal health secretaries, mayors, directors, and technicians from SES participated in the virtual meeting.

[The efforts to intensify surveillance for the presence of YF in monkeys in the area and to vaccinate people in the area is prudent. The dead howler monkey was found near the border of Santa Catarina. There have been several monkey deaths from yellow fever this year [2021] in Santa Catarina state. The number of human cases has increased from 2 reported on 11 Mar 2021 (see Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (SC) human, monkey 20210315.8247346) to 3 (see Yellow fever - Americas (08): Brazil (SC) 20210413.8305780). These human cases represent spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Fortunately, there has been no urban yellow fever transmission in Brazil since 1942.

Increased surveillance is important to know where yellow fever virus transmission is taking place. People living in these localities should be vaccinated to avoid more human cases. - Mod.TY
