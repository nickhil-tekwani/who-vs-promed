Request for Information
-----------------------
At a recent conference on pandemic planning, a speaker referenced an
article from the journal 'Nature Medicine', Dec. 2004 issue, which
implied that approximately 35 million (yes, 35 million) Chinese
citizens are estimated to have antibodies to H5N1. A participant in
the audience asked for clarification / confirmation of that statement
from the speaker, and it was confirmed.

However, the next presenter from the CDC had never heard reference to
this, nor had anyone else. Clearly the implications to this
statement would be profound. Has anyone heard of this or have any
information on it?

[PrroMED-mail would like to hear from anyone who can provide
clarification of this statement which has important bearing on
interpretation of the epidemiology of avian influenza in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
