Bird flu outbreak in Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------
Over 100 domestic birds have died of bird flu in a village in northern
Kazakhstan, Kazakh chief veterinarian Asylbek Kozhmuratov said on Tuesday
[16 Aug 2005].

Bird flu outbreaks had previously been discovered in 5 regions of northern
and central Kazakhstan.

Kozhmuratov said the Kazakh Agriculture Ministry wanted to ban the fall
hunt for wild birds, as they could potentially be infected, and to conduct
bird vaccinations.

Dr. Nikola T. Belev, the president of the International Epizootic Bureau's
Regional Commission for Europe, said that, if bird flu "spread to Europe
where there were many birds, the disaster would be equal to 2 tsunamis."

Over 9000 birds have been slaughtered in Kazakhstan to prevent the disease
from spreading further.

[The official notifications of Kazakhstan to the OIE (last update: 9 Aug
2005) have, so far, mentioned one affected province (oblast): Pavlodar, in
northeastern Kazakhstan, bordering the Russian province Novosibirsk. The
disease affected geese. Yesil is situated distantly west of Pavlodar. Data
on the species involved in the additional outbreaks are not available.

The Republic of Kazakhstan, in central Asia, borders on Siberian Russia in
the north, China in the east, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan in
the south, and the Caspian Sea and European Russia in the west. It is the
9th largest country in the world: about 1 050 000 square miles (2 719 500
sq km), almost 4 times the size of Texas, with a population (as of 1995) of
about 17.4 million. Kazakhstan is administratively divided into 14
provinces (oblasts) and 3 cities. - Mod.AS]
