Confirmed case of H3N2v infection in Weber County
-------------------------------------------------
Weber-Morgan Health Department [WMHD] received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and the Utah Department of Health that a Weber County resident has tested positive for a novel influenza virus [the swine-origin H3N2 reassortant now designated H3N2v] that has been identified in several isolated cases in the United States.

The individual was not hospitalized and recovered at home. As a precaution, all known contacts have been advised to watch for fever, cough, and other flu-like symptoms and to contact their physician if necessary.

While considered novel, the A/H3N2v, influenza virus is genetically similar to those which circulate in pigs. It is common practice for the CDC to monitor diseases that are capable of transmitting from animals to humans, says Gary House, director of the Weber-Morgan Health Department.

"Fortunately, this individual is getting better,"Ã¹ House said. "We know there have been 12 other cases with in the past year in the United States that have also fully recovered. We are working with the CDC, the Utah Department of Health, and Utah Department of Agriculture and Food to determine how the individual was exposed to this particular flu virus."

As with all other flu viruses, House reminds the community to take preventive measures such as covering coughs and sneezes, staying at home while ill, and washing hands frequently. "We learned from the H1N1 experience of 2009 that the public's willingness to follow these simple precautions is the best line of defense." House said.

[Previously cases of human infection with this variant H3N2 virus (H3N2v) have been seen in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Maine, and West Virginia. Most have been in children younger than 10 and none of the cases has died. 6 of the 12 had exposure to pigs but in the other 6, no contact with swine could be found. The CDC has said it believes some of these cases are the result of human-to-human spread, but suggests spread among people is probably still limited at this point.

Swine influenza virus (SIV) H3N2 with triple reassorted internal genes (TRIG) has been enzootic in US since 1998. Transmission of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus to pigs in the US was followed by reassortment with endemic SIV, resulting in reassorted viruses that include the novel H3N2 genotypes (rH3N2p). The swine-origin H3N2v strain includes the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus.
