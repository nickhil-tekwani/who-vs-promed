The Ministry of Natural Resources is destroying all raccoons and skunks in a
5km radius of a Prescott-Maynard home after discovering the first confirmed
case of rabies in a raccoon in Ontario.
-The first Canadian case of raccoon rabies was confirmed on Wed 14 Jul 1999
by Dr. Alex Wandelar at the Canadian Food Inspection laboratory in Nepean. A
monoclonal antibody test identified the infection as Atlantic Raccoon Rabies
virus, previously unseen on this side of the border.
-The infected raccoon was found dead on private property on 14 Jul 1999
between the villages of Maynard and Domville, about 5km northwest of
Prescott and 20 km east of Brockville. Its body was discovered in a kennel
with 3 dogs, who appeared to have fought with it and killed it. All 3 dogs
suffered bites to their faces and mouths.
-The owner of the dogs opted to have them destroyed rather than quarantine
them on his property for 6 months to see if the disease developed.
-The Ministry of Natural Resources is asking people to report the location
of any raccoon exhibiting abnormal behavior: foaming at the mouth,
staggering, apathy, or unusual aggression; by calling 1-888-574-6656.
-Anyone who thinks they've had contact with a rabies-infected animal
anywhere in Leeds, Grenville and Lanark counties is asked to report it to
the Medical Officer of Health there at call the unit's Brockville office at
(613) 345-5685 or 1-800-660-5853. The health unit can also provide more
information on rabies.
Dr. Rick Rosatte heads the ministry's Peterborough Rabies Research Unit, &
is now
anticipating that he'll be pulling 18-hour work shifts in the Prescott area
for the next 2 weeks, trying to contain and eradicate the virus before it
can become established in Canada. "It's a miracle we haven't gotten it
before," he said. "We knew it was inevitable." Raccoons in Ontario have been
susceptible to the fox strain of rabies since the 1950s. Rosatte estimated
that the fox rabies virus kills between 30 and 40 raccoons in the province
each year.
Rosatte said the joint federal-provincial ministries team he's working with
had a plan to deal with this eventuality since 1993. It's now put into
action. The first thing they did, he said, was to call in the ministry's
professional trappers from Niagara Falls, Gananoque and the rest of the St.
Lawrence River corridor and concentrate them in a 10km radius around the
spot where the rabid raccoon was found.
It's routine for the ministry to live-trap and vaccinate raccoons throughout
the summer around border crossings and all along our side of the St.
Lawrence. This is to maintain a buffer zone of protected animals in case an
infected U.S. raccoon got through.
The Americans, for their part, fight the same annual battle, combating the
spread of raccoon rabies through the U.S. northeast with baits dropped out
of planes and laced with oral vaccine. The oral vaccine hasn't been approved
for general use in Canada, yet. Rosatte said the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency's Veterinary Biologics division has given permission to use oral
vaccine here in the current emergency, however, if the team considers it
necessary.
At the moment, they're using the traditional methods. Over a 2 week period,
the trappers, who are each assigned a 10-square-kilometre cell, will head
out early each evening armed with 1500 Tomahawk live traps. They are placed
where raccoons are more likely to venture - near the edge of forests or
water, near barns and along the edges of cornfields.
Any raccoons, foxes or skunks trapped within the inner 5km depopulation ring
will be euthanized by lethal injection. Although raccoon rabies is more
virulent in the raccoon population, foxes and skunks are susceptible.
Raccoons travel approximately 4 square kilometres every couple of nights,
said Rosatte. Animals in the inner ring that may have come in contact with
the sick animal could be incubating the disease for a period of one week to
three months. Vaccinations are not effective on infected animals, and
officials must assume that any animal within the first ring may have had
contact with the sick raccoon.
Raccoons, foxes and skunks caught in the outer 5km ring are vaccinated,
tagged and released. If an infected animal makes it into this buffer zone,
it would most likely die without passing rabies on to others.

History
---------
Raccoon rabies has been slowly making its way north from Florida since the
late 1940s. In 1977, it jumped several hundred kilometres north to Virginia,
when it is believed that raccoon hunters brought southern animals, some of
which were infected, north to replenish depleted populations. Since then,
the disease has been moving northward at a pace of about 60 kilometres a
year. By 1990, raccoon rabies was showing up in New York State and northern
New England. Nearby Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties in New York, along
the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, have reported 150 cases of
raccoon rabies in the past 18 months.
In 1994 and 1995, Ministry of Natural Resources teams began vaccinating
raccoons in the Niagara and St. Lawrence River regions in the hopes of
establishing a buffer zone of animals immune to the disease. Normally the
rivers act as a geographical barrier, and have slowed the animals getting
into Ontario. However, raccoons are good swimmers and even better
hitchhikers, aboard boats or trucks, and they´ve been expecting the arrival
of the disease in Ontario for the past couple of years. "We've had 14
tractor-trailers from the U.S. come to Toronto, open their back door and
find a raccoon inside,'' Rosatte said.
Rosatte estimates that "right now fox rabies costs [Ontario Can$6- to
7-million"
for control programs and treatment for humans who come into contact with
suspected or confirmed rabid animals. If raccoon rabies becomes established
here, he conservatively estimates that the annual bill would be at least an
equivalent amount.
The intangible social costs are harder to pin down, but Rosatte noted that
in the 1980s, before oral animal vaccine was available for fox rabies, about
2000 people annually reported being exposed to rabid animals: "Last year,
less than 900 had to be vaccinated."
Raccoons are even more adaptable to urban living than foxes. Rosatte said
few people in New York State reported contact with rabid animals prior to
the 1990s, when the raccoon rabies arrived there. But by the mid-1990s there
were about 3000 people annually who either thought or knew they had been
exposed.

On 14 Jul 1999 the first animal case in Canada caused by the raccoon strain
of the rabies virus was confirmed in a dead raccoon 10 km north of Prescott,
a town in eastern Ontario, just north of the St. Lawrence Seaway. A raccoon
had fallen into a dog compound and was killed during the altercation.
>From July 16 to 20, 351 raccoons, 70 skunks and 1 fisher have been
euthanised. Approximately 100 [feral cats have also been trapped and
released with the exception of 2 which exhibited symptoms suggestive of
rabies. Specimens from 78 of the euthanised raccoons and the 2 felines were
sent to the CFIA for testing and were negative. It is unlikely that any of
the wild animal submissions from the 0 to 5 km zone will yield any positive
confirmations as the animals had to be sufficiently healthy to be attracted
to a sardine bait inside a 2 by 4 ft trap. However the action taken is an
effort to eliminate a susceptible reservoir as well as animals possibly
incubating the virus prior to exhibiting clinical symptoms and shedding of
the agent in the vicinity of the raccoon rabies case.
Raccoon rabies is a public health concern because raccoons are plentiful in
both urban and rural areas, and humans and their pets may come into contact
with this species more often than with other wild animals. The raccoon
rabies strain is primarily spread among raccoons but does infect other
species, primarily felines. The strain was introduced to New York State in
1990, and led to an increase in the number of total animal rabies cases from
20 to 50 per year to more than 2000 per year, and of persons undergoing
post-exposure treatment from an average of less than100 per year prior to
1990 to over 10 000 in 1990-95.
The situation in Ontario may however be different from New York State as the
MNR has been effectively vaccinating foxes, the target species, and perhaps
to a very limited degree of success, raccoons, with an oral bait rabies
vaccine since 1989. Currently the incidence of animal rabies in Ontario is
less than 100 [per year?
