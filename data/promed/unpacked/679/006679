[After 5 consecutive days with no newly reported cases, there is a newly confirmed fatal case reported from Najran. This makes the 4th newly confirmed case reported from Najran since 1 Jul 2016, and the 7th newly confirmed case reported from Najran since 18 Jun 2016. Of note, 6 of the 7 newly confirmed cases from Najran were classified as primary cases -- 3 with a history of direct contact with camels, 1 with a history of indirect contact with camels, 1 with no history of contact with camels and 1 with camel contact history currently under investigation. The 1 remaining case was classified as a secondary case in a household contact. As these were presumably non-related cases (except for the household contact and possibly the woman with indirect contact with camels), is there an increase in acute MERS-CoV infections in camels in Najran ongoing at this time? ProMED-mail would welcome more information on camel studies/ investigations ongoing in Najran.

Of note, it has been 16 days since the last reported case of MERS-CoV infection from Riyadh (albeit that case was considered a primary case without a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness). Presumably an indication that the nosocomial transmission in the most recent outbreak in Riyadh has been interrupted.

[2] Saudi Arabia, transmission in extended family, 2014 - EID

Arwady MA, Alraddadi B, Basler C, Azhar EI, Abuelzein E, Sindy AI, et al. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission in extended family, Saudi Arabia, 2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Aug [date cited]. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2208.152015

Abstract
Risk factors for human-to-human transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are largely unknown. After MERS-CoV infections occurred in an extended family in Saudi Arabia in 2014, relatives were tested by using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and serologic methods. Among 79 relatives, 19 (24 percent) were MERS-CoV positive; 11 were hospitalized, and 2 died. Eleven (58 percent) tested positive by rRT-PCR; 8 (42 percent) tested negative by rRT-PCR but positive by serology. Compared with MERS-CoV-negative adult relatives, MERS-CoV-positive adult relatives were older and more likely to be male and to have chronic medical conditions. Risk factors for household transmission included sleeping in an index patient's room and touching respiratory secretions from an index patient. Casual contact and simple proximity were not associated with transmission. Serology was more sensitive than standard rRT-PCR for identifying infected relatives, highlighting the value of including serology in future investigations.

[The above article adds to the slowly growing body of literature addressing risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission. In this case transmission occurred among members of an extended family involving 79 individuals -- 50 lived in the 4 involved households, 26 were relatives visiting those households and 3 were ill adults in a separate branch of the family tree. An interesting finding was that of the 19 confirmed MERS-CoV infections, 8 were negative by rRT-PCR but positive by serology -- demonstrating that serologic testing was more sensitive than standard rRT-PCR for identifying infection and may explain why many of the contact tracing results have concluded no transmission of the virus when there may well have been transmission "under the radar." - Mod.MPP]
