Influenza update - 378 (based on data up to 29 Sep 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns. For more information on influenza transmission zones, see https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/Influenza_Transmission_Zones20180914.pdf.

Summary
------
The current influenza surveillance data should be interpreted with caution, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has influenced to varying extents health-seeking behaviours, staffing/routines in sentinel sites, as well as testing priorities and capacities in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.

Globally, influenza activity remained at lower levels than expected for this time of the year, though increased detections were reported in some countries. In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, the influenza season remained low or below baseline. Despite continued or even increased testing for influenza in some countries in the southern hemisphere, very few influenza detections were reported.

In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained below inter-seasonal levels. In the Caribbean and Central American countries, there were no influenza detections reported. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity, likely due to COVID-19, decreased in most reporting countries.

In tropical South America, tropical Africa and Southern Asia there were sporadic or no influenza detections across reporting countries. In South East Asia, increased influenza detections were reported in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR).

Worldwide, of the very low numbers of detections reported, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 57 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 14 Sep 2020 to 27 Sep 2020 (data as of 9 Oct 03:04:42 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 50 521 specimens* during that time period. A total of 99 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 60 (60.6%) were typed as influenza A and 39 (39.4%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, none were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 50 (100%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 5 (22.7%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 17 (77.3%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO encourages countries continue routine influenza surveillance, test samples from influenza surveillance sites for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 virus where resources are available, and report this information in a timely manner to established regional and global platforms (see the Operational considerations for COVID-19 surveillance using GISRS guidance at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance-publications).

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2021 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 16-24 Sep 2020 in the format of an e-Consultation. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus (see more information at https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2021_south/en/).

*It includes data only from countries reporting on positive and negative influenza specimens.

[Will it be a mild influenza season this year or a "double whammy"?

WHO recommends that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, GISRS, regional influenza networks, and national influenza surveillance systems should prepare for the co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the upcoming and subsequent influenza seasons and for the possible emergence of influenza viruses of pandemic potential. Many countries continue to leverage the GISRS and associated surveillance systems for COVID-19 sentinel surveillance using influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) syndromic sentinel surveillance systems to monitor community transmission and geographic spread of COVID-19.

Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family's health this season. To protect your health when getting a flu vaccine, follow the CDC's recommendations for running essential errands and doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions against COVID-19 and influenza, which are the same for both diseases except with the heightened recommendation of wearing masks in public/crowded places for COVID-19 with the ongoing pandemic situation - Mod.UBA]
