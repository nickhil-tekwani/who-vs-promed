Anthrax Kills 2 Chimps, 2 Gorillas in Cameroon
----------------------------------------------
Anthrax has killed at least 2 gorillas and 2 chimpanzees in
southeastern Cameroon, prompting fears that the highly infectious
disease could spread to humans living nearby, government officials
said on Tuesday.
"Analysis of samples taken from the dead animals indicates that the
principal cause of their death is anthrax, a highly contagious
disease to humans," the central African country's Ministry of
Forestry and Wildlife said in a statement.
It was the 1st time that a gorilla had been reported to have died
from anthrax, [an infection acquired] when animals absorb bacterial
spores that can live for decades in dry soil while they eat remnants
of vegetation, officials said.
The wildlife ministry warned people living in the northern belt of
the Dja nature reserve not to touch or eat any dead monkeys but
rather to burn or bury them immediately.
A wildlife ministry official said the primates had probably died
between November and December 2004, but authorities had had to send
samples to Germany to determine the cause of death.

[We have had previous reports of anthrax in primates and possibly
bushmeat, so this is not unlikely. Also, chimpanzees are carnivores
and regularly will kill and eat small game animals. If game animals
were dying of anthrax, it is not as internationally newsworthy as
chimpanzees and gorillas! They would also provide infected blood
meals for biting flies. - Mod.MHJ]
