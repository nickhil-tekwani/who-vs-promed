Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO Update 69
------------------------------------
Weekly update:
As of 4 Oct 2009, worldwide there have been more than 375 000
laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 and more
than 4500 deaths reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). As
many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly
of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the
actually number of cases that have occurred. The WHO is actively
monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent
consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and
through monitoring of multiple sources of data.

In the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, transmission of
influenza virus and rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI) continue to
increase marking an unusually early start to fall and winter
influenza season in many countries. Geographically widespread
influenza is being reported throughout North America, with the United
States reporting ILI levels elevated above the seasonal baseline for
the past month and Mexico reporting a high intensity of respiratory
diseases for the past 3 weeks. In Canada, although overall ILI
activity remains low, focal increases have been reported in the
western part of Canada. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, early
transmission of influenza virus continues to increase in many
countries, with more intense focal activity being reported in a few.
National or regional ILI levels remained elevated above the baseline
in parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland and Scotland),
Ireland, and Israel. In Ireland, a high intensity of respirat!
ory diseases has been reported for the past 2 weeks, with the highest
rates of ILI reported among children aged 5-14 years old. In addition
to Ireland and Israel, widespread geographic spread of influenza
virus is also now being reported in Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Cyprus. At least 10 countries in the region are also reporting an
increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. In Japan,
influenza activity continues to be elevated above the seasonal
epidemic threshold since week 33, most recently in the large
population centers.

In the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza virus
transmission persists, however influenza activity remained variable.
Geographically widespread to regional influenza activity continues to
be reported throughout the tropical region of the Americas without a
consistent overall trend (and increasing trend in parts of the
Caribbean, and decreasing in much of tropical Central and South
America). High intensity respiratory diseases activity was reported
in Columbia, Cuba, and El Salvador, and moderate health care impact
was experienced in many countries; 2 countries, Barbados and St.
Lucia, reported severe health care impact. As influenza transmission
slowly declines in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, several
countries are reporting geographically regional spread (India,
Bangladesh, and Thailand) or localized spread (Sri Lanka and Myanmar)
of influenza activity; and most countries in the region have reported
experiencing a low health care impact since late S!
eptember [2009].

In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza
transmission has largely subsided (Chile, Argentina, and New Zealand)
or continues to decline substantially (South Africa and Australia).

All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been
antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like
pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. See below for a detailed laboratory
surveillance update.

Weekly update (Virological surveillance data): see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/laboratory09_10_2009/en/index.html>

Systematic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza
Surveillance Network (GISN), supported by the WHO Collaborating
Centres and other laboratories, continues to detect sporadic
incidents of H1N1 pandemic viruses that show resistance to the
antiviral oseltamivir. To date, 31 resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza
viruses have been detected and characterized worldwide. All of these
viruses show the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the
antiviral oseltamivir, but not to the antiviral zanamivir. Worldwide,
more than 10 000 clinical specimens (samples and isolates) of the
pandemic H1N1 virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.

*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the
Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries
in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes.

Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 39: 13 Jul - 27 Sep 2009)

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health care services.

guidance on global surveillance: see

A description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives
and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the
surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.

Laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 as officially
reported to the WHO by States Parties to the IHR (2005) as of 4 Oct
2009. Map of affected countries and deaths: see
<http://gamapserver.who.int/h1n1/cases-deaths/h1n1_casesdeaths.html>.

The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly
reported their first pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed case(s) since the
last Web update (Number 68) as of 4 Oct 2009 are: Tajikistan.

Cumulative totals as of 4 Oct 2009:

Region / Cases* / Deaths
WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 1238 / 2 70
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / 146016 / 3292
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 12861 / 80
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / More than 59000 / At least 193
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 38038 / 480
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 109926 / 410

Total / More than 378 223 / At least 4525

*Given that countries are no longer required to test and report
individual cases, the number of cases reported actually understates
the real number of cases.
