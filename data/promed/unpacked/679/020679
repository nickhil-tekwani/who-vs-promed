Nigeria
-------
Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox.

From September 2017 to May 2021, a total of 446 suspected monkeypox cases have been reported from 30 states. Of the reported cases, 199 (44.6%) have been confirmed in 18 states -- Abia (3), Akwa Ibom (7), Anambra (2), Bayelsa (39), Benue (2), Cross River (13), Delta (22), Ebonyi (1), Edo (7), Ekiti (2), Enugu (4), FCT (5), Imo (8), Lagos (25), Nasarawa (2), Oyo (6), Plateau (3), and Rivers (48).

A total of 8 deaths have also been recorded (CFR= 4.02 %) in 6 States -- Cross River (1), Edo (2), FCT (1), Imo (1), Lagos (2), and Rivers (1)

In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported from January and May [2021]. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from 5 states Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1), and no deaths were recorded.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
--------------------------------------
From the beginning of 2021 through 16 May [2021] the DRC has seen 1515 monkeypox cases, including 49 deaths.

Last year [2020], the country saw a total of 6257 suspected cases including 229 deaths (CFR 3.7%) that were reported in 133 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the country.

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease indigenous to Central Africa. In humans, the disease is similar to smallpox, though milder.

According to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows: about 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired. One to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too. The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off. The illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.

Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice, and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts.

People at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or have contact with the animal's rash, blood, or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.

There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.

[Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to have substantial numbers of monkeypox (MPX) cases this year (2021). This is not surprising. As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and Congo DR and widespread there geographically. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. But as the report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents may be the source of MPX virus transmission.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
