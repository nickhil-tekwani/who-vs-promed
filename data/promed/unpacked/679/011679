Has anyone researched the possibility of endocrine disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) being the source of pelican breeding disturbance? There is
significant literature on the ecological effects of EDCs on bird
reproduction, from eggshell thinning to altered behavior. Since pelicans
are at the top of the bio-amplification chain, they would exhibit the
effects sooner than would some other bird species.
(See An IEH assessment of: The Ecological Significance of Endocrine
Disruption - Effects on Reproduction and Consequences for Natural
Populations (266 pp)).

The following are excellent resources for the investigation of wildlife and
of the effects of EDCs on their populations:

2002 in-depth review and overview of EDCs.

National Science and Technology Councils (NSTC) Committee on the
Environment and Natural Resources (CENR).

These might help clarify, or suggest a plan of research to explain, the
observed phenomenon with pelican breeding disturbance.
