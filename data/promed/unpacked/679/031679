Apple growers in Himachal Pradesh face the onslaught of scab disease, which struck the state after nearly 4 decades [this is incorrect, see comment below]. It is rapidly deteriorating production. The highly infectious disease is spreading through the high-yielding belt. Prices have already doubled in local markets.

The quality deteriorates in a few days, rendering all the produce in the orchard useless. According to officials of the national horticulture department, the fungal infection has spread over an area of more than 10 000 hectares [about 24 710 acres]. "We are monitoring the spread closely and have also suggested curative measures. If immediate preventive measures are not taken by orchard owners, the disease can affect 60 to 70 percent of apple production in the state," said Des Raj, deputy director of horticulture.

"We expect a 25 to 30 percent drop in apple production this year [2020] in the state, with more than 60 percent down for the premium 'Royal Delicious' variety, "Raj added. "The disease makes [the fruit] it unviable for storage, only 30 to 40 percent of the [2020] produce is of storable quality."

[Scab disease (also called black spot) caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ affects apple, crab apple, loquat, and a few other related tree species. It is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable, and losses can be more than 70%. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit; they are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. Cracks in fruits may serve as entry points for other pathogens to cause rotting pre- or post-harvest.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain, and can be carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive, requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays per year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

The related species _V. pirina_ causes scab on pear with similar symptoms. The pathogens are specific to pear and apple, respectively, and cannot cross-infect the other's hosts. Other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops.

It is unclear, why the report above claims that scab has resurfaced in HP for the 1st time after 4 decades, that is, since the mid-1980s. Outbreaks have been reported in the state on multiple occasions much more recently, for example in 2019 (ProMED-mail post 20190705.6553318) and 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050612.1645 which also refers to a ca. 1992 outbreak).
