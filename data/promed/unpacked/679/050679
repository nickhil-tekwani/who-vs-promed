The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today [3 Oct 2010] received notification from the Health Department
of Guangdong Province of local cases of chikungunya fever in
Dongguan, Guangdong Province and urged members of the public to be on
guard against mosquito-borne diseases.

A spokesman for CHP said: "The chikungunya virus is transmitted by
infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes to humans. The disease is characterised
by fever, headache, and joint pain of the wrist, knee, ankle, and
small joints. Some patients may develop a rash affecting the trunk
and limbs. The illness is usually self-limiting (will go away without
treatment) and lasts for 3-10 days, although the joint pain may last
for weeks to months." he said.

There is no vaccine for chikungunya fever. The public should adopt
the following measures to avoid mosquito bites.

* Avoid visiting mosquito-infested areas;
* Wear long-sleeved clothes and long trousers light in colour for
protection against mosquitoes;
* Use insect repellent on exposed parts of the body;
* Use mosquito screens or nets when the room is not air-conditioned;
* Travellers returning from areas where chikungunya fever is endemic
and suffering from symptoms of the disease should seek prompt medical advice.

[This is ProMED-mail's 1st report of locally acquired chikungunya
virus infection in China. The only other ProMED-mail report of a
chikungunya virus infection in China was imported from Mauritius in
2006. The above report does not indicate where the virus may have
come from originally. It is possible that this virus is endemic in
the tropical, southernmost areas of China.
