Application of precaution measures following the detection of
suspected avian influenza cases in 3 swans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The results received today [3 Jul 2007] of the 1st analyses of 3
young swans that were found dead in a pond in the commune of
Assenoncourt (department of the Moselle), indicate suspicion of avian
influenza. The preliminary results are further investigated at
AFSSA's [French Food Safety Agency] national reference laboratory at
Ploufragan, to determine if the virus involved is HPAI [highly
pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1.
The following precaution measures are being applied in the zone, in
line with the EU's regulations pertaining to suspected avian
influenza in wild birds:
a. Implementation of a 1-km radius control zone around the pond, in
which the following measures are applied:
- enhanced monitoring of wild bird mortality
- captive birds within the zone are kept indoors and visits are made
by veterinarians
- ban on gathering of birds
- ban on bird hunting
- cats and dogs must be kept on leash.
b. Implementation of a 15-km radius observation zone around the pond,
in which the following measures are applied:
- enhanced monitoring of wild bird mortality
- captive birds within the zone are kept indoors
- ban on gathering of birds
- ban on bird hunting
- cats and dogs must be kept on leash;
The results of the reference laboratory tests are expected for Thu 5 Jul 2007.

[Assenoncourt is located about 50 km (31 mi) from the German border; see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=48.77111,6.79509|14|4&loc=FR:48.77111:6.79509:14#t=l&map=48.77111,6.79509|8|4&loc=FR:48.77111:6.79509:14>.
The species definition of the affected swans will be appreciated. The
affected swans in Germany were _Cygnus olor_ (mute swans); see

It remains to be determined if the infection is maintained within the
swan population, or rather transmitted to them by sub-clinically
infected wild birds of a different species. Mute swans are migratory
throughout northern latitudes in Europe and Asia, as far south as
North Africa. - Mod.AS]

[2] Viet Nam

Viet Nam has sent officials on an urgent mission to China to buy 50
million doses of vaccine for poultry after 2 people died of the H5N1
bird flu virus.
Viet Nam has only 15 million doses left, jeopardising a nationwide
campaign to vaccinate waterfowl and chickens, [as quoted on Wed 4 Jul
2007 by Saigon Giai Phong (Liberation) newspaper from government
officials].
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has approved an order to import 200
million doses of vaccine to stop the spread of H5N1.
International experts hailed a poultry vaccination programme and
other measures Viet Nam adopted from late 2005, as a model that
helped keep the virus at bay. However, this year [2007], it has
spread nationwide in birds and humans.
Since May [2007], 5 people have been infected by the virus, 2 of who
have died, the 1st human casualties in the Southeast Asian country
since November 2005.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed only the 1st 2 cases of
infection, both in men who subsequently recovered.
"Bird flu is now on a declining trend in the northern region but in
the southern region the risk of bird flu recurrence is extremely
serious," Agriculture Minister, Cao Duc Phat, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying at a government meeting on Tuesday [3 Jul 2007].
The Animal Health Department said 8 provinces and Haiphong city --
all in the northern and central regions -- all of which have detected
bird flu outbreaks in poultry in the past month [June 2007], remained
on the government's watch list.
