Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed the presence of adenovirus that has caused viral conjunctivitis in Pune city between November-December 2013 and January-February 2014. This is only the 2nd documented viral conjunctivitis outbreak in India where adenovirus was found to be the causative agent. The adenovirus was first identified in Chennai, formerly Madras, which earned the medical condition its common name, 'Madras eye'. Adenoviruses are resilient to standard disinfectants and can be easily transmitted in places with a high population density or a heavy flow of people.

"Adenovirus associated conjunctivitis cases were reported for the 1st time in Maharashtra [state] and only for the 2nd time in India. It is a more severe type of conjunctivitis and causes epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. A virus's association with conjunctivitis outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Pune and also in Maharashtra. In the earlier scenario, coxsackievirus A24 (CA24) of _Enterovirus_ genus was circulating in Pune and across Maharashtra and caused outbreaks," senior scientist Devendra Mourya, Director of the NIV told the Times of India (TOI). Elaborating, scientist (E) V Gopalkrishna, deputy director and principal investigator of the study at NIV said, "Adenovirus infection is quite contagious, as the virus is transmitted readily in respiratory or ocular secretions and can even contaminate swimming pools. Frequent hand washing is recommended and care must be taken to avoid contamination to others through towels, make-up, instruments, among others."

Scientists in collaboration with ophthalmologists conducted the study in Pune to understand (how) this virus strain caused a large number conjunctivitis cases. Senior eye surgeon Shrikant Kelkar, Director of National Institute of Ophthalmology, and cornea-consultant Pranav More of HV Desai Eye hospital, Hadapsar [Pune] were involved in the study. The eye surgeons' role was related to the clinical examination of the conjunctivitis cases, diagnosis, and providing clinical materials like eye swabs to NIV scientists and their team for investigating the viral causative agents associated with [this outbreak of] conjunctivitis. In total 19 clinical samples were collected from conjunctivitis patients aged between 13 and 57 years for the virological study. 11 swab samples were collected from National Institute of Ophthalmology and eight from HV Desai Eye Hospital. "Of these, 63.2 percent cases tested positive for adenoviruses and none tested positive for enterovirus. This shows the predominance of this virus in circulation. There is no co-circulation of other viruses such as enteroviruses," said Gopalkrishna who is also head of the Enteric Virus Group at NIV. What's worrying experts more is that the viral infection that earlier inflamed the conjunctiva -- a thin membrane that covers the inner surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eyeball -- is now affecting the cornea as well. Many patients who suffer from viral conjunctivitis develop pointed spots on the surface of the cornea -- the transparent outer layer covering the iris (the coloured part of the eye) and the pupil. Their eyes also become sensitive to light. "Conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus is called keratoconjunctivitis where the infection involves the cornea. The usual form of conjunctivitis that gets cured within a week does not involve the cornea. But this is an unusual form and that's why patients take months and, in some cases almost a year to get rid of it. After the acute attack subsides, discomforts in the form of dryness in eye and corneal opacity causing sensitivity to light may last up to a year," said Kelkar.

Conjunctivitis outbreaks had been reported in Pune and other parts of [Maharashtra] state in 2003, 2007, and 2010. NIV investigations carried out under the leadership of scientist Gopalkrishna and his team revealed that coxsackievirus A-24 (CA-24), a member of the _Enterovirus_ genus, was the viral etiological agent found associated in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases during that period of study. The findings of the NIV scientists were in agreement with findings reported from other countries. CA-24 has been the viral etiological agent reported in outbreaks of conjunctivitis reported from other countries during the same period. "Identifying the virus strain in circulation in conjunctivitis outbreaks in the region will assist the development of strategic public health interventions", said Gopalkrishna.

[Conjunctivitis can result from many causes, including viruses, bacteria, allergens, contact lens use (especially the extended-wear type), chemicals, fungi, and certain diseases. Viral conjunctivitis can be caused by the following viruses, with adenoviruses being the most common cause: adenoviruses, picornaviruses (particularly enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24), measles virus, and several herpes viruses.

Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Most viruses that cause conjunctivitis are spread through hand-to-eye contact by hands or objects that are contaminated with the infectious virus. Hands can become contaminated by coming in contact with infectious tears, eye discharge, fecal matter, or respiratory discharges.

Many of the viruses that cause conjunctivitis may be associated with an upper respiratory tract infection, cold, or sore throat.
Conjunctivitis
- usually begins in one eye and may progress to the 2nd eye within days;
- spreads easily and rapidly between people and can result in epidemics;
- is typically mild and usually clears up in 7-14 days without treatment and resolves without any long-term effects. In some cases, it can take 2-3 weeks or more for viral conjunctivitis to completely clear up, depending on whether complications develop.

As the Times of India report indicates, viral conjunctivitis is a global phenomenon, caused by a restricted range of viruses. - Mod.CP
