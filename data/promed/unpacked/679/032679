I could not agree more with the reassuring words of the ProMED-mail
Moderator on this topic. Not only "as long as there have been mammalogists
studying rodents in the Americas (and in the Old World), there have been
hantaviruses infecting these rodents", the hantaviruses were there long
before the profession of mammalogist even existed. Phylogenetic studies of
hantaviruses indicate that they are the product of co-evolution with their
rodent hosts during probably thousands of years. If trapping rodents was
an activity at high risk for incurring hantavirus infection, we would have
known. For some reason(s), it seems not. On the other hand, professional
exposure to mice in the forest was already considered as an important risk
factor from the very first accounts on (1934) in European literature of
Nephropathia epidemica (NE), long before the viral etiology became clear.
In the first (1951) report in English on NE, lumber workers were considered
at high risk, particularly when dwelling in primitive lodges in the forest
(Myhrman G., Nephropathia epidemica: a new infectious disease in Northern
Scandinavia. Act Med Scan 1951; Vol CXL fasc 1: 52-56.).
During successive NE outbreaks in Belgium, we were struck by the high
proportion of cases who had a history of previously handling wood in the
forest (and not that much of trapping rodents in the forest), for
professional reasons or for leisure. The most impressive story came from a
gynecologist, living in the forested South of Belgium. Gynecology cannot
exactly be considered as a profession at risk for hantavirus infection, but
our colleague had a history of hauling heavy fire-logs from the forest
during the previous W.-E. [weekend?, aimed at the open fire of his newly
built house. Instead of celebrating the inauguration of his new home, he
had to undergo several dialysis sessions in his own hospital. Intrigued by
these stories, we decided to set up a case-control study, comparing
seroconfirmed NE cases to seronegative household members and - neighbours.
The results of this study will be published in one of the next issues of
CID [?. (A case-control study after a hantavirus outbreak in the South of
Belgium: who is at risk? F. Van Loock et al.) Suffice it to say that
firewood cutting was by far the most significant risk factor (OR: 25.5, 95%
CI: 5.7-114, p <0.000), whereas trapping rodents was only borderline
significant ( OR:4.5, 95 %CI :1.2-17.3, p<0.04 ). These data are, of
course, only applicable for the studied zoonosis, i.e., Puumala virus
infection, spread by red back voles. They point nevertheless indirectly to
the transmission route for infection, common to ALL known pathogenic
hantaviruses, i.e. inhalation of aerosolised rodent excreta.
Bank voles have often their burrows under firewood logs, and transport of
the latter can bring potentially infected material closer to the upper
airways of humans. Even more important, inhalation is more marked due to
this physical effort. Interestingly, strenuous physical activity of any
kind in the forest bore also a significantly greater risk in our
case-control study : OR : 5.2, 95 % CI : 1.9-13.9, p< 0.001 Inhalation
has often been cited as a WAY of infection, but to my knowledge has never
been studied so far as a MODULATOR for hantavirus infection. When we
described a severe case of "Rat-transmitted hantavirus disease in Sarajevo"
(Lancet 1994; 344:131), it was striking that the case-patient was the only
one amongst the locked-in military personnel to contract disease in a
building infested with rats (or other rodents). But he had been also the
only one to train strenuously INSIDE the premises, running daily up and
down the stairs for exercise.
Perhaps mammalogists are at lesser risk than lumber workers or
wood-cutters, simply because they have to inhale less vigorously during
their job, and because they don't have to disturb rodent burrows so very
often?
As for "the PROPER safety precautions to take", the practical question
remains what this should mean, when professionally busy on the field or in
the forest. Wearing gloves may be one point, but a surgical mask is
useless,since this will not contain viral particles. And I don't see
mammalogists wearing HEPA-filter masks on the job, let alone lumberjacks.
An often neglected, but potentially useful recommendation (which costs
nothing) is always trying to turn your back against the wind, when catching
rodents, and particularly when disrupting rodent burrows.
