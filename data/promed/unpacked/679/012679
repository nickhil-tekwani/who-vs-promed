BSE, cause and affect:
It is reported that the BSE agent can not be found in various organs of
affected animals. If the theory of the prion protein is correct then
infected meat taken orally has prions present. Is the prion small enough
to pass through the stomach walls? Which part of the stomach does it
pass through and do different conditions affect it i.e. pH2, pH9? Once
through the stomach walls does it pass throughout the body in the blood
leading into the brain, and once in the brain, does the prion pass into
the brain cells or, does it get trapped outside the cells where by
certain reactions releases toxins being responsible for the appearance of
lesions? If the prion is present in the blood why does it not show as
being present in other organs or; is it attacked by the immune system or,
is it not found as it is not looked for or, is it to hard to find without
physical evidence i.e. lesions, or? In experiments it is quoted that
mice are fed intravenously through the spine with BSE infected material
but is this not a different route to that of animals that were fed
ruminant material i.e. therefore can the results be accepted?

The prion protein hypothesis of transmission from infected ruminant feed
to cattle, runs like this. The infection, from the infected organs of the
dead animals incorporated in the ruminant feed, consisted of prion protein
molecules that had an aberrant molecular conformation (designated PrPsc).
Infection of cattle only took place when the ingested PrPsc molecules
caused particular PrP molecules (of the same protein but in a "normal"
shape) found in the cow's brain, spinal cord and retina to change their
conformation to PrPsc, which in turn caused others to do likewise, in a
snowballing 'replication' effect. There are no "toxins". It was the
resulting accumulated build-up of PrPsc in the brain that caused the BSE
brain lesions.

A great deal of research during the past two or three years, on every tissue
and secretion from confirmed BSE-infected cows, has demonstrated that
infectivity is not found in any but the brain, spinal cord and retina. The
researches were carried out by intracerebral injection into mice (the proven
most drastic route and the one which greatly shortens the incubation period
and thus also gives a quicker test result) so that if infection is not
transmitted to the mice that way, one can say that infectivity has not been
found in that particular tissue or secretion being tested.

Regarding your questions about blood and the immune system, although a
short-live haemotogenous phase occurs in laboratory rodents, this has not
been found in cattle. There is, in any case, no immune response to prions.

Your remaining questions are really all part of the question "By what
mechanism and route did the PrPsc protein in the ruminant feed reach the
cow's brain?"

I do not think that anyone can yet give a definitive evidence-based answer
to that. In mice and other laboratory rodents the sequence of events is
initial replication in the lympho-reticular system (LRS) followed by
migration via the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system
(CNS) to the spinal cord and finally to the brain. In these species
replication is always greater in the CNS than in the LRS. On present
knowledge, experts consider it likely that in cattle the pathogenesis
followed a predominantly (and possibly wholly) CNS path. However, there
did not appear to be residual infectivity retained in the peripheral parts
of the nervous system.

Some have speculated that a CNS migration might not have been (or not wholly
have been) initially via the oral route, but infected feed dust absorbed
through the cow's eyes and thence direct to the brain.

What can be said is that the hypothesis of infected ruminant feed as the
major factor seems to have been confirmed by the banning of ruminant feed
being followed, after a delay mainly due to the incubation period, by the
dramatic successive reductions in the number of new BSE cases in cattle over
the past two years.
