A 4-year-old girl, a resident of Jalan Sidomulyo, Kelurahan
Padangbulan, Kecamatan Senapelan, Kota Pekanbaru has been confirmed
to have died of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection. "We have
received the laboratory result for this patient, and it was evidently
positive for avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection," said Head of
the Bird Flu Control Team of Arifin Achmad hospital, Dr Azizman Saad.

Meanwhile, Arifin Achmad hospital is currently treating 3 other bird
flu suspect patients, a 40-year-old woman, her 14-year-old daughter,
and an 8-year-old neighbor. They reside in Sungai Apit Kabupaten Siak.

They were admitted to hospital at the same time and placed in a bird
flu isolation unit because of fever up to 38 C. "Now they are in
stable condition. Temperature is falling and lung condition is good,"
said Azizman.

[If this human case of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection is
subsequently authenticated by a World Health Organisation reference
laboratory, it will rank as the 2nd confirmed case in Indonesia since
the beginning of 2010 and the 164th case overall. See:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_04_21/en/index.html>.
Both of the 2010 cases have had a fatal outcome.
