The Department of Health (DOH) in Eastern Visayas has reported 53 cases of leptospirosis from 1 Jan to 29 May 2022]. Of these 53 individuals, 8 died, according to Jelyn Malibago, the regional information officer of the DOH, on Wednesday [1 Jun 2022]. "We expect more cases of leptospirosis as the rainy season begins," she said.

The health official urged the public not to wade in flooded areas, to avoid getting the bacteria mainly from the urine of [infected] animals like rodents. If one is to wade in flood water, Malibago said he or she should wear boots and gloves; drain potentially contaminated water; control rodents in the house by using traps or poison; and maintain cleanliness.

Of the 53 cases [in Eastern Visayas Region], 22 were from Leyte; 10 from Samar; 7 each from Southern Leyte and Eastern Samar; 5 from Northern Samar; and 2 from Biliran.

The 3 deaths due to leptospirosis in Leyte were from Tacloban City [provincial capital city of Leyte], Abuyog, and Hilongos; 2 deaths from the towns of Padre Burgos and Hinunangan in Southern Leyte; 2 deaths from Basey and Catbalogan City in Samar; and 1 death from Maydolong town in Eastern Samar.

The symptoms of those who were infected with leptospirosis include high fever, headache, muscle and abdominal pain, and vomiting. _Leptospira_ [bacteria] enter the human body through cuts in the skin or through membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth.

[Eastern Visayas (pop., population of about 4.55 million residents in 2020) is an administrative region in the Philippines, consisting of 3 main islands, Samar, Leyte, and Biliran, with 6 provinces (Biliran, Leyte, Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar, Southern Leyte); Tacloban is the provincial capital city of Leyte (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Visayas#Administrative_divisions).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is also a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals. - Mod.ML
