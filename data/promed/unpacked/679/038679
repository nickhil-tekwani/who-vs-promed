Over the past 3 days, Uganda's health ministry has reported 8 more Ebola Sudan cases along with 2 more deaths, with officials also announcing that a doctor is among the fatal cases. [See ProMED Ebola update (22): Uganda, Kenya 20221003.8705924; 2nd fatal case among the health-care workers, although the 1st was not confirmed. - Mod.LK]

Since the outbreak was first announced on 20 Sep [2022], Uganda continues to report a steady stream of new cases, but so far, the illnesses appear to be limited to hot spots in the west central part of the country near Mubende.

The new developments lift the country's overall total to 62 cases, 27 of them fatal. Of the 62 cases, 43 are lab confirmed and 19 are listed as probable. Of the 27 deaths, 9 were in lab-confirmed patients, and 18 are classified as probable.

In its latest update on Twitter today [3 Oct 2022], the ministry said 24 people are in treatment for their infections, and 882 contacts have been identified for follow-up.

[Case numbers continue to rise. One hopes the health-care workers and first responders are now better protected from accidental infection while treating patients. A big concern is "expansion to other areas, such as Kampala, could overwhelm the country's healthcare system." - Mod.LK

The Ministry of Health says there is no cause for alarm after a suspected case of Ebola in Kakamega County turned negative.

The 32-year-old male patient, who had traveled to Uganda, was admitted to a Mumias hospital with Ebola symptoms on Thursday [29 Sep 2022].

Acting Health Director General Dr. Patrick Amoth, in a statement on Saturday [1 Oct 2022] however said that samples of the suspected case were taken to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) laboratory for testing and turned out negative.

"We would like to inform the public that the laboratory tests for samples taken from the patient have since turned out to be negative and therefore there is no cause for alarm," Amoth said.

[This is great news and a big relief, but the precautions suggested in ProMED Ebola update (22): Uganda, Kenya 20221003.8705924 still apply. Borders are porous, and an infected individual can carry the virus unsuspectingly across if precautionary testing is not conducted to try to prevent this occurrence. - Mod.LK]

South Sudan's government with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) said they have sent 3 samples out of 5 unconfirmed suspected cases of the Ebola viral disease (EVD) for testing in South Africa.

Alex Freeman, the Head of the WHO Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC), told journalists in Juba on Sunday [2 Oct 2022] that Uganda is currently battling to contain the spread of the Sudan strain of Ebola virus (SUDV) that has no ready vaccine.

On 20 Sep [2022], health authorities in neighboring Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by the Sudan virus (SUDV) after a case was confirmed in the Mubende district of central Uganda.

Freeman said they have raised the level of preparedness to be able to detect, isolate, and manage suspected EVD cases.

Mabior Kiir, the Manager for the Public Health Emergency Operation Center, said the 5 suspected cases were detected in the states of Eastern Equatoria, Western Equatoria, and Central Equatoria. He disclosed that one of the suspected cases from Kajokeji in Central Equatoria has since passed on. All the cases were detected on 30 Sep [2022].

[ProMED thanks Ryan McGinnis for submitting this extremely important update on suspected Ebola cases in the states of Eastern Equatoria, Western Equatoria, and Central Equatoria with one unconfirmed fatality in the latter state. These states are in the southern region bordering Uganda. Spill over porous borders is not unexpected, which is why it is so important to institute border checks that are rapid and accurate. Concern is also increased by the insecurity in South Sudan, which could jeopardize control efforts. - Mod.LK]
