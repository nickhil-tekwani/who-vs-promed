Emergence of bluetongue virus serotype 6 in Europe: German field data
and experimental infection of cattle.
-----------------------------------------------
Abstract
In late 2008, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 6 (BTV-6), which had
never occurred in Europe before, was 1st detected in the Netherlands
and Germany. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, the
prevalence of infections in cattle was investigated in a virological
(N=28 658) and serological (N=2075) field survey in Lower Saxony,
where 45 cases confined to the district Grafschaft Bentheim were
found. Blood from affected animals was used for the experimental
infection of 3 cattle with different BTV antibody status, leading to
sustained viraemia in one animal naive for BTV. Of 2 animals that had
detectable antibodies against BTV serotype 8, one became transiently
infected and seroconverted for BTV-6 while the other did not react. In
conclusion, while only a very limited spread of BTV-6 could be
observed in the field, experimental infection of cattle did not show
substantial differences of the course of infection in comparison to
other BTV serotypes.

[The above recent paper (Received by the journal 13 Sep 2009, received
in revised form 16 Nov 2009, accepted 26 Nov 2009) includes data which
may help in the discussions regarding the background to bluetongue
epidemiology in Northern Europe. We therefore copy herewith for
subscribers, somewhat abridged, the discussion and conclusion
chapters. Additional text and references are to be found in the full

"Discussion
----------
Among tens of thousands of animals that were screened in the field
survey, only a small number was found to be positive for BTV-6 RNA or
antibodies. These were mostly isolated cases in holdings scattered
throughout a single district in the German federal state of Lower
Saxony, close to the border with the Netherlands, where similar
findings were made. Given the BTV screening measures that were in
place in 2008, BTV-6 most likely was detected much earlier after its
introduction than BTV-8 had been, suggesting an entry late in the
season. Apparently, it has only been able to propagate to a very
limited extent, while BTV-8 had spread rapidly after its introduction
in 2006. Together with the reported genetic similarities, this gave
rise to the theory that BTV-6 was an attenuated strain introduced
either by the illegal local use of a modified live vaccine or the
unrecognized import of animals that had been vaccinated with a
modified live vaccine in a 3rd country and were still vira!
emic for BTV-6 when they arrived in Europe.

Serological evidence from areas affected by BTV-6 provided no
indication of a recent use of the commercially available multivalent
MLV vaccine. No antibodies against serotypes other than BTV-6 and -8
were detected in either the Netherlands or Germany. Specifically,
there were no traces of other serotypes from bottle A of the
multivalent vaccine package (1, 4, 12 and 14), which would have been
the most likely source of the BTV-6 vaccine strain. This, however, has
no bearing on another possible explanation, the accidental
introduction of vectors already infected with BTV-6 as stowaways in
global trade.

According to the CRL, genome segment 2 of the Netherlands isolate is
almost identical to the South African BTV-6 vaccine strain. Whether
this isolated finding is particularly meaningful remains open to
debate. The manufacturer of the vaccine (Onderstepoort Biological
Products) maintains that based on segment 2 alone, all African strains
of BTV-6, including the vaccine, are closely related. Such a high
degree of homology was not seen in European BTV-8, however, which
shares 93 percent of nucleotides of segment 2 with the South African
BTV-8 vaccine strain and 97 percent with a Nigerian isolate. For other
segments of European BTV-6, a high similarity to the South African
reference strain is claimed, but the origin of segment 10 is unknown,
and reassortment has been suspected. Only 4 isolated sequences of
individual genome segments of BTV-6 are presently available online,
and no sequence of either the BTV-6 vaccine strain or the recent
European isolates has been made public.

But regardless of its origin, the question remains whether the very
limited spread of BTV-6 that has been observed in 2008 is due to
attenuation of the virus itself. Judging from our data, other factors
could have contributed to that outcome. Our experiment suggests that
the susceptibility to BTV-6 infection of cattle is influenced by
previous exposure to BTV-8, but this needs to be investigated in a
broader study using a defined challenge dose of BTV-6. In the present
experiment, it is difficult to estimate the infectious dose contained
in the inoculum. The dates of infection of the donor animals remain
unknown, but the low amount of BTV-6 genome in the pooled samples (no
Ct value lower than 25, data not shown) and the failure to isolate
virus by other means suggest that the blood had been collected at a
late stage of infection, resulting in limited infectivity. While
BTV-infected ruminants can remain positive in the RT-PCR and even
viraemic for weeks or months, the concentra!
tion of infectious particles in the blood decreases over time. In a
related animal experiment at the CVI [Lelystad, Netherlands] using a
BTV-6 field sample from a Dutch cow, at first only one of 6 animals
could be infected, which also suggests a low infectious dose. When
fresh blood taken from the latter animal at 10 dpi was inoculated in a
2nd experiment, however, 11 out of 11 animals displayed virus
replication. Nevertheless, within the scope of our experiment, the
course of BTV-6 infection, once established in the naive calf, was
similar to BTV-8.

At its peak, the amount of BTV-6 genome detected in calf 605 did not
notably differ from viral genome levels observed in BTV-8 animal
experiments. This similarity also extends to the persistence of
detectable viral RNA in peripheral blood of calf 605 and the only
gradual decrease of circulating BTV-6 genome in the presence of
neutralising antibodies that was observed in field-infected animals.
Viral RNA remains detectable in the blood for extended periods of time
because BTV persists in invaginations in the cell membrane of
erythrocytes, a trait probably shared by both field and vaccine strains.

With regard to the absence of any clinical symptoms other than
elevated body temperature, it has to be noted that in our experience
and based on experimental data reported by other groups, clinical
bluetongue disease in cattle does occur, but it is not a regular
finding in Holstein Frisians experimentally infected with BTV-8
either. Conversely, it has been shown that even vaccine strains can
cause disease, if only in sheep. Exposure to sunlight might play a
role in bluetongue pathogenesis, which could contribute to the reduced
severity of disease observed after experimental infection in
high-containment animal housing. The initial detection of BTV-6 in the
Netherlands, on the other hand, had been precipitated by clinical
disease observed in the field.

There is no doubt that after 2 years of the BTV-8 epidemic and with
mass vaccinations beginning in mid-2008, BTV-6 faced, by no means, an
animal population naive to BTV. To the contrary, the western North
European Plain shared by Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany arguably
was the region with the highest cumulative incidence of BTV-8 in
Europe. In the field survey presented here, over half of the animals
had neutralising antibodies to BTV-8, and more than 1/10th were still
positive in the real-time RT-PCR. Even if cross-neutralisation between
serotypes is low, there is evidence of group-specific cell-mediated
immunity after infection. Given these unfavourable conditions, the
fact that BTV-6 was able to spread at all does not suggest attenuation.

Conclusion
-------------
The final evaluation as well as the measures taken by animal health
authorities concerning the emergence of BTV-6 are debatable from a
scientific point of view. If BTV-6 does not return in 2009 [it did not
- Mod.JW], it will be difficult to say with any certainty whether this
was because of its vaccine origin or simply because BTV-8 had come
first. In either case, one troubling fact remains: since 2006, 3
different serotypes of BTV have 1st been detected in the same
geographical region, without any previous notion of their presence on
European soil and without any definite explanation for their
introduction. Finding and closing that loophole is crucial for animal
health in Europe, particularly with regard to the looming threat of
other, more lethal, orbivirus diseases of domestic animals like
African horse sickness [AHS]."

The above thought-stimulating findings and arguments deserve
attention, in particular the concluding indication to pay attention to
a possible loophole in the western North European Plain shared by
Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.

Regarding the mentioning of AHS as a potential additional threat: If,
most unfortunately, this happens, the disease is likely to be detected
in its early stages due to its exceptional high pathogenicity (and
mortality rate) in horses. A possible introduction of another
culicoides-borne equine orbivirus, namely equine encephalosis, is
probably less likely to be recognised during its early stages, due to
its milder symptoms. - Mod.AS]
