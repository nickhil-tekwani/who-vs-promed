Health officials in eastern Iowa are looking for the source of an _E. coli_ outbreak that has sickened several children in Maquoketa. The Telegraph Herald reports that at least 3 children from Maquoketa are being treated at an Iowa City hospital after developing hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS], a serious complication caused by a toxin-producing _E. coli_ strain.

Doctors say the strain can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting. HUS symptoms include dark-colored urine, increased fever, abdominal pain and headache and can affect kidney function. The Jackson County Health Department is working to determine what might have caused the outbreak. Community Health Manager Michele Cullen says the process involves contact tracing, but a source has not been identified.

[Although it is not directly stated that an enterohemorrhagic pathotype of _E. coli_ was isolated from the diarrheal stools of the affected children, most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are caused by one of these strains, either O157:H7 or otherwise, especially with a cluster of cases occurring at one time. Certainly, non-HUS cases caused by the EHEC should also be occurring, with bloody diarrhea as the main reason to seek medical care. If 3 cases of HUS have been identified, it is likely that at least 15-20 times more cases have occurred, as HUS generally occurs in no more than 5%-10% of cases.

The following has been extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, et al. (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer; in press.

"Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

"HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure, and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10%, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis." - Mod.LL
