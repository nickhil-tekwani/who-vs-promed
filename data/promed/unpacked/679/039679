A poison as harmful as arsenic is contaminating fruit juices and
cordials drunk by millions of people every day across Britain,
scientists revealed last night [28 Feb 2010].

The toxin called antimony, which is lethal in large doses and has
been linked to cancer, was discovered in 16 of the most popular
brands of juice and squash.

Experts expressed "concern" over the findings, which they believe may
be the result of chemicals in the drinks' plastic bottles leaching
into the liquid.

The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), which published the research,
raised fears for the health of children and called for an
investigation "straight away".

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen found levels in the fruit
drinks were far above those allowed in tap water under European
rules. Researcher Claus Hansen said: "The antimony concentrations in
the products tested exceed the limit in EU drinking water but no
antimony limits exist for foodstuffs so no legislation has been
broken. [So what is the EU limit in drinking water? - Mod.TG]

"However, we cannot be sure that the antimony levels found are
harmless." He added: "It would be a good idea to have some more
research to get a better impression of what the antimony limit should
be in fruit drinks."

The RSC said: "Marketing, certainly for the cordial products, is
geared towards children. It's a children's drink. That means they are
more likely to drink it than adults and are more at risk."

The alarm was raised after scientists discovered that the drinks
regularly broke EU limits for antimony imposed on tap water. 8
samples contained higher levels of the substance allowed, while one
undiluted drink was found to have levels of the chemical that were
800 per cent higher than tap water. [While other sources tell us it
is 42 juice drinks from 16 different brands, no one has told us how
many samples they tested, or what the EU allows in drinking water. - Mod.TG]

Clinically, antimony is similar to arsenic and causes headaches,
dizziness, and depression. High levels can be fatal within days.

All of the unnamed sample drinks were produced in the UK and were
widely available in supermarkets across Europe. Antimony is listed as
a top pollutant in America by the Environmental Protection Agency. It
is also listed in the UK on the Environment Agency's pollution
inventory. The agency said prolonged contact with antimony may affect
the digestive system, eyes, heart, kidney, lungs, and skin.

Dr Hansen warned that the toxin could also be found in other food products.

He also said not all of the drinks were in plastic bottles, with some
in Tetra packs.

The study tested 42 drinks including blackcurrant, strawberry,
raspberry, sour cherry, mint, and caramel products. [One wonders if
the acidity of these products plays any role in potentially leaching
the antimony from the host container. - Mod.TG]

Authors of the report, featured in the Journal of Environmental
Monitoring, said the results showed concentrations up to 17 times
higher than previous studies. [When were the previous studies
performed and using what method to test? Is the testing protocol more
sensitive than previous studies? Have any regulatory levels changed
since the last study? - Mod.TG]

The report said more research was needed to find out whether antimony
was leaching into the drinks from the plastic bottles or whether it
was present during manufacture.

The British Soft Drinks Association yesterday defended the industry
and its regulations. A spokesman said: "Fruit juices and juice drinks
are safe. There is no read across between the levels of antimony
permitted in drinking water and those that might be acceptable in a
fruit juice or a juice drink." He added: "The packaging is safe. The
data in the study does not confirm any conclusions about the
packaging and the authors themselves conclude that 'further studies
are warranted'."

[In the USA and perhaps in other countries such as those in the EU,
the drinking water allowable limits are below limits that may be
found in juices, other drinks or food. The belief is that water is
consumed on its own as well as used in cooking and therefore any
substances in water should have a lower limit to avoid accumulations.

This is possibly true in the EU. If it is, then the level in the
juice, even for children may not be as high as the various articles
want it to seem.

Several questions have been raised throughout this article, for which
in searching a number of sites, the answer could not be found. These
questions need to be answered to determine where the reality of the
safety of these levels is.

Antimony is around us in may forms and concentrations. The
concentration of antimony that is dissolved in rivers and lakes is
very low, usually less than 5 parts of antimony in 1 billion parts of
water (ppb). We cannot measure such small amounts without special
equipment. Antimony does not appear to accumulate in fish and other
aquatic animals. The concentration of antimony dissolved in one
polluted river where wastes from antimony mining and processing had
been dumped was as high as 8 ppb. Most of the antimony in the river,
however, was not dissolved, but was attached to particles of dirt.
Although antimony is used in solder for water pipes, it does not seem
to get into the drinking water.

Soil usually contains very low concentrations of antimony, less than
1 part of antimony in a million parts of soil (ppm). However,
concentrations close to 9 ppm have been found.

Food usually contains small amounts of antimony. You eat and drink
about 5 micrograms (5 millionths of a gram) of antimony every day.
The average concentration of antimony in meats, vegetables, and
seafood is 0.2-1.1 ppb. The antimony oxide that is added to many
materials for fire protection is very tightly attached to these
materials and does not expose people to antimony.

Antimony can enter your body when you drink water or eat food, soil,
or other substances that contain antimony. Antimony can also enter
your body if you breathe air or dust containing antimony. We do not
know if antimony can enter your body when it is placed on your skin.

A small amount of the antimony you eat or drink enters the blood
after a few hours. The amount and the form of antimony in the food or
water will affect how much antimony enters your blood. After you eat
or drink very large doses of antimony, you may vomit. This will
prevent most of the antimony from entering through the stomach and
intestines into your blood. Antimony in your lungs will enter your
blood after several days or weeks. The amount of antimony that will
enter your blood from your lungs is not known.

After antimony enters your blood, it goes to many parts of your body.
Most of the antimony goes to the liver, lungs, intestines, and
spleen. Antimony will leave your body in feces and urine over several
weeks. Exposure to 9 milligrams per cubic meter of air of antimony
for a long time can irritate your eyes, skin, and lungs. Breathing 2
milligrams per cubic meter of antimony for a long time can cause
problems with the lungs (pneumoconiosis), heart problems (altered
electrocardiograms), stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach
ulcers. People who drank over 19 ppm of antimony once, vomited. We do
not know what other health effects would occur to people who swallow
antimony. We do not know if antimony can cause cancer or birth
defects, or affect reproduction in humans.

Antimony can have beneficial effects when used for medical reasons.
It has been used as a medicine to treat people infected with
parasites. Persons who have had too much of this medicine or are
sensitive to it when it was injected into their blood or muscle have
experienced adverse health effects. These health effects include
diarrhea, joint and/or muscle pain, vomiting, problems with the blood
(anemia), and heart problems (altered electrocardiograms).
