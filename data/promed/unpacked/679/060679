Shelled peas sold in farmers markets have been previously associated with campylobacter due to fecal contamination of the fields by wild cranes (https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir249).

"Abstract
---------
Background: _Campylobacter jejuni_ is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and most cases are identified as sporadic events rather than as parts of recognized outbreaks. We report findings from a substantial 2008 campylobacteriosis outbreak with general implications for fresh produce safety.

Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study to determine the source of the outbreak and enhanced surveillance to identify additional cases. Clinical and environmental specimens were tested for _Campylobacter_, and isolates were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We report findings from a substantial 2008 campylobacteriosis outbreak with general implications for fresh produce safety.

Results: By routine surveillance, we identified 63 cases of laboratory-confirmed infection. Only raw peas, consumed by 30 (67%) of 45 case-patients and by 15 (17%) of 90 control participants, were associated with illness (adjusted odds ratio: 8.2; P<.001). An additional 69 patients (26 laboratory confirmed) who reported eating raw peas within 10 days of illness onset were identified through enhanced surveillance. In all, 5 cases were hospitalized, and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome developed in one case; none died. The implicated pea farm was located near a Sandhill crane (_Grus canadensis_) stopover and breeding site. Of 36 environmental samples collected, 16 were positive for _C. jejuni_; 14 crane-feces samples and 2 pea samples. We identified 25 unique combined SmaI-KpnI PFGE patterns among clinical isolates; 4 of these combined PFGE patterns identified in 15 of 55 human isolates were indistinguishable from PFGE patterns identified in environmental samples.

Conclusions: This investigation established a rare laboratory-confirmed link between a campylobacterosis outbreak and an environmental source and identified wild birds as an underrecognized source of produce contamination."

Of note, ProMED did post on the outbreak when it occurred in 2008 related to an Alaska Department of Health & Social Services report (see Campylobacteriosis, raw peas - USA: (AK) waterfowl source 20081010.3216). - Mod.LL
