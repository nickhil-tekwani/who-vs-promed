Some additional thoughts on the anthrax outbreak in hippos in Uganda, some
of which support certain of your comments in previous correspondence:
1) Anthrax is endemic in many areas of Africa and the world, and these
endemic areas are frequently associated with alkaline soils and alkaline
surface water frequently related to volcanic /calcite geological
formations. The Queen Elizabeth system fulfills most of these criteria.
2) In the _Bacillus anthracis_ life cycle, long dormant periods in the
environment in the resistant spore survival mode are interspersed with
short periods of exponential replication of the germinated bacilli within
suitable hosts during outbreaks. Interepidemic periods may be measured in
years or decades, and in remote areas of the developing world, the disease
may not have been previously recognised or documented.
3) Triggers for these outbreaks include local overabundance of hosts, poor
soil drainage and stressors generally associated with resource depletion
and intra- and inter-specific competition.
Hippos have few natural enemies except man, and there is a cyclical
tendency for their population growth to exceed the ecological carrying
capacity of their nocturnal grazing range. Dry seasons and dry cycles
compound the problem. In the Queen Elizabeth National Park system, Lake
Edward and Lake George (linked by the Kazinga channel) are major aquatic
features stretching for many square miles, and support a large hippo
population. Census figures in 1958 reported a population in excess of 15
000 for the system, with resultant severe overgrazing, trampling and soil
erosion. Between 1958 and 1966, more than 7000 hippos were culled to
address this overabundance issue. A 1969 census showed that there were
still 10 000 hippos in the system. Heavy poaching in the 1970s reduced this
population by half, but by the 1990s the population had recovered again to
over 7500. I unfortunately have no recent census figures.
4) Anthrax outbreaks may possibly be seen as a natural
population-regulating mechanism for some species (including hippos) under
certain environmental conditions and relative population density
situations. Epidemic outbreaks are relatively short-lived (generally
measured in months) and in most species (except buffalo and bison) there
appears to be no gender predilection. The male predilection seen in African
buffalo and bison appears to be linked to wallowing behaviour. Another
observation is that sub-adult animals are relatively under-represented in
carcass counts.
Potential transmission modes include:
-- Contamination of grazing by the leaking of unclotted blood from body
orifices of terminal or dead individuals [and from scavenged freshly dead
carcasses.]
-- Contamination of lake shallows and pools [and cattle troughs] by
[bathing] vultures that have recently fed on infected carcasses.
-- Percutaneous infection of fight wounds by spores in the environment or
spores in the oral cavity of the aggressor.
-- Mechanical transmission by large haematophagous biting flies (_Pangonia_
spp.) which target hippos.
-- Cannabalism with ingestion of tissues from infected carcasses.
Control of Anthrax:
From a purist's point of view, anthrax is an indigenous multi-species
disease, and in natural free-ranging systems it should be considered an
integral part of the ecology, and a periodic population regulator. However,
in a not-so-perfect world, because the disease affects livestock and has
zoonotic implications, control is attempted, based on 3 pillars :
1) Vaccination of endangered wildlife species that are at risk -- as many
as possible -- where possible.
2) Public awareness campaigns stressing the danger of handling or utilising
carcasses of dead animals.
3) Reduction of contamination of the environment by burning or [2nd best]
burying carcasses. Alternately, making carcasses unattractive to scavengers
by spraying with formalin or covering with branches or sheets of plastic
until putrefaction, anaerobic conditions, acid pH and temperature destroy
the bacilli in the carcass (2- 4 days). In the case of hippopotami, their
aquatic habits frequently result in the carcasses of anthrax victims
floating or surrounded by shallow water, making them relatively
inaccessible to winged or terrestrial scavengers. Their thick hide is not
easily penetrated (even by crocodiles) until putrefaction is fairly
advanced. Most bacilli in the carcases will therefore be destroyed by their
anaerobic and acidic environment together with the massive growth of
putrefactive organisms. Theoretically therefore, floating hippo carcasses
should not be a major source of contamination by spores, with the exception
of exudates from orifices (when present). Also, in the main bodies of water
of large lakes, the dilution factor for spores should be such as to pose
minimum risk. However, contamination of small pools and inlets will
probably require the removal, beaching and burning or burying of carcasses.
For what they are worth, these are just a few more thoughts regarding this
anthrax outbreak in hippos, and the potential management thereof.

[I have little to add to this excellent and concise description of the
epidemiology of hippo anthrax. We are seeing large anthrax outbreaks these
days in Africa which could well be related to temporarily high local
population densities. Stress events will lower the LD50, causing individual
grazing animals which would otherwise be unaffected to die. Other factors
then facilitate disease spread. - Mod.MHJ]
