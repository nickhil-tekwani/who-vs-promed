Imported case of trypanosomiasis infected in Zimbabwe
-----------------------------------------------------
[Here we report the] case of a 64 year old Minneapolis woman who accompanied her husband on safari in Zimbabwe for 3 weeks in September 2012.

She returned on 4 Oct 2012 and developed high fever, nausea, and diffuse myalgias on 6 October. She presented to the emergency department on 10 Oct 2012 and was admitted after trypanosomes were seen on a peripheral blood malaria/parasite smear. Rapid clinical deterioration and normal CSF studies were consistent with _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ infection or East African sleeping sickness. The patient received treatment with suramin with multi-system organ failure and remains in the intensive care unit at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

[Trypanososmiasis has been reported sporadically in tourists from East Africa over the past decade (see below). It is important to know which game reserve the patient visited, whether towards Botswana or in the north towards Zambia or Mozambique. Trypanosomiasis has emerged in Central and East Africa over the past 2 decades, with the 1st reports of infections in tourists in 2000 (see below). This is the 1st report in ProMED-mail of human trypanosomiasis in a tourist infected in Zimbabwe. - Mod.EP
