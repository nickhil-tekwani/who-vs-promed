Increasing numbers of cases of people poisoned by spoiled or
contaminated mussels are occurring, bought from the Porta Palazzo
fish market, in neighborhood stores, and in the large distribution
market for Turin and its province. Now the 1st analysis of the
mussels is being done which should give more information on the cause
or causes of the illnesses.

More than 30 people have experienced symptoms of food poisoning after
eating mussels on Thursday and Friday evening [16-17 Sep 2010] and
were forced to go to hospitals in the area. Still others have turned
to the doctor by phone. Symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea,
vomiting, and fever have occurred.

"With only the symptoms and the incubation time is not possible to
determine the common pathogen," explained the Gradenigo hospital. "In
order to give definite answers, and not generate an alarm, it is
necessary to wait for the outcome of the cultures. In theory, and we
still do not know whether this the case, it could be bacterial enteritis."

Another 6 cases of poisoning from mussels were recorded tonight [19
Sep 2010] in Turin. A report to the San Giovanni Bosco hospital
related that gastrointestinal symptoms in recent days have affected
dozens of people in Turin and its province, all who had bought the
shellfish in supermarkets. None are in serious condition. Meanwhile
all the other people in recent days who have gone to hospitals with
symptoms of intoxication have been discharged.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the incubation periods
and lengths of the illnesses and whether fever was a prominent symptom.

Since mussels are generally eaten cooked, it is less likely that a
true infection was the cause (such as salmonellosis or norovirus
illness). Staphylococcal enterotoxin is an example of heat stable
enterotoxin which causes an illness of short (less than 6 hours)
incubation and a _Bacillus cereus_ enterotoxin is also heat-stable.

Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP), a toxin-associated illness
associated with production in dinoflagellates, which can be
associated with mussels may well be the diagnosis here. Diarrhea is
the most commonly reported symptom (92 percent), closely followed by
nausea (80 percent) and vomiting (79 percent), with onset 30 minutes
to 12 hours from ingestion. - Mod.LL]
