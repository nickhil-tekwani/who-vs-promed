Danish authorities have ordered thousands of ducks and pheasants
culled at a breeding farm for wild birds after detecting that some
were infected with the bird-flu virus, news reports said today.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) said the strain
was the H5 virus.
Unlike H5N1, the H5 strain is not viewed as potentially lethal to
humans but the culling was a precautionary measure, said the agency.
["H5" is a preliminary, incomplete definition of the LPAI strain
involved; its N segment could be any of the 9 neuraminidase (N1-N9)
subtypes of influenza A viruses. - Mod.AS]
The agency conducts routine tests as part of an avian-flu monitoring programme.
A 1-km no-go zone has been set up around the farm located near Viborg
in central Jutland.

Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Poultry In Denmark
-----------------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza in
Denmark reported to the OIE: 2 Jun 2006).
Information received on 6 Jul 2006 from Dr Preben Willeberg, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Soborg:
Report date: 6 Jul 2006.
Identification of agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5*.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 5 Jul 2006.
Date of start of the event: 5 Jul 2006.
An outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5 has
been reported in a hatchery for farmed game birds (mallards and
pheasants), ducks, geese and different species of ornamental birds at
Loevel in Viborg county. There are approximately 25 000 birds. The
total number of cases and of animals destroyed is not yet available.
Ducklings were tested in accordance with the Danish surveillance
programme for avian influenza in poultry.
The diagnosis has been made by the Danish Institute for Food and
Veterinary Research using PCR test and sequence analysis.
The control measures undertaken are:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- zoning.
Other measures to be undertaken are:
- stamping out;
- disinfection of the infected establishment.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has set up a 1-km
radius restricted zone around the holding and is implementing the
necessary measures in accordance with Council directive 2005/94/EC.
* Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7
avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 2.7.12. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code:

[Loevel is situated at Lat: 56:32:04N (56.5346), Lon: 9:28:00E
(9.4667). Map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=56.5346&lon=9.4667&scale=1000000&icon=x>.
The neuraminidase identity of the LPAI strain involved might be
anticipated in due course. A previous LPAI strain in Denmark, earlier
this year, was eventually found to be H5N2 (see archive 20060623.1740).
The severe control policy applied by the Danish authorities in this
case exceeds regular international requirements. - Mod.AS]
