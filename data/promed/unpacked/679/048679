Health officials revealed on Monday that more people in the capital had
been infected with [a Dengue [virus and asked residents not to panic as
everything was still under control. An official at the city's health agency
disclosed that three more people afflicted by the fever had died, bringing
to 10 the number of fatalities so far.
"We have recorded a total of 1,526 cases so far this year," head of
agency's animal-related diseases section Tini Suryanti told reporters at
her office. Worrying that the disease might spread further, her office held
a meeting on Saturday with all the heads of hospitals located in Greater
Jakarta in an attempt to strictly monitor the development of dengue fever
patients in the capital and Coordinate efforts to overcome the problem.
"We asked hospital heads to inform the agency promptly on any new dengue
fever patients admitted to their hospitals," Tini said. Based on previous
standard procedures, hospitals had to report such cases on a daily basis.
According to available data, the city recorded over 15,000 cases in 1998
with 133 fatalities. Last year, the number of cases totaled 3,751 with 45
people dead. Among the hospitals that have been inundated by dengue fever
patients is Pasar Rebo Hospital in East Jakarta. The hospital's director,
Umar Wahid, said the management had resorted to placing patients in the
corridors as the wards were overflowing. "The patients outnumbered the
hospital's capacity, especially those who are being treated in third
class," Umar, who is President Abdurrahman Wahid's brother, told The
Jakarta Post. But, he said, city residents need not be worried or panicked
about what was happening at his hospital. According to him, the patients
were at the hospital merely due to the hospital's decision not to reject
any dengue fever patients.
"Everything is still under control. We have enough blood and medicine
supplies, as well as medical personnel," he said. So far, the hospital has
treated some 55 dengue patients. "The number of dengue cases is not as high
as in 1998 when the capital had its worst outbreak," he added. Most of the
patients being treated at the hospital were residents living nearby and
mostly of the lower income
bracket, Umar explained. The doctor recalled that some of the patients came
to the hospital in a panic, thinking they were infected by the deadly disease.
He said most of the patients that rushed to the hospital were suffering
from a light fever, indicating that they were at the early stages of the
infection. Umar praised the attitude of the local residents in reacting
immediately. "(Under such conditions), it's not necessary to give the
patients blood ransfusions, only to provide them with additional fluids.
That's enough," he said. Health officials have repeatedly asked the public
to help prevent the possible outbreak by cutting the life cycle of the
_Aedes aegypti_) mosquito, which carries the fever virus. "Residents must
remember to avoid the presence of clean and still water where the mosquito
lays its eggs. We must always close, periodically clean or bury water
containers," head of the city's health agency, Achmad Harjadi, said. In
Central Jakarta, health officials have named at least 10 subdistricts as
the most dengue fever-prone areas in the mayoralty. The head of the control
and eradication subdivision of the local health office, Paripurna,
identified the 10 spots as Karang Anyar, Kemayoran, Serdang, Cempaka Baru,
Utan Panjang, Paseban, Cempaka Putih Timur, Kampung Rawa, Cikini and
Bendungan Hilir. "The conditions there are the worst," he said.
The number of people suffering from dengue fever in those areas in January
and February this year [2000 alone has reached 161 cases, which is three
times higher than the 46 cases in the same period last year. "Our efforts
to help eradicate the fever failed because residents did not cooperate with
us. They, for instance, did not want to open their doors and windows for
the health employees to fumigate. Most of them only asked our personnel to
fumigate the hedges in front of their houses," Paripurna said. Interviewed
earlier on Sunday, several residents told The Jakarta Post that they have
yet to make necessary preparations for a possible outbreak of the fever
although they realized that the number of sufferers increases from day to day.
According to them, they would wait until their local authorities instructed
them to carry out sanitary activities, popularly known as the "3M
Movement", by scrubbing household water tanks, buckets, vases, water
reservoirs and burying unused cans. A resident of Pegangsaan subdistrict,
Rosidi, said people in his neighborhood were accustomed to cleaning their
households themselves. "Moreover, we do not have enough space to bury
unused materials. So far, no one has been afflicted by the fever," he said.
A similar comment was made by Rozali, head of a neighborhood association at
Kalipasir subdistrict. "No instruction has been issued by the subdistrict
authority yet, but we have routinely and voluntarily cleaned our
neighborhood although it is not included in the '3M Movement'," he said.
Experts had repeatedly said that the 3M movement was the most effective way
of eradicating dengue [virus as it would end the mosquito's life cycle.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has predicted that the peak will occur in
April [2000.
