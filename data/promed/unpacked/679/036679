There has been a major outbreak of mumps in Ireland over the past 12 months with almost 2000 cases of the highly infectious disease having been notified to the health authorities.

A significant number of the outbreaks were in the HSE [Health and Safety Executive] South region which includes Cork, Kerry, Waterford and South Tipperary and where notifiable cases were twice the national average. However, the highest incidence of mumps was in the North-West.

The scale of the outbreak, since July 2014, has led the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to recommend an increase in the overall coverage of the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine among teenagers and young adults to prevent similar large outbreaks in future.

The centre said official figures showed there were large gaps in the uptake of the 2-dose MMR vaccination. It claimed many outbreaks were linked to schools, colleges and universities as well as among families.

The centre, which monitors all infectious disease in the Republic, also observed the vaccination status of patients was not routinely available or reported. Such data were not available in 41 percent of all cases.

Nevertheless, the centre said it appeared a large proportion of cases had received 1 to 3 doses of the MMR vaccine with a majority having had at least 1 vaccine. The vaccine, introduced in Ireland in 1988, protects against measles, mumps and rubella. It is usually given to children aged 12 months followed by a booster dose at 4 to 5 years.

The infection can be highly dangerous in older children and adults as it can lead to serious complications such as meningitis and encephalitis through secondary infection.

As there is no cure for mumps, treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing the further spread of infection.

The HPSC [Health Protection Surveillance Centre] said recent results were in line with other international outbreaks of mumps which had shown waning immunity to the mumps component of the MMR vaccine as a factor in a number of outbreaks of the disease.

Research has shown there were 1993 reported cases of mumps notified to the health authorities in the past 12-month period with outbreaks reported across most regions and all age groups. Males accounted for 56 percent of all cases.

The median age of those infected was 20 years, although the youngest sufferer was 2 months old while the eldest was aged 89 years. 2/3rds of those infected with mumps were aged 15 to 24. Among those cases for whom vaccination data was available in the 15 to 24 age group, a large majority of these reported having received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

Patients in the HSE South region, which also includes Carlow and Kilkenny, accounted for 29 percent of all cases with a notification rate twice the national average at 86.7 per 100 000 population.

However, the highest incidence of mumps was in the North-West (with 93.3 cases per 100 000), while the national average was 43.4 per 100 000 population. The lowest rate (17 per 100 000) was seen in the North-East.

Only 48 percent aged 12 months or older of those infected were reported as having one or more vaccinations, while the vaccination status of more than 1000 cases was unknown or not reported.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 88 percent effective at preventing mumps while one dose provides 78 percent cover.

[Mumps is a contagious infection, caused by mumps virus, a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Mumps is most common in children over the age of 2 who have not been vaccinated, and also causes disease in unvaccinated teenagers and young adults, although older people may contract the disease as well. In the cases reported above, a large majority reported having received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Immunity appears to have waned over time or was only partial to begin with. The MMR vaccine, against measles, mumps, and rubella, is least effective against mumps. As stated in the report, 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are 88 percent effective at preventing mumps while 1 dose provides 78 percent cover.

Mumps is spread from person to person via airborne droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with the infected person or contaminated items.

Once a person has become infected with mumps, it takes 2-3 weeks for the symptoms to appear. However, an infected person can spread the infection even when they do not have any symptoms -- the disease is contagious from 7 days before and up to 9 days after the onset of symptoms. It can be a potentially serious disease for children and young adults.

The virus causes salivary glands to become swollen and tender on one or both sides of the face, resulting in enlarged cheeks. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, and can last up to 10 days. For teenagers, getting mumps can cause swelling in the testicles or ovaries, and can lead to sterility. Swelling of the brain can occur in the most serious cases, albeit rarely.

In 2014, in Ireland, the number of people diagnosed with mumps [up to November 2014] more than doubled when compared to the previous year, 2013. There were more than 400 cases of the highly contagious airborne disease diagnosed in 2014, compared with a total of 184 cases in 2013. [And this current report is 5-fold higher to date for 2015.] The 2014 outbreak predominantly affected young adults and teenagers. - Mod.LK
