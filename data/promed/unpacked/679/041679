A mystery of sorts threatens to stunt Massachusetts' small but growing oyster industry after illnesses linked to bacterial contamination forced the state to shut down beds for the first time ever. The culprit is the _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ bacterium, which has occurred in state waters since the 1960s. Theories abound about the recent increase in illnesses linked to Massachusetts -- but those are only theories.

"Honestly, I'm confused by the whole thing," said Don Merry, an oyster grower from Duxbury [Massachusetts], where oyster beds have been closed. Average monthly daytime water temperatures in the region rarely approach the 81 [deg F/27.2 deg C] believed to be the threshold that triggers dangerous _Vibrio_ growth. Rising average water temperatures locally, while not reaching that threshold, could be causing environmental changes that cause strains of _Vibrio_ to thrive, said Suzanne Condon, associate commissioner of the Department of Health. In addition, virulent _Vibrio_ strains that aren't as temperature-sensitive may have been carried from overseas in ships' ballast water in the past decade, said the state's chief shellfish biologist, Michael Hickey.

Meanwhile, it has been only 6 years since states were required to federally report _Vibrio_ illnesses. So testing for it is relatively slow and underdeveloped and can't yet predict, for instance, if outbreaks are coming, Hickey said.

The bacterium causes gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and cramping, but the illness is generally severe only in people with weakened immune systems. The CDC estimates the USA has about 4500 cases of _Vibrio_ infection annually.

Since May 2013, Massachusetts has had 50 laboratory-confirmed cases of vibriosis, compared with 27 during the same period in 2012. Other states have also seen increases in _Vibrio_-related illnesses.

In August 2013, Connecticut closed oyster beds and issued a voluntary oyster recall after its 1st _Vibrio_ outbreak, which sickened at least 14 people. Also in August 2013, officials in Washington's King County, where Seattle is located, warned oyster fans that _Vibrio_ had sickened twice as many people as normal.

Cape Cod [Massachusetts] oyster farmer John Lowell said the trouble hits everyone working to build his state's industry, though his East Dennis farm is nowhere near the closed beds. "You either hang separately or you hang together, so it affects all of us," he said.

Massachusetts has about 260 oyster growers who harvested roughly USD 12 million worth of oysters in 2012. That total is dwarfed by Louisiana -- the highest-revenue oyster state, at USD 42 million -- but it's in the top 5 nationally, according to federal statistics. Hickey said a boom in aquaculture operations fueled a 67 percent increase in the value of the Massachusetts oyster catch between 2010 and 2012.

Massachusetts' 1st closures were announced 30 Aug 2013 for oyster beds along the shore south of Boston, after illnesses caused by _Vibrio_ were linked to an oyster-growing area in Duxbury. The 2nd closure, announced Mon 9 Sep 2013, shut down oyster beds in Katama Bay in Edgartown, on Martha's Vineyard. Combined, this year's [2013] closures affect about 14 percent of Massachusetts growers, Hickey said.

[Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _E. coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aide to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). - Mod.LL
