The following background information on Kunjin virus infection is abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series [1]. Primary references are available on request.

Kunjin virus (KUN), a subtype of West Nile virus, was 1st isolated in Australia in 1960 from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_). The virus is named for an Aboriginal clan living on the Mitchell River in Kowanyama, northern Queensland. Most cases of human infection are reported in Australia, with sporadic reports from Nepal.

Serosurveys suggest the presence of human infection in Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In Australia, Kunjin virus infection is more widely distributed than another flavivirus disease, Murray Valley encephalitis. The yearly incidence varies from 0-to-9 cases per year (see Graph).

KUN is reported in most of tropical Australia, eastern Queensland, and occasionally southeastern Australia. The disease appears to have been responsible for some reports of "Murray Valley encephalitis" in 1974 and was implicated in an additional sporadic case in northern Victoria in 1984. A presumptive case of KUN was reported in Pilbara, Western Australia in 1997. In 2000, the disease reappeared in Central Australia, where it had last been documented in 1974. During 1992 to 2010, 13 cases were reported in Northern Territory, and an outbreak of Kunjin virus encephalitis was reported among horses in New South Wales in 2011.

See incidence graph for KUN in Australia at https://www.gideononline.com/2019/04/03/kunjin-virus-infection/.

In 2011, 3.1% of blood donors in Mildura, Victoria were found to be seropositive toward KUN. The following year, seropositivity was documented in 0.6% to 0.7% of humans and 12.7% of animals in eastern New South Wales. The principal mosquito vectors for Kunjin virus are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cu. pseudovishnui_, and _Cu. squamosis_. _Aedes albopictus_ has been identified as a potential vector for Kunjin virus in Australia.

The virus has also been identified in mosquitoes from Malaysia. Reservoirs include marine birds, pigs and horses. Kunjin virus infection is often asymptomatic. Overt infection is clinically similar to Ross River disease: arthralgia, fever and rash.

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof. Berger for this background information. His response is a comment following the report of Kunjin virus transmission activity in the Darwin area that was presumably detected in vector mosquitoes recently. - Mod.TY
