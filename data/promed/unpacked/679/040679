From: Dr Andie Forde <amf@welpath.co.nz>

Two patients have just consulted me post-travel. They have advised me that
on the 24 Aug 1999 when they crossed the border from Thailand to Kampuchea
at the Poipet ( ? ) crossing they were compelled to swallow a tablet.
Another individual identified this tablet as being of the same brand as the
antimalarial which they were taking daily. But thought that the dose was
four times higher. A number of people developed nausea and vomited after
taking this tablet.
I assume that these travellers were given doxycycline, presumably for
cholera, as has occurred in Madagascar.
