Subject: Report of anthrax case in Mosul

[We received the following report on March 29th and initiated a query as to
the reality of the events reported as there were two "odd" aspects: that
the disease was "contagious," which it is not except in truly extraordinary
circumstances, and that the hospital staff were given anti-anthrax serum,
which is very hard to obtain outside Russia and not omni-available even
there and would be of no use in a chemical exposure. MHJ Mod]

Iraqi paper claims disease similar to "anthrax" killed six in Mosul hospital
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mosul, Al-Zaman: Workers at the Republican Hospital in Mosul asserted to
Al-Zaman yesterday that secret health and security measures were taken at
the hospital's burns unit during the past three days following the death of
six Iraqis last week from a contagious serious skin disease that the
workers say is similar to the disease known as "anthrax". The sources,
which refused to be identified, told Al-Zaman correspondent in the city,
which is in northern Iraq, that a village baby girl was brought by her
father to the hospital two weeks ago and treated for a spot on her hand
that looked like a burn and that this was the origin of the disease.
It is suspected that the skin disease on the hand of a shepherd's baby girl
caused the spread of a disease over which silence is maintained and might
have spread to other ordinary patients inside the hospital. The sources
said that the doctors, nurses and burns unit workers were given
anti-anthrax serum, the same that is given to soldiers to protect them from
chemical weapons.
According to the sources, the hospital's burns unit was closed and a large
and precise operation was launched to disinfect it while senior hospital
officials and employees refused to discuss this issue or give press
statements about the nature of the disease and its source for publication.

U.S. military medical officers contacted Iraqi medical officials in Mosul
to investigate this situation. About 2 weeks ago, a child from one of the
local shepherd communities was brought to Al-Zahrawi Hospital in Mosul. The
child had a burn with a black skin lesion (possibly an eschar). The
attending physician biopsied the lesion and found that it was not anthrax
but actinomycosis. The child was treated for both the burn and the
actinomycosis, got better, and was discharged to home. There were no other
deaths reported from this incident, nor other cases of serious skin
disease, nor any other cases of actinomycosis. There were no reports of
cases of anthrax at Al-Zahrawi Hospital.
Al-Zahrawi Hospital was formerly called "Republic" (Al-Jumhurriya)
Hospital, but changed names over five years ago. On Wednesday, 24 March
2004, TV Ninewa went to Al-Zahrawi Hospital to investigate the anthrax
claim. They found no cases other than this single child described above and
did not report a story on TV. Broadening the search even further, US and
Iraqi physicians found no cases of anthrax at the nearby Al-Razzi Hospital.
Local officials do report that cutaneous anthrax is endemic around Mosul,
with an average of 20 human cases per year.
Local Iraqi physicians state that they know of no supplies of "anti-anthrax
serum" in the area. Such a product has been available in Russia, but is
not licensed in the United States. Nor did it play any role in this incident.
Report coordinated by CPT Dan C. Godbee, MD, US Army Reserve, Deputy
Brigade Surgeon and Arabic linguist, 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division
[Our thanks to Col. Grabenstein and Cpt. Godbee for their information on
the Al-Zaman report of events in the Al-Zahrawi hospital. While the disease
is known in Iraq --- their last report to OIE in 1995 merely stated that it
was seen in sheep & goats; WHO reported some 200-269 human cases during the
period 1976-80 --- hard information has been lacking. In latter years it is
known that the quality of veterinary services had fallen off significantly.
Whether the Al-Zaman report was misinformation or purposeful disinformation
is unknown - Mod.MHJ]
