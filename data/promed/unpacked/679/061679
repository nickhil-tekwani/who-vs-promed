Rift Valley Fever Outbreak in Yemen: State of Emergency Declared
----------------------------------------------------------------
Two experts from the WHO arrived in Sana'a on Sat 30 Sep 2000 to
participate in the field campaigns against the Rift Valley fever outbreak
which has so far claimed lives of about 100 people in Hodeidah. A state of
emergency has been declared in Hodeidah Wadies following the spread of the
fever there. A number of army helicopters are preparing to take part in the
operation and expand the spray of insecticides all over Yemen.
A government team has recently announced full control of the disease in
Wadi Mour, Hodeidah, pointing out that no deaths had been reported since
last Wednesday (27 Sep 2000). [However local sources in Hodeidah told the
Yemen Times that a number of new cases had been detected in Hodeidah and
that more than 2 000 animals had died.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh [ordered the Ministries Of Defense And
Interior to ban import and entry of livestock from the Horn of Africa.

official sources and those from unattributed local sources. -Mod.CP
