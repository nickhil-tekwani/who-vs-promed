On 18 Oct 2022, the regional health authorities of Galicia in Spain reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in a mink farm in the province of A Coruña. Mink in the farm were tested following regular surveillance procedures after the occurrence of sick mink in the farm with respiratory symptoms and an unusual increase in deaths of the animals. Mink were tested for several diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Two samples tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1).

Avian influenza A(H5N1) has recently been detected in Spain in domestic and wild birds. Strict measures were immediately implemented on the farm by the official veterinary services. Following a public health risk assessment by Spanish authorities, mink were culled in the farm that kept 8369 breeding females and 43 617 weaned offspring, and the farm premises were cleaned and disinfected. As a precautionary measure, the Ministry of Rural Affairs initiated surveillance of poultry and mink farms located around the affected farm. Among other measures, it will be prohibited to keep concentrations of birds and the release of hunting birds for repopulation.

[A Coruña is a port city on a promontory in the Galicia region of northwest Spain (map at https://tinyurl.com/4azy27vj). It is situated within the territories, stretching along the Atlantic shores of Spain's north and north-west, where a dense cluster of HPAI H5 cases in wild water birds has been reported during the recent 4 weeks. See FLI map, updated 20 Oct 2022, at https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/aviaere-influenza-ai-gefluegelpest/karten-zur-klassischen-gefluegelpest/.

The described mink case has become Spain's 2nd HPAI event in mammals during 2022, preceded by a human case, early October (ProMED post 20221005.8705973). This was Europe's 2nd case of human H5N1 infection during 2022; the 1st case was reported in February 2022 from England.

Since mink are inherently susceptible to both (human and animal) influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, their potential role to become "mixing vessels," as in pigs, for the generation of novel reassortant viruses, should be adequately addressed. It is important to prevent mink from being infected with such viruses. Clear intervention steps that should be taken are to stop feeding minks with raw poultry products and to refrain from workers with respiratory symptoms from attending mink farms (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2021.1899058). - Mod.AS
