Suspected hog cholera cases found in Kagoshima
----------------------------------------------
The Kagoshima prefectural government said Thu, 18 Mar 2004, pigs at a
local pig farm may have been infected by swine fever virus, also
known as hog cholera.
Initial blood tests found that 40 of 44 pigs checked at the farm in
Kanoya had hog cholera antibodies but no virus has been defected,
officials said. They said they conducted the tests after 6 of 98
pigs shipped from the farm to a slaughterhouse had been found to have
symptoms of hog cholera on Mon, 15 Mar 2004.
Further tests found that 10 pigs at the farm did not have the
disease, they said.
The prefectural government asked pig farms within a radius of 3
kilometers of the farm not to ship their pigs, they said.
The antibodies, which can be inherited [passive, maternally derived?
- Mod AS], could be the result of preventive injections typically
given to pigs, or they could be a sign that the animals had
contracted the disease, the officials said.
The pig farm last gave pig injections against the disease in November 2000.
The fatality rate of the disease is almost 100 percent but humans are
not infected by it.
The last hog cholera outbreak in Japan was reported in Kumamoto
Prefecture in 1992.
Kagoshima ships more pigs than any other prefecture in Japan at about
2 million annually.
