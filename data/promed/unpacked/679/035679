Public health officials in multiple states, with the assistance of
the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the FDA
(Food and Drug Administration), are investigating a large multistate
outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Tennessee infections. An
epidemiologic study comparing foods that ill and well persons said
they ate showed that consumption of Peter Pan peanut butter and Great
Value peanut butter were both statistically associated with illness
and therefore the likely source of the outbreak.
FDA has advised consumers not to eat any Peter Pan peanut butter
purchased since May 2006 and not to eat Great Value peanut butter
with a product code beginning with "2111" purchased since May 2006.
Peter Pan peanut butter is made in a single facility in Georgia.
Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with "2111"
is made in the same facility as Peter Pan peanut butter. Great Value
peanut butter made by other manufacturers is not affected.
As of 21 Feb 2007 at 12PM EST, 329 persons infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella_ Tennessee have been reported to CDC from 41
states. Among 249 patients for whom clinical information is
available, 51 (21 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been
attributed to this infection. Onset dates, which are known for 224
patients, ranged from 1 Aug 2006 to 2 Feb 2007, and 60 percent of
these illnesses began after 1 Dec 2006.
FDA officials and the peanut butter manufacturer are working
collaboratively to learn more about production of peanut butter to
determine how it may have become contaminated.
The states that have reported cases are Alaska (1 case), Alabama
(10), Arkansas (3), Arizona (5), California (3), Colorado (10),
Connecticut (2), Florida (4), Georgia (18), Iowa (6), Illinois (7),
Indiana (14), Kansas (8), Kentucky (9), Massachusetts (5), Maryland
(2), Maine (1), Michigan (7), Minnesota (5), Missouri (16),
Mississippi (5), Montana (2), Nebraska (2), Nevada (1), New Jersey
(6), New Mexico (1), North Carolina (16), New York (34), Ohio (7),
Oklahoma (10), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (25), South Carolina (6),
South Dakota (5), Tennessee (18), Texas (14), Virginia (23), Vermont
(4), Washington (4), Wisconsin (6), and West Virginia (2).
