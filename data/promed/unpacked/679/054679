A suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Postrervalle last week mobilized personnel of the medical center of this municipality and the Office of Health of Vallegrande. The ill individual, a 17 year old, who works as a cowboy in the Mosqueras area, went to the [health] center, presenting with symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection]. He was taken to Vallegrande where a corresponding chart was initiated and related tests were done that confirmed the 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area.

Due to the seriousness of the case, on [Fri 26 Apr 2019] the patient was transferred to Santa Cruz where he received treatment. It is believed that the patient was infected when he was in a rural property in Moroco, close to Mosqueras.

The Moroco - Mosqueras area is forested with high humidity due to the constant rains. There are several cattle ranches in the area.

Rodrigo Garc√≠a, Chief of Health in Vallegrande, stated that they went immediately to the areas and established an [epidemiological] focal blockade and began to train people about management of the disease. Today [Mon 29 Apr 2019] a new team went into the place in order to verify the presence of long-tail rats that transmit the virus.

A hantavirus outbreak was reported recently in [nearby] Tarija [department].

[The condition of the patient is reported as serious, prompting his transfer to Santa Cruz city where more advanced facilities are available. The seriousness of the case suggests that he may have developed hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome although no mention is made of the use of mechanical ventilation.

The hantavirus involved in this case is not specified. The Moroco - Mosqueras area is an inter-Andean valley. The report above indicates that it is forested area but the presence of cattle ranches indicates that extensive open areas of pasture must be present as well; making it difficult to determine which of several hantaviruses may be involved. Andes hantavirus has not been reported present in Bolivia. In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

As Dr. Jan Clement pointed out previously, a battery of hantavirus diagnostic agents, including SEOV antigens is required to reach a definitive diagnosis. - Mod.TY
