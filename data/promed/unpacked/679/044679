Uchida farm which shipped day-old-chicks found positive for H5
--------------------------------------------------
The affected farm is located in Ibaraki town in Ibaraki Prefecture, some
50km from Mitsukaido city, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries announced.
The Ministry ordered immediately the culling of 116 000 birds on the farm,
and imposed movement restrictions within a radius of 5 km.
"There is a possibility that the infection route of this bird influenza
outbreak is different from the other outbreak confirmed around
Mitsukaido-shi at the end of June 2005", said Prof Hiroshi Kida from
Hokkaido University, chairman of the government's poultry diseases subcomittee.

[It is not clear if this outbreak is different from the recent one
described in posting 20050727.2171. An official Japanese follow-up report,
sent to the OIE on 28 Jul 2005 from Dr Hirofumi Kugita, Chief Veterinary
Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, appears in
today's (29 Jul 2005) OIE disease information. It notifies 3 outbreaks in
the Ibaraki prefecture (2 in Mitsukaido city, 1 in Bando city), caused by
an H5N2 LPAI virus.

Official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the above outbreak, and typing
of the virus involved, are pending. - Mod.AS]
