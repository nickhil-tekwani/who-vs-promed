National Map Commentary (updated: 5 Aug 2005)
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust (ASR) was reported today [6 Aug 2005] in Laurens
County in Georgia and Pearl River County in Mississippi. Elmore
County in Alabama and Laurens County in Georgia are the furthest
north that ASR has been reported in 2005. Pearl River County,
Mississippi is the furthest west that ASR has been found in 2005.
Alabama now has 3 counties reported positive with ASR; Florida has 9;
Georgia has 7; and Mississippi has 2. New reports for ASR are
expected to continue within states already reporting the disease over
the next week [2nd week August 2005], with new reports now coming in
almost daily.

"Rust-like" spores reported in Champaign county Illinois
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tuesday [6 Aug 2005], there are no observations of Asian
soybean rust [ASR] on soybean, kudzu, or other potential hosts in the
top soybean state of Illinois or in neighboring states, according to
an official report on the USDA's sbrusa.net web site. However, spore
traps in the state have turned up 4 "rust like" spores. The
unconfirmed spores were reported on 29 Jul 2005 in one Illinois spore
trap in Champaign county.
Spraying fungicides in Illinois is not recommended at this time. The
USDA forecast outlook indicates that the risk of large numbers of ASR
spores being deposited in Illinois this week is low.
According to Linda Kull of the National Soybean Research Laboratory
at the University of Illinois, quoting from an official USDA
observation report, "Spraying at this time is premature, may result
in the need for a 2nd spray later in the season, and could be a waste
of time and money. USDA scientists say soybeans approaching pod and
seed fill are at low or no risk of damage by ASR in Illinois. When
seeds are nearly mature and begin to dry, the risk of yield loss due
to ASR is very low.
The sample in question was collected from a spore trap the week of 14
Jul 2005. The spores look similar to many kinds of rusts from various
hosts. Spores in traps cannot be positively identified with visual,
molecular, or culturing techniques. "It is not possible to confirm
whether these spores are actually ASR, but scouting in Champaign
county has increased," Kull said.
In Kentucky and Tennessee, similar "rust-like" spores were reported
in several traps, but there is no evidence that soybean plants or
alternative hosts there have been infected with ASR.
The latest report of ASR-soybean plants is in Lee County, in Alabama,
in the east-central part of the state. It represents the most
northern location of soybean rust in 2005.

[ASR may be present in Illinois, but confirmation will come after
laboratory tests, hopefully next week (2nd week August 2005).
