CJD case in Norway NOT linked to BSE
--------------------------------------
The earlier reported case of a man in Norway supposedly suffering from new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is misleading. [ProMED-mail reported the
Aftenposten on-line piece and stated "A Norwegian man who died last week at
Aker Hospital in Oslo 'most probably' was suffering from the human form of
mad cow disease or new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD or vCJD)."
It was certainly not stated as a confirmed case in our posting. - Man. Ed.
DS. The clinical picture was typical of the sporadic form of the disease
and an autopsy carried out 17 Oct 2000 confirmed this diagnosis.
