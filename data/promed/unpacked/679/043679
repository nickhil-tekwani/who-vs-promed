[Novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV], a dozen are positive without symptoms. Samples have been sent to ISS for confirmation

"Approximately a dozen people have tested positive" for the [novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV] "but are completely asymptomatic. We sent samples to the Institute of Medicine 'for confirmation'," says Professor Alessandro Bartoloni, head of infectious diseases at the AOU Careggi

"People with positive screening results" - continued the professor - "have not been isolated and are at home 'cause they have no signs. [We] continue to take samples and examine them to understand the extent to which the virus [is being transmitted] and' widespread '. The behavior of [the novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV] seems to have surprised the experts. "There was a belief, as indicated by the World Health [Organization]'- continues the infectious disease [specialist] - that the virus had limited transmission [person-to-person] and that infection led to aggressive disease. What we're seeing so far seems to be just the opposite -- widespread transmission and minimal to no disease. The scheme is 'reversed'.

The tests have been conducted on people who have had contact with someone who already 'is positive, although not presenting any symptoms. "In addition to the protection of persons - says Professor Bartoloni - this study will serve 'to figure out what is going on... The question at this point if whether the virus has been modified or if we are dealing with a totally different virus.

[Novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV], a dozen patients positive but without symptoms

The 3 hospitalized for [novel coronavirus] are in good condition.
-------------------
There are approximately a dozen people who have tested positive for the [novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV] so far but are completely asymptomatic. The samples were sent to the Institute of Health for confirmation, said Professor Alessandro Bartoloni, head of infectious diseases at the AOU Careggi today [3 Jun 2013]. The positive tests were obtained by throat swabs, were from individuals that did not have any symptoms so they are remaining at home (not hospitalized) under observation. The 3 patients with clinical symptoms are in good condition in the hospital and are in isolation. The index case, the 45 years old Jordanian male, should be discharged from the hospital either tonight or tomorrow at the latest. The man and the young girl "look good", reported the doctors, but for now will remain hospitalized for precautionary reasons.


Meanwhile, testing of individuals who have come into contact with these 3 cases is continuing, even in the absence of symptoms. The testing is not finished so the numbers of positives may still increase in the coming hours. "People with positive screening results - continued the professor - have not been isolated and are at home because they have no symptoms. We continue to take samples and examine them to see how far the virus has spread." The behavior of the [novel coronavirus - MERS-CoV] seems to have surprised the experts. "There was a belief, as indicated by the World Health Organization - continued the infectious disease [expert] - that the virus was had limited transmission [perso-to-person] and was quite aggressive. What we're seeing so far seems to be, however, just the opposite. The pattern is reversed. " "In addition to the protection of persons - says Professor Bartoloni - this study will serve us well to understand what is behavior of the virus. The question at this point is: has the virus has changed or is another virus? Â».

"The crisis unit set up last Friday [1 Jun 2013]" - said the Tuscany Regional Authorities - "is constantly monitoring the clinical and epidemiological situation." The Crisis Unit consists of technical advisers to the Councillor of Health, , the 2 teaching hospitals -the University Hospital of Careggi and the Meyer Hospital, and the Health Unit 10 in Florence [?]. In the afternoon [3 Jun 2013] in Florence, Dr. Giuseppe Ruocco, the Director General of Prevention in the Ministry of Health participated with the [University Hospital of] Careggi, at a meeting organized by the Tuscany Regional Department of Health. This meeting was directed by the Assessor Health Advisor Luigi Marroni. "The purpose of the meeting was to present the strategies, procedures and initiatives taken by the Tuscany Regional Health office, in order to report how the Ministry of Health is monitoring the situation. Tomorrow [4 Jun 2013] afternoon there will be a meeting of the crisis committee with experts from the Institute of Health, in order to complete the technical examination of the actions taken."

[If the positive tests are confirmed by the Institute of Medicine, this will represent the 1st documentation of asymptomatic transmission of the MERS-CoV among contacts of clinically ill patients. The question raised by the presenting physician as to whether they are identifying a changed virus or whether they are identifying a different virus from the virus that has been associated with an apparently high case fatality rate is a good question. Another curious observation is that these positive specimens were obtained from throat swabs, and not lower respiratory tract specimens. Another difference from what has been observed up to the present. We await further information on this announcement.

It is not in the best interest of a virus to kill the majority of the individuals/hosts that it infects. It is considered somewhat suicidal, as it will ultimately kill off the majority of potential hosts.
