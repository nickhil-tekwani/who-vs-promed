Rising levels of a fungal disease are threatening future canola crops
across Western Australia.

Sclerotinia produces white fluffy growths on the outside of the stem,
reducing yields and remaining in stubbles to re-infect crops in
following years. Chemical control of the fungus is also difficult as
there's a very limited time in which fungicides can be successfully
applied to the canola plant. Most commercial varieties of canola are
susceptible to sclerotinia infection.

Plant pathologist Ravjit Khangura says rising levels of the disease
are now reaching worrying levels. "A lot of canola crops had levels
as high as 60 percent of the stems," he says. "Initially, we thought
the disease was more prevalent in the northern coastal areas, but you
know, it is just everywhere."

[Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mould), is
caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This soilborne
fungus is one of the most nonspecific (around 400 known hosts) and
successful of plant pathogens and is present worldwide. On oilseed
rape, infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem lesions
showing a typical bleached appearance develop.

The pathogen is primarily soilborne and has a complex disease cycle.
It can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread by infected
plant material, mechanical means and wind-borne spores. It is thought
that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots
of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for
crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history
of a field as well as weather conditions.

Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term
crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum)
and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very
effective against soilborne fungal pathogens.

Canola (CANadian Oil Low Acid) is the trademarked name of a
commercial variety of oilseed rape which is grown widely.
