Three people contracted anthrax in the Kostanay [Qostanay] region. They are now in the hospital. The disease was first detected in cattle in one of the livestock farms in the village of Prirechnoye, Denisovskiy district.

More than 10 heads have already died, and quarantine has been imposed (on the area). Veterinarians have hygienically disposed the corpses of the dead animals. Also, the places where cattle were kept and died were disinfected. Vaccination against anthrax was urgently organized. The vaccinated animals are under the supervision of veterinary officers. The epizootic situation in the rest of the villages of the Denisov region and in the whole of the Kostanay region is stable.

The last time cases of infection among people with anthrax were recorded in 1995. The veterinary department of the Kostanay region reported that at the end of June [2021], on the basis of diagnostic studies in cattle materials belonging to Altai LLP with Prirechnoye of the Sverdlovsk Rural District of the Denisov District, an anthrax pathogen was identified, an inbusiness.kz correspondent reports.

The veterinary station of the Denisovsky district took timely measures to prevent the spread of the disease from the focus of infection. Measures were taken to destroy the [carcasses] of dead animals in a specialized incinerator and disinfect places where animals were kept and died. Already on 3 Jul [2021], in the focus of infection, all liquidation measures have been carried out by the Republican Antiepizootic Detachment KF. Now, in all 4 livestock bases and adjacent territories, mechanical cleaning [and] whitewashing of partitions, feeders, and walls of premises has been completed, the regional veterinary department reported. In addition, a 2-fold disinfection of livestock bases, walking areas, summer cards as well as places of death of animals was carried out.

The epizootic situation in the rest of the villages of the Denisov region and in the whole of the Kostanay region is stable. Since 12 Jul [2021], no deaths have been registered in the focus of infection among animals, [and] the situation has stabilized. The vaccinated animals are under the supervision of the veterinary service; the condition of the animals is satisfactory. The quarantine will be lifted 15 calendar days after the infection has been eradicated and the final disinfection has been carried out.

The department of sanitary and epidemiological control of the Kostanay region added that 3 residents of the Sverdlovsk rural district were infected. The last time cases of infection among people with anthrax were recorded was in 1995.

In the Denisovsky district of the Kostanay region, an unfavorable epidemiological situation for anthrax has developed. In one of the largest fattening farms, livestock deaths were registered, according to BaigeNews.kz citing alau.kz. This was reported by the head of the department of especially dangerous infections of the department of sanitary and epidemiological control of the Kostanay region, Lyudmila Nalobina.

According to the specialist, in the process of carrying out work to establish and eliminate the causes of death, 3 participants in these events became infected. All patients are in the infectious diseases hospital of the regional center and receiving specific treatment. During the investigation of this incident by epidemiologists and veterinarians, the cause was established: the causative agent of anthrax.

"To date, preventive anti-epidemic and anti-epizootic measures are being taken in the hotbed of infection of people and agricultural livestock. Persons related to this outbreak have been identified; all of them receive prophylactic antibacterial treatment, after which they will be vaccinated with an anthrax vaccine. To date, the source of infection has not been established. Most often, the source is the old anthrax burials, on the territory of which, despite the prohibitions, cattle graze," said Lyudmila Nalobina.

However, according to her, there are no such burials within this farm. "It is quite possible that the cause was abnormal heat, which resulted in the formation of a scarce grass cover. When grazing, farm animals could become infected with anthrax spores in the ground when plucking out undersized grass with roots," concluded Nalobina.

The incubation period for anthrax is 14 days. The [human] disease begins with general malaise, weakness, fever, headache, and muscle pain. The most common form of the disease is skin disease. It develops in places where the pathogen enters through contact with contaminated livestock products or when nursing and slaughtering sick cattle. The development of an ulcer begins with redness of the skin. Then a tubercle appears, turning into a bubble with bloody contents. Then the bubble bursts and turns into an ulcer with a characteristic black charcoal bottom. Ulcers are painless, and this is one of the important signs of the disease. Less common are more severe, almost fatal, intestinal and pulmonary forms. In the absence of treatment for the skin form, the outcome is poor.

[It is clearly a puzzle where this infection came from, as it is in a region not rife with outbreaks. But it also borders a region of Russia not without its share of outbreaks. So failing the discovery of a contaminated cattle grave on this farm, or sick animals on adjoining farms, I would be tempted to consider that it came as latent infections in cattle imported from Chelyabinsk in Russia. The stress of transport and the hot summer weather reducing the innate resistance would convert a latent infection into the clinical disease and death.
