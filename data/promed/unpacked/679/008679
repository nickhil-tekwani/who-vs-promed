Since the beginning of 2007, 78 cases of rabies infection in animals have
been recorded in the Rostov Oblast. This figure exceeds that of last year
[2006] by 87 per cent , according to the Rostov Oblast branch of
Rosselkhoznadzor (The Federal Agency for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance).
During the past 8 months, 2 cases of rabies in humans have been recorded,
with fatal outcomes in each case. An official Rosselkhoznadzor spokesperson
stated that these 2 victims had not sought medical aid. The official also
stated that cases of rabies had been registered in 28 districts and 2 towns
of the oblast. In detail, 7 cases have been recorded in each of the
Konstantinovsky and Zimovnikovsky districts, 6 cases have been registered
in the Tselinsky district, 4 cases have been recorded in each of the
Dubovsky and Kamensky districts, and 2 cases have been recorded in each of
the Rostov and Novoshakhtinsk districts.
Biologists at the regional veterinary laboratory have stated that the
increase in rabies is a consequence of an increase in the population of
foxes, which are the main reservoir of the disease. Nonetheless, a
spokesperson for the agency stated that despite this significant increase
of rabies morbidity the veterinary service of the oblast had the situation
under control.

[Expansion of natural foci of rabies has been observed this year (2007) in
various regions of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It is
partly connected with atypical warm weather during the winter, which has
led to growth of the red fox population, and partly connected with
insufficient prophylaxis of rabies among wild animals in the different
regions of NIS (Newly Independent States), especially beyond the borders of
Russia. - Mod.NP
