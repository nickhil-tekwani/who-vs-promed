Nelson Marlborough Public Health Service (PHS) has identified another
5 possible cases of legionellosis in their investigation to find a
source of the illness and search for further cases. PHS were visiting
businesses in the Riverlands Industrial Estate after 3 confirmed cases
of _Legionella_ were reported and 3 suspected cases were identified
earlier this month [May 2011].

Medical officer of health, Dr Ed Kiddle said, "Following visits to
the Riverlands Industrial Area last week [week of 16 May 2011] we have
identified 5 more possible cases of people who have had respiratory
infections that could fit with legionellosis over the period since the
beginning of April [2011]."

He said that these infections could also be due to a virus or
different bacteria and blood tests were being arranged where possible
to see if _Legionella_ could be confirmed. He said that as this
testing required 2 blood samples to be taken some weeks apart the
results wouldn't be available until later in June.

With the additional 5 cases there are now 8 suspected cases of
legionellosis and 3 confirmed cases from this industrial estate area.

To identify a source of the infection we have been working with
Marlborough District Council (MDC) and the Department of Labour (DoL)
to identify all cooling towers in Blenheim and have sampled water from
some towers in the immediate area of concern.

"The 1st results from these cooling tower samples are expected later
today [24 May 2011]. Towers have been shock-dosed with chemicals to
cover any risk if they had been contaminated with _Legionella_ and the
DoL are contacting other premises in the wider Blenheim area with
advice on management of cooling towers," said Dr Kiddle.

In addition PHS had taken samples from compost piles in the
Riverlands Industrial area to further investigate possible sources for
_Legionella_.

"As we may never be able to identify the source of the infection it
is important that people are aware of the risk factors for
legionellosis. These are inhaling dust from compost and potting mix or
being exposed to water spray coming from a contaminated source. People
most at risk of severe disease are those over 50 years of age,
smokers, and anyone with immune suppression," he said.

Legionellosis illness may range from a mild flu like illness to
severe pneumonia with symptoms including fever, dry cough, anorexia,
shortness of breath, chills, muscle aches, and headaches and sometimes
stomach pain and diarrhoea. The illness is not passed from person to
person. Incubation is usually 2 to 10 days. Dr Kiddle advised people
with concerns about their health to see their GP.

Large commercial air conditioning systems that use cooling towers are
potential sources of contamination as well as, hot water systems, air
humidifiers, and spa pools. Businesses with cooling towers are
required to have a programme in place to monitor for _Legionella_ and
treat the water in the cooling towers to ensure that no bacteria can
survive. These are generally in commercial and industrial areas.

Nelson Marlborough Public Health Service (NMPHS) investigates cases
of legionellosis notified to the medical officer of health by a doctor
or a laboratory, in order to identify possible sources of _Legionella_
bacteria and to prevent others from becoming ill. This may involve
providing public health advice to individuals, agencies, and
organisations as required. NMPHS does not provide direct clinical
services or general water or soil testing other than in the context of
investigating notified cases of disease.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease; more than 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand. For Australia and
New Zealand, _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7
per cent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella
longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 per cent of cases (Yu VL, et al:
Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by
culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an
international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8;
http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less
severe than legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its name from
an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually
a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, and cooling towers.

In contrast, in Australia and New Zealand, legionnaires' disease has
been associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix, compost,
and soil; in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found
in potting mix, compost, and soil, and cultured from the respiratory
specimens of patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also
have been reported sporadically in Europe
(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497).
Indeed, legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ in a gardener
was reported recently in Scotland
(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11167176).

Marlborough is one of the regions of New Zealand, located on the
northeast coast of the South Island. Blenheim, the most populous town
in the Marlborough region, is the seat of the regional council and has
a population of 30 200 (June 2010 estimate)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Region). The area that
surrounds the town is well known as a center of New Zealand's wine
industry. For a map of the Riverlands Industrial Estate on the
outskirts of Blenheim and its relation to Blenheim, see
