A U.S. traveler who recently returned from West Africa has died in a New Jersey hospital of Lassa Fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever rarely seen in the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Monday night [25 May 2015].

The unidentified traveler landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport [New York, NY] 17 May [2015], flying from Liberia via Morocco. He had no fever or symptoms during the flight, nor when he was screened at the airport upon arrival.

The next day, however, he went to an unnamed hospital in New Jersey complaining of a sore throat, fever and fatigue. When asked about his recent travel history -- a common question in wake of ongoing fears about the Ebola virus -- he did not reveal his recent visit to Liberia, according to the CDC.

He was treated and released, but returned to the hospital last Thursday, 21 May [2015], because his symptoms had worsened. He was transferred to an unnamed facility designed to treat viral hemorrhagic fevers and specimens were submitted to the CDC for testing.

The test results, available Monday morning [25 May 2015], confirmed Lassa Fever but were negative for Ebola and other viruses.

The patient died Monday evening, according to the CDC. Throughout his treatment he was in "appropriate isolation."

This is just the 6th case of Lassa [fever] in the United States since the virus was discovered in Nigeria in 1969. The last case here was in Minnesota, in 2014. There has never been a person-to-person transmission of the disease in the United States, according to the CDC.

While Lassa fever and Ebola originate in roughly the same part of West Africa, they vary greatly in how contagious they are and how deadly. Ebola can be spread from person to person via contaminated bodily fluids and has a fatality rate approaching 70 percent, according to the CDC.

Lassa, however, has a fatality rate of 1 percent. The illness can be quite severe in about 20 percent of patients, and it routinely kills about 5000 West Africans every year. The virus is named for the locale where it was first located. It is a zoonotic virus -- meaning it is spread by animals. It is most often spread to people when they come in contact with rat droppings.

"In rare cases it can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with a sick person's blood or bodily fluids, through mucous membranes, or through sexual contact," the CDC indicated in its announcement Monday night. "The virus is not transmitted through casual contact, and patients are not believed to be infectious before the onset of symptoms."

CDC officials are now working with local health workers to compile a list of anyone who may have had close contact with the deceased. They will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop any symptoms.

A team of federal disease experts is in New Jersey working with hospitals that treated a man who died from Lassa fever Monday night [25 May 2015], as health officials in that state worked to identify and track people who came into contact with him.

The team, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, includes experts on Lassa fever, infection control, occupational health, and lab and waste management, said a spokesman, Thomas Skinner. The patient, who has not been identified, had come from Liberia earlier this month [May 2015].

The New Jersey Health Department said the patient had been 55 [years old], and referred to him as "an Essex County man." The department did not say whether he was an American citizen, but said he had been "returning" to the United States from Liberia.

In a statement, the state epidemiologist, Dr. Tina Tan, said, "Given what we know about how Lassa virus spreads to people, we think the risk to the public is extremely low."

Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. It can have symptoms similar to Ebola -- diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- but is less infectious [contagious] and far less likely to be fatal. About 1 per cent of Lassa patients die, compared with about 70 per cent of Ebola patients.

The patient, who was not identified, traveled from Liberia to Morocco and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on 17 May [2015]. The patient did not have a fever on departure from Liberia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, or any other symptoms. When he arrived in the United States, his temperature was taken and he again did not have a fever.

The patient was placed under active monitoring starting on 18 May 2015, the day he came into the hospital reporting symptoms, Mr. Skinner said. Under active monitoring, local health workers contact patients to ask about symptoms and temperature. The health department reached a person listed as the man's emergency contact on 19, 20 and 21 May, and he did not report elevated temperatures, the department said. The patient was hospitalized on 22 May.

The man had a job in the mining industry that took him to Liberia numerous times a year, health officials said. Mines are located in remote, rural areas, where Lassa fever tends to be present.

A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Health Department, Donna Leusner, said the patient died at 8:45 p.m. on Monday [25 May 2015]. She did not say which hospital had treated him.

The 6-member C.D.C. team arrived on Tuesday morning and is overseeing work at the hospitals, including helping hospital officials identify which, if any, health care workers should be monitored for symptoms. State and local health care workers in New Jersey are tracing the patient's contacts outside the hospital.

It was unclear whether the patient lied about his symptoms, or simply did not experience any in the days between his 1st visit to the hospital and when he was admitted on 22 May. Unlike people with Ebola [virus disease], in which symptoms tend to be constant after they 1st appear, patients infected with Lassa fever [virus] may have symptoms that ebb and flow, for example a temperature that appears one day but not the next.

The federal disease centers have been in the process of updating health guidance for Liberia since changing that country's classification on 13 May [2015] to a country with "former widespread transmission" of Ebola [virus disease]. The World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola [virus disease] on 9 May, and the federal agency was trying to account for that. It said that current guidance will continue to apply, until an update is posted.

On 4 May [2015], the C.D.C. downgraded its travel risk alert for Liberia to level 2, meaning that the agency was no longer recommending that Americans avoid nonessential travel to that country. But it continues to recommend that travelers practice "enhanced precautions" when traveling to Liberia.

According to the agency, the case in New Jersey is the 6th known occurrence of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the United States since 1969; 2 other cases became known only after the patients had already recovered. The last known case was reported in Minnesota in 2014.

There has never been person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever documented in the United States, the C.D.C. said. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact, and the disease is not believed to be contagious before the onset of symptoms. About 100 000 to 300 000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5000 deaths related to the illness, occur in West Africa each year.

In West Africa, Lassa virus is carried by rodents and transmitted to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents, officials say. In rare cases it can be transmitted through direct contact with a sick person's blood bodily fluids or mucous membranes, or through sexual contact.

[Lassa fever virus (LFV) is endemic in West Africa, including Liberia, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically in Liberia. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. The last outbreak in Liberia posted on ProMED-mail (archive no. 20140328.2363217) was in 2014, citing a report from the CDC. On that occasion, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Liberia notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever in a UN Mission in Liberia Kakata camp, Margibi County. A total of 14 cases including 1 death were reported from 27 Feb 2014 to 10 Mar 2014. The last case of Lassa fever contracted in Liberia with death occurring in the USA, coincidentally also in New Jersey, was in 2004. The current case, reported above, illustrates the importance of obtaining an accurate travel history. Apparently, in this case above, the patient failed to report that he had been in Liberia, which likely delayed his hospitalization and treatment.

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment, though the antiviral drug ribavirin has been used successfully in Lassa fever patients
