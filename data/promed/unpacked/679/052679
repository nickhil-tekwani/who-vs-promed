---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Rice stripe virus_, transmitted by the small brown planthopper
_Laodelphax striatellus_, has recently reemerged as a major disease
in Zhejiang province, eastern China. Intensive surveys during 2003 to
2006 demonstrated how the disease has spread rapidly from the
northern to central and eastern regions with increasing incidence
each year.

In bioassays, the highest proportions of viruliferous vectors were
from regions where the disease was most severe. The greatest disease
incidence was in the earliest sown plants, and substantial control
could be achieved by delaying planting from late May to mid-June. In
experiments where different proportions of infected plants were
established (by inoculation or varying the sowing date), average
yield losses were 0.8 percent for every one percent increase in
disease incidence. In inoculation experiments, young seedlings,
particularly those at the 3- to 5-leaf stage, were the most
susceptible, whereas up to one percent of plants inoculated at or
after the elongation stage developed symptoms.

Recent epidemics appear to have resulted from large populations of
viruliferous vectors colonizing rice seedlings at the most
susceptible stage. This is probably because of changes in cropping
practice, recent warmer winters in Zhejiang province, and the
development of resistance or tolerance to the insecticides widely
used (triazophos, synthetic pyrethroids, and imidacloprid).

[Rice stripe disease caused by _Rice stripe virus_ (RSV) leads to
severe or even crippling losses in many rice-growing regions. RSV is
the type member of the genus _Tenuivirus_, which has not yet been
assigned to a family, and is serologically related to _Maize stripe
virus_ and _Rice grassy stunt virus_. The virus spreads in East Asia
and has been recorded in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and parts of
Russia. It also affects other grassy hosts including wheat, barley,
oats, maize, millets, and some weeds, but only rice and wheat are
reported to serve as virus reservoirs. Symptoms on rice include
chlorotic stripes or mottling on leaves, necrotic streaks, and
wilting. Rice plants infected at the early growth stages are worst
affected, showing severe symptoms and premature death.

RSV is transmitted in a persistent manner by several planthopper
species. It is propagative in the vectors and transmitted to the
progeny via the eggs. The most important vector is the small brown
planthopper, _L. striatellus_, which is often responsible for
epidemics of the disease. The effects of RSV on _L. striatellus_ are
uncertain but RSV may shorten the insects' life span. RSV detection
in this vector is being used for disease forecasting. RSV can also be
mechanically transmitted at low efficiency. Disease management
includes cultural techniques (for example planting time, reduction of
inoculum), vector control, and use of resistant cultivars.
