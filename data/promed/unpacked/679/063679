SYNOPSIS: The latest news from New York State is that West Nile-like virus
has been laboratory confirmed in horses. Ten of 13 symptomatic horses from
Suffolk County tested positive by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. New York
authorities have investigated 23 suspect horses and 13 have died or have
been euthanized. Some of these horses were laboratory positive for Equine
Protozoal Myelitis.
No cases of encephalitis linked to WNV have been reported in pets during
the outbreak . Synopsis Provided by Texas Department of Health. Mod. TG

Subject: West Nile-Like Virus, Update
Horses: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) of the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today [Tues 19 Oct 1999 they
have confirmed West Nile-like Virus (WNV) antibodies in 10 of 13
symptomatic horses tested from Suffolk County. In addition, CDC has
confirmed the virus isolated by NVSL from 1 deceased horse in Suffolk
County is WNV. Additional tests are pending. Twenty-three horses have been
under investigation for WNV (22 from Suffolk County, 1 from Rockland
County), with symptoms and onset dates from late August to mid-October.
Thirteen of the horses have died or been euthanized. A number of these
horses had been previously laboratory confirmed to have equine protozoal
myelitis. It is not known whether this co-infection played a role in the
likelihood of clinical symptoms and death.
Pets: No cases of encephalitis linked to WNV have been documented in pets
in this outbreak, nor does it appear from other WNV outbreaks overseas that
this will be likely. However, CDC has found 3 positive sera from healthy
dogs in a preliminary screen of 84 dog serum samples from New York City.
Pets will probably be similar to most species of mammals and birds in that
they are susceptible to a transient WNV infection if bitten by an infected
mosquito, but are unlikely to become clinically ill.
Birds: WNV has been confirmed by CDC in 78 birds from New York State,
primarily from New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland
counties. In addition, 1 bird each has been confirmed from Orange and
Saratoga county. Most of these dead birds were crows. Current information
supports the birds from Orange and Saratoga counties are birds which
acquired their WNV infection in areas further south, and then flew north
after infected. Laboratory confirmed dead birds have been reported from
Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Bergen, Union, Middlesex, Essex, Hudson,
Monmouth, Morris, and Hunterdon counties in New Jersey.
Almost 5000 dead birds have been reported to the state through county
health departments. Dead bird reports, including species and location, have
been valuable in providing an early surveillance tool for spread of the WNV
outbreak. Laboratory testing of birds will continue to be available,
particularly for crows which appear to be very sensitive to clinical
illness.
Humans: To date, there have been 56 confirmed human WNV cases with 7
deaths, all from New York City, Nassau, and Westchester counties.
Additional studies to determine the degree of asymptomatic infections in
humans are underway.
Summary: The current WNV outbreak in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey
appears to be waning. The number of laboratory confirmed cases in humans,
birds, and horses appears to be declining, even though new positive results
continue as laboratory tests on previous cases are completed (as occurred
with the horses). Due to low temperatures, most of the mosquito control
activities have stopped. It is not known at this time whether the outbreak
will reoccur next spring. Federal wildlife officials are performing bird
serosurveys along the Atlantic seaboard to document any possible spread of
the outbreak. Although documentation of infection in horses is a new
development in this outbreak, previous outbreaks of WNV overseas indicate
that overall morbidity and mortality for WNV infection in all species will
be lower than for other causes of mosquito-borne human and equine
encephalitis.
MEMORANDUM (edited)
Date: 19 Oct 1999
From: Commissioner: L.I. Horses Confirmed to Have West Nile-like Virus

State Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers announced a number of
horse deaths and illnesses in Suffolk County are likely the result of West
Nile-like virus.
The USDA and the CDC confirmed at least 1 dead horse had the virus and
another 10 symptomatic horses have confirmed West Nile-like antibodies.
Additional tests are pending.
>From late August through this month, a total of 22 horses in Suffolk County
have shown clinical signs of the virus. Thirteen of those horses have died
or been euthanized. The other nine horses are recovering.
"We're recommending that horses be stabled inside during normal mosquito
feeding times, which are dusk to dawn," the Commissioner said. "We also are
recommending to horse owners that they use insect repellents on their
horses."
Horses that contract the virus cannot pass the virus to other horses, or to
people or pets, the Commissioner said. The West Nile-like virus is spread
by mosquitoes that acquire the virus from wild birds.
There is no vaccine to prevent infection in horses from the West Nile-like
disease. There is also no known treatment other than supportive therapy,
which includes giving the horse intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory
drugs to prevent swelling. Appropriate precautions should be taken when
handling any animal with neurological symptoms to avoid risk of exposure,
particularly because the animal could have rabies.
State Department of Agriculture and Markets veterinarians have notified
all of the equine practitioners in the state about the situation, advising
them of the clinical signs of the virus and appropriate sample collection
and submission procedures.
State Department of Agriculture and Markets veterinarians and other vets
assigned to federal agencies are conducting surveillance activities,
including blood sampling of horses throughout Long Island and the Hudson
Valley, as part of an emergency response effort coordinated by the USDA.
The CDC today confirmed the positive West Nile-like test results after
tissue samples were sent to USDA laboratories. The CDC is currently testing
tissue samples from the other dead horses and serum from the living horses
suspected to have the virus.
Initially, local veterinarians thought the horse deaths and illnesses were
caused by Equine Protozoal Myelitis, a relatively common disease in horses.
However, state and local veterinarians later noticed unusual symptoms and
more and more horses becoming sick, creating suspicions that West Nile-like
virus may be the cause.
Officials with the USDA are developing a West Nile-like virus diagnostic
test and conducting inoculation studies to determine the effects of the
disease on U.S. livestock and poultry.
Clinical signs of the virus in horses include lethargy, weakness in the
hind quarters, stumbling and [loss of coordination, lack of awareness,
head tilt and head twitch, convulsions, circling, hyperexcitability,
partial paralysis and coma.
