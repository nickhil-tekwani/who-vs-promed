In 1988, the United Kingdom reported that it had identified a new disease
in cattle and called it bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It was
postulated that the disease was caused by a scrapie-like agent and was
being spread by the feeding of rendered meat meal and bone meal to cattle.
In rapid succession, spongiform encephalopathies were recognised in
ruminants in zoos, and in domestic and wild cats.
In March 1996, the United Kingdom reported cases of Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease (CJD) that did not fit the classical description of that disease.
Affected people were younger and the clinical signs and pathology were
different to classical CJD. Although the causative agent of new variant CJD
was not known at the time, the possibility was raised that it may have
arisen from the consumption of BSE-infected meat.
In April 1996, the World Health Organization advised countries on
precautions to prevent the spread of a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) in countries with and without BSE and other TSEs such
as scrapie in sheep. The advice for countries like Australia and New
Zealand was to: ban the feeding of meat meal and bone meal (rendered
ruminant protein) to ruminants; and review the rendering practices in the
country.
In May 1996, industry placed a voluntary ban on the feeding of rendered
ruminant proteins to ruminants. The Australian Agriculture and Resource
Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) agreed that
States and Territories impose a regulatory ban on the feeding of rendered 2
ruminant protein from 1 November 1996. A review of the standards in the
rendering industry demonstrated that all plants have treatments in place
that will destroy anthrax and _Clostridium perfringens_ spores no plant had
treatments that would destroy the BSE agent (133 o C for 20 minutes at 3
bar pressure when processing pieces less than 50 mm size). Given that
Australia is free of animal TSEs, there is no reason to require
inactivation of the BSE prion protein in Australian rendering processes,
particularly as there is a ban on feeding rendered meat meal and bone meal
to ruminants.
In May 1997, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) the world
animal health organisation recommended that all member organisations
institute a monitoring and surveillance program that would detect a
BSE-like condition before it became established in cattle populations. The
recommended program included: compulsory notification and clinical
investigation of suspect cases, namely adult animals showing signs of
nervous disease; undertaking a risk assessment to identify potential
hazards for BSE occurrence in the country; initiating a continuous
surveillance and monitoring program for BSE that addresses the risks
identified in the point above; examining brain material of animals older
than 20 months displaying progressive neurological signs for TSE at
approved laboratories using approved diagnostic techniques; and recording
the results of the monitoring and surveillance investigations and
maintaining the records for at least seven years.
In early October 1997, two research papers reported that new variant CJD in
humans is caused by an agent that is either very closely related to or
identical with the agent causing BSE in cattle. Even though Australia has
never recorded BSE, it is important for Australia to partake in the
international quality assurance program demonstrating that there is no BSE
or scrapie in Australia.
Accordingly, Australian animal health authorities have developed a
surveillance program for TSEs in livestock. The Australian Surveillance
Program comprises:
[1] field investigations by an official veterinarian of cases where veterinary
practitioners and/or abattoir veterinarians suspect a TSE on the grounds of
clinical signs of nervous disease;
[2] laboratory veterinarians screening the case histories of all laboratory
submissions with a clinical history of nervous disease, to exclude the
diagnosis of a TSE;
and [3] veterinary histopathologists, trained in the diagnosis of TSEs,
screening the brains of all animals over the age of two years with a
clinical history of nervous disease to detect lesions of TSE and establish
an alternative diagnosis.
The surveillance program has been structured so that there is a 90%
probability of finding infection of BSE or scrapie if it occurred in 1% of
the nervous conditions occurring in cattle and sheep in Australia. Taking
account of the livestock populations in Australia, it is necessary to
investigate at least the number of cases shown in Table 1.
In the first year of the program, Australia will raise the sampling levels
to 500 cattle and sheep to provide a 95% probability of finding a 0.5%
level of infection. Australia is committed to ensuring that neither BSE nor
scrapie establish in either its cattle or sheep populations. Future trade
in beef and sheep meats will require certification that there is an
effective surveillance program operating for TSEs in Australia.
The Australian Surveillance Program for TSE requires the cooperation of
primary producers, private veterinarians, government field and abattoir
veterinarians and laboratory veterinarians. Where animals are targeted for
laboratory investigation, it is very important that appropriate specimens
be collected to establish the cause of an animals disease condition as well
as establishing that there were no histopathological lesions of BSE or
scrapie in the brain.
