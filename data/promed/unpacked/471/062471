Avian Influenza in Russia and Kazakhstan: Import of Feathers and Live
Birds Banned
---------------------------------------------------
The Commission has asked Member States to implement a ban on all
imports of feathers and live birds from Russia and Kazakhstan with
immediate effect, due to confirmed outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI)
in these countries.

Russia and Kazakhstan have been added to the list of 9 Asian
countries (Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, China, Vietnam, North
Korea, Pakistan and Malaysia) not allowed to export birds, their meat
or products to the EU because of AI. No ban is necessary for eggs,
poultry meat or meat products on this occasion, as there is no trade
between Russia and Kazakhstan and the EU in these products. The
Standing Committee on the Food Chain will review the decision when it
meets in September 2005.

Russian bird flu may be spreading, humans unaffected
-----------------------------------------------------
A bird flu outbreak in Russia's Siberian regions may be spreading,
but no humans have been infected so far, officials and Russian media
said on Monday.

The highly potent H5N1 strain, confirmed in the Siberian region of
Novosibirsk, has swept parts of Asia and killed more than 50 people
since 2003. Outbreaks in Russia and later in neighbouring Kazakhstan
have been reported since mid-July 2005.

In a sign the outbreak had yet to be contained, news agencies
reported the virus may have spread to 2 more districts of the Kurgan
region in western Siberia where bird flu was confirmed in wildfowl
last week.

"Dead bird samples from these areas have been taken away for
[testing]," Interfax news agency quoted a regional agriculture
official as saying.

But Russia's consumer rights watchdog said the situation was under
control. "As of 7 Aug 2005, the epidemic situation...remains
stable...There have been no infections and no one was suspected of
having been infected," the watchdog, part of the Health Ministry,
said in a statement.

Some health officials fear the virus that has swept through Asia
could mutate into a lethal strain that could rival or exceed the
Spanish flu pandemic that killed up to 40 million people across the
globe at the end of World War One.

Itar-Tass news agency quoted Novosibirsk officials as saying mass
deaths among farm birds largely stopped on Monday [8 Aug 2005] in the
worst-affected, quarantined areas of the Novosibirsk region.

Mass poultry deaths in Novosibirsk have been registered since 10 Jul
2005, according to media reports. The number of Russian regions hit
by the avian flu rose to 5 last week.

Russia's growing bird flu crisis could drive up imports of poultry.
Russia annually consumes more than 2 million tonnes of poultry meat
and imports more than half its needs from the United States, Brazil
and other countries.

The European Union has decided to ban imports of chickens and other
products from Russia and Kazakhstan, although in practice the EU does
not buy poultry from the 2 ex-Soviet countries.

Kazakhstan
---------
In Central Asia's Kazakhstan, the deaths of 364 hens in the village
of Krasny Yar, initially assumed to having been caused by bird flu,
turned out to be due to a regular bird disease, Interfax quoted
regional veterinary officials as saying.

But there was no word on the situation in other, more widely affected
Kazakh regions, including Pavlodar, where bird flu had been
registered officially.

The Russian Emergencies Ministry said in a note issued on Monday [8
Aug 2005] that a total of 5573 domestic and wild birds had been
affected in the Novosibirsk, Omsk and Tyumen regions.

Russia has culled tens of thousands of domestic birds in past days to
prevent the virus spreading. In Tyumen region alone, more than 12 000
chickens, ducks and geese had been killed, Tass said.

Tass quoted Tyumen officials as saying the virus had been confirmed
in another small village called Vorobyovo, but it was unclear how
many birds were affected there. Tass said checks were being carried
out in a number of nearby settlements.

Interfax news agency reported from Altai, another affected Siberian
region, that state inspectors joined forces with local hunters to
locate, check and, if necessary, shoot down infected birds,
especially in areas near big farms.

Ban on Russian poultry import won't harm producers: ministry
--------------------------------------------------
The ban on the import of poultry and poultry farming products from
Russia imposed by a number of countries will cause no negative
effects on domestic producers, for the sole reason the export of
these items from Russia is very insignificant, Agriculture Ministry
has told Prime-Tass.

The EU countries banned the import of poultry and related products
from Russia and Kazakhstan in the wake of the bird flu epidemic,
although they are not their importers. Azerbaijan, Ukraine,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Hong Kong did so, too.

Cases of avian influenza have been registered in the Novosibirsk,
Omsk, Tomsk, and Tyumen Regions and the Altai Territory [of Russia].
The disease has not affected any humans so far.

Bird flu has been identified in the Pavlodar Region of Kazakhstan.

The Emergency Situations Ministry last week warned that the bird flu
may travel from Siberia to European Russia during the autumn
migration.

It is believed that the disease was brought to Siberia from China.

The Russian union of poultry producers has asked the government to
take urgent measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

The Russian poultry farming industry has been [growing steadily] for
the past few years, as domestic demand has soared and import quotas
restricted import.

According to the Poultry Producers Union's forecasts, this year's
production was to grow by 17 percent on the year to 1.4 million
tonnes.

[Russia officially notified the OIE on 5 Aug 2005 that the avian
influenza virus type A from Novosibirsk (Southwest Siberia),
initially (24 Jul 2005) reported as H5, has been finally confirmed as
H5N1. The notification includes some statements which require
clarifications:

1. The affected species are reportedly chickens, turkeys, ducks and
geese. However, birds of 5 species have been destroyed. What was the
5th species involved?

2. "In localities where the infection has resulted in deaths of
birds, mortality since the beginning of the epizootic has not
exceeded 3.3 percent". Such low death rates, if applicable to
chickens, put in question the pathogenicity of the Russian AI strain
and its similarity to SE Asian strains. Clarification will help.

3. Reportedly, "the application of control measures has sharply
reduced mortality". It is not clear what control measures have
reduced mortality of AI-affected flocks.
