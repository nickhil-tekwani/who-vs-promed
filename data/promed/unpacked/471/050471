Avian cholera is killing eared grebes, ducks and gulls on the Great
Salt Lake in what is becoming an all-too-regular event on the
important migratory bird flyway.
Prevailing northwesterly winds have blown about 1500 bird carcasses
into windrows along a 0.5-mile (0.8-km) stretch of the lake's
southern shoreline near Saltair, Tom Aldrich, migratory game bird
expert for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, said Wednesday [2
Jan 2008].
While the disease doesn't affect humans, people shouldn't pick up the
birds or let their dogs chew on them, he said [This could lead to skin
infection, according to a Canadian source -- see 1st ProMED archive
listed at end.]
Avian cholera has been confirmed in the eared grebes. Gull and duck
carcasses have been sent to the US Geological Survey National
Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, for analysis.
Introduced from domestic fowl during the 1940s, avian cholera has
become the most common infectious disease among wild North American
waterfowl but didn't appear in Utah until the late 1990s. In 2004,
avian cholera killed about 30 000 eared grebes on the Great Salt Lake
[see ProMED 2004 ref. at end].
How avian cholera came to Utah remains a mystery. "For a long time
people thought it was snow geese that carried this around, sort of
like Typhoid Mary," Aldrich said. "But we don't get snow geese here."
About 1.5 million eared grebes land on the Great Salt Lake each fall
during their migration. Aldrich said the cholera outbreaks have
always started with the small water birds.
The outbreaks on the lake now occur every couple of years, he said.
As fresh water areas on the lake freeze, the birds move to the
southern shore to feed on brine shrimp cysts.
Avian cholera is a kind of blood poisoning that spreads quickly when
the birds are overcrowded and food supplies are short. Scientists say
death occurs so quickly that birds can fall from the sky or die while
eating without showing signs of sickness.

[Avian cholera is caused by _Pasteurella haemolytica_ (formerly
multocida)_. There are several types or strains. The most common type
affecting wild birds is Type 1. In the wild, it affects primarily
ducks, coots, geese, gulls, and crows. The causative agent is
contained in feces and other body secretions. Ingestion of food or
water contaminated with any infected body secretions will spread the
disease. Transmission by aerosol may occur, and the bacteria can
survive up to 4 months in the soil.
If illness is observed, the birds will be lethargic, or they may have
convulsions, swim or fly erratically or in circles, or they may
appear to try to fly upside down. Illness is not often observed, as
the onset is so acute. Fecal droppings range from pale yellow to
bloody.
Avian cholera (also sometimes called fowl cholera) is a disease to be
differentiated from avian influenza. But lesions and testing can
demonstrate that difference. Avian cholera, caused by _Pasteurella
haemolytica (multocida)_, is not to be confused with the cholera that
affects humans, caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Fowl
cholera or avian cholera is not zoonotic and has no public health
significance.
Death is usually rapid; lethargy and convulsions may occur in sick
birds that do not die acutely.
Generally, clean up of carcasses will help prevent contamination of
the environment. - Mod.TG
