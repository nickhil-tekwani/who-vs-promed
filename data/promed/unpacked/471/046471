On [Tue 27 Jun 2017], a 23-year old female resident of Bharatpur, Chitwan district visited as outpatient to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital with a 20-day history of high grade fever with chills, vomiting, severe pain behind the eyes and shortness of breath. No rash or eschar was seen.

The patient tested positive for scrub typhus, indicating that scrub typhus is perhaps [starting to spread] in Chitwan district, which was the district worst affected by scrub typhus last year [2016].

According to her, scrub typhus detection kits are out of stock and unavailable in government hospitals. Thus, diagnostic kits are urgently needed for early identification and accurate treatment to prevent from scrub typhus-related complications in the coming days.

A halt in the supply of kits required for diagnosing scrub typhus from the government-level here has forced people in need to visit the private health facility.

According to the District Public Health Office (DPHO), Chitwan, the Office has not received the scrub typhus kits from the center for the past 4 months. Prior to this, the Office would obtain kits from the Department of Health Services and provide [them] to the Bharatpur Hospital.

The facility for testing scrub typhus bacteria (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_, [formerly] known as _Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_) is currently available only in the Chitwan Medical College. The college charges Rs 2500 [USD 24.28] per test. The service is free in government hospitals.

DPHO, Chitwan officiating Chief Narhari Sharma said efforts were on to get kits from the center, but to no avail. He said he had no idea why the center was not sending kits to the district. A total of 4 people have died from this bacterial disease that is transmitted by mites in the current fiscal year.

According DPHO Kit controller Ram KC, to date since the beginning of the current fiscal, 1627 suspected patients underwent the test for scrub typhus and 504 were positive.

It seems that the chances of transmission of scrub typhus bacteria are relatively higher in the months of Kattik and Asoj (mid-September to mid-November) as 166 and 112 scrub typhus cases were recorded in these months last year [2016].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Pun for his submission.

There have been prior reports on scrub typhus cases in Nepal earlier this year (2017) and last year (see also's below).

Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of a 6-legged chigger, the larval form of the trombiculid family of 8-legged mites. Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures). Chiggers live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the moist soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off of their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.

Chitwan is a district in Central Region of Nepal and Nawalparasi is an adjacent district in the Western region. Maps of Nepal can be seen at http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm (regions and districts) and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5135389,19830. - Mod.ML]
