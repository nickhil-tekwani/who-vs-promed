Scientists are studying the causes of death of at least 10 Kemp's ridley turtles in Costa Rica's southern Pacific region, and the reasons why another 12 are ailing, a local daily said on Saturday [19 Jan 2013].

National University veterinarian Kinndle Blanco told the local daily La Nacion that on 8 Nov [2012] a boat of the environmental organization MarViva found 22 turtles floating near Matapalo Beach [Puntarenas province], so after informing the authorities they brought them onto dry land. 10 of the 22 turtles died in the following days, and biologists, veterinarians and scientists of the Widecast network, a group specializing in sea turtles, still have no idea what caused their sickness.

At the time they were taken from the sea, the turtles were in a poor state of health and had mollusks and algae stuck to their shells and other parts of the body.

According to Widecast's Claudio Quesada, this occurs when the creatures have been floating adrift in the water for a long time.

"These turtles had been like that for at least 2 months," he said, adding that analyses showed that the turtles were badly dehydrated and had probably not eaten for about 2 weeks.

The scientists' current hypothesis is that the turtles became ill from being exposed to agrichemicals or heavy metals dissolved in the sea. This is, however, a theory that cannot be proved until the laboratory provides the necropsy results.

"Possible contamination produced by drainage from crops of African palms, rice, and pineapples, given their concentrations of agrichemicals, could be depositing some substance that directly affects them, since every time a sea turtle eats it swallows water," Quesada said.

For his part, Blanco said that the Kemp's ridley turtle is a wide-ranging species, so that determining exactly what happened to this group is "complicated." Nonetheless, he said the work is being done to try and determine whether this is a problem that affects only the coast, the high seas, or other parts of Costa Rica's Pacific Ocean area.

Throughout this year [2013] another 41 ailing Kemp's ridleys were found in the biological reserve on Cano Island, also in the southern Pacific region, in a state similar to that of the Matapalo group.

[A necropsy could find a number of different things. Heavy metals or an insecticide/herbicide screen could rule in or rule out the speculations above.

There have been cases of domoic acid poisoning turtles but there are no reports of domoic acid in the region mentioned.

Red tide has been known to affect turtles, but again, there seems to be no red tide in this area.

Parasites of the brain are another ailment of turtles, but it would seem unusual to have this many affected in a short period of time and a similar location.

We look forward to learning what is happening to these turtles.
