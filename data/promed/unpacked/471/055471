All 46 schools in Mesa County [Colorado] are closing Thursday [21 Nov 2019] out of an abundance of caution as a gastrointestinal illness continues to spread through its student body. Six schools had closed as of Wednesday [20 Nov 2019] afternoon before the district-wide shutdown was announced. Schools will remain closed on Friday [22 Nov 2019] through the district's Thanksgiving break, which lasts the entire week of the holiday from [25-29 Nov 2019].

Mesa County health officials think norovirus is a possible cause of the outbreaks. The main symptom is vomiting that lasts between 12 and 24 hours, with a few reports of diarrhea as well. Officials warned the public that when it comes to norovirus, not all cleaning liquids and hand sanitizers can kill the germs. People sick with the virus can continue to spread the illness 24 hours after symptoms have passed. Officials urged parents to keep their children at home if they show any signs of illness.

[ProMED thanks Tony Schountz for sending this alert.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about 1 in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for a smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the USA and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL
