Classical swine fever (CSF) was officially eradicated from domestic swine in the United States in 1978. Continuing surveillance has not demonstrated a case of CSF or presence of CSF in the US since that time.

It is long-known that swine can be infected and/or harbor pestiviruses that are not related to CSF. Congenital tremors has been a sporadic disease in US swine herds for over 80 years, and the presentation/frequency of disease expression did not change during or after CSF eradication.

The pestivirus used to reproduce congenital tremors experimentally is phylogenetically well separated from CSF. The amino acid percentage identity of the viral Npro when comparing the congenital tremor pestivirus to CSF ranges from 35.9 to 36.4 per cent. In fact, this virus was more closely related to a bat pestivirus than to any other pestivirus at the time of discovery.

This virus is consistently found in serum and tissues of piglets clinically affected with tremors but is not detected in unaffected cohorts either within or between litters on affected farms. The pestivirus associated with congenital tremors is not CSF.

There is no evidence to support the moderator's speculation that CSF is in the US at this time.

[That the pestivirus is not CSFv was dealt with in the previous posting; see 20151106.3773270. However our ISU commentators now reveal that the causative pestivirus may be one normally associated with bats. Interesting and worth knowing. This thread is now cut. - Mod.MHJ
