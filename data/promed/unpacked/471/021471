As of [Thu 10 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
1695 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
685 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 per cent],
988 recoveries, and
21 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Tue 8 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
2 newly confirmed cases
2 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery.

- both from Dawmat Alijandal [Al Jawf region]
