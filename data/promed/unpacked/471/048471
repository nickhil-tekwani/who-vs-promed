[Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus and an important emerging zoonotic disease in South East Asia. NiV was 1st identified in Singapore and Malaysia during an outbreak of severe febrile illness with encephalitis in 1998-1999. In 2001, Nipah encephalitis outbreak was reported for the 1st time from Meherpur district, Bangladesh; since then, sporadic cases and outbreaks were reported from various districts of the Indian subcontinent.

The natural reservoir hosts of NiV are flying foxes (_Pteropus_ spp.). They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia (including the Indian subcontinent), Australia, East Africa, and a number of remote oceanic islands in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. At least 60 extant species are in this genus. The species found in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian flying fox (_Pteropus giganteus_). - Mod.PMB
