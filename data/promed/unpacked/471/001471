Botulism killing Erie fish, birds
-----------------------------------
Thousands of Lake Erie fish and shorebirds are dying from a mysterious
outbreak of type E botulism. The natural bacteria is found in the lake's
sediment and normally forms in the carcasses of dead fish. Wildlife experts
say there's little they can do.
Scientists are puzzled as to why the organism responsible for the toxin has
found its way into live fish, and what worries them more is large numbers
of loons will likely be the next to die from ingesting the toxin when they
begin migrating south in October and stop at Lake Erie to feed.
Most of the dead fish, primarily sheepshead, and a variety of birds such as
gulls, cormorants and terns, have been found on a stretch of Lake Erie east
from Port Dover, said Jeff Robinson, Ontario wildlife area manager for
Environment Canada, who is based in the Canadian wildlife service office in
London.
US scientists on the south side of Lake Erie, which is also littered with
dead fish, are trying to determine whether the toxin is being transmitted
by a recent invader, the small round goby fish which now inhabits the lake
after coming from the Caspian Sea in eastern Europe, as did the troublesome
zebra mussel in the mid-1980s.
Dying sheepshead collected 2 weeks ago by the US Department of
Environmental Conservation from the shore of Lake Erie near Buffalo were
found to have botulism and to have fed on gobies.
The goby is one of the few lake invaders which feed on the zebra mussel at
the bottom of the lake.
"We're not really sure what's going on," said Robinson. "But what seems to
be the current thinking is the goby fish are part of the reason this
botulism has come up through the food web."
John Cooper, a spokesman for the Lake Erie management unit of the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources, said it is common for fish to die in Lake
Erie and wash up on shore during the summer as a result of thermal
inversion over the lake, by which strong north winds blow warm surface
water to the south, leaving the north shore much colder and with less
oxygen. Some species of fish cannot adapt to this change, and "in many
cases, they die." [However, it is becoming autumn in that region of the
country, and thermal inversions are more rare at this time of the year. -

Normally, the botulism bacteria [_Clostridium botulinum_ is found in
sediments on the bottom of the lake. It becomes a toxic bacterium only when
it is in an environment having no oxygen. The bacterium is generally
dormant in a live fish, and forms a toxin once the fish is dead as part of
the process of decomposition.
It's [the toxin generally not found in live fish, and it has been very
rare, until the last few years, that botulism has been found in birds which
eat live fish, Cooper said. There were die-offs of thousands of birds which
feed on live fish in the fall of 1998 and 1999 in the west end of Lake Erie
and south end of Lake Huron, he said.
"That was when the question came up of how birds normally eating live fish
are getting type E botulism. And we've now, in the last 2 years, had
similar occurrences with dead fish and dead birds in the east end of Lake
Erie."

[One certainly hopes that this outbreak will remain confined to fish and
birds. Type E botulism is well known to cause illness in humans, and is
typically associated with the consumption of preserved or fermented fish,
marine mammals, and beaver. Ethnic preparations of uneviscerated fish
pickled in brine have also been associated with type E botulism in humans.
_Clostridium botulinum_ spores can be found in the intestinal contents of
fish, which may explain why ungutted fish have been most often implicated
in outbreaks of human disease.
