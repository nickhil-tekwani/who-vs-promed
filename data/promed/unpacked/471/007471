A [Conway, Carroll county] woman, 51, was diagnosed with the illness in August and died on 18 Sep [2014], according to her obituary. She was the 1st confirmed case of the mosquito-borne illness in the state since 2009. She died at the Gosnell Hospice House in Maine.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, she was the 1st person in the state to be diagnosed with EEE [eastern equine encephalitis virus infection] in 5 years. A 2nd adult was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne illness in early September [2014] and has since been released from a hospital.

"Unfortunately, 1/3 of the people who become infected with EEE [virus and develop clinical encephalitis] do end up dying, and many of those who survive, end up having severe health effects from their illness," said Beth Daly of HHS [Health and Human Services].

Health officials said symptoms of the illness appear after 4-10 days after being bitten and can include high fever, severe headaches, stiff neck, and sore throat.

The risk of death associated with EEE [virus infection] is higher than with West Nile virus, both of which are carried by mosquitoes. Health officials said prevention has to be a priority, urging residents to wear long sleeves and pants when outside, particularly at dusk and dawn, and use mosquito repellent with DEET.

The mosquito threat will end for the year after a couple of hard frosts, but health officials said until then, residents should take precautions.

[This case in New Hampshire, is not surprising since it occurred within the geographical range of EEE virus in the eastern USA, where human and equine cases occur sporadically. As is usual, there are many more equine than human cases.

There was a recent case in New Hampshire involving a mule (see ProMED archive no 20140906.2752704) and a non-fatal human case cited in the above report (see ProMED archive no 20140823.2717174). The virus is maintained in passerine birds and transmitted among them by the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_. The species occasionally feeds on mammals and may have been the bridge transmitter in the above case.

There is a vaccine commercially available for equine administration but not for humans. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to avoid mosquito bites. [Particularly in areas where equine cases have been reported. - Mod.JW]
