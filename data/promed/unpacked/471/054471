In a follow-up to a report last month [November 2017], the measles situation in Venezuela, particularly Bolivar state, has grown to more than 400 confirmed cases.

According to recent data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has reported 431 confirmed (by laboratory or by epidemiological link) measles cases from the beginning of September through the end of November this year [2017]. An additional 154 cases remain under investigation.

The majority of the cases come from Bolívar state. In Anzoátegui state, 2 confirmed cases were identified, both with an epidemiological link with Bolívar state.

The vast bulk of cases have been reported in very young children.

PAHO reports, in Venezuela, the identified genotype was D8 (with a different lineage to the D8 identified in Brazil in previous years).

[Virologic surveillance for measles was initiated in response to the global measles resurgence that occurred in the late 1980s.

"Wild-type measles viruses have been divided into distinct genetic groups, referred to as genotypes, based on the nucleotide sequences of their hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes, which are the most variable genes on the viral genome.

"The 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxy-terminal 150 amino acids of the nucleoprotein have up to 12 percent nucleotide variation between genotypes. The 450 nucleotides that encode the carboxy-terminal region of the nucleoprotein (N-450) are required for determination of the genotype. The measles genotyping protocol is available from CDC.

"For each genotype, a reference strain is designated for use in genetic analysis (phylogenetic analysis), usually the earliest known virus isolation of that group. The means of referring to the genotypes has been standardized using alphabetical designations for the main groupings (clades). Within the main clades, numerals are added to identify the individual genotypes. The following 19 genotypes have been detected since 1990: A*, B2, B3, C1, C2, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, G2, G3, H1, H2 (*Vaccine strains Moraten, Edmonston, Zagreb are all genotype A).

"There were 2 putative wild-type cases of measles identified as genotype A in 2008."

Measles deaths and infections are on course to treble in the European Union, latest figures have revealed. Cases have jumped from 3805 last year to more than 10 000 in the first 9 months of 2017, driven by spikes in Romania and Italy, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has shown. There were 30 deaths from January to September [2017], against 12 last year [2016], according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Romania, which has suffered more than 2-thirds of the EU's measles deaths this year [2017], has a lower-than-average immunisation rate. The percentage of 1-year-olds who have had the measles vaccine stood at 86 percent last year, compared with 85 percent in Italy. WHO says countries should have immunisation rates of 95 percent to protect the wider population. It warns immunisation rates in Europe have fallen from 95 percent to 93 percent over the last 5 years.

Romania and Italy have both moved to make immunisations mandatory this year. 'Pseudoscience' and media gossip in Romania have worked to induce high levels of skepticism towards vaccines, according to www.vaccinestoday.eu

Dr Valeria Herdea, president of a professional medical organisation in Romania, told the website: "We still have gossip shows in the media, with different celebrities of dubious taste, who provide all kind of 'magic methods' for child immunity, without vaccination, but who capture public attention much more than scientific information. This is increasing the percentage of those who became suddenly anti-vaccination or at least hesitant."

The latest figures come as health chiefs in England warned unvaccinated people planning on traveling to Italy and Romania.

Last year [2016] a director of an immunisation programme in South America, which has been declared free of measles, told Euronews he was concerned immigration from Europe would threaten the continent's achievement.

Europe is a world leader when it comes to skepticism over vaccines, according to a survey by the Vaccine Confidence Project.

As exemption rates rise, "herd immunity" is weakened. This is the idea that immunity by vaccination or previous illness of a large percentage of a population helps protect those who are not vaccinated, such as those with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving immunizations. Herd immunity limits the disease's opportunity to spread and helps prevent against outbreaks, according to the CDC - which could be threatened if numbers of exemptions continue to rise. - Mod.LK]

While Europe has been seeing a measles outbreak during the past 2 years or so, affecting thousands, Greece has been largely unaffected until recent months. Since August 2017, 364 measles cases have been reported with 167 reported in October [2017] alone.

The Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) says the majority of the cases have been reported from South Greece, affecting mainly people of Greek nationality (mainly young Roma children, as well as Greek adults mainly aged 25-44 years old) susceptible to measles, among them healthcare professionals who were unvaccinated or partly vaccinated. One death has been reported in a laboratory confirmed measles case, concerning a Roma infant 11 months old, with underlying dystrophy, unvaccinated, who died of septicemia.

KEELPNO expects more cases and says the spread to other geographic areas cannot be excluded.

Vaccination with the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for children, adolescents and adults who have not been vaccinated with the appropriate doses. According to the National Immunization Program, children, adolescents and adults who were born after 1970 and have no evidence of immunity should receive 2 doses of measles containing vaccine.

People with measles in Russia increased by 4 times in 10 months of 2017, reported the Department of Protection of Consumer Rights (Rospotrebnadzor).

"Measles cases detected between January and October 2017 increased by 4.3 times compared to the same period last year [2016] to stand at 0.25 per 100 000 people," reads a statement from the entity.

It is noted that in total, in this period, 367 cases of measles were detected, compared to 86 cases in 2016. According to the statement, the largest number of patients was detected in Dagestan, the Chechen Republic, Moscow and its province.

A total of 7 cases of measles, an "extremely infectious" disease, have been confirmed in Surrey. Public Health England (PHE) is urging people across the county to check that they are up to date with the MMR vaccine following the diagnoses in North West Surrey.

PHE has warned it is possible for people of any age to contract the illness and that it can lead to serious complications. It is extremely infectious and so anyone with symptoms has been advised to stay at home and phone their GP ... to prevent it spreading.

Dr Margot Nicholls, consultant in communicable disease control with PHE south east, said: "Measles is extremely infectious. Christmas is fast approaching and gatherings will be held where the disease can spread easily. It is really important that anyone who hasn't had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine contacts their GP surgery to get up-to-date. If you're unsure whether you or your children have had the vaccine, check your child's Red Book or contact your GP surgery to find out. You do not need to seek additional vaccines if you and your children have had 2 MMR vaccines in the past."

Dr Nicholls added: "With ongoing outbreaks in other parts of Europe including Romania, Italy and Germany, we're also warning that anyone travelling to these countries for the festive period is at particular high risk. If you're planning to go to these countries, contact your GP to arrange an appointment for vaccination before you travel, if you've not received 2 MMR doses in the past. The MMR vaccine is free and parents are offered the 2 jabs for their children when the little ones turn 1 and again at 3 years, 4 months. If you have missed either of your jabs, PHE has said it is important that you get up to date with your GP, particularly in light of the recent cases."

Children should have their 1st MMR jab at 1 and a booster at 3 years and 4 months with lots of other people "so stay away from any Christmas gatherings if you have symptoms, and especially from vulnerable patients in hospitals, care homes or other settings. We understand Christmas is a time to visit loved ones, but measles can be serious for these groups and spreads easily in these places."

A measles outbreak has strengthened its grip on the country after initially flaring up in Liverpool and Leeds. Now it's spread to Manchester and Birmingham, with the strain initially thought to have originated in Europe.

As many as 4 children in Manchester have been confirmed to have the highly-contagious bug which causes a blotchy red rash. In Birmingham, 9 cases of the virus, which also causes cold-like symptoms, a fever, aches and pains, have also been confirmed. It comes after 28 confirmed cases in Leeds and 18 in Liverpool. Cases have also been reported in Surrey and Sussex.

Brits are now being urged to have their children vaccinated, something controversial columnist Katie Hopkins is a staunch opponent of.

Dr Will Welfare, Consultant in Health Protection with Public Health England, told the Manchester Evening News: "Measles is a very infectious virus and can spread rapidly among communities, such as schools, if people have not been fully immunised. I would appeal to any parents who have not yet had their children vaccinated to get them protected as soon as possible through their GP."

The NHS say measles can be prevented by having the vaccination, offered by the health service as a single measles, mumps and rubella jab.
