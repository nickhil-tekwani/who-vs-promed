The Ministry of Health has urged that priority be given to those scheduled for rabies treatment as people flocking to the capital's Pasteur Institute in Cambodia for vaccinations is putting a strain on the system. The call came after the institute reported that increased numbers of people with no symptoms of the disease showing up is causing increased waiting times.

A 10 year old girl died in Svay Rieng province on 12 Feb 2019 after contracting rabies from a cat bite early in December [2019]. The girl's family, from Khlaing village in Svay Teap district's Chrak M'tes commune, did not admit her to hospital until her symptoms worsened, by which time it was too late.

Ministry of Health spokesperson Or Vandine could not be reached for comment. But she said in a ministry statement that preventive measures were best to avoid contracting the disease. Avoid playing with or being bitten by cats or dogs; do not allow your own dog or cat to roam freely where it could bite other people -- and vaccinate your pets. "[We] would like to renew [our] instructions that those at highest risk -- such as people who have been bitten by dogs or cats -- pregnant women and those who have been scheduled to be vaccinated will receive their vaccination as a priority."

Ly Sowath, a doctor at the Institute's Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, told The Post on Sunday [24 Feb 2019] that people were flocking to get vaccinated against rabies. However, some had been bitten or scratched by a cat or dog a long time before and knew it [the biting dog/cat] was still alive more than 10 days later, meaning the animal was rabies-free. "In such cases, this means the animal causing the injury did not have rabies and cannot transmit the disease.. . . [These people] do not need to be vaccinated. Animals with rabies [don't live long]."

Following the steep rise in people seeking vaccinations, the Pasteur Institute issued a press release requesting citizens give priority to those who were coming to be vaccinated for the 2nd or 3rd time as scheduled and to those who had suffered serious dog bites, young children, monks, disabled people, elderly people and pregnant women.

A Pasteur Institute study found that around 800 people die from rabies each year in Cambodia, of which 40% were younger than 15 years of age. It said that although 600 000 people are bitten by dogs each year, the institute provided vaccinations for only 22 000 people.

Minister of Health Mam Bun Heng said the ministry took the issue seriously and had opened another rabies vaccination centre in Battambang province in cooperation with the Pasteur Institute. He said there were also private services with proper licences in cities and provinces, so there was a choice of where to receive rabies vaccination.

An elderly man in Tboung Khmum province on Tuesday [26 Feb 2019] died from rabies after he was scratched by his dog 2 months ago but did not seek early medical treatment. [The man], 58 years of age from Ou Reang Ov district's Pratheat commune, was scratched by his dog while playing with it on [25 Dec 2019].

Try Pov, commune chief, yesterday [28 Feb 2019] said that a doctor confirmed that the man had died from rabies. "According to the victim's relatives, he played with his dog and it scratched his belly," Mr Pov said. "He did not seek vaccination then because he thought it was just a minor scratch." Mr Pov said that last week [the patient] had symptoms of rabies, and when he went to see a doctor, he was told that it was too late to treat him.

Lieutenant Colonel Meng Lay, deputy chief of district police, yesterday [28 Feb 2019] said that although commune and village authorities have previously disseminated information about rabies, people do not bother to seek medical advice when they are bitten or scratched by dogs or cats. "When a dog or cat bites them, they always think that there is no problem," he said. "And when the disease occurs they go to seek treatment, but is already too late." Lay urged people to be aware that vaccination is immediately needed after getting bitten or scratched by dogs or cats.

Chhorn Mony, deputy director of the provincial health department, yesterday [28 Feb 2019] said the department has set up a working group to conduct research and also disseminate information about rabies to the public. He urged people to be alert and avoid playing with animals that could be infected. Mr Mony said anyone who is bitten or scratched by a dog, cat or other animals should seek immediate treatment at referral hospitals or private clinics.

According to the Health Ministry, rabies is a disease caused by a virus that infects domestic and wild animals, such as dogs, cats, bats, monkeys and other mammals. It said that in Cambodia the disease is mostly transmitted to humans through dog bites. The ministry noted that rabies is fatal if victims do not receive sufficient vaccination on time after they are bitten.

[Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people. Dog vaccination reduces deaths attributable to rabies, as well as the need for postexposure prophylaxis as a part of dog bite patient care.

In the Western Pacific Region, Cambodia is one of 7 countries considered high-risk for rabies. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and partners to develop essential documents, such as a national strategy and guidelines, and to support the implementation of action plans. WHO is collaborating with partners and agencies working toward the elimination of rabies in Cambodia. - Mod.ST

As many as 825 people were bitten by dogs in West Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Barat, NTB) province, and 6 of them -- residents of Dompu District, had died, a local official said. "[These are] data [as of 24 Feb 2019]. Most of the victims -- 735 people -- are residents of Dompu. [A total of 32] were confirmed of being infected with rabies," Budi Septiani, head of the NTB animal health office, said here, Monday [25 Feb 2019].

In Bima District, 33 people were bitten by dogs; in Sumbawa District, 27, including 4 infected with rabies. The number of people bitten by dogs in Bima Municipality was 4; West Sumbawa, 6; Mataram, 7; East Lombok, 4; and North Lombok, 10.

The West Nusa Tenggara authorities have made a coordinated effort with the Agriculture Ministry to control rabies in the province, by -- among other things -- conducting vaccination, particularly in Dompu and Sumbawa districts. Integrated public awareness campaigns on rabies were carried out in the districts of Dompu, Bima, Sumbawa, West Sumbawa, and Bima Municipality.

Meanwhile, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has worked with the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture and Dompu administration to train animal health officers to control rabies outbreak in the district. The rabies outbreak in Dompu District, West Nusa Tenggara Province, has demonstrated the importance of capacity building for the related authorities, FAO representative in Indonesia Stephen Rudgard remarked in a press statement made available to Antara on 8 Feb 2019. "The outbreak of rabies in Dompu is very unfortunate and demonstrates the need to develop capacities within the local government, and especially the animal health service, to detect and respond to a priority disease, such as rabies," he emphasized.

In dealing with this problem, the Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services (DGLAHS) has taken immediate actions to control the current rabies outbreak in the district. Dompu District has been declared a rabies-infected area on 27 Jan 2019. The district's Livestock and Animal Health Services recorded 544 dog bite cases from potential rabies vector animals between late 2018 and early February 2019.

Rabies could be returning to Israel's north, Gilboa Regional Council officials fear, after a rabid dog killed 2 other dogs on Sunday [24 Feb 2019]. The small community of Gan Ner reported the unusual incident of a rabid mixed-breed Alsatian attacking other dogs in the neighborhood. A team from the Gilboa Municipal Veterinary Service was immediately dispatched to capture the dog and treat the other animals with a rabies vaccine. In all, 2 dogs died from the attack and 20 others were addressed as animals that had contact with the rabid dog.

"I am proud of the residents of Gan Ner, the representatives of the local committee and the plenum who took an active part in the capture, and are now showing a caring involvement," said [municipal veterinarian, Gilboa Regional Council] Dr Shai Rodrig on Monday [25 Feb 2019]. He thanked local residents who were cooperative in having all pets in the community vaccinated and warned that stray cats could carry the deadly disease as well [see commentary]. The Gilboa Regional Council held an emergency meeting and have contacted other municipalities and government ministries to properly deal with the situation.

The number of rabies cases reported in mammals in 2017 -- 74 -- was 250% that of the previous year, and the number of infected jackals -- 47 -- was almost 10 times as many as in 2016. By comparison, there were only 9 rabid animals [6 dogs, one fox, one cattle, one horse] in 2006.

[The described rabies case was lab confirmed on 25 Feb 2019; for the report (no. A00343532) and a dynamic rabies map for 2019, go to https://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Pages/default.aspx. Since the start of 2019, 5 rabies cases have been diagnosed in northern Israel, including 4 dogs (pink dots) and one jackal (aqua dot), presenting a concerning spread of the disease westward into dense populated areas.

Following more than 10 years of effective control of rabies in Israel, mainly due to the countrywide application of oral vaccination policy in wildlife (foxes and jackals), an explosive outbreak in jackals, starting on the Jordanian and Syrian north eastern borders and spreading south-westward, commenced in August 2017, peaking in early 2018 and not yet over. The current developments, namely, rabies in kept (and, probably, unvaccinated) dogs, have the potential of exposing more humans to the virus and an increased need for postexposure treatments. The situation has led the State Veterinary Services to declare large parts of northern Israel as "high risk" and to apply more severe control measures, including vaccination of livestock. For a list (in Hebrew) of the municipalities within the declared region and a dynamic rabies map, published 24 Feb 2019, please go to http://tinyurl.com/y63rp5wv.

The event which has been unfolding since August 2017 illustrates the difficulties in the application of oral vaccination policy in a territory of a country bordering regions where such policy is not applied. However, there could have been other factors/deficiencies involved in the described developments, justifying a thorough professional study. Its conclusions should address local needs and beyond. - Mod.AS
