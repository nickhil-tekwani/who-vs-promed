There are 1246 places in Swat Valley where dengue larvae are present, stated a health department report made available to The Express Tribune.

"Although health officials in the district vowed to launch anti-dengue campaigns in Mingora and its surrounding areas, no action has been taken so far," Saidu Medical College student Tahir Jan said. "Locals are also to be blamed, as people in areas such as Othki, Rang Mohallah, Tahirabad, Hayatabad, and Bypass let water stand outside their houses, creating breeding grounds for the larvae."

He added that the larva also multiplies around places where there are heaps of tyres. "Mechanics leave tyres in their compounds and they become the favorite place of dengue mosquitoes." The increasing number of tyres at shops is because of the non-customs-paid and unregistered vehicles which have become common in the city, he added. Panic has spread among locals after 3 cases of dengue fever surfaced in the district recently. They have been demanding that health officials launch campaigns in their respective areas.

However, Swat Health Department Spokesperson Syed Mohiuddin said recently that the 4th round of a dengue campaign has been completed throughout the district. He said the department launched multiple dengue campaigns in the past. "The campaign was launched in 11 Union Councils out of the total 64 in the district as they were the most vulnerable areas."

Mohiuddin added that male and female health officials visited 56 093 places in these Union Councils to check for the larvae. He added that during the drives the larvae were found in over 1200 places, after which they cleaned the area, while patients with dengue fever in Malookabad Union Council were referred to the hospital. "In the campaign, different sprays were used for fumigation inside and outside the houses." He said they will soon launch the 5th campaign in the entire district.

He said locals should also cooperate with the authorities so that effective results can be achieved. "Appeals to take precautionary measures have been made many times but to no avail."

Mohiuddin said people will contract dengue and other diseases if their surroundings are unclean. "We are trying to tackle the dengue threat but it cannot be controlled and eradicated completely until the public takes part in the campaigns."

[Mingora is the largest commercial city in Swat District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of northern Pakistan. Mingora is located at an altitude of 984 m (3228 ft) above sea level. _Aedes aegypti_, the vector for the transmission of dengue virus requires a warm climate. Though the vector typically does not live at altitudes above 1000 m [3281 ft], where the temperature is colder, the detection of _A. aegypti_ larvae in the Northern district of KPK, which faces severe cold weather in winter, is alarming. The health authorities are taking efforts for the control of dengue in different areas of the districts; however with the detection of 3 cases during the current season, a multipronged strategy with focus on the surveillance, vector mapping and management, health education, laboratory diagnostic services and provision of treatment facilities in the district hospitals is required. It would be interesting to carry out research on the vector adaptation to higher altitude and cold weathers. - Mod.MS]
