[1] OIE's support to vaccinations, Africa

The OIE provided Togo with one million doses of AI vaccines from its
vaccine bank for protecting adult poultry against the H5N1 avian
influenza strain immediately following the confirmation of a 1st
outbreak in this country.
This delivery comes as a result of the OIE partnership with donors to
the OIE World Animal Health and Welfare Fund and the financial
support of Canada via the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA).
Since its inception in May 2006, the vaccine bank also delivered 20
300 000 [doses of] vaccines to African countries: Egypt (14 million
doses), Mali (one million), Mauritania and Ghana (2 million), Senegal
(one million) and Mauritius (300 000) within the OIE/Inter-African
Bureau for Animal Resources of the African Union (AU-IBAR)
partnership, with the financial support of the European Commission
(EC) and of Canada.
The OIE initially established the virtual vaccine bank for African
countries and for rapidly assisting infected countries with
vaccinating poultry populations at risk. Countries free of infection
but wishing to establish a strategic stockpile can also appeal to it.
A strategic stockpile can be used by a country in case of a
persistent worsening of the situation.
The bank is not entirely reliant on physical stocks of vaccines but
also on commitments from the supplier to deliver vaccines when
needed. This avoids vaccine loss due to lapsing expiration dates.
The supplier was selected by the OIE through an international call
for tender based on the quality of the product, the price and
quickness of the shipments. It answers all quality standards required
and recommended for in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.
The OIE has succeeded in maintaining and extending this virtual AI
Vaccine Bank to other regions of the world. The Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) has already confirmed a
financial participation in this global project for 3 years
(2007-2009).
More contributions will allow more active support from the OIE to
vaccination programs in countries where the permanent circulation of
the virus makes vaccination policies an essential tool in the control
of the disease.
Vaccines should be produced according to the OIE Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, and evidence should be
provided that the vaccine significantly reduces virus excretion from
vaccinated birds if they are subsequently infected.
Vaccines should be selected on the basis of evidence that the product
is able to prevent virus circulation in the target species. It is
desirable that the quality control tests associated with this degree
of efficacy are reflected in individual batch documentation. It is of
paramount importance to respect a cold chain (4-8 C) during storage
and transport of vaccines.

[The commendable contribution of 20.3 million doses of AI vaccine to
African countries is a testimony to OIE's steadily growing efforts to
recruit international support in order to control the disease,
particularly in developing countries. Needs still exceed the
available vaccine quantities, as is apparent from the fact that Viet
Nam is currently in need of 200 million doses of the vaccine (see
next item). - Mod.AS]

[2] Viet Nam, vaccination

The bird flu epidemic is being controlled in the north [of Viet Nam],
but the disease could break out again at any time, Minister of
Agriculture and Rural Development and Head of the National Steering
Board for Bird Flu Control Cao Duc Phat stressed on 3 Jul 2007 in
Hanoi.
The 2nd phase of the vaccination program for poultry is running very
slowly because of the serious shortage of vaccine. The country now
has only 15 million doses of H5N1 vaccine.
Meanwhile, the supervision report of the Veterinary Agency under the
MARD reveals that poultry sold at 10 of 15 wholesale poultry markets
carry H5N1 virus, and up to 96 percent of ill poultry are not
vaccinated.
To deal with the shortage of vaccine, the National Steering Board for
Bird Flu Control has sent representatives to China to negotiate to
urgently buy 50 million doses of vaccine. The Veterinary Agency plans
to import an additional 200 million doses of vaccine as soon as
possible to inject into waterfowl nationwide.

[The above figures seem to indicate a high prevalence of avian flu in
Viet Nam; the effectiveness of vaccination could be estimated if one
knew the vaccination coverage in the entire population. - Mod.LM]
