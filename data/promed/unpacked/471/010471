Since December 2011, the Animal Health Service (GD) has received
reports of the birth of deformed lambs born with defects such as
torticollis (crooked neck), and arthrogryposis (deformed joints). Some
deformed lambs were born dead. Until 16 Dec 2011, this was reported
from 16 farms.

Since last week, these symptoms have been reported from another 14
farms, bringing the total to 30 farms. The affected farms are spread
throughout the entire country.

Affected lambs have been submitted for postmortem examinations at GD.
In some lambs, brain abnormalities were observed, such as
hydranencephaly or hypoplasia. On 16 Dec 2011, samples from 8 lambs
(from 2 farms) were tested by the CVI; in 2 lambs from the same farm,
the Schmallenberg virus was detected in brain tissue by RT-PCR (FLI,
Germany). On 19 Dec 2011, another 27 lambs from 9 farms had been
tested, and Schmallenberg virus was found in another 14 lambs (from 4
farms).

It was concluded that the Schmallenberg virus is the cause of the
disease. Earlier, other pathogens, which may cause similar clinical
signs, were excluded.

Two calves with arthrogryposis (from 2 farms) were also tested for
Schmallenberg virus by RT-PCR, but in these 2 calves, the virus was
not detected. However, it should be noted that Schmallenberg virus
cannot be excluded as the cause of malformations in these calves,
since it has been reported in literature that in orthobunyavirus
infections in cattle (like Akabane virus), the virus is often not
detected in newborn calves with deformities unless they are aborted
well before term.

[We are very grateful for the above, firsthand update, which follows
an earlier report from the same authoritative source (see archived
post 20111125.3451).

So far, the (yet to be isolated) Schmallenberg virus has been
identified in 16 affected lambs on 5 farms (out of a total of 35
examined lambs on 11 farms) located throughout Netherlands. The
addition of "new" cases is, in fact, not to be regarded as a "spread"
of a disease; it reflects infections which, in fact, took place 3-4
months ago, when the foeti were infected in-utero during their 2nd or
3rd month of development.

If bovine foeti have been infected as well during the named season
(August-September 2011), the appearance of CNS-damaged calves
(hydranencephaly, etc.) is to be expected, mainly in February-March
2012, while arthrogryposis might appear earlier.

Information on congenital malformations in farm animals has
traditionally known to be (globally) deficient, since there are animal
breeders who regard such a phenomenon in their livestock as
disreputable and are thus reluctant to report it.

Reporting on the incidence of malformed lambs, kids, and calves in the
Netherlands may be intensified following the publication by the Ministry
of Agriculture of "Regulation No. 251218," dated 20 Dec 2011, requiring
the reporting of deformed ruminants, the impetus of which was to "obtain a
reliable picture of the seriousness, nature and geographical distribution
of the Schmallenberg virus." There is no European obligation/regulation
of such reporting.

24-hour phone numbers and a specific reporting form have been
published on the official Dutch web-sites.

The ministry also published on 21 Dec 2011 a Q&A for farmers and for
the general public (in Dutch, available at
http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/bestanden/documenten-en-publicaties/brochures/2011/12/21/vragen-en-antwoorden-over-het-schmallenbergvirus/vragen-en-antwoorden-over-het-schmallenbergvirus-versie-21-12-2011.pdf.

The Dutch public has been confronted in recent years with several
animal-health related issues, including a large epidemic of Q fever,
which affected animals as well as people. Steps are being undertaken
to keep the public well-informed and to avoid unjustified consumer
alarm. - Mod.AS]
