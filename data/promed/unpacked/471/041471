We do not have good information about which mosquito vector species are responsible for transmitting Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus to humans. Our best guess is that certain floodwater _Aedes_ species are responsible for inter-epidemic transmission between non-human hosts and that these species ignite the epidemic phase of transmission.

Please note that the term, "the _Aedes_ mosquito" is too generic. It would seem more likely that competent _Culex_ species such as _Culex poicilipes_ in East and West Africa, _Culex pipiens_ var. _molestus_ in Egypt, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ in the Arabian Peninsula, and _Culex theileri_ in southern Africa are responsible for introducing RVF virus into the human population. These species are far more numerous and widespread than the floodwater _Aedes_ species during periods of recovering and extensive rainfall and constitute important pest species for humans. Whereas the _Aedes_ vectors will most certainly feed on humans, their ecology does not normally bring them into contact with humans. The one possible exception to this rule is the species implicated in the Saudi Arabian and Mauritanian outbreaks, _Aedes vexans_ subspecies _arabiensis_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Alan Kemp for providing this information on the mosquito vector species that might be responsible for transmitting Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus to humans in Mauritania and elsewhere. Alan also pointed out that, strictly speaking, mosquitoes should be included among the hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies referred to in the moderator's comment.
