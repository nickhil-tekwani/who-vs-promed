Beef cattle infected with lumpy skin disease (LSD) were found on a farm in New Taipei's Linkou District on Thursday (15 Apr 2021), the 1st time in Taiwan proper, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA).

Eight of 130 cows raised on the farm were discovered to have fever and nodules on their skin by New Taipei animal protection personnel during an inspection conducted on the farm the previous day [Wed 14 Apr 2021].

PCR tests by the COA's Animal Health Research Institute using blood samples taken from 3 of the 8 cows showed that they had contracted the disease caused by a capripox virus. The 8 cows were culled, cremated, and buried on the spot, with restrictions imposed on movements near the farm.

Lumpy skin disease is an infectious, eruptive, fatal [see comment] disease of cattle characterized by nodules on the skin and other parts of the body. Secondary bacterial infection often aggravates the condition.

On Thursday [15 Apr 2021] afternoon, genome sequencing conducted by the institute determined that the virus present in the Linkou cow blood is a 100% match for that found in cows on the outlying island of Kinmen in 2020 and a similar case in China in 2019.

Taiwan will report the case and related test results to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

Later Thursday [15 Apr 2021], COA Minister Chen Chi-chung said the virus could have spread from Kinmen or China to Taiwan proper.

In a bid to prevent the transmission of the disease, which does even greater harm to dairy cattle, all cattle in New Taipei will be vaccinated on Friday [16 Apr 2021], and those in other areas north of Miaoli County will be vaccinated within 3 days, ahead of those in other parts of the country, he said.

Taiwan has about 35 000 beef cows on 1197 farms nationwide with a production value of TWD 2.5 billion (USD 88.21 million) annually, according to Chen.

Meanwhile, there are 120 000 dairy cattle on 560 farms across the country, with a yearly production value of TWD 11.5 billion [USD 406 million], he said.

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Line district, New Taipei
Started: 14 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 130 / 8 / 0 / 8 / 0 / 122

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Suspected clinical signs were observed at a farm of New Taipei City and reported by the farm to New Taipei City Government Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office on [14 Apr 2021]. Samples were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI), for diagnosis. Lumpy skin disease (LSD) was confirmed by the AHRI on [15 Apr 2021]. The farm has been placed under movement restriction. All suspected cattle were culled, and the rest will be vaccinated against LSD. Cleaning and disinfection are conducted. In addition, there is a total of 5 cattle farms within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the infected farm. One cattle farm within a 3 km [1.9 mi] radius of the infected farm has been placed under movement restriction, and clinical surveillance is being implemented with the remaining 4 cattle farms within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the infected farm. The preventive vaccination for all cattle farms will be conducted in a zone covering 6 counties/cities in northern Taiwan in priority. All of the cattle farms within the country will be inspected, and the cattle will be vaccinated.

Control measures applied in domestic: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; disinfestation; zoning; control of vectors; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; movement control inside the country; disinfection; quarantine; ante- and post-mortem inspections
Control measures to be applied in domestic: vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)

Control measures applied in wild: vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute, Council of Agriculture (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Apr 2021 / positive
Cattle / gene sequencing / 15 Apr 2021 / positive

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by a capripox virus, continues to spread in the Asia and the Pacific Region. Since 2019, the disease has been reported in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Hong Kong (SAR-PCR), India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Taiwan (Kinmen), Viet Nam, and, most recently, Thailand. Detailed information summarizing relevant information on the activities that the Asia and Pacific region have been working on, as well as OIE's recommendations on LSD, are available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/ (updated 7 Jan 2021).

The virus has likely spread to 'Taiwan proper' from the island Kinmen, a Taiwanese territory adjacent to China's mainland, which had been reported as infected in July 2020 (ProMED archive no. 20200710.7561703). Information on the route of spread and its chronology is pending. The virus spreads by infected cattle, infected vectors (airborne or carried in vehicles such as boats or planes) or iatrogenically (e.g., by the use of used, contaminated syringes).

The Taiwanese decision to control LSD by an immediate vaccination of its entire susceptible cattle population, following the culling of the clinically affected animals, is in line with the policy recommended in scientific reports by EFSA's [European Food Safety Authority] experts (Ref 1) and by FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] (ProMED archive no. 20170428.5001476, 20170116.4767100). EFSA's scientific paper, updated 2018, is presented in Ref 1. The recommendations were based upon experience gathered in southeast Europe and in several Middle Eastern countries, into which LSD initially spread from its origin in endemically infected sub-Saharan Africa. The abstract of the scientific report follows:

"The duration of the vaccination campaign sufficient to eliminate lumpy skin disease (LSD) mainly depends on the vaccination effectiveness and coverage achieved. By using a spread epidemiological model, assuming a vaccination effectiveness of 65%, with 50% and 90% coverage, 4- and 3-year campaigns, respectively, are needed to eliminate LSD. When vaccination effectiveness is 80% to 95%, 2 years of vaccination at coverage of 90% is sufficient to eliminate LSD virus (LSDV). For shorter campaigns, LSD is predicted to persist. When the infection is eliminated by vaccination, 2 pathways for disease recurrence are possible, (i) by new introduction from a neighbouring affected area, especially by introduction of infected animals, or, less likely, (ii) the infection persisting either in the environment, in vectors, or in wild animals.

"For planning surveillance, several elements should be considered: the objectives and related design prevalence, the epidemiological situation, the immunological status of the host population, the geographical area and the season, the type of surveillance (active or passive), the diagnostic methods including clinical detection (considered the most effective method for early detection of LSD), the target population, the sample size and frequency. According to the model, for early detecting new introductions of LSD, it may be needed to clinically check a large number of herds (e.g., 2-3000 herds) monthly. Lower sample sizes can be considered, when a greater delay in detecting the virus is acceptable. Where vaccination is maintained, active surveillance for verifying the effectiveness of vaccination would be needed. Demonstrating disease absence can rely on serological surveillance, which should consider the test sensitivity, the design prevalence (estimated value: 3.5%), the onset and duration of serum antibodies. Important knowledge gaps on LSD are about within-herd transmission, duration of protective immunity, role of vectors, diagnostic tests, farm location and type in the at-risk countries, and the epidemiological status of neighbouring countries."

LSD is not zoonotic.

Only live LSD vaccines are currently available, globally. It will be interesting to note which vaccine strain is used for the vaccination in Taiwan.
