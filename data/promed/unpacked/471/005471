Smoked bear meat suspected behind outbreak of trichinellosis in Siberia
----------------------------------------------------
A trichinosis epidemic has broken out in Siberia, with 71 people affected
in Khakassia and Kemerovo so far, Russian health officials report. Among
those diagnosed with the disease are 21 children under 14 years of age. All
the patients have been hospitalized, and their condition is evaluated as
serious, yet stable. According to the officials, the mass contamination has
presumably been triggered by consumption of smoked meat of a bear infested
with trichinae. Investigation has now been launched to identify the actual
causes of the epidemic.

[_Trichinella_ spp. are found worldwide in many carnivores and are
prevalent in Russia. Undercooked wild boar is a well-known source of
infection, but other sources including domestic pigs need to be excluded. -
