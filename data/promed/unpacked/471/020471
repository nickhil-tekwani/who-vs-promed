Prevention of fowl plague: Ministry of Agriculture culling poultry
------------------------------------------------------------------
Minister Veerman of Agriculture, Nature and Food-Safety, has decided to
preventively cull a poultry farm in Eesmond [province of Groningen,
north-east Netherlands]. Earlier this week, antibodies against avian
influenza [virus] were detected in blood samples obtained from the farm as
part of surveillance activities. This active surveillance has been
operational since the termination of 2003's outbreak, and involves
periodical testing of all poultry farms in the Netherlands. No symptoms of
disease have been seen on the farm. Although the virus could not be
isolated, and in spite the fact that it is, almost certainly, not a
highly-pathogenic avian influenza strain, the Minister decided not to take
any risk and thus ordered the culling of all 22 000 layers on the farm.
This has been carried out today.
The epizootic last year was probably caused by a variant of the [avian
influenza] virus becoming aggressive. This is the background to the
ministry's decision to carry out its massive surveillance, meant to detect
introductions of the mild variant [avian influenza virus] and to eliminate
the affected birds before (though unlikely) a pathogenic strain may evolve.
Each poultry farm is sampled once a year; farms where birds have access to
open terrain are tested quarterly, since such birds may have contact with
wild birds that could carry the milder variant of the avian influenza virus.
These activities are not required by the EU, nor are the involved costs
bourne by the Union.
