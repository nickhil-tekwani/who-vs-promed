Up to epidemiological week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2022], Santa Cruz registered 3 cases of hantavirus [infection], according to information from Dagner Montalván, the person responsible for the SEDES [Departmental Health Services]. Of these patients, 2 were released from hospital and one remains in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in the internal medicine service.

Montalván indicated that the cases were reported in the San Julián, Concepción y Postrervalle municipalities where currently epidemiological surveillance is being done to determine if new infections are occurring. For now, there are 17 cases of suspected hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

As a disease transmitted by excrement of rural rodents, the physician recommended cleaning the house and keeping food covered, if they are outdoors and in closed places with ventilation.

Montalván specified that the sites where the positive cases of hantavirus were registered are new human settlements.

The person responsible for the program stated that during 2021, 5 cases of hantavirus [infection] were reported.

[Cases of hantavirus infection occur sporadically in the lowlands of Bolivia. The hantavirus involved in this and previous cases in the Santa Cruz department are not specified. The ecological setting where these cases occurred is not described, making it difficult to determine which of several hantaviruses may be involved. The mention of new human settlements suggests that the areas where the cases occurred might be surrounded by forest. In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the hantaviruses that might be involved in these cases, and their rodent hosts with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html);
- Bermejo virus (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran virus (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

As Dr. Jan Clement pointed out previously, a battery of hantavirus diagnostic agents, including Seoul virus antigens is required to reach a definitive diagnosis. - Mod.TY
