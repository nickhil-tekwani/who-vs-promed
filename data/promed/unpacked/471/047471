• Commenting about the upcoming activities, WHO regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said: "In support of Malawi and its neighbours, we are acting fast to halt this outbreak and extinguish the threat through effective vaccinations. The African region has already defeated wild poliovirus due to a monumental effort by countries. We have the know-how and are tirelessly working to ensure that every child lives and thrives in a continent free of polio."
• In response to confirmation of the WPV1 outbreak in the country, the government of Malawi declared the outbreak a national public health emergency and activated the emergency operations centre to coordinate outbreak response. Global and regional support from the GPEI Rapid Response Team are in-country to support planning, implementing and monitoring of response.

• Outbreak response will be implemented, through high-quality supplementary immunisation activities covered the infected provinces. A national emergency operations centre has been established to coordinate outbreak response activities.
• Mozambique is also participating in multi-country, subregional emergency outbreak response with Malawi and other countries, in response to the recent detection of WPV1 in Malawi.

Niger
• 2 cases of cVDPV2 were reported; 1 each in Diffa and Tillaberi bringing the number of 2021 cases to 17.

Nigeria
• 2 cases of cVDPV2 were reported; 1 each in Niger and Nasarawa bringing the number of 2022 cases to 5. The number of 2021 cases remains 415.
• The 38th meeting of the Expert Review Committee (ERC) on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization convened in Abuja on 14-15 March 2022. The group reviewed the latest poliovirus epidemiology in the country and put forward key recommendations.
• The group highlighted the need to urgently address the resurgence of cVDPV2 in the country since March 2021, noting that outbreak response is taking place under challenging circumstances of increasing insecurity in some areas, COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreak response efforts.
• The ERC underscored the need for increased quality outbreak response through advocacy at all levels of government, particularly at state and local government area (LGA) levels, in fully implemented planned, large-scale campaigns (nOPV2 and also phased fIPV campaigns).
• The group also noted the need to minimize the risk of WPV1 reintroduction, particularly given detection of this strain this year [2022] in Malawi.

Senegal
• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 17 cases reported in 2021.

Sierra Leone
• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 5 cases reported in 2021.

• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There is 1 case reported in 2022 and 1 case in 2021.
• Efforts are continuing to strengthen both immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity in the country. This week, for example, a technical assessment and support mission in Somaliland took place to strengthen both surveillance for AFP and measles.

South Sudan
• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 9 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2021.

Tajikistan
• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 32 cases reported in 2021.

Uganda
• No cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported this week. There are 2 positive samples linked to the N'Djamena outbreak in Chad reported in 2021.

Ukraine
• No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2021.
• The GPEI is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country's health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care. At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio.
• A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio. While the cold winter climate of Ukraine is not conducive to polio transmission, undetected residual transmission cannot be ruled out, particularly as the surveillance system has been disrupted.
• The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.
• Immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from large-scale population movements.
• The GPEI is strengthening synergies with broader immunization needs for displaced persons, including polio vaccines in the package of health interventions and using polio surveillance to help detect other vaccine-preventable diseases.
• The GPEI is assessing the availability of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and measles vaccines in key areas; assessing cold chain capacity and potential impact on it due to electricity cuts; providing communication support for demand generation for immunization; and supporting proactive AFP and environmental surveillance in all internally displaced population (IDP) sites.
• In border areas, operational support is provided to set up mobile vaccination teams and ensuring safe and efficient transport and temporary storage of vaccines.
• In neighbouring countries (Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary), support is focusing on strengthening surveillance (AFP and environmental); registration of children; procurement of vaccines; increasing communication to generate vaccine demand; and strengthening immunization in camps and refugee settlements.

Yemen
• 3 cases of cVDPV2 were reported; 1 each in Lahaj, Marib and Saadah bringing the number of cVDPV2 cases to 16. The number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3.
• Efforts are continuing to strengthen surveillance, particularly in high-risk areas, but security and logistical challenges continue to slow the movement of samples to laboratories outside of the country.

Daily update - morbidity and vaccination against the polio virus (polio) as of 23 Mar 2022

Vaccines given by Maternal and Child Health centers of the Ministry of Health, the Jerusalem Municipality and some by Leumit in Jerusalem and its surroundings (Jerusalem District):
• Vaccinated from the beginning of the operation until now - 14 755
• Vaccinated today (23 Mar 2022) until 14:00 - 615

Results of recent samples for confirming positive sewage findings in the Beit Shemesh, Modi'in Illit and Beitar Illit areas came back positive yesterday.

Follow-up and inspections by the Ministry of Health and the authorities in sewage systems throughout the country and as part of the epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

To date, positive/suspicious samples for the polio virus (polio) in Jerusalem and the surrounding area:
- children with a positive culture and symptoms - 1 not vaccinated;
- children with a positive culture without symptoms - 3 not vaccinated;
- suspicious and asymptomatic initial examination (in final testing stages) - 3 unvaccinated.

All positive/suspected children are not vaccinated.

On the last day and up to this hour, there is no change in the number of new cases. The Ministry of Health again calls on parents to make sure that their children are vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health's vaccination routine and to vaccinate the children who have not yet been vaccinated as soon as possible. The polio virus vaccine is the most effective and safe means of preventing infection with the virus and protecting against the disease.

[Reviewing the prior post on this outbreak in Israel, on 17 Mar 2022 the cumulative total of new vaccinations among the target population was 11 785 (Poliomyelitis update (12): global cVDPV2 (DR Congo, Nigeria), cVDPV3 (Israel) 20220321.8702116). In the ensuing 5 days an additional 2970 children were vaccinated (a cumulative total of 14 755 vaccinated as of 22 Mar 2022).

In 2020, the estimated total population of the ultra-orthodox community in Jerusalem was 1.175 million. One media report said, "...among some communities in Jerusalem, vaccination rates are less than 50%". 2970 children doesn't seem to be a large response (https://healthpolicy-watch.news/first-polio-case-diagnosed-in-jerusalem/).

The count of asymptomatic children with positive stool cultures for the cVDPV3 is now at 3, with an additional 3 pending final results. All infected individuals were unvaccinated.
