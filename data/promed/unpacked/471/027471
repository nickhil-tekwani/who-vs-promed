In relation to the measles outbreak detected in recent weeks in Granada,
the Office of Health wishes to provide the public with the following
information:

The Administrative Litigation Court No. 5 of Granada has agreed to
authorize the compulsory vaccination of children who have either not been
vaccinated or have not submitted a [current] child immunization card.

This measure will be implemented giving parents all the assistance needed
to comply with the judicial notice, ensuring the confidentiality that
accompanies any medical procedure, but being particularly sensitive in this
case in view of the age of those affected.

As of today [25 Nov 2010], 46 cases of measles infection have been
recorded, of which 8 are adults, and the rest are children. 14 of those
affected have needed hospital care at some point, and 3 remain in hospital,
a child and 2 adults. [Previously, in early November 2010, the number of
cases of measles in Granada had been reported to be 20; see ProMED-mail
post "Measles - Spain (02): (AN) 20101110.4081." - Mod.CP]

It is also necessary to point out that a third of the cases in this
outbreak are children under 15 months of age. Therefore, according to the
protocol established by the Ministry of Health, in order to curb the
epidemic and given the high contagiousness of measles, it is necessary to
vaccinate all susceptible children. Therefore, yesterday [24 Nov 2010], and
before the court's ruling was made public, an exceptional measure was
adopted and will remain in place for the duration of the current situation:
all infants 6 months and older will receive one dose of vaccine.

According to the current immunization schedule, the 1st dose of the vaccine
is given to children at 15 months of age. As a preventive measure from the
ministry's Public Health Office, the 1st dose will be administered at the
earlier age of 12 months.

This measure has now been extended to infants 6 to 11 months, but, in
addition to this dose, these children will require the 2 doses indicated on
the regular immunization schedule (at 15 months and 3 years), since the
immune system at this age is very immature, and revaccination is necessary
so that the immune response to the vaccine confers complete protection.

Thus, the goal is to prevent the circulation of the virus and the potential
transmission to infants under 12 months or to the susceptible adults who
might be in contact with them.

Parents of children aged 6 to 12 months who require vaccination may request
information and make an appointment through Salud Responde (902 505 060).
The information service is also available to pediatricians.

Since Granada health services diagnosed the 1st case of measles in a school
in the capital, the Granada Office of Health has been taking various
measures to curb the spread of the outbreak, one of the most recent being
the transfer of all relevant information concerning this matter to the
Judiciary so that it may consider additional actions to mitigate, where
possible, the continued circulation of the measles virus among the children
in the affected school, as well as in the rest of the city and the province.

[In most European countries, compulsory vaccination, measles vaccination in
particular, would be unenforceable in view of past and continuing hostility
of some parents to the use of the MMR triple vaccine, which contains
attenuated measles virus. The outcome of this initiative is awaited with
interest.

Granada city is the capital of the province of Granada, in the autonomous
community of Andalusia, Spain. It can be located on the
