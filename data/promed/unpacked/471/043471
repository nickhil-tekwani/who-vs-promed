Saudi Arabia: Man Admitted to Hospital with Mad Cow Disease Symptoms
---------------------------------------------------
A 65-year-old Saudi man from Madinah who was admitted to King Faisal
Specialist Hospital in Jeddah on 19 Jan 2004 is suspected of having variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail], the human form of mad cow disease (BSE - bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), the Al-Watan Arabic daily reported yesterday. If confirmed
it would be the 1st case of vCJD in the Kingdom.
"After conducting a series of tests, the hospital told us on 31 Jan 2004
that my father is suffering from spongiform encephalopathy," the daily
quoted the man's son as saying. Hospital record say that the symptoms of
the man, who is now in a coma, were "suggestive" of [variant?] CJD.
The family say that the man showed symptoms of the fatal disease about 3
months ago in the beginning of Ramadan. "He started to lose his memory and
found difficulty to understand things and to talk," the son told the Arabic
daily. The patient was taken to a number of hospitals and clinics in
Madinah. "In the beginning doctors thought that he had suffered a stroke
and treatment was given on that basis," he said. Later the man's condition
deteriorated, and he spent 40 days in a hospital in Madinah but showed no
signs of recovery. He was also given treatment against malaria and typhoid.
"We had sent results of medical tests to a number hospitals. Finally, the
King Faisal Hospital agreed to take him," the son said. How the man
contracted the disease is still a mystery. He visited Britain in 1996 for
some months. "He told us that he had not eaten beef while in Britain," the
son said. "Possibly somebody in the market might have cheated him by giving
beef instead of mutton," he added.
The family has already spent a huge amount of money on the man's treatment.
However, they are not convinced of the hospital's diagnosis and they are
planning to take him abroad for more specialized treatment. The Vienna
University Hospital has agreed to treat him. According to the man's son,
there were at least 7 CJD cases in Jeddah. However, Dr. Adnan Al-Bar,
director of health in the Makkah region, did not confirm or deny the
report, the paper said.
Classic CJD has been known about for over 80 years, but its causes are
unknown. It may be inherited or spread through infected surgical equipment.
There is no cure, and the disease is fatal. vCJD is believed to be linked
to the consumption of BSE-infected beef.

[The basis for the diagnosis of vCJD -- as distinct from sporadic,
iatrogenic, or familial CJD -- is not clear from this report. The text is
ambiguous; the hospital is reported as saying the patient's symptoms are
"suggestive of CJD", whereas the family appear to be convinced that the
patient has contracted vCJD. In general, younger people have been at
greatest risk of contracting vCJD. Previously most suspected cases have not
been confirmed, except where there has been prolonged residence in the UK.
Further information on this case would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
