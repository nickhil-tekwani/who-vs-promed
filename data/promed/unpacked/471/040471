Human Gastroenteritis Outbreak Associated with _Escherichia albertii_, Japan
----------------------------------------------------------
_Escherichia albertii_ is an emerging human and bird pathogen that belongs to the attaching and effacing group of pathogens. This group of pathogens forms lesions on intestinal epithelial cell surfaces by the combined action of intimin, an eae gene-encoded outer membrane protein, and type III secretion system effectors (1-4).

Recently, we found that _E. albertii_ represents a substantial proportion of the strains that had previously been identified as eae-positive _Escherichia coli_, enteropathogenic _E. coli_ or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_; 26 of the 179 eae-positive strains analyzed were found to be _E. albertii_ (5). Furthermore, _E. albertii_ is also a potential Shiga toxin 2f (Stx2f)-producing bacterial species (5). However, no _E. albertii_-associated gastroenteritis outbreak has been reported, which generates doubts regarding the clinical role of this microorganism. In this study, we revisited an outbreak of gastroenteritis that was presumed to have been caused by eae-positive atypical _E. coli_ OUT:HNM (6) to determine if it was actually caused by _E. albertii_.

The Study
--------
An outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred at the end of May 2011 in Kumamoto, Japan, among persons who attended 1 of 2 parties held in a Japanese restaurant on 29 May 2011. We reviewed case records for the 94 persons who attended the parties. A total of 48 persons became ill; 43 of them attended the 1st party (a total of 86 attended), and 5 attended the 2nd party (a total of 8 attended). The ill participants had not eaten any food in common except for the meals served at the restaurant. The main symptoms of the patients were diarrhea (83 percent) abdominal pain (69 percent), fever (44 percent), and nausea (29 percent). The mean incubation period was 19 hours.

A routine protocol to identify bacteria and viruses was used by our laboratory to examine 54 fecal specimens from 44 party participants and 10 members of the restaurant kitchen staff (7 party participants and all of the kitchen staff were asymptomatic). Atypical _E. coli_ lactose negative; OUT:HNM) strains harboring the eae gene and _E. coli_OUT:H18 strains harboring the stx2d and astA (but not eae) genes were isolated from 24 and 3 specimen, respectively; 7 specimens yielded both strains (Table 1 [for tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The stx2-positive/eae-negative _ E. coli_ strains were found to be serotype O183 (a recently described O serotype) by agglutination testing with O183-specific antiserum (S. Iyoda, M. Ohnishi, unpub. data).

All atypical _E. coli_ strains showed identical or nearly identical XbaI-digested DNA banding patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the 10 _E. coli_ O183:H18 strains also exhibited identical patterns. The source of the infection was most likely the meals served in the restaurant, but a bacteriological examination of the meal or of the ingredients used to prepare the meal was not possible because none of the food was preserved for analysis.

The lactose-negative/eae-positive features of the OUT:HNM strains suggested that these strains might be _E. albertii_. We examined additional biochemical properties of these strains and found that they exhibited the _E. albertii_-specific features described (4,5). These features include nonmotility, inability to ferment xylose and lactose, and inability to produce beta-d-glucuronidase. The _E. coli_ O183:H18 strains demonstrated common phenotypic and biochemical properties of _E. coli_ (7).

To determine whether the _E. albertii_-like OUT:HNM strains were _E. albertii_, we randomly selected 6 strains and determined their phylogeny by multilocus sequence analysis as described (5). Results indicated that although the _E. coli_ O183:H18 strain analyzed in parallel belongs to _E. coli_ sensu stricto, the _E. albertii_-like OUT:HNM strains belong to the _E. albertii_ lineage; all 6 strains showed identical sequences.

We further examined the intimin subtype by sequencing the eae gene, the chromosome integration site of the locus of enterocyte effacement encoding the eae gene and a set of type III secretion system genes, and the presence and subtype of the cdtB gene as described (5). Results showed that the _E. albertii_ strains had intimin sigma, which is rarely identified in enteropathogenic _E. coli_ or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_; the locus of enterocyte effacement was integrated into the pheU tRNA gene; and the cdtB gene of the II/III/V subtype group was present. These features are consistent with recently described genetic features of _E. albertii_ (5).

We divided the party participants into 4 groups according to strain isolation patterns and statistically assessed the association of strain isolation patterns with incidence of clinical symptoms. The results indicated that persons infected with only _E. albertii_ or persons infected with _E. albertii_ and _E. coli_ O183:H18 had diarrhea and abdominal pain more frequently than did uninfected persons (p less than 0.05) and that the incidence of asymptomatic carriers was lower among persons infected only with _E. albertii_.

Conclusions
---------
In this gastroenteritis outbreak, _E. albertii_ or stx2-positive _E. coli_ O183:H18 was isolated from 24 ill patients; both strains were isolated from 7 patients. Thus, although the responsible meal or food was not identified, it was most likely contaminated with these 2 microorganisms. The contribution or involvement of _E. coli_ O183:H18 in this outbreak is unknown because there were 3 patients from whom only _E. coli_ O183:H18 was isolated and because there were no differences in clinical symptoms between persons infected with serotype O183:H18 and persons not infected. In contrast, _E. albertii_ was isolated from a larger number of patients, and many fecal specimens yielded only _E. albertii_.

The proportion of persons who had clinical symptoms was also higher for _E. albertii_-positive party participants than for uninfected persons. Therefore, it is plausible that _E. albertii_was the major causative pathogen of this outbreak. This information indicates that _E. albertii_ can cause gastroenteritis outbreaks among humans (5).

More attention should be given to sporadic cases and outbreak cases caused by this emerging pathogen. It may also be informative to revisit past outbreak cases caused by eae-positive atypical _E. coli_ if pathogens were recorded as being nonmotile, unable to ferment lactose and xylose, and unable to produce beta-d-glucuronidase.

[About 2 decades ago, the organism _Hafnia alvei_ (1) was implicated in cases of diarrhea but eventually these _H. alvei_-like strains were found to be more closely related to enteropathogenic _E. coli_ and to some _Shigella_ than to _Hafnia_ and the species _E. albertii_ was recognized.

This interesting non-lactose-fermenting organism is now being recognized as a cause of gastrointestinal illness, causing diarrhea with some vomiting, and with fever and abdominal distention. The above report from Emerging Infectious Diseases parallels another recent report of _E. albertii_ as a cause of foodborne gastroenteritis (2) which also occurred in Japan in 2011 but in Akita Prefecture.

Recognition of this organism can be difficult but is likely to be more common as a cause of foodborne illness.
