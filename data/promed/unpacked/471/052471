2 horses die of anthrax in Mongolia
-----------------------------------
2 horses in Mongolia's Dornod province died Monday from anthrax, the
Mongolian General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM) said here
Wednesday.
Authorities in the province have enforced martial law in the Halhgol
County where the deaths occurred and have begun operations to
disinfect the livestock in the district, a GAEM spokeswoman said. She
said 13 horses were found to be infected with anthrax several days
before in the county and 6 have subsequently died. The carcasses were
buried and authorities in the region are closely observing the
remaining animals to prevent further outbreaks.

[To say that this is unusual is an understatement. Horses are careful
grazers and it is still wintertime in Mongolia, so the ground will be
frozen, further decreasing any chances of acquiring spores in soil.
Similarly it is certainly not the season for biting flies. My
Mongolian contacts have been asked to comment as best they can on
this event. We must await their informed replies. - Mod.MHJ]
