TITLE: Atlantic Brant Disease Die-off in New Jersey (NJ)
ISSUE: 2 die-offs of Atlantic brant have occurred in the vicinity of E.B.
Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) during the winter of 2000-
2001
STATUS: Approximately 700 birds were recovered in the mid-Nov to
mid-Dec
period of 2000 (we know the actual mortality was higher). The cause of
this mortality was never confirmed, though the National Wildlife Health
Research Center (NWHRC) suspected a virus [see [2 below.
A second die-off began the weekend of 13 Jan 2001 and approximately
643
dead birds have been recovered as of noon on 19 Jan 2001. The NJ
Division of
Fish, Game and Wildlife conducted an aerial survey to document the
extent
of this mortality and their pathologist collected samples from dying
birds. Specimens from the recent mortality have been sent the NWHRC
for
analysis.
It is suspected that these two die-offs are related.
Several animals have been sent to the NWHRC for analysis: 3 dead
brant have
been recovered in Maryland and one dead brant has been recovered in
Delaware.
We do not know if these mortalities are related to the NJ die-off. The
NJ
die-off has been extremely localized and had involved a large number
of
birds. The Delaware and Maryland mortality may have some other
cause.
ISSUE BACKGROUND:
Between 100 000 and 150 000 Atlantic brant winter in the Atlantic
Flyway. The bulk of these birds can be found in New Jersey, Long
Island
and Coastal Virginia. NJ winters the greatest number of these birds, and
the E.B. Forsythe NWR winters a significant proportion of the NJ
population.
Previous die-offs of Atlantic brant in NJ were caused by
starvation. Starvation does not appear to have caused these mortalities.
The symptoms for both mortality events seem identical. The birds die
quickly, sometimes in flight. Many of the brant have hemorrhaged
hearts
and spotted livers. There does not seem to be an enteritis involved. The
cause does not appear to be either a contaminant or bacteria.
Atlantic brant are hunted. The current regulation's framework is a 50-
day
season with a 2-bird daily bag. This season ended 9 Jan 2001.

Has anyone considered the obvious possibility that this die-off and the
previous one were due to West Nile virus? Brants are geese and they
are dead and West Nile virus kills geese.

[Anyone objecting that WNV is mosquito-transmitted & there were no
mosquitoes flying around biting birds in New Jersey in November
2000, has to explain the finding of WNV in a dead hawk in February
last year (2000), also when there were no mosquitoes active -- see:
