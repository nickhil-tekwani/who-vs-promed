The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as of 31 Mar [2019], there were 613 US cases of _Candida auris_, an emerging fungus that is rapidly spreading worldwide. While Illinois, New Jersey and New York are bearing the brunt of the outbreak, with 156, 106 and 319 cases, respectively, 9 other states have also reported cases. Additionally, 1123 patients were found to be colonized with _C. auris_ but not showing symptoms. The number of US-based cases of the infection has jumped by 26 [in March 2019] alone. In a 10 Apr [2019] update, the CDC reported 587 cases of _C. auris_ in the country.

_C. auris_ cases have been reported globally, including multiple cases in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany and India. _C. auris_ is difficult to manage because it is often multidrug-resistant. It has caused bloodstream infections, wound infections and ear infections.

_Candida auris_ is an emerging fungus that presents a serious global health threat. _C. auris_ causes severe illness in hospitalized patients in several countries, including the US. Patients can remain colonized with _C. auris_ for a long time, and _C. auris_ can persist on surfaces in healthcare environments. This can result in spread of _C. auris_ between patients in healthcare facilities.

Most _C. auris_ cases in the US have been detected in the New York City area, New Jersey, and the Chicago area. Strains of _C. auris_ in the US have been linked to other parts of the world. US _C. auris_ cases are a result of inadvertent introduction into the US from a patient who recently received healthcare in a country where _C. auris_ has been reported or a result of local spread after such an introduction.

_C. auris_ was made nationally notifiable at the 2018 Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Annual Conference. For the updated case definition and information on the nationally notifiable condition status, please see the 2018 CSTE position statement (https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/2018ps/18-ID-05_Dec2018_Update.pdf).

[See Figure at source URL above: US map -- Clinical cases of _Candida auris_ reported by US states, as of 31 Mar 2019.]

Cases reported prior to 2019 are categorized by the state where the specimen was collected. Cases reported in 2019 are categorized by the patient's state of residence to reflect the standards of the Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Most probable cases were identified when laboratories with current cases of _C. auris_ reviewed past microbiology records for _C. auris_. Isolates were not available for confirmation. Early detection of _C. auris_ is essential for containing its spread in healthcare facilities.

Clinical cases of _C. auris_ reported by state (confirmed/probable cases): California (2/0), Connecticut (1/0), Florida (13/0), Illinois (156/4), Indiana (1/0), Maryland (3/0), Massachusetts (7/0), New Jersey (106/22), New York (319/4), Oklahoma (2/0), Texas (2/0), Virginia (1/0); TOTAL (613/30).

Beyond the clinical case counts reported above, an additional 1123 patients have been found to be colonized with _C. auris_ by targeted screening in 8 states with clinical cases. The CDC will update case counts monthly.

[See source URL for complete definitions of clinical cases, probable clinical cases, and colonization/screening cases.]

The CDC encourages all US laboratories that identify _C. auris_ to notify their state or local public health authorities and CDC at <candidaauris@cdc.gov>. The CDC is working closely with public health and healthcare partners to prevent and respond to _C. auris_ infections. The CDC-sponsored Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network (ARLN) will help improve detection and response to _C. auris_ nationwide.

[See Figure at source URL above: Countries from which _Candida auris_ cases have been reported, as of 31 Mar 2019.]

Single cases of _C. auris_ have been reported from Austria, Belgium, Iran, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates.

Multiple cases of _C. auris_ have been reported from Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the UK, the US (primarily from the New York City area, New Jersey, and the Chicago area), and Venezuela; in some of these countries, extensive transmission of _C. auris_ has been documented in more than one hospital.

US cases of _C. auris_ have been found in patients who had recent stays in healthcare facilities in India, Kenya, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela, which also have documented transmission. Other countries not highlighted on this map may also have undetected or unreported _C. auris_ cases.

[Whole genome sequencing has identified 4 distinct clades that segregated geographically to South Asia (India and Pakistan), South Africa, Venezuela, and Japan with minimal observed intraregion genetic diversity. Genotypes of isolates in the US were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the US followed by local transmission within healthcare settings.

On antifungal susceptibility testing at the CDC, _C. auris_ isolates were commonly resistant to fluconazole, and many were also resistant to amphotericin B, but isolates were uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) (3%). The 2nd news report above, however, mentions the first 2 "pan-resistant" US cases have been identified, but does not specify which antifungal agents underwent susceptibility testing. Apparently the 2 "pan-resistant" US cases were from New York City and were initially started on an antifungal agent to which the _C. auris_ isolate was susceptible, but the organism subsequently emerged resistant on therapy (https://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/21/two-nyc-fatalities-had-nations-first-cases-of-pan-resistant-fungus/).

The widespread agricultural application of triazole fungicides and their persistence in the environment can reduce the population of azole-susceptible soil microbiome and act as a significant selective force for the emergence and spread of azole-resistant genotypes. This concern has been recently raised concerning the emergence of drug-resistant _Candida auris_ and _Aspergillus_ species (ProMED-mail posts Candida auris: MDR, emergence due to agricultural use of azoles, susp. 20190407.6409119 and Aspergillosis - USA: multidrug resistance 20180928.6057087).

Similarly, concern for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms was raised in a recent ProMED-mail post regarding the recent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval of spraying streptomycin on all citrus crops in the US 3 times per year. Please see ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance (03): USA, spraying streptomycin on citrus trees, EPA 20190320.6377319. - Mod.ML]
