More than a year after a virulent strain of tuberculosis killed 52 of
53 infected patients in a rural South African hospital, experts here
and abroad say the disease has most likely spread to neighboring
countries, and some say urgent action is essential to halt its
advance, which, if left unchecked, could prove hugely expensive to
contain and could threaten millions across sub-Saharan Africa.
The form of TB, known as XDR for extensively drug-resistant, cannot
be effectively treated with most 1st- and 2nd-line tuberculosis
drugs, and some doctors consider it incurable.
Since it was 1st detected in 2006 in KwaZulu-Natal Province,
bordering the Indian Ocean, additional cases have been found at 39
hospitals in South Africa's other 8 provinces. In interviews on Fri
26 Jan 2007, several epidemiologists and TB experts said the disease
had probably moved into Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique --
countries that share borders and migrant work forces with South
Africa -- and perhaps to Zimbabwe, which sends hundreds of thousands
of destitute refugees to and from South Africa each year.
But no one can say with certainty, because none of those countries
have the laboratories and clinical experts necessary to diagnose and
track the disease. Ominously, none have the money and skills that
would be needed to contain it should it begin to spread. Even in
South Africa, where nearly 330 cases have been officially documented,
evidence of the disease's spread is mostly anecdotal, and
epidemiological work needed to trace its progress is only now beginning.
"We don't understand the extent of it, and whether it's more
widespread than anyone thinks," Mario C. Raviglione, the director of
the Stop TB Department of the WHO in Geneva, said in a telephone
interview. "And if we don't know what has caused it, then we don't
know how to stop it." Cases of XDR TB exist elsewhere, in countries
like Russia and China where inadequate treatment programs have
allowed drug-resistant strains of the disease to emerge. The South
African outbreak is considered far more alarming than those
elsewhere, however, because it is not only far larger, but has
surfaced at the center of the world's HIV pandemic.
Although 1/3rd of the world's people, by WHO estimates, are infected
with dormant tuberculosis germs, the disease thrives when immune
systems are weakened by HIV. At least 2 in 3 South African TB
sufferers are HIV positive. Should XDR TB gain a foothold in the
HIV-positive population, it could wreak havoc not only among the 5
million South Africans who carry the virus, but the 10s of millions
more throughout sub-Saharan Africa. People without HIV have a far
smaller chance of developing active tuberculosis, even if they are
dormantly infected with the bacillus that causes TB.
Most if not all of the 52 people who died in the initial outbreak of
XDR TB, at the Church of Scotland Hospital in a KwaZulu-Natal hamlet
called Tugela Ferry in 2005 and early 2006, had AIDS. Most died
within weeks of being tested for drug-resistant tuberculosis, a
mortality rate scientists called unprecedented. Since then, South
African health officials say, they have confirmed a total of 328
cases of XDR TB, all but 43 in KwaZulu-Natal. Slightly more than half
the patients have died. Those numbers are deceptive, however. The
Tugela Ferry outbreak was reported in part because the hospital there
was part of a Yale University research project involving HIV-positive
patients with tuberculosis. Because South Africa's treatment and
reporting programs for tuberculosis are notoriously poor -- barely
half of TB patients are cured -- virtually all experts contend the
true rate of infection is greater.
"We're really concerned that there may be similar outbreaks to the
one in Tugela Ferry that are currently going undetected because the
patients die very quickly," said Dr. Karin Weyer, who directs
tuberculosis programs for South Africa's Medical Research Council, a
semiofficial research arm of the government.
Some other researchers and experts say they share Dr. Weyer's
concern. "It's an emergency, and we're not reacting as if it were an
emergency," said Dr. Nesri Padayatchi, an epidemiologist and expert
on drug-resistant TB for Caprisa, a Durban-based consortium of South
African and American AIDS researchers. "I think we have the financial
resources to address the issue, and we've been told the Department of
Health has allocated these resources."
Although the government was 1st told of the outbreak 20 months ago,
in May 2005, "to date, on the ground in clinics and hospitals, we are
not seeing the effect," she said. In KwaZulu-Natal's major city,
Durban, the sole hospital capable of treating XDR TB patients has a
waiting list of 70 such cases, she said.
Dr. Weyer said the waiting list indicates that "capacity is becoming
a problem" in KwaZulu-Natal, the outbreak's center. "I'm quite sure
we may find a similar situation in other provinces," she added. A
spokesman at the hospital said it could not easily determine how many
patients were awaiting treatment.
But the manager of South Africa's national tuberculosis program, Dr.
Lindiwe Mvusi, said such complaints were misplaced. The Durban
hospital in question, she said, is under renovation, and officials
are "looking for accommodations in other hospitals" while
construction proceeds. Hospitals in other provinces have enough beds
now for XDR TB patients, and some are expanding isolation wards to
handle any spread of the disease, she said.
She said other responses to the outbreak were underway, including a
rough assessment of TB cases in hospitals nationwide. A more
comprehensive national survey of TB cases may be conducted later in
2007, she added, and health officials in KwaZulu-Natal have begun
surveillance programs to detect new cases of drug-resistant TB in the province.
Dr. Mvusi also rejected the notion that the tuberculosis had moved
beyond South Africa's borders. But in interviews, a number of TB
experts and epidemiologists raised that concern, including Mr.
Raviglione at WHO, Dr. Padayatchi, Dr. Weyer and Dr. Gerald
Friedland, director of the AIDS program at the Yale University School
of Medicine.
