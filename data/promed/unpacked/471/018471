As part of the activities conducted by the National System for Phytosanitary Epidemiological Surveillance in Mexico, 4 plants of Mexican lime [cultivar] less than 3 years old were detected with citrus canker (_Xanthomonas citri_) in a non-commercial area. [The bacterium] was found in foliage on communal land [in a] rural area [of the] Municipality of Matamoros, State of Tamaulipas.

The National Service for Agri-Food Health, Safety and Quality, through the Plant Health Directorate, has started incursion delimitation through phytosanitary surveillance.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (Xac; synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ (Xaa), depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide.

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. Different Xac strains can vary in host specificity, for example lime-specific strains which do not affect orange or grapefruit (ProMED-mail post 20170920.5330396). CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bacteriocidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence. Research on developing biocontrol methods is being carried out (for example, see link below).

Antibiotic sprays are used occasionally for CC management, but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.

The Mexican state of Tamaulipas shares a border with the USA where CC has been spreading since the mid 1990s. An introduction of the pathogen from there appears a likely source of the incursion reported above. Mexican lime (also called key, Omani, West Indian) is a cultivar of lime (_Citrus x aurantiifolia_ hybrid). A putative parent of limes is considered to be different from the unknown parent of lemons.
