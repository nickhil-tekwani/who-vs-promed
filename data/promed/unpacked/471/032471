In an update on the leptospirosis situation in Puerto Rico, health officials advise, given the increase in cases suspected of leptospirosis, [citizens avoid] having contact with water, soil, or food that may have been contaminated by contact with urine (or other secretions) of infected animals. To date [30 Sep 2022], [there is] a reported total of 72 suspected cases after the passage of Hurricane Fiona.

"We have gone through a natural disaster and we ask for the help of citizens to take adequate protection measures for recovery efforts. We urgently call for the use of gloves, safety glasses and [closed shoes] and drink bottled water. Also, if you have a cut, use a band-aid or waterproof bandage and do not walk, swim, bathe, submerge your head or swallow flood water or any body of water that may be contaminated. Finally, keep food, water, and garbage in containers closed to avoid contact with rodents," pointed out Dr. Carlos Mellado López, Health Secretary.

The Department of Health indicates that a person with a fever, headache, muscle aches, bloodshot eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, jaundice (skin and eyes yellowish), rash and cough and [who] has been walking barefoot through water from the flooding, or has been collecting debris without adequate protections, they could be infected. "You need to seek immediate medical assistance and tell your doctor about your symptoms and if you have been in contact with water or materials that could be infected for proper evaluation and treatment," concluded Mellado López.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain and subsequent flooding with Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was followed by outbreaks of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis also occurred following flooding after Hurricane Hortense, which hit Puerto Rico in 1996.
