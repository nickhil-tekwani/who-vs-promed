Czech vets say German, French cowpox not from Czech rats
--------------------------------------------------------
The Czech Veterinary Administration has rejected the allegation that
the recent cowpox cases in France and Germany were caused by pet rats
from the Czech Republic, the daily Lidove Noviny (LN) writes today [3
Mar 2009].

Czech veterinary inspectors have not uncovered any animal infected
with cowpox during their check of rats bred in the country. "We have
not revealed any infection. No cowpox case has occurred in the Czech
Republic for 2 years," Czech deputy head sanitary officer Jaromir
Hruby told the paper.

Czech veterinaries call on their foreign colleagues to prove their
allegations. Milan Sehnal, deputy director of the veterinary
administration, told LN that the German and French sanitary officers
made their accusations despite lacking evidence. Sehnal said the
widely released news might harm Czech rat breeders.

In Germany, 18 cases of people infected with cowpox were registered
in late January [2009], while French veterinary authorities
registered 9 cases this year. The inspectors claim that the people
got infected from pet rats from the Czech Republic.

Humans get infected with cowpox only seldom. The disease may have
more serious consequences for people with a weakened immune system or
allergic reactions.
