In addition to [the moderator's] valuable comments, I believe it is useful
to add 2 things. Firstly, the epidemiology of leprosy makes true outbreaks
very rare. As indicated in your comment, there may be increased case
detection, or patients may be coming forward more often, as opposed to
having a true outbreak situation. Secondly, fingers and toes do not fall
off in patients with leprosy. There can be loss of the distal digits of
fingers and toes in patients with certain forms of leprosy, but this is a
chronic process related to trauma and perhaps to vascular change leading to
resorption of bone, and the process proceeds slowly over many years. It is
not a matter of having the digits fall off of the patient.

[The moderator thanks Professor Frankel for his comments. Leprosy produces
disability and deformity through damage to peripheral nerves. Sensory loss
in the extremities (toes, fingertips) can result in injuries; ulcers form
and become secondarily infected, and the infection spreads to muscle and
bone, resulting in the loss of digits. - Mod.ML]
