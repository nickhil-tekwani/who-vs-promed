One week after Louisiana State University (LSU) announced an outbreak of mumps, the university confirmed 7 additional cases, bringing the total of infected students to 12, according to WAFB-TV. LSU officials are continuing to urge students to seek treatment if they have swollen and tender salivary glands under their ears or jaw.

Mumps is a contagious disease. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be spread through contact with saliva or respiratory droplets.

Infected people are advised to limit contact with others. They are contagious from a few days before swelling of the salivary glands until up to 5 days after the swelling begins.

"Students with signs of mumps must be isolated for at least 5 days from the onset of salivary gland swelling," LSU said in a release following the initial outbreak. "There is no specific treatment for mumps or exposure to mumps. Most people with mumps recover fully. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, and some of them are serious."

Receiving 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in a person's lifetime is the best way to prevent mumps, LSU said. "Proof of immunity to mumps or proof of 2 doses of MMR vaccine is currently required for all students at LSU."

Our Public Health team is recommending that children and young people who may have missed out on protection from mumps should receive a catch-up MMR vaccination. In England there has been a significant rise in the number of cases of mumps [in the past year].

The latest data from Public Health England (PHE) show that there were 5042 lab-confirmed cases of mumps in England in 2019 compared with 1066 cases in 2018. This is the highest number of cases since 2009.

The steep rise in cases in 2019 has been largely driven by outbreaks in universities and colleges. Many of the cases in 2019 were young adults born in the late 1990s and early 2000s who missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children.

In Cheshire East, our uptake was less than 80% for the 2nd dose in the early 2000s, more than 15% below the figure required for group immunity. These cohorts are now old enough to attend college and university and are likely to continue fuelling outbreaks into 2020.

Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus. Mumps can be caught through direct contact with saliva or droplets from the saliva of an infected person.

[MMR vaccine] uptake has improved locally in recent years with most practices achieving between 90% and 95% for the 1st dose; however, in some towns there are still more than 10% of children who have not had both doses of MMR before they start school.

Abstract
--------
Unusually large outbreaks of mumps across the United States in 2016 and 2017 raised questions about the extent of mumps circulation and the relationship between these and prior outbreaks. We paired epidemiological data from public health investigations with analysis of mumps virus whole genome sequences from 201 infected individuals, focusing on Massachusetts university communities. Our analysis suggests continuous, undetected circulation of mumps locally and nationally, including multiple independent introductions into Massachusetts and into individual communities. Despite the presence of these multiple mumps virus lineages, the genomic data show that one lineage has dominated in the USA since at least 2006. Widespread transmission was surprising given high vaccination rates, but we found no genetic evidence that variants arising during this outbreak contributed to vaccine escape. Viral genomic data allowed us to reconstruct mumps transmission links not evident from epidemiological data or standard single-gene surveillance efforts and also revealed connections between apparently unrelated mumps outbreaks.

[Recommended reading. As the authors state: "Understanding transmission routes can be crucial in guiding the public health response to an outbreak -- for example, whether efforts should be directed toward controlling mumps spread within a university or preventing virus importation." - Mod.LK]
