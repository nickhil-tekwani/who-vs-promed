Japan finds new bird flu outbreak on chicken farm
-------------------------------------------------
Japanese authorities have discovered a fresh outbreak of bird flu disease
on a chicken farm in eastern Japan, close to where several cases of the
disease have been detected since late June 2005.
Some chickens at the farm had tested positive for a strain of the H5 virus,
a local government official in Ibaraki prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, said
on Wednesday [27 Jul 2005].
Authorities will conduct further tests to confirm the subtype of the virus,
the official said.
All bird flu outbreaks discovered in Ibaraki since late June have been
confirmed as the weak H5N2 strain. This is a less virulent type than the
H5N1 strain found in previous avian flu outbreaks in Japan early in 2004.
The H5N1 strain first surfaced in poultry in Hong Kong and China 8 years
ago and is known to have killed more than 50 people in countries including
Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia.
The location of the latest outbreak in Japan is about 6 km (4 miles) from
where the initial case was found in late June 2005. Since June,
authorities have killed chickens at 7 farms, all located near the initial
case, after they tested positive in antibody tests. The farm in the latest
case has about 35 000 birds.
Following the new case, authorities limited the movement of eggs and
chickens in a 5-km radius around the farm to prevent the virus from spreading.
Bird flu returned to Japan last year for the first time in 79 years.
Between January and March in 2004, Japan had 4 outbreaks of the H5N1 type
strain, including an outbreak in Kyoto in western Japan in February 2004
that led to the disposal of about 240 000 chickens and 20 million eggs.

phylogenetic relationship to the recent Siberian isolate will be of
interest. - Mod.AS]
