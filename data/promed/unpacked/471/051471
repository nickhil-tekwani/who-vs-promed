Several state health departments are telling ConAgra Foods its Banquet pot
pies may be linked to cases of salmonellosis. The company says its pies are
safe if they're cooked properly. ConAgra officials are working with health
authorities to determine whether any more precautions are necessary.
A company spokeswoman says it's especially important to follow the
directions when pies are cooked in a microwave, adjusting the time for
devices that have less power. She says no recall is planned.
Federal officials are tracking a large salmonella outbreak. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention tells Action 3 News that 139 cases of
salmonella in 30 states appear to be linked to pot pies. A total of 23
people have been hospitalized.

ConAgra Foods Inc voluntarily stopped production on Tue 9 Oct 2007 at the
Missouri plant that makes its Banquet pot pies after health officials said
the pies might be linked to 139 cases of salmonella in 30 states.
ConAgra maintains that its pies are safe if they're cooked properly, but
the United States Department of Agriculture issued a health alert Tuesday
afternoon, 9 Oct 2007, to warn consumers about the link between the
company's product and the salmonella cases.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been tracking reports of
the salmonella cases. A CDC spokeswoman said the largest numbers of
salmonella cases had been reported in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Missouri.

[ProMED-mail awaits a formal alert from CDC and/or the USDA about this
outbreak. Cooking in a microwave oven can leave areas that are inadequately
cooked if contamination with an enteric pathogen such as salmonella is
present. ProMED-mail has previously posted outbreaks in the USA and Spain
linked to similar situations. - Mod.LL]
