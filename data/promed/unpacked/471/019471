IMMUNE RESPONSE FOUND IN MIDGUT OF BLOOD-SUCKING INSECTS
October 14, 1997
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
Volume 94, Number 21, p. 11508
Researchers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg,
Germany, have provided the first detailed evidence of an immune response
that takes place in the mosquito's midgut and elsewhere in its body after
ingesting a blood meal containing malarial parasites. The results suggest
that not only does the mosquito's main gut region produce its own immune
reaction, but it also may be involved in signaling other tissues to do the
same. Most previous studies of host defense systems of insects have
focused on flies and "model" insects, which include certain types of moths.
Only recently have scientists begun to launch molecular and genetic
investigations into the immune system of mosquitoes, the principal carriers
for malaria and several other major diseases affecting humans and livestock.
[Data] in the article show that three previously described and two newly
identified genes are activated in the mosquito's midgut, both in response
to experimental bacterial infection and to a parasite-infected blood meal.
Future molecular and cellular analysis of the parasite-induced immune
response may lead to a better understanding of what makes some mosquito
strains and species susceptible to malarial infection while others are not.
Ultimately, such information will be critical to developing new programs to
control the spread of the disease, which kills some 2.7 million people each
year.
In a related article beginning on page 11,502, scientists from the
University of Wales isolate two previously unknown antibacterial proteins
from the midgut of the stable fly, Stomoxys, suggesting that the midgut of
this insect possesses tissue-specific immune mechanisms. The proteins
belong to the large family of "defensins," which are characterized by
distinctive structural features and antifungal and antiparasitic properties
in addition to antibacterial activity. Taken together, the two papers
establish the midgut as a significant immune-responsive organ in
blood-sucking insects.
