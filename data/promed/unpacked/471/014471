ANNOUNCEMENT: OPT-IN COMING SOON FOR PROMED
*******************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

Dear ProMED Subscriber,

Over the next few weeks, the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) will be improving the mail-deliverability infrastructure for the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED). This includes how mail is delivered to you and the appearance of the messages. That said, the content of the email will remain the same and we do not anticipate any interruptions to any ProMED lists.

You will receive an email asking you to "opt-in" to ProMED as we move from our old platform to a new one. Please take the time to review this email and complete the opt-in process. In addition to opting-in, we will also be asking you a few questions that will help us better serve you.

If you choose not to opt-in, your ProMED subscription will end. You can always re-subscribe at:
https://isid.org/promedmail-subscribe/

If you have questions, please check out our FAQ section here:
https://isid.org/opt-in-coming-soon-for-promed/

Thank you for supporting ISID's ProMED.

The ISID Team


[Please be sure to keep an eye open for the email and take the few moments it takes to opt-in. Also, consider adding <promed@isid.org> to your address book or otherwise "whitelist" the address so our e-mails don't get rejected. - Mod.LXL]
