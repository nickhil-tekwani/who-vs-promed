[1] AstraZeneca
[A] Denmark, Norway: AstraZeneca suspended for 2 weeks
Date: Thu 11 Mar 2021

Denmark, Norway suspend AstraZeneca vaccine over blood clot fears
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Use of vaccine paused for 14 days in Denmark while investigators probe reports of possible 'serious side-effects'

Denmark will not use AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine for 2 weeks after reports that some recipients had developed serious blood clots, and in one case may have died as a result, the country's authorities said on Thursday [11 Mar 2021]. They did not say how many reports of blood clots there had been, but Austria has stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism.

Danish health authorities said the country's decision to suspend the shots for 14 days came after a 60 year old woman in Denmark, who was given an AstraZeneca shot from the same batch that was used in Austria, formed a blood clot and died. Danish authorities said they had responded "to reports of possible serious side effects, both from Denmark and other European countries".

"It is currently not possible to conclude whether there is a link. We are acting early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated," health minister Magnus Heunicke said on Twitter.

Following Denmark's move, Norway announced later on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] that it was also halting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. "This is a cautionary decision," Geir Bukholm, director of infection prevention and control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), told a news conference. FHI did not say how long the suspension would last. "We ... await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood clot," Bukholm said.

Also on Thursday [11 Mar 2021], Italy said it would suspend use of an AstraZeneca batch that was different from the one used in Austria.

AstraZeneca meanwhile told Reuters news agency in a written statement the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials, and peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The drugmaker said earlier this week its shots were subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and that there had been "no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine". It also said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support their investigation.

The European Union's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said on Wednesday [10 Mar 2021] there was no evidence so far linking AstraZeneca to the 2 cases in Austria. It said the number of thromboembolic events -- marked by the formation of blood clots -- in people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine is no higher than that seen in the general population, with 22 such events being reported among the 3 million people who have received it as of [9 Mar 2021].

Another 4 countries -- Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Latvia -- have stopped inoculations from the batch while an investigation continues, the EMA said. The batch of one million doses went to 17 EU countries.

Al Jazeera's Paul Brennan, reporting from London, said Thursday's [11 Mar 2021] moves by Denmark and Norway appeared to have "been borne of an abundance of caution. The Danish Health Authority has not given any details of exactly how many blood clot cases there have been," Brennan said. "But what they did say it was that it was currently not possible to conclude there was a link between the vaccine and these deaths."

So far, 136 090 Danes have received a shot with AstraZeneca's vaccine in a country of 5.8 million. The Nordic country also uses vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Denmark's Health Authority said it had pushed back the final date for when it expects all Danes to have been fully vaccinated by 4 weeks, to [15 Aug 2021], as a result of the suspension.

Sterghios Moschos, a molecular biologist at the UK's Northumbria University, said Denmark, Norway, and other governments were doing the correct thing to "stop and make sure everything was okay" before proceeding with further use. "It's an appropriate response, there is a concern that has been raised, and it needs to be looked at carefully and independently," Moschos told Al Jazeera. "But the likelihood, in general, that ... a batch of the vaccine may have something wrong with it is very small."

Spain on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] said it had not registered any cases of blood clots related to AstraZeneca's vaccine so far and would continue administering the shots.

[B] Austria: adverse side effects, suspected
Date: Sun 7 Mar 2021:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-austria-nurse-idUSKBN2AZ0AO


Austrian authorities have suspended inoculations with a batch of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine as a precaution while investigating the death of one person and the illness of another after the shots, a health agency said on Sunday [7 Mar 2021]. "The Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (BASG) has received 2 reports in a temporal connection with a vaccination from the same batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the district clinic of Zwettl" in Lower Austria province, it said.

One 49 year old woman died as a result of severe coagulation disorders, while a 35 year old woman developed a pulmonary embolism and is recovering, it said. A pulmonary embolism is an acute lung disease caused by a dislodged blood clot. "Currently there is no evidence of a causal relationship with the vaccination," BASG said.

Austrian newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten as well as broadcaster ORF and the APA news agency reported that the women were both nurses who worked at the Zwettl clinic. BASG [Federal office for safety in Healthcare] said blood clotting was not among the known side effects of the vaccine. It was pursuing its investigation vigorously to completely rule out any possible link. "As a precautionary measure, the remaining stocks of the affected vaccine batch are no longer being issued or vaccinated," it added.

An AstraZeneca spokesman said: "There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine," adding that all batches are subject to strict and rigorous quality controls. Trials and real-world experience so far suggest the vaccine is safe and effective and it had been approved for use in well over 50 countries, he said. AstraZeneca also said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support the investigation.

European Union regulators at the end of January [2021] approved the product, saying it was effective and safe to use, while the World Health Organization (WHO) in mid-February [2021] listed the product for emergency use.

Adverse reactions seen in trials were short-lived for the most part and blood clotting issues were not reported. A safety assessment by Germany's vaccine regulator of more than 360 000 people who received the Astra vaccine in the country between the launch in early February [2021] and [26 Feb 2021] concluded that adverse reactions were in line with the safety profile described in clinical trials.

[C] Austria: PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) view

COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca: PRAC preliminary view suggests no specific issue with batch used in Austria
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Austrian national competent authority has suspended the use of a batch of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) after a person was diagnosed with multiple thromboses (formation of blood clots within blood vessels) and died 10 days after vaccination, and another was hospitalised with pulmonary embolism (blockage in arteries in the lungs) after being vaccinated. The latter is now recovering. As of 9 Mar 2021, 2 other reports of thromboembolic event cases had been received for this batch. There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine.

Batch ABV5300 was delivered to 17 EU countries [1] and comprises 1 million doses of the vaccine. Some EU countries [2] have also subsequently suspended this batch as a precautionary measure, while a full investigation is ongoing. Although a quality defect is considered unlikely at this stage, the batch quality is being investigated.

EMA's safety committee PRAC [Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee: the committee that is responsible for assessing all aspects of the risk management of medicines for human use] is reviewing this issue; it is investigating the cases reported with the batch as well as all other cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination. The information available so far indicates that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population. As of [9 Mar 2021], 22 cases of thromboembolic events had been reported among the 3 million people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in the European Economic Area.

PRAC will continue its assessment of any potential issue with the batch as well as its review of thromboembolic events and related conditions.

EMA will further communicate as the assessment progresses.

[D] South Korea: adverse reactions
Date: Thu 11 Mar 2021 11:41 KST

https://jp.yna.co.kr/view/AJP20210311001600882


According to the "New Coronavirus Vaccination Response Promotion Team," which is composed of government agencies centered on the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, 1073 new symptoms that appear to be side reactions due to vaccination were reported by midnight on [11 Mar 2021].

There were no new reports of deaths after vaccination. A total of 15 deaths have been reported so far. The causal link between death and vaccination is not yet known. The propulsion team recently explained that 8 of the previously reported deaths were "provisionally determined to be cases in which a causal relationship between post-inoculation side reactions and death is unrecognizable".

Among the newly reported side reactions, 7 were cases that seemed to be anaphylaxis, a serious strong allergic reaction. By vaccine manufacturer, 6 cases received the vaccine made by AstraZeneca in the UK and 1 case the Pfizer vaccine made in the US. The other 1066 cases presented relatively mild symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Since the start of vaccination in South Korea on [26 Feb 2021], a total of 6859 side effects have been reported. This is 1.37% of the total of 50 635 people who received the vaccination the previous day.

AstraZeneca vaccines reported 6802 cases, accounting for 99.2% of the total. There were 57 (0.8%) reports of Pfizer vaccines. This is [largely] because there are far more AstraZeneca vaccinated people (487 704) than Pfizer vaccinated people (12 931). The reported rate of adverse reactions to the number of inoculated persons was 1.40% for the AstraZeneca vaccine and 0.44% for the Pfizer vaccine.

Of the adverse reactions reported so far, 57 cases were considered to be anaphylaxis (56 cases of anaphylaxis-like reaction, 1 case of anaphylactic shock), and 5 cases were severe. Experts explain that anaphylactic-like reactions often improve with treatment, although symptoms such as dyspnea and hives occur within 2 hours of inoculation.

[E] How the Astra Zeneca vaccine works
Date: Thu 11 Mar 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine.html


The University of Oxford partnered with the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca to develop and test a coronavirus vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222. Clinical trials found that the vaccine had an efficacy of 82.4 per cent when 2 doses were given 12 weeks apart (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268). Despite some uncertainty over trial results, Britain authorized the vaccine for emergency use in December [2020], and India authorized a version of the vaccine called Covishield on [3 Jan 2021].

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is based on the virus's genetic instructions for building the spike protein. But unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which store the instructions in single-stranded RNA, the Oxford vaccine uses double-stranded DNA.

DNA inside an adenovirus
------------------------
The researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to another virus called an adenovirus. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause colds or flu-like symptoms. The Oxford-AstraZeneca team used a modified version of a chimpanzee adenovirus, known as ChAdOx1. It can enter cells, but it can't replicate inside them.

AZD1222 comes out of decades of research on adenovirus-based vaccines. In July [2020], the 1st one was approved for general use -- a vaccine for Ebola, made by Johnson & Johnson. Advanced clinical trials are under way for other diseases, including HIV and Zika.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for COVID-19 is more rugged than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. DNA is not as fragile as RNA, and the adenovirus's tough protein coat helps protect the genetic material inside. As a result, the Oxford vaccine doesn't have to stay frozen. The vaccine is expected to last for at least 6 months when refrigerated at 38-46Â°F (2-8Â°C).

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine requires 2 doses, given 4 weeks apart, to prime the immune system to fight off the coronavirus. During the clinical trial of the vaccine, the researchers unwittingly gave some volunteers only half a dose. Surprisingly, the vaccine combination in which the 1st dose was only half strength was 90 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 in the clinical trial. In contrast, the combination of 2 full-dose shots led to just 62 per cent efficacy. The researchers speculate that the lower 1st dose did a better job of mimicking the experience of an infection, promoting a stronger immune response when the 2nd dose was administered.

[This article from the NY Times, which is recommended reading, explains very clearly the design of the Astra Zeneca vaccine and how it infects individuals upon inoculation and immunizes them against SARS-CoV-2.

It should be noted that AstraZeneca's vaccine has not yet been approved for use in the United States. It cannot be sold legally to other countries without prior approval by the FDA. It is unlikely the FDA will approve the vaccine before the issues of blood clots and embolism are resolved. But considering the high number of vaccinees inoculated with Astra Zeneca vaccine, occasional individuals experiencing side effects, unfortunately, are to be expected. Blood clots and embolism apparently were not observed in clinical trials. As of 9 Mar 2021, 22 cases of thromboembolic events had been reported among the 3 million people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in the European Economic Area. The 2 week suspension is being imposed while an investigation is under way, out of an abundance of caution. - Mod.LK]

[2] European Union: Johnson & Johnson vaccine approval
Date: Thu 11 Mar 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/eu-medical-regulator-gives-green-light-to-jj-covid-vaccine


EU regulator approves Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine
-------------------------------------------------------------
The decision gives the 27-member European Union a 4th vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The European Union's medicines regulator has recommended conditionally approving a single-dose coronavirus vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J), a move that paves the way for the bloc to use a 4th licensed vaccine to curb the pandemic.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] that it was recommending the vaccine should be authorised "after a thorough evaluation" of J&J's data found it met the criteria for efficacy, safety, and quality. The United States, Canada, and Bahrain have also approved the US company's shot. South Africa is carrying out an expedited review.

"With this latest positive opinion, authorities across the European Union will have another option to combat the pandemic and protect the lives and health of their citizens," said Emer Cooke, the EMA's executive director. The EMA has already greenlighted vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford University, and Moderna. 3 other vaccines are also under "rolling review" by the Amsterdam-based body -- Novavax, CureVac, and Russia's Sputnik.

In J&J's 44 000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 67 per cent effective 2 weeks after inoculation, the EMA said.

Though many rival shots have reported a higher protection rate, direct comparison between headline numbers is difficult because their trials had different goals, and J&J's study was conducted while new, more contagious variants of the virus were circulating. Its vaccine delivers immunity-building proteins through a weakened version of a common cold virus, similar to AstraZeneca's shot. J&J has also used the technology in its EU-approved Ebola vaccine.

EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year without full data on its efficacy and side-effects being available. Final approval by the European Commission is expected soon.

J&J chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels described the EMA's decision as a "landmark moment" as the world struggles to control the coronavirus pandemic, which has crushed economies and killed more than 2.7 million globally. The shot, called COVID Vaccine Janssen after the J&J unit that developed it, is hoped to support the EU, where delivery delays from Pfizer and AstraZeneca have harmed supply.

J&J has agreed to deliver at least 200 million doses to the EU this year [2021], including 55 million in the 2nd quarter, with the 1st shipments expected next month [April 2021] Europe is having difficulty taming the virus as a more contagious variant 1st identified in the United Kingdom rips through the continent. Italy and France have imposed fresh lockdowns.

Europe ranks far behind countries including Israel, Britain, Chile, and the US in the race to roll out vaccines.

For the 1st time in 6 weeks, new cases rose across Europe last week -- by 9 per cent. The World Health Organization's European office blamed that surge partly on virus variants, including the one 1st recorded in the UK, which is believed to be about up to 70 per cent more transmissible.

Epidemiological update: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
------------------------------------------------------
Executive summary
-----------------
- Until [9 Mar 2021], a cumulative total of 116 736 437 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2 593 285 deaths, have been reported globally, for which the Region of the Americas accounted for 45% of the cases and 48% of the deaths.
- In the Americas Region, between December 2020 and February 2021, the highest proportions of cases were reported from the North America (68.9%) and South America (28.5%) subregions.
- In the Americas Region, between December 2020 and February 2021 for the 1st time since the notification of the 1st cases, South America contributes with a higher proportion of deaths (85%), surpassing North America (14.5%), as a result of the number of deaths that occurred in Brazil.
- As of [10 Mar 2021], 31 countries and territories in the Americas have reported the presence of variants of concern. Only the United States of America and Canada have notified all 3.
- In some countries/territories, an increase in the number of pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 has been observed. As of [10 Mar 2021], a total of 172 552 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, including 1017 deaths have been reported in the Americas since the 1st COVID-19 cases.
- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact indigenous peoples, with 392 646 cumulative cases reported, including 5605 deaths as of [10 Mar 2021].
- A special analysis on the epidemiological situation in Costa Rica and Guatemala is presented in the section on older adults, observing that in Costa Rica both women and men aged â¥80 years have the highest risk of illness and death from COVID-19. In Guatemala, on the other hand, the highest risk of illness was among males and females aged 60 and 69 years, and the highest risk of death was among females aged â¥80 years and among males aged 70 and 79 years.
- In the analysis of children and adolescents, in Costa Rica, female children and adolescents aged 5 years and older have a higher risk of illness than male children and adolescents.
- In Guatemala, at younger ages (<15 years old), the risks of illness are similar for both sexes, but the risk is higher for males aged 15 to 19 years.
- Between May 2020 to [10 Mar 2021], 3526 cumulative confirmed cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) were reported among children and adolescents temporally coinciding with COVID-19, including 95 deaths.
- While 2021 has deservedly been designated as the International Year of Health and Care Workers in appreciation and gratitude for their unwavering dedication in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, unfortunately, the number of cases and deaths in this group continues to grow, with 1 369 969 cumulative confirmed cases reported, including 7389 deaths as of [10 Mar 2021].

Situation summary in the Region of the Americas
-----------------------------------------------
As of [9 Mar 2021], all 56 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas have reported a cumulative total of 52 038 090 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1 247 994 deaths [https://bit.ly/3kvigPD], since the detection of the 1st cases in the Region in January 2020.

Since the [9 Feb 2021] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-19 [http://bit.ly/3aOxZWG] and as of [9 Mar 2021], 4 617 288 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 142 033 additional deaths, have been reported in the Region of the Americas, representing a 13% increase in cases and an 11% increase in deaths; these percentages are lower than those observed comparing the period between [8 Dec 2020] and [8 Jan 2021], when there was a 25% increase in the number of cases and a 16% increase in the number of deaths.

Between December 2020 and February 2021, the subregions of North America and South America accounted for the highest proportion of cases (68.9% and 28.5%, respectively), while the Central America and the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands subregions accounted for 1.6% and 1% respectively. During the same period, South America accounted for 85.0% of the reported deaths, followed by North America (14.5%), Central America (0.4%), and the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands (0.1%) (Figure 2: Distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, by subregion and month of notification. Region of the Americas, March 2020 to February 2021).

Analyzing the trend of cases and deaths in the last 7 days in the Central America subregion, El Salvador and Guatemala are the only 2 countries in the subregion that reported an increase in cases, and there was no increase in deaths reported amongst any of the countries in this subregion; however, this trend will need to be observed with caution (Table 1: Observed trend of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in countries and territories in the Central America subregion in the last 7 days, until [9 Mar 2021]).
