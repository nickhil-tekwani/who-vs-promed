Further Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Deaths in Pakistan
----------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI: [It is suspected that at least 7 people have died of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Aga Khan Private hospital.
They included 6 patients and one member of hospital staff. Though the Aga
Khan Hospital has officially [confirmed the death of only 2 persons from
the virus, hospital sources said not less than 7 people have died of an
acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the last few weeks. The hospital would
not confirm the number of deaths, saying only 2 people were known to have
died of the disease. [Rumina Hasan Consultant Microbiologist,and Arif
Sarwari (Infectious Disease Physician) at the Aga Khan University Hospital
have told ProMED-mail that the first was an 18 year old male from
Balouchistan admitted on 13 Sep 2000, and the second, a 30 year old nursing
assistant admitted on 11 Oct 2000. In both these cases diagnosis was on
basis of clinical features supported by serologic confirmation from CDC
Atlanta. The nursing assistant had attended a third patient also admitted
with signs and symptoms compatible with CCHF. This patient was a resident
of Karachi, he had however been in contact with cattle. A spokesperson for
the Aga Khan Hospital, stated that there were 5 other patients who had come
from Balochistan and had been suffering from massive internal hemorrhaging,
vomiting and defecating blood. All had died. The administration was at
present segregating the cases of all those suffering from high fever, and
all of such cases are being kept in isolation. Assistant Professor Dr Arif
Sarwari, stated that the hospital was sending samples of blood for test to
the USA. Facilities were not available locally to confirm the clinical
diagnosis of CCHF.

[Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic or potentially endemic
in Pakistan and another 34 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and
Europe. The disease is transmitted by ticks and the reservoirs are domestic
animals. This outbreak in Karachi appears to involve patients from rural
areas, and also tragically a nurse infected prior to diagnosis of the
nature of the infection in the patient under his care. CCHF has been
reported elsewhere in Pakistan and another death was reported in Loralai
Hospital on Thu 2 Nov 2000. It has been claimed that more than 12 people,
including 4 women and 2 policemen, have been died from CCHF so far in
Loralai and Quetta during the last 2 months. - Mod.CP.
