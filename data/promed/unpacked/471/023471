Brazil: 11 Deaths in Para State Following Bat Bite
-----------------------------------------------
Bites from rabid bats [the vampire bat _Desmodus rotundus_] have killed 11
people in northern Brazil in the last 2 weeks, local authorities say.
Health officials have vaccinated local people and set up treatment posts
around the remote Amazonian town of Augusto Correa in Para state. 9 of the
victims were children, and 2 people are seriously ill in the hospital with
rabies. A factor behind the outbreak is the destruction of the rain-forest,
the Brazilian environment agency says. Deforestation leads to a greater
concentration of bats in areas populated by humans.
Laboratory tests on bats captured in the region have shown that some are
carrying rabies virus. Rabies is a very serious brain disease, which can be
prevented by vaccination. Humans generally contract the virus by being
bitten by an infected animal. 21 people died from rabies last year [2004]
in Para, the Efe news agency reported. The toll was higher than the number
of rabies deaths registered across Brazil between 2002 and 2003, the agency
stated.

[In 2004, the Reuters news agency reported that government scientists in
Brazil believed more aggressive behavior of (vampire) bats might be linked
to deforestation. Greater availability of livestock, coupled with less
vegetation for fruit-eating bats, could have favored an increase in the
numbers of vampire bats. Deforestation could also force changes in bats'
migration patterns, affecting their population and behavior.
It was also reported that a doctor at a hospital where patients had died in
Para state in 2004, Carmem Andrea Freitos, had also noticed changes in the
incubation period of rabies in her recent patients. Typically, patients
with human rabies die an average of 20 days after being bitten, reported
the regional newspaper Liberal, but Dr. Freitos says some of her patients
were bitten up to 6 months before (see:
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3596691.stm>).
The particular vulnerability of children to attack by vampire bats has been
discussed in ProMED-mail previously, and interested readers should consult
some of the archived reports listed below. - Mod.CP]
