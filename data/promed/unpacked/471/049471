A horse that was stabled at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank tested positive for equine herpesvirus after its owner violated a quarantine placed on the facility by the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

On 3 Nov 2016, the state agency reported that one horse that was removed from the center showed mild signs of the disease's rare neurological form, but lab tests later determined it to be the non-neuropathogenic herpesvirus, a more common and usually non-lethal form of the disease.

The owner, who was not named, had trailered the horse to their home, which was in violation of the quarantine that the Department of Food and Agriculture had placed on the equestrian center since 3 Nov 2016, when 2 saddlebreds were diagnosed with the neurological form of the disease, one of which had to be euthanized for humane reasons.

The home to where the horse was taken has also been placed under quarantine, according to the Department of Food and Agriculture.

There are currently 9 horses under quarantine at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.

Kent Fowler, the animal health branch chief for the Department of Food and Agriculture, wrote in an email Tuesday [29 Nov 2016] that the state has launched an investigation "with potential legal ramifications" into the owner who violated the quarantine.

"We intend to pursue this violation to the full extent of our quarantine authority laws," he wrote.

The Department of Food and Agriculture expects to lift the quarantine at the Burbank facility by 6 Dec 2016, as long as there are no new cases of equine herpesvirus.

Equine herpesvirus was found at the facility earlier this month after 8 horses returned from a horse show held in Las Vegas [Nevada] 27-29 Oct 2016.

The disease is a common illness in horses that usually affects the animal's respiratory system. However, the state agency becomes involved if the disease is found to be equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, a rare neurological form of the illness.

Humans are not at risk of becoming infected with the equine herpesvirus.

[It is very sad that the owner violated the quarantine issue as this could be an ugly legal battle. However it is somewhat understandable that a person not knowing how the disease is transmitted but knowing his horse did not have the neurological type of the disease decided it was safe to take his horse home.

Perhaps more explanation and teaching to those placed under quarantine would help the horse owners understand. Those doing the quarantine know the rules inside out and assume that so do the horse owners when likely that is not true. - Mod.TG
