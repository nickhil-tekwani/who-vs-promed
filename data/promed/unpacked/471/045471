Text of unattributed report headlined "Assam kala azar outbreak
feared, state put on alert" published by Indian newspaper The Asian
Age website on 22 Feb 2008
----------------------------------------------
The Assam health authorities on Thursday [21 Feb 2008] sounded an
alert after 7 people were suspected to have been infected by visceral
leishmaniasis, or kala azar, that was considered to be almost eradicated.

The 7 patients were admitted in Guwahati Medical College Hospital on
Wednesday [20 Feb 2008]. The superintendent of the medical college
Mr. P. Bhattacharya told reporters: "Seven patients, including 2
children, were being monitored and various tests undertaken to find
out if they were victims of kala azar. The laboratory results would
be available in a day or 2 for final confirmation."

All the 7 patients, who have been admitted over the past 5 days, are
from the Chandrapur area on the outskirts of Guwahati. He informed
that a team of senior doctors of the medical college held an
emergency meeting to find out diagnostic measures in the event of a
black fever outbreak.

He clarified: "Since black fever is a deadly disease and there were
reports of such cases in recent past, the department has taken the
matter seriously."

Visceral leishmaniasis, VL, is a deadly disease transmitted via the
bite of an infected sand fly. It usually develops over several months
or years. If VL is not treated, it can be fatal. General symptoms of
VL include persistent fever, fatigue and weakness, vomiting,
diarrhoea and enlarged spleen, besides weight and appetite loss.

However, claiming that there was no reason to create panic situation,
the health department officials said that health authorities are now
monitoring the health status of locals in the area from where the 7
patients were brought to the hospital. "We are sending field staff
and doctors to the area as a precautionary measure," health
department officials said.

[The report discuss the uncertainty of the diagnosis, so these cases
are not confirmed. Visceral leishmaniasis, VL, or kala azar, has been
spreading in India since the 1990's, but Assam is not regarded as an
endemic state. An outbreak with 7 patients simultaneously is
possible, and if confirmed suggest a single source of infection. The
patients live in the same district of Guwahati, but we do not know if
they come from the same or closely related households. Given no
clinical information and no information on the reason why these
patients are suspected of having VL given that the physicians are
discussing diagnostic possibilities, the diagnosis is at present uncertain.
