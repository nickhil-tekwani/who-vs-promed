India: Encephalitis Kills 36 Children in Muzaffarpur
-----------------------------------------------
36 children have died in the flood-prone Muzaffarpur district [Bihar state]
in the [past] week [3rd week June 2005] due to suspected encephalitis,
official sources said. Health officials in Muzaffarpur said the children
died after developing symptoms of encephalitis. The children developed a
sudden light fever in the early morning, followed by convulsions,
unconsciousness and death.
Alarmed by a likely outbreak of suspected encephalitis, a 4-member central
team is visiting Muzaffarpur on Sunday [19 Jun 2005] to study the cause of
the spread of the disease and to direct district officials to take
preventive measures against it.
Exactly a decade ago, in 1995, encephalitis hit Muzaffarpur and claimed the
lives of dozens of children.

[Outbreaks of encephalitis affecting children have been reported frequently
from India over many years, and a confirmed diagnosis has been obtained
only rarely. Japanese encephalitis has been the favored diagnosis and has
occasionally been confirmed. 10 years ago, an outbreak of encephalitis was
recorded in the same region (Muzaffarpur District, Bihar State) and caused
466 cases of disease with 167 deaths between 6 and 28 Jun 1995. Most cases
were in children, and they were mainly from 3 primary health care centers.
All were eventually referred for treatment to the Medical College and
Hospital, Muzaffarpur. The clinical picture included low fever,
convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Death generally occurred 1-2 days
after admission to the hospital, while surviving patients showed rapid
recovery and no residual illness. The outbreak of suspected viral
encephalitis was over by the end of June 1995. Preliminary laboratory and
epidemiological data ruled out Japanese encephalitis virus as the cause of
the outbreak, and there was no confirmation of virus involvement. It was
considered that several features of the outbreak and the disease were
inconsistent with a diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis, namely, an atypical
clinical picture, a low prevalence of potential mosquito vectors, and
negative serology. That outbreak ended with the onset of rains, which also
ended a period of extreme heat.
The current outbreak bears some resemblance to the 1995 outbreak, and the
results of the current investigation are awaited with considerable
interest. - Mod.CP]
