Rice diseases reduce production
-------------------------------
Diseases affecting grain development have caused a reduction of 24 to 26 percent of total rice production in 2014. They include a group of fungi with symptoms appearing 60-70 days after sowing.

The provinces of Guayas and Los Rios were particularly affected. Empty panicles were detected, as well as panicles with discoloured and weak grains, leading to reduced quality of the harvested product.

Farmers are trying to combat the problem. They have been advised that for the management of disease complexes like the one causing the current problems, it is important to start early in the crop cycle to limit symptom development and impact on the crop.

[The article above states that a fungal complex is considered to be the cause of the problems.

Fungal pathogens known to affect rice crops in the Americas include, for example, rice blast (_Magnaporthe oryzae_), sheath rot (_Sarocladium oryzae_), black smut (_Tilletia barclayana_), bakanae (_Gibberella fujikuroi_), and sheath blight (_Thanatephorus cucumeris_). It is not clear whether any of these are thought to be involved in the disease complex described.

An undiagnosed fungal disease was reported in Ecuador earlier (ProMED-mail post 20120509.1127065). Although symptom development above is said to be more rapid, both reports may refer to similar fungal complexes.
