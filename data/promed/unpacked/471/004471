30 000 birds culled in Nadia: DM [district magistrate]
------------------------------------------------------
About 30 000 birds have been culled till today [23 Sep 2011] at
Tehatta 1 block in Nadia district where there has been an outbreak of
bird flu. ["While about 14000 birds were culled on Tue 20 Sep 2011,
about 6000 birds were culled Wed 21 Sep 2011, and about 10 000 on Thu
22 Sep 2011]," Nadia district magistrate Avinaba Chanda said.

"60 teams were deployed for culling ," he said adding about 8000 birds
would be culled [on Fri 23 Sep 2011].

The Nadia administration was providing coupons to the bird owners as
per the order of the state government through which they would get the
compensation later. But government of India has ordered to arrange for
spot compensation, official sources said.

According to the district magistrate, there are 3 check points to stop
the birds from going out of the protected area within 3 km [2 mi]
radius of the affected area.

The confirmation of the outbreak of [avian influenza] from laboratory
was received on Monday night [19 Sep 2011], the DM said after which
culling started.

[This outbreak has been reported to the OIE on 19 Sep 2011 (follow-up
report no 1, available with map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11026).
It is the 2nd H5N1 outbreak in India since the immediate notification
of a new epizootic, claimed to have started on 29 Aug 2011
(ProMED-mail archive no 20110909.2747).

The 1st outbreak was located in Dhuburi, Assam, northern to
Bangladesh; the 2nd, current outbreak, is located south to Bangladesh,
namely in Nadia, West Bengal, about 840 km (522 mi) distant from the
1st outbreak (see map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10993).
The likely common denominator of both outbreaks is their proximity to
Bangladesh, a country that has reported, since March 2007, 519
outbreaks of avian influenza (see map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5154).

The applied "control measures" in relation to HPAI, as reported by
both countries to the OIE, are the following:
Bangladesh:
Stamping out, movement control inside the country, disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s), vaccination prohibited.

India:
Stamping out, quarantine, movement control inside the country,
disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), screening, no
vaccination.

We have sought OIE's explanation to the difference between
"vaccination prohibited" and "no vaccination" policies. The following
explanatory note has been kindly provided:

"Vaccination prohibited" means that the use of a vaccine to control
the outbreak(s) is prohibited under any circumstances.
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)
Vaccination as a measure to control the outbreak(s) (such as ring
vaccination).
Where there is no vaccination, it means that they do not apply
vaccination around the outbreak(s).

So for Bangladesh the use of vaccine is prohibited in the country
(ring and routine vaccination), while in India, the Government does
not vaccinate but the use of vaccine is not forbidden."

Upon further inquiry, the following details were kindly added:
"These definitions are used mainly for immediate notifications and
follow-up reports when dealing with emergencies.

For routine vaccination you should look at 6-monthly reports to see if
the country practices mass vaccination. In general, when vaccination
is prohibited, it is already mentioned in the 6-monthly report and
when an exceptional event occurs vaccination remains prohibited."

We are very grateful to the head of OIE's Information Department, Dr
Karim Ben Jebara, for the clarifications above.

Subscribers are thus advised that OIE's immediate notifications and
follow-up reports do not address the vaccination status of the
affected holdings in countries, which do not prohibit vaccination. To
obtain that kind of information, subscribers are advised to refer to
the 6-month or annual detailed reports.

To clear the current issue, we referred to OIE's information on
"Disease control measures" as reported in the annual reports of the 2
above countries in relation to HPAI.

The following results (annual reports 2010) were found:
1. India: notifiable disease, Qf, M, Te, GSu, Qi, S
2. Bangladesh: notifiable disease, Qf, M, Gsu, Tsu, Qi, S, Z, Vp

Key:
Qf= precautions at the border
M= monitoring
Te= screening
Gsu= general surveillance
Tsu= targetted surveillance
Qi= movement control inside the country
S= stamping out
Sp= modified stamping out
Z= zoning
Vp= vaccination prohibited.
V= routine vaccination
T= treatment
Cr= control of wildlife reservoirs
Cn= control of arthropods

Since India's policy does not mention either Vp or V, it is not clear
if vaccination is allowed to be carried out by non-governmental
entities, and if HPAI H5N1 vaccines have been certified for such
(unofficial) use; this information is herewith requested. - Mod.AS]
