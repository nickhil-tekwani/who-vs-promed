In spite of the fact that there are vaccines to prevent whooping cough, the infection has become a re-emerging disease, which today is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in children. The main victims of this acute respiratory infection caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_ (whooping cough), are infants younger than 6 months, usually acquired from their parents or teenage siblings, or even a member of the health care team. In infants, pertussis can be a serious disease that can lead to severe complications or even death, unlike what happens in adults or older children. The reemergence of the whooping cough or pertussis can be observed in the numbers of cases in the country.

Up until 30 April 2012 597 cases of pertussis were confirmed by laboratory testing. In the same period of 2011, there were 315 cases: [this is] 90 percent more. The data comes from the National Reference Laboratory for_Bordetella pertussis_ of Argentina.

The cases reported in that period were in turn 1028 in 2011 and 2399 in 2012, which means an increase of 133 percent, perhaps explained by the deepening of the epidemiological surveillance that would result in greater reporting of suspect cases.

The Ministry of Health of Argentina reported thatin 2011 the cases reported were more than expected, a situation similar to that recorded in other countries of the region, such as Chile, Uruguay, Cuba and the USA, which also had outbreaks of the disease. In 2012, the situation has not changed, warned this week the head of the National Program for Control of vaccine-preventable diseases, Carla Vizzotti, who pointed out that the figures "indicate a level of suspect cases confirms that we are in an outbreak, as happened in 2011."

[In the USA as in Argentina, recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized, like the ones described in this report. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women to provide passive immunity is a further expansion of these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the source for the infant is a family member.

The increasing susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected by the current vaccines.
