A case of cat infection by the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in
Indonesia, a World Health Organization medical officer in Jakarta said
Monday. "We have evidence of one cat in Indonesia that has already been
infected by this virus," said Steven Bjorge, medical officer for the WHO's
Communicable Disease Section. Bjorge, speaking in a panel discussion at the
Jakarta Foreign Correspondents' Club, said he thinks the cat "was infected
probably by eating contaminated birds. This is a very rare disease. It's
extremely difficult for this virus to be passed on to humans," he said,
downplaying concerns about cross-species transmission of the virus. There
are no recorded cases of cat-to-human H5N1 infection anywhere in the world.
Trisatya Naipospos, the government's top adviser on H5N1 strategy, told the
panel there have been unpublished studies of other cats in Indonesia being
tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu. [And] there have been a
number of cases of feline infection by the dangerous H5N1 strain of avian
flu outside of Indonesia, all of which appear to have been associated with
outbreaks in domestic or wild birds and acquired through ingestion of raw
meat from an infected bird.
In December 2003, 2 tigers and 2 leopards that were fed with fresh chicken
carcasses died of H5N1 infection at a zoo in Thailand. In October 2004, 147
of 441 captive tigers in another zoo in Thailand died or were euthanized as
a result of infection after being fed fresh chicken carcasses. Civet cats
have died of bird flu in Vietnam, while earlier in 2006 a domestic cat in
Germany became the first case of a European Union mammal dying of bird
flu. There have also been cases of martens, pigs and ferrets being infected.
Indonesia's Health Ministry says the WHO has confirmed 52 cases of humans
infected by bird flu in Indonesia, of which 39 resulted in death. But the
WHO says there have been 50 cases with 38 deaths in the country. In
explaining the discrepancy, Bjorge said the WHO and the Health Ministry use
a "different definition" as to what constitutes a confirmed case of bird
infection. He said the organization will later revise its definition to
avoid such discrepancies in the future.

[If you look, you shall find. I fully expect that once the
veterinary/public health investigators are aware that domestic cats are at
risk, they will be swabbing them along with the family members. The
interesting point will be whether the domestic cat infections precede the
related family cases, are coincidental, or follow family cases. And if they
are blood-sampling the family, they might as well sample the cats also for
antibodies. - MHJ.Mod]
