Legionnaires' bacterium benches team
-------------------------------------
A trip to Oklahoma City for a national basketball tournament for
home-schooled children turned into an uncomfortably close encounter with a
dangerous bacterium for 13 local residents. The contingent of players and
family members from Elkhart and LaGrange counties, Indiana stayed at a
hotel that Oklahoma health officials believe harbored the bacterium that
causes Legionnaires' disease. 7 members of the group became sick with
symptoms of Pontiac fever, according to Kristy Bradley, interim
epidemiologist for the Oklahoma State Health Department. Pontiac fever is
caused by _Legionella pneumophila_, the same pathogen that causes
Legionnaires' but is considerably less dangerous. Neither disease is spread
from person-to-person.
The 13 local residents who stayed at the hotel, a Comfort Suites facility,
included players, coaches, and family members who were participating in the
National Christian Home-school Basketball & Family Conference. The event
drew 6000 people and 240 teams from around the nation. The local group
includes residents of Middlebury, Bristol, Howe, and Shipshewana, health
officials said.
Bradley said the investigation is focusing on a room that houses the
hotel's pool and hot tub, and where the contingent held daily devotional
meetings. Members of a group from Houston, which was also participating in
the tournament and conference and staying at the hotel, also became
sick. Bradley also said about 65 people, all from the Indiana and Houston
groups, have reported becoming sick with the milder Pontiac illness. Their
symptoms have included rapid onset of fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches,
and headache.
The disease came to light on Sat, 20 Mar 2004, when members of the 2 teams
became sick and had to forfeit some of their games, Bradley said. Since
both teams happened to be staying at the Comfort Suites, that facility
became the obvious suspected source of the illness.
Peg Ramey, director of community nursing for the Elkhart County Health
Department, said an outbreak of disease caused by the Legionella bacterium
does not require a health department investigation to identify people who
may have come into contact with infected individuals. That's only done
when the disease in question can be spread from person to person, not the
case with this organism.
Bradley said 10 of the 13 affected local residents were interviewed by
Oklahoma state health officials before they left for the return trip to
Indiana. She said she's confident that the remaining 3 know about their
possible exposure because they're related to some of the people who were
interviewed.
