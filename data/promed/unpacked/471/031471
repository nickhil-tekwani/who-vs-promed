Hong Kong has recorded 3 new cases of the rat hepatitis E infection in humans, health authorities have revealed, adding that one of the patients with an unspecified underlying illness had died. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said on Tuesday night [14 May 2019] it was investigating 3 separate cases, each involving an elderly man with underlying liver function issue. The men lived in different districts, with one each in Kowloon City, Southern, and Tuen Mun.

Kowloon City is beside Wong Tai Sin, where the 1st 2 cases of the infection were reported in Hong Kong in 2018. The other districts are well apart from these 2 areas. The 2 cases in 2018 were also the 1st reported in the world. Health experts called the latest incidents "very significant", showing transmission occurred from time to time in different parts of the city. One expert believed rat-to-human transmission was more likely than from person to person.

So far, the investigation has not been able to track down the source of the infections, but health chiefs ordered rat control measures to be stepped up in the districts. In the latest incidents, the 1st tw2o cases involved men, aged 81 and 67, who developed liver-related problems. Neither required admission to hospital. The 67-year-old traveled to Taiwan and South Korea during the incubation period. A 3rd man, 74, also developed liver problems. He was hospitalized over an unspecified underlying illness and died on 4 May 2019.

"Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined [in the 3 cases]. The CHP's investigation is ongoing," a spokesman said. The centre urged the public to be vigilant against hepatitis E and "strictly observe good personal, food and environmental hygiene".

In September 2018, Hong Kong reported the world's 1st case of a human infected with the rat hepatitis E virus. The patient was a 56-year-old man living in Choi Wan Estate in Wong Tai Sin. He had undergone liver transplant surgery in May 2017 and developed persistent abnormal liver function 2 months later. In November 1018, a 70-year-old woman, who lived just 3 km (1.9 miles) away in the same district, was found to be carrying the virus.

Dr Siddharth Sridhar, clinical assistant professor from the University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology, said the latest cases were "very significant. The discoveries ... show the 2-case cluster in Wong Tai Sin was not a one-off transmission event but occurs from time to time in different parts of Hong Kong." Individuals with underlying illnesses should maintain high standards of personal, food and environmental hygiene, Sridhar said, adding people should avoid rodents and contact authorities if they spot an infestation.

Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading microbiologist from HKU [University of Hong Kong], said human infection by the rat hepatitis E virus was "likely to be much more common than originally expected." He said personal hygiene may have been less than optimal in the 3 latest cases as they were elderly men. Also, all 3 had underlying illness. Both factors may predispose them to the infection. Yuen called for more investigations on the route of transmission, though he believed the virus jumping from a rat to a human was more likely than between 2 people.

A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said its staff would work with the Housing Department and management companies to carry out a joint operation to step up cleansing of public places and rat control in the districts where the patients lived. Those who disposed of waste improperly would be prosecuted. The teams would provide professional advice and instructions on rat control to those involved in managing housing estates and buildings. The department would also work with district councillors on inspections of black spots and publicity campaigns.

[The following is the introduction from a report of one of the 2018 cases
(Sridhar S, Yip CCY, Wu S, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus as cause of persistent hepatitis after liver transplant. Emerg Infect Dis. Dec 2018; 24(12): 2241-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6256372/pdf/18-0937.pdf. The references can be seen at the original URL.

"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans worldwide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, deer, camel, or boar meat (2-6). HEV transmission through blood product transfusion also has been described (7).

The diverse Hepeviridae family, which incorporates all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host species are terrestrial mammals (genus _Orthohepevirus_) and fish (genus _Piscihepevirus_) (8). The _Orthohepevirus_ genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have been reported to infect humans belong to _Orthohepevirus_ A (HEV-A). A total of 5 genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1-4 and -7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).

In addition to HEV-A, the _Orthohepevirus_ genus includes 3 other species: _Orthohepevirus B_ circulates in chickens, _Orthohepevirus C_ (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and _Orthohepevirus D_ in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis E virus, shares only 50%-60% nt [nucleotide] identity with HEV-A (8). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clinical infection have not been reported. The substantial phylogenetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical species barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis."

Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019:
ref: Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. J Infect Dis. 2019. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiz025. [Epub ahead of print]; https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz025/5288497

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major public health concern in developing countries where the primary transmission is via contaminated water. Zoonotic HEV cases have been increasingly described in Europe, Japan and the United States with pigs representing the main animal reservoir of infection. We report an unusual acute hepatitis infection in a previously healthy man caused by a rat hepatitis E virus with a considerably divergent genomic sequence compared to other rat HEV strains. It is possible that rat HEV is an under recognized cause of hepatitis infection and further studies are necessary to elucidate its potential risk and mode of transmission."

As well, the virus has recently been reported in UK rodents:
Murphy EG, Williams NJ, Jennings D, et al. First detection of Hepatitis E virus (_Orthohepevirus C_) in wild brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) from Great Britain. Zoonoses Public Health. 2019. doi: 10.1111/zph.12581. [Epub ahead of print]; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/zph.12581

Abstract
--------
"In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in the number of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections in people annually since 2010. Most of these are thought to be indigenously acquired _Orthohepevirus A_ genotype 3 (HEV G3), which has been linked to pork production and consumption. However, the dominant subgroup circulating in British pigs differs from that which is found in people; therefore, an alternative, potentially zoonotic, source is suspected as a possible cause of these infections. Rodents, brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) in particular, have been shown to carry HEV, both the swine HEV G3 genotype and _Orthohepevirus C_, genotype C1 (rat HEV). To investigate the prevalence of HEV in British rodents, liver tissue was taken from 307 rodents collected from pig farms (n = 12) and other locations (n = 10). The RNA from these samples was extracted and tested using a pan-HEV nested RT-PCR. Limited histopathology was also performed. In this study, 8/61 (13%, 95% CI, 5-21) of brown rat livers were positive for HEV RNA. Sequencing of amplicons demonstrated all infections to be rat HEV with 87%-92% nucleotide identity to other rat HEV sequences circulating within Europe and China (224 nt ORF-1). Lesions and necrosis were observed histologically in 2/3 samples examined. No rat HEV RNA was detected in any other species, and no HEV G3 RNA was detected in any rodent in this study. This is the first reported detection of rat HEV in Great Britain. A human case of rat HEV infection has recently been reported in Asia, suggesting that rat HEV could pose a risk to public health."
