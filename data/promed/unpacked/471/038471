Fatal cattle disease moves down South Australia with the rain
-------------------------------------------------------------
The rapid southern spread of a potentially fatal cattle disease that
is endemic in warmer Queensland but not often experienced in the
cooler south, is now being tracked by the animal health authorities
in New South Wales (NSW).

It has been 40 years since the bovine ephemeral fever [virus], or the
3-day sickness, reached Bega on the NSW far south coast, after
floods, similar to that of recent weeks. Cattle affected by the
disease have high temperatures and can't stand up for a few days.

Ian Lugton, livestock vet says the disease is likely to spread into
Victoria's north and east.

"Having more rain and winds forecast today, there is certainly a fair
chance that the mosquitoes carrying this infection have not got all
the way down the coast, and they may well do after these weather
events that are coming," Dr Lugton said.

He warns people in Victoria that the disease may have crossed over
the Victorian border as it has happened in the past, and it has been
recognized in the Temora and Wagga areas at the moment, although the
cooler weather temperatures may be limiting the spread.

Health authorities say there's no risk from consuming beef or milk,
from cattle affected with the 3-day sickness.

[Bovine ephemeral fever appears to be transmitted by arthropods. The
vector or vectors are not known, but the bovine ephemeral fever virus
(BEFV) has been isolated from a mixed pool of Culicine and Anopheline
mosquitoes, as well as _Anopheles bancroftii_, in Australia, and from
_Culicoides_ (biting midges) in both Africa and Australia. Mosquitoes
are suspected to be the most important biological vectors. The
disease can also be spread by intravenous inoculation of small
amounts of blood. Bovine ephemeral fever is not transmitted by close
contact, body secretions, or aerosol droplets. The virus does not
seem to be transmitted in semen and it is rapidly inactivated in
meat. Carriers are not known to occur.

Readers are also encouraged to see the moderator's comments on the
previous ProMED-mail post 20100210.0460 for more information on BEFV.
