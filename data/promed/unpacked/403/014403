An Australian uveitis specialist has warned that people are at risk of unnecessarily losing sight due to a sharp increase in the number of ocular syphilis cases being recorded around the world.

Ophthalmologist and uveitis specialist Professor Justine Smith from Flinders University [Australia] said that while the disease is easily treatable, its symptoms were often misdiagnosed as other conditions due to its previously low rates of infection. Smith recently collaborated on the largest ocular syphilis study ever undertaken with researchers in Brazil, which identified 127 cases across 4 clinics over a 2.5-year period [1].

"If you want to understand a disease as it's happening right at the moment, you need a large population to work with, and Brazil has 10x the population of Australia," Smith explained. "The infection manifests in similar ways in different populations, so that was a reason why this was a great collaboration."

Nearly 90 of the patients reported in the study were suffering inflammation in both eyes, and exams had revealed that some had suffered structural and functional complications inside the eye, such as retinal detachment. However, according to Smith, these symptoms are easily treated with penicillin if they're detected early enough.

"Anyone who presents at our clinic with inflammation in the eye, we test for syphilis. It will be a minority of those people who have syphilis in the eye, but you don't want to miss even one, because it's very treatable," she said. "You can get the results back within a day; it's really cheap; it's very robust testing now, and the treatment takes about 2 weeks, and that gets rid of it."

Statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicate a sharp increase in the number of people diagnosed with syphilis recently. In 2015, there were 7.5 cases per 100 000 persons, which represented the highest annual number and the highest rate of reported syphilis cases in approximately 20 years, and a 19% increase since 2014.

Meanwhile, during 2012-2016, the Australian notification rate of infectious syphilis increased 107% from 6.9 per 100 000 to 14.3 per 100 000. A recent ABC report also indicated the disease had reached "epidemic proportions" in North Queensland, where more than 1100 cases had been recorded since 2008, a year in which only 2 new cases were identified.

The most common symptom of ocular syphilis is blurry vision, but Smith says more than half of the patients studied lost vision to below driving level. "Patients didn't present to clinics for treatment until they had a problem for some months, but it is not completely the fault of the patient. Doctors are no longer accustomed to seeing syphilis these days, so it may not be picked up for an extended period of time, during which patients may develop eye complications," she said. "Our most important observation is the role of testing in making a timely diagnosis of ocular syphilis, which should limit the risk of vision loss."

"Abstract
-----------
"Recent reports from different world regions suggest ocular syphilis is re-emerging, in parallel with an increasing incidence of the systemic infection globally. We conducted a large observational study of 127 persons consecutively treated for ocular syphilis at public medical centers in Brazil over a 2.5-year period ending July 2015. Of 104 individuals serologically tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 34.6% were positive. Ophthalmological evaluations included measurement of Snellen visual acuity and intraocular pressure, and assessment of inflammation by slit lamp examination and dilated posterior eye examination. Involvements in 214 eyes were anterior (6.1%), intermediate (8.4%), posterior (76.2%) and pan- (8.4%) uveitis, and scleritis (0.9%). Multiple anterior and posterior eye complications were observed, including cataract in the anterior eye (incidence rate, 0.18/eye-year) and epiretinal membrane in the posterior eye (incidence rate, 0.09/eye-year); incidence rates of reduction in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/50 or less and 20/200 or less were 0.10 and 0.06/eye-year, respectively. Rates of complications and visual acuity loss did not differ significantly between HIV- positive and negative individuals. In an era of re-emergence, syphilis has ocular complications that may compromise vision, despite treatment with appropriate anti-microbial drugs."

Ocular syphilis can involve any structure of the eye, but posterior uveitis is the most common, as was found in the above study from Brazil. Other manifestations may include anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis, and interstitial keratitis. Permanent blindness may result.

Ocular syphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis, including primary and secondary syphilis. In 2016, the US CDC noted that ocular syphilis occurred mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM) who were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus from reports in 2 major cities, San Francisco and Seattle, and subsequent case finding (HIV); only "a few cases" at the time were noted in HIV-uninfected persons including heterosexual men and women (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm), which prompted speculation that an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these HIV-infected patients or infection with a neuropathogenic strain of syphilis accounted for these findings. However, the above report from public medical centers in Brazil over a 2.5-year period ending July 2015 found 65% of patients with ocular syphilis were HIV-negative.

It is important to note that ocular syphilis should be managed according to treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm). - Mod.ML
