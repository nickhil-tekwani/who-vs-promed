Mukah is the latest district to join other divisions in registering a rise
in incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease. But the State Health
Department (SHD) has yet to ascertain the exact number of children infected
with this disease despite the increased number of cases also recorded in
Bintulu, Kuching, Marudi, Serian, Sibu and Miri.
State Health Department (SHD) director Dr Yao Sik Chi told the Tribune
yesterday that parents should heed the department's advice to observe
strict personal hygiene. "Getting early treatment for their children and
the regular washing of hands would help bring down the incidence of this
disease," he advised. "Parents with children below five must wash hands
before eating and avoid crowded places", he added.
Parents should not compromise on personal hygiene as the disease could only
be spread from human to human, he said. Dr Yao had directed all medical
staff at the divisional and district levels to alert parents of children
infected by the disease to seek early medical treatment at the nearest
hospitals and clinics. He hoped nursery operators too would cooperate by
observing strict personal hygiene, and send home children suspected of
being infected by the disease. Meanwhile, University Malaysia Sarawak
(Unimas) director of Health and Community Medicine, Professor Dr Jane
Cardoza, agreed that prevention was most effective to fight the disease.
"Keeping hands clean by washing with water before any intake of food is the
best practice for parents and children. The hot and dry weather should be
good reason to observe strict personal hygiene," she said.
On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Dr George Chan said the
government did not want to be caught unprepared this time. In mid-1997,
the Coxsackie outbreak took the lives of 31 children under five years old,
with 911 treated at hospitals and clinics. A total of 3,334 children were
treated nationwide for this viral infection. The outbreak also put the
country on medical alert, forcing the temporary closure of nurseries and
swimming pools in the State. The State government allocated nearly RM1
million for research on the Coxsackie disease. The government also took
steps to ensure there would be no future recurrence of the disease in the
State.
