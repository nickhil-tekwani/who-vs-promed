Human and Equine West Nile Virus Infections in France, Aug - Sep 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On 6 Oct 2003, a case of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection was notified
by the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) of Arboviruses (Pasteur Institute,
Lyon). The patient is a 41-year-old man living in the administrative
department of the Var in southeastern France. Onset of symptoms occurred in
late August (fever, myalgia, diarrhoea). After 7 days, he was admitted in
hospital with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis.
Initial blood and CSF samples were positive for WNV IgM antibodies by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples taken 3 weeks later were
positive for both WNV IgM and IgG. The neutralisation test was positive on
both blood samples; reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
negative, and no virus was isolated. The patient has now been discharged from
hospital.
His wife reported having had a mild fever a week before her husband developed
onset of symptoms. She tested positive (IgM and IgG) for WNV antibodies by
ELISA on a blood sample taken in mid-October 2003. Neutralisation test
results are pending.
During the 2 weeks before symptom onset, the patient had stayed in
the Var for 4 days, and had spent 2 days in the department of
Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. He also had driven along the French Riviera
from his home in the Var to Alicante (Spain), where he spent one
week. He then returned to the Var in France, where he developed
symptoms 2 days after his return His wife remained in the Var during
the 3 weeks before onset of her symptoms.
On 9 Oct 2003, the French Food Safety Agency (which, in collaboration
with the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for equine WNV
surveillance in France) reported WNV infection in a horse living in
the Var, approximately 20 kilometres from the residence of the human
cases. The horse had suffered from encephalitis in mid-September and
subsequently recovered. A blood sample was positive for both IgG and
IgM by ELISA and neutralisation. In addition, 2 suspected equine
cases were notified in the same department, both with meningo-encephalitis
with onset in mid-September. One horse was euthanised early in the course of
the disease but no cerebral biopsy was performed, and the other horse
recovered.
The occurrence of 2 human cases (one confirmed and one probable) and
3 equine cases (one confirmed and 2 probable), in the same area
within a 5-week period, strongly suggests that infection was
contracted in the Var.
In France, national West Nile virus surveillance comprises:
(1) Notification to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire
<http://www.invs.sante.fr> of confirmed human cases by the NRL and
its associated laboratory;
(2) WNV testing and notification of all horses presenting with encephalitis
or meningoencephalitis; and
(3) WNV testing by the NRL of ill and dead birds collected by a voluntary
network of wildlife observers (SAGIR). Moreover, since 2001, the
national system has been reinforced during the at-risk period (from
May to October) in the departments of the Camargue and Corsica, where
West Nile virus circulation has been documented in the past. In these
departments, suspected human cases are notified to the local health
authorities and tested for West Nile virus. In addition, sentinel
chickens and horses are monitored for seroconversion. No
seroconversion has yet been detected in the sentinel horses or birds
in 2003.
From 8 Oct 2003 onwards, surveillance of WNV infections has been
strengthened in the Departments where the patient travelled or stayed
prior to illness onset. Retrospective and prospective case finding of
human meningoencephalitis cases is now being carried out by the
Regional Epidemiology Unit and the local health authorities in all
hospitals of the Departments on the Mediterranean coast. Moreover, in
the Var, a seroprevalence study is being carried out among 600 horses
living within 30 km of the human or equine cases. An ecological study
of the vector competence and potential of the mosquito populations
around the residences of the cases is being carried out. All
physicians, laboratory biologists, veterinarians, and the volunteers
in the SAGIR wildlife network involved in the local reinforced
surveillance were alerted about possible virus circulation. The
French agencies for blood transfusion and donor organ transplantation
safety were alerted to the virus circulation on French territory and
the occurrence of human cases.
Conclusion: The investigations indicate that West Nile virus was
circulating in the Var in France in August and September 2003. It is
yet not possible to determine whether virus circulation has ceased.
However, taking into account the weather conditions, the reduction in
mosquito populations, and the southward migration of wild bird
species, the probability of persisting virus circulation is
decreasing every day.

Investigations in Spain Following Human West Nile Virus Infections in France
--------------------------------------------------
The Institut de Veille Sanitaire in France contacted the Spanish
authorities on 7 Oct 2003 regarding the first probable case of West
Nile fever in France. The patient spent half of the incubation period
(15 days) in the south of France and half near Alicante, Spain. The
health authorities in the area of Alicante have not, to date,
detected any increase in meningoencephalitis in 2003.
West Nile virus (WNV) activity was last detected in Spain between the
1960s and the 1980s in the regions of Catalunya, Andalucia, Valencia,
and Galicia (reference below). Following the outbreak of WNV in
horses in France in the year 2000, a research network for arthropod-
and rodent-transmitted viral diseases was established in Spain in
2001. Ongoing research and surveillance projects carried out in
different regions have not detected any WNV activity in the areas
studied. These studies include testing of human sera, sera from
migrating birds, and pools of mosquitoes for West Nile virus and
other flaviviruses.
Following the notification of a probable case in France, specific
investigations have been initiated in Spain, including:
(1) Active search and detection of meningoencephalitis of unknown origin in
the area of Alicante;
(2) systematic testing for WNV in sera from the area archived at the national
reference centre during the past few months;
(3) active search of possible changes in animal health; and
(4) an entomological study and a seroprevalence study in migrating birds in
the area are under discussion.
The initial results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on sera
from the area archived at the national reference centre during the
past few months are negative for WNV. Results of serological studies
will be available soon.
In conclusion, there is no evidence at this point of any cases of WNV
in Spain, nor is there any proof that WNV is circulating in this
country. Nevertheless, a proactive system has been implemented to
ensure that appropriate surveillance procedures are being carried out.

Correction: No Imported Cases of West Nile Virus Recorded in Sweden
--------------------------------------------------
[Sirkka Vene (Dept. of Virology, Zoonoses section, Swedish Inst. for
Inf. Dis. Control, SE-171 82 Solna, Sweden) has pointed out an error
in the Moderator's comment to the preceding post in this thread,
where it was stated that there had been recent cases of imported West
Nile virus infection in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden.]
Sirkka Vene states that: "As a national laboratory we are the only
facility in Sweden to perform West Nile virus diagnostics, and we
have not diagnosed any cases (imported or others) of West Nile virus
infections for the past 15 years."
ProMED-mail regrets this error and thanks Sirkka Vene for putting the
record straight.
