WHO Avian Influenza Expert Says 300 Dead In China
-------------------------------------------------
Dr. Masato Tashiro, a Japanese WHO consultant, believes that China
has had 300 human deaths from avian influenza and is hiding the true
extent of the disease from the rest of the world. Dr. Masato Tashiro,
Director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Influenza at the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, and head of the Department
of Virology of the National Institute of Infectious Disease (Japan),
astonished colleagues with this information during a speech at a
recent retirement dinner for a fellow virologist, Hans-Dieter Klenk.
Having just returned from the Hunan province of China on behalf of the World
Health Organization (WHO), [Dr. Masato Tashiro] claimed that a reliable source
had provided him with details of the true nature of the H5N1 virus in
China. "We are systematically deceived," he is reported to have said.
Tashiro visited China on behalf of the World Health Organization (WHO) in
Hunan province. His laboratory, at the National Institute for Infection
Research in Tokyo, as one of the Asian points of contact for the United
Nations, had been particularly entrusted with investigations into avian
influenza in Asia and China. Dr. Masato gave his lecture in the University of
Marburg Clinic before some the most outstanding virologists in the world and
shocked the meeting with his unauthorized data [report] from inside China.
The Japanese virologist [said he] firmly believes in the reliability of the
source and its data. The secrecy of the Peking government is still causing
concern as it was at the beginning of the SARS epidemic disease, complained
Tashiro. At least 5 medical co-workers who should be reporting on the
situation in the provinces were arrested, and [other] publication-willing
researchers were threatened with punishments [he said].

[There have been recurrent reports of human cases of avian influenza
in China. So far, none have been independently substantiated. This
report has more significance than most, coming from a WHO-supported
virologist. However, Dr. Tashiro's report is based on 2nd-hand
information and requires independent authentication. Further
information is requested. - Mod.CP]

China: School Teacher Tests Negative for Avian Influenza Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood tests on a Chinese schoolteacher who fell ill in an area that
suffered a bird flu outbreak show that he doesn't have the virus, a
World Health Organization official said on Wed 23 Nov 2005. The
teacher lived in the same county in the central province of Hunan as
a 9-year-old boy who was confirmed to be one of China's 1st human
cases. The boy's 12-year-old sister, who died, was a suspected case.
"Based on an extensive range of blood tests, [the schoolteacher] has
been excluded as a case of H5N1," said Dr. Julie Hall, an infectious
diseases specialist for the WHO's Beijing office.
The 36-year-old teacher fell ill after chopping raw chicken,
according to the government. Chinese experts initially said all 3
tested negative for the virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu. But it
later reopened the investigation and asked the WHO for help.

[This result, if confirmed independently, reduces the number of
laboratory confirmed human cases of avian influenza in China to 2: a
24-year-old woman in Anhui province (who died) and a 9-year-old boy
in Hunan province who recovered. - Mod.CP]
