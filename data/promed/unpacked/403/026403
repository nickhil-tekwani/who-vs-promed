Hepatitis: More cases confirmed in young children
---------------------------------------------
UK health officials say investigations have uncovered another 34 confirmed cases of unusual hepatitis - or liver inflammation - in young children since 25 Apr 2022. This brings the UK total to 145 since January 2022, including 108 in England, 17 in Scotland, 11 in Wales and 9 in Northern Ireland. 10 children affected have had liver transplants.

Scientists are not yet certain what is causing this rise in cases. But researchers say their findings continue to suggest the sudden increase may be linked to adenovirus infection - a virus that usually causes cold-like symptoms and vomiting and diarrhoea in otherwise healthy children.
Most cases of hepatitis - or liver inflammation - have been seen in children under five years old, with many initially feeling ill with diarrhea and nausea followed by jaundice - a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes that shows the liver is struggling.

Scientists say they are continuing to keep an open mind with a range of other causes being actively investigated. The pattern they are seeing is not typical of illness from adenoviruses, so they are also looking at other possible factors, such as a previous infection, including Covid-19, or an environmental cause. They are also exploring whether there have been any changes to the genetic make-up of adenovirus that might trigger liver inflammation more easily. Another possible explanation is that restrictions imposed in the pandemic may have led to young children being first exposed to adenovirus at a slightly later point in their lives, leading to a "more vigorous" immune response in some.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10764441/California-declares-seven-cases-severe-hepatitis-child-dies-suspected-illness.html

7 more cases of severe hepatitis have been detected in California, and a child has died in Wisconsin, as the mysterious disease spreads throughout the country. California's Department of Health said it had detected the cases in 'young' children, who had all been taken ill since October. It takes the USA total for suspected hepatitis cases to 27, with the condition now being spotted across 7 states -- mostly east of the Mississippi river.

The cause of the mysterious illness remains a 'mystery', chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci says. But experts have raised concerns that lockdowns weakening immunity in children or even Covid infections could be to blame. Nearly 200 children have been sickened by the condition across the world in up to 14 countries. At least 18 have needed liver transplants.

The California department of health said it was unclear whether adenovirus -- which typically causes colds -- was behind the illnesses, or if the cases were connected.

Hospital reports two cases of rare, unexplained child liver illness in Minnesota
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A pediatric doctor with M Health Fairview is reporting 2 cases of unexplained, severe hepatitis in children in Minnesota that appear to match similar cases around the globe. Dr. Heli Bhatt, a pediatric gastroenterologist and hepatologist with M Health Fairview Masonic Children's Hospital, says a [then] 4-week-old baby received a liver transplant 6 months ago following unexplained, severe liver inflammation. Another, otherwise healthy child, is currently awaiting a liver transplant due to hepatitis with no known origin. M Health Fairview says one child is from Minnesota and the other is from South Dakota.

On Friday evening, 29 Apr 2022, the Minnesota Department of Health confirmed that it is investigating "several cases," saying they are waiting on additional clinical information and lab testing.

"What is unique about this situation is that they are really severe, and they are going on to need transplants, and even one death, which is what is mind boggling to call of us," said Dr. Bhatt. "I think the best thing you can do is not panic, good hand hygiene and let your pediatrician know if your kid is having symptoms."

10-month-old boy found to have acute hepatitis with unknown cause; MOH investigating
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 10-month-old boy in Singapore was found to have acute hepatitis with unknown cause, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Saturday (Apr 30). It added that investigations are ongoing to determine if the case is similar to those in the recent global outbreak. MOH said that it had been notified on Fri, 29 Apr 2022, of a case of acute hepatitis, or liver inflammation, in the infant. The case had presented at KK Women's and Children's Hospital Emergency Department on Mon, 25 Apr and he was admitted for further investigations.

The case and his household contacts are currently well, said MOH. "Investigations are ongoing to determine if the case has a similar presentation to the cases of acute hepatitis of unknown cause reported internationally and by the WHO," it added. "Laboratory testing has determined the case to be negative for the common viruses that cause hepatitis (hepatitis type A, B, C and E viruses). The case has a previous history of COVID-19 infection in December 2021, although there is no evidence at this time that the acute hepatitis is related to COVID-19."

More than 200 suspected and probable cases of acute hepatitis of unknown cause have been reported in children across 17 countries, said the ministry. MOH added that it is monitoring the situation closely, and has informed all medical practitioners to be vigilant to young children presenting with signs and symptoms of hepatitis for which a cause cannot be identified.

[The statement that the Singapore case child was "well" might suggest that the case does not fit the case definition.

More clinically compatible cases continue to be reported, it is not entirely clear how many of these are newly presenting or being found looking back at past cases over the past few months. A time line of all the cases based on day of initial symptoms would be very informative.

One possible cause, adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. In this CDC report related to the Alabama cases (Hepatitis, undefined, global (03): USA (AL) children, CDC, poss adenovirus, 2021-22 20220430.8702942), which were seemingly recognized prior to European cases, no clear evidence of adenovirus in the affected liver tissue was found, and although type 41 was identified by hexon gene sequencing it is not clear if a whole genomic analysis of the virus has been compared to older adenovirus serotype 41. Hexon is the major surface coat protein of adenovirus. If the virus is the cause, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors, or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible for the more severe disease?

To this point, no evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne toxin or transmissible agent was involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio. - Mod.LL
