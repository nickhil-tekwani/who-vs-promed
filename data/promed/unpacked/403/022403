Anthrax kills bison in Rural Municipality of Paddockwood
--------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed as the cause of death for 7 bison in a
Paddockwood herd, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
After lab results were returned Thursday [24 Jul 2008], the rest of
the herd was put in quarantine and is now being monitored. In 2006,
more than 800 animals died due to the disease in Saskatchewan.

So far this year [2008], 21 animals have died from anthrax. One large
cattle farm in the Rural Municipality (RM) of King George, near Swift
Current, lost 13 head of cattle in May 2008. Last week [14-18 Jul
2008], anthrax claimed one animal in a beef herd in Ponass Lake in
East Central Saskatchewan.

The soil-borne spores can be brought to the surface by human and
environmental acts, which include excavation, flooding and erosion from winds.

"What we have this year with it being drier, some of those areas that
were maybe under water for the last couple of years are drying up and
animals are moving in," said CFIA disease control specialist Betty
Althouse. "So there may be exposure there that didn't happen last year."

Althouse said a few cases of anthrax every summer aren't unusual. But
a lower level of anthrax vaccination this year doesn't help the
situation. She said a heightened awareness of the issue developed
after the 2006 outbreak but has since dropped. "I guess we don't not
expect (more anthrax cases)," Althouse said, emphasizing the need for
ranchers to consult their local veterinarians and make a decision on
vaccination. "We'll kind of have to wait and see what develops."

Paddockwood Reeve Brent Zbaraschuk said somewhere between 70 and 100
people in the RM keep livestock and that the industry is important to
the community. Once he heard of the anthrax case, he called the CFIA
and found out they don't release information on where specific cases
take place. "What's the next thing the RM is going to get hit with?
First the flood at Candle Lake and now this," he said.

Increasing rates of anthrax infection are being found among bison and
they could be developing a susceptibility to the disease, according
to Althouse. She believes animal behaviours such as pawing at the
ground and "dust bathing" could also be to blame.

Anthrax is legislated under the Health of Animals Act. Producers and
veterinarians are obligated to report suspected cases to CFIA.

[A number of points. So far this summer it has been dry in
Saskatchewan and therefore the biting fly populations should be low,
diminishing the risk of fly-borne epidemics. But sporadic cases will
still occur, hopefully with no or minimal intra-herd spread. This is
what we saw in North and South Dakota in 2006 when it was dry; in 2005
when it was wet the disease was all over the eastern parts of those 2
states.

Secondly, after an outbreak one should minimally revaccinate each year
for at least 3 years. On my very 1st anthrax investigation in the UK
in 1972 I was introduced to Max Sterne by Gregor Henderson, the
director of the institute where the outbreak was -- what an
introduction! Anyway, Max, bless his heart, told me that in his
experience in Natal [South Africa] pastures would stay contaminated
for 3 months to 3 years after a case, and my experience has borne this
out. However careful one is in disinfecting and cleaning up there is
always some residual contamination, and it takes time for daily
temperature changes, rain, and UV light to kill and disperse the
remaining spores.

Thirdly, bison have always been susceptible. Nowadays one is seeing
more plains bison being raised on the Canadian prairie ranches. They
need to be vaccinated each spring along with the cattle. The bison
bulls like dust wallows. It is part of their display during the
breeding season to set up a 30-40 foot dust column. Hypothetically if
an animal had died of anthrax in one of these wallows the spores could
subsequently be spread down-wind by a displaying bull. Whether it
actually happens has yet to be proven. Very few bulls die in their
wallows, and though saucer-shaped, wallows have an 8-inch or more
raised edge. So any laterally moving spores from a carcass site,
because of downslope movement of rain, would have to climb up over the
edge to get into the wallow. On the other hand the normal
contamination around an undisturbed bison carcass site, thanks to the
size of the beast and the scavenging activities of foxes, coyotes,
crows and wolves is spectacular, which is why it is doubly important
to burn these carcasses and disinfect the site. - Mod.MHJ
