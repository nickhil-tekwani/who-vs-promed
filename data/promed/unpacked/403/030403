Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Jan 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new animals
Epidemiological comments: the Djoudj National Bird Park is an ornithological site located in Dagana Department and considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has the status of a wetland of international importance (Ramsar site No. 138) and is the core of the transboundary biosphere reserve of the Delta of the Senegal River. The disease occurs during the breeding period of the pelicans, when they are incubating, hatching, and growing juveniles. It is also the period of the great eastern transatlantic migration of waterbirds, some of which stay in the northern wetlands from November to March. As of [2 Feb 2022], the epidemiological situation is as follows:
- Susceptible animals at risk: 11 563 pelicans;
- Total number of sick animals: 883;
- Total number of dead animals: 758, including 754 juveniles and 4 adults;
- Morbidity rate: 7.6%;
- Mortality rate: 6.5%;
- Lethality rate: 86%

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone
Domestic control measures to be applied: official destruction of animal products; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; disinfestation
Wild control measures applied: disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone

Affected population: these are 52-week-old laying hens. The birds are kept in buildings with an automatic water distribution system.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the epidemiological surveillance network for animal diseases (or RESCAM) of the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries has reported high poultry mortality in laying hen houses in the locality of Kongso-Bamengoum. The epidemiological investigation teams of the veterinary services took samples for analysis and protective measures were taken in accordance with Law no. 006 of [16 Apr 2001], on the nomenclature and sanitary zoo regulations of livestock diseases considered legally contagious and notifiable, and with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: zoning; traceability; surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; movement control inside the country; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products; disinfestation; screening; stamping out.
Domestic control measures to be applied: disinfection
Wild control measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs

The following information is from the scientific article
Lo FT, Zecchin B, Diallo AA, et al. Intercontinental spread of Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) to Senegal. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; 28(1): 234-237; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/1/21-1401_article
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"In January 2021, Senegal reported the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1), which was detected on a poultry farm in Thies, Senegal, and in great white pelicans in the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary. We report evidence of new transcontinental spread of H5N1 from Europe toward Africa."

Conclusions
-----------
"These evolutionary and spatial investigations indicate that the H5N1 outbreaks in Senegal did not emerge from local evolution of H5N1 viruses in Africa. These new viruses seem to have been introduced in fall 2020 from Eurasia through migratory birds flying southwest for winter. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (October-December 2020) and the long branches that separate the Senegal viruses from progenitors in Europe suggest an undetected virus circulating in the area, likely in wild birds.

"The Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, located in the Senegal River delta along the East Atlantic Flyway, is a sanctuary for large breeding waterbirds, including great white pelicans. H5N1 caused the death of hundreds of pelicans there. Before the emergence of the HPAI H5Nx viruses of the Gs/GD lineage, infection with avian influenza virus of pelicans was rarely reported. The incursion of the Gs/GD lineage has resulted in numerous fatal infections in this species. On the basis of data from the avian influenza passive surveillance system implemented in Europe during 2005-2017, an HPAI detection rate of 9.5% has been estimated in great white pelicans. This species is highly gregarious, behavior that could have promoted the spread of HPAI in these birds in Senegal. Unfortunately, surveillance of wild and domestic birds near where the H5N1-infected pelicans were identified did not shed light on the species responsible for introducing the virus. The wetlands of Senegal are inhabited by millions of aquatic bird species, including Garganey (_Anas querquedula_), Northern pintail (_A. acuta_), Northern shoveler (_Spatula clypeata_), Eurasian teal (_Anas crecca_), Eurasian wigeon (_Mareca penelope_), common pochard (_Aythya farina_), and tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_), many of which have had a role in the spread of Gs/GD-lineage H5 viruses. This bird population has been hardly affected by the 2020-2021 epidemic in Europe, during which HPAI H5 virus infections were reported in apparently healthy birds. Therefore, even considering that most of the great white pelicans residing in the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary are deemed to be sedentary, species other than pelicans might have been involved in introducing and spreading H5N1 within Senegal or to neighboring countries reporting HPAI H5N1, including Niger, Nigeria, Mauritania, and Mali.

"Recent reports of H5N1 in Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali indicate an unprecedented westward spread of the virus in Africa. However, the lack of genetic information on the viruses detected in these countries makes it difficult to reconstruct the exact number of virus introductions and dynamics of virus dissemination, and both poultry trade and wild bird movements remain valid candidate pathways. Moreover, after the outbreaks of HPAI in poultry, 2 states in Nigeria reported 7 suspected human cases of avian influenza H5N1, 4 in Kano, and 3 in Plateau. These cases confirm the importance of One Health joint activities by public human and animal health sectors to contain and monitor virus spread and the emergence of novel viruses of major concern.

"There is still much to learn about the ecology of these viruses in the wild bird population; detection of the 2.3.4.4b clade in Senegal demonstrates that predicting the dissemination trajectories of these viruses is difficult. No system yet exists that can prevent the virus from following wild bird movements. Efforts are needed to regulate poultry movements and develop risk-based surveillance in wild birds in Africa to detect newly introduced and circulating viruses, reduce the likely spread to poultry, and limit the risk for exposure of humans to infected birds."
