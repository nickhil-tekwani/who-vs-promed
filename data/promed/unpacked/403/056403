[1] Vaccination and virus spread
Date: Thu 1 Apr 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-walensky.html


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday [1 Apr 2021] walked back controversial comments made by its director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, suggesting that people who are vaccinated against the coronavirus never become infected or transmit the virus to others.

The assertion called into question the precautions that the agency had urged vaccinated people to take just last month [March 2021], like wearing masks and gathering only under limited circumstances with unvaccinated people.

"Dr. Walensky spoke broadly during this interview," an agency spokesman told The Times. "It's possible that some people who are fully vaccinated could get COVID-19. The evidence isn't clear whether they can spread the virus to others. We are continuing to evaluate the evidence."

The agency was responding in part to criticism from scientists who noted that current research was far from sufficient to claim that vaccinated people cannot spread the virus.

The data suggest that "it's much harder for vaccinated people to get infected, but don't think for one second that they cannot get infected," said Paul Duprex, director of the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh.

In a television interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Dr. Walensky referred to data published by the CDC showing that one dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 80% effective at preventing infection, and 2 doses were 90% effective.

That certainly suggested that transmission from vaccinated people might be unlikely, but Dr. Walensky's comments hinted that protection was complete. "Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick," she said. "And that it's not just in the clinical trials, it's also in real-world data."

Dr. Walensky went on to emphasize the importance of continuing to wear masks and maintain precautions, even for vaccinated people. Still, the brief comment was widely interpreted as saying that the vaccines offered complete protection against infection or transmission.

In a pandemic that regularly spawns scientific misunderstanding, experts said they were sympathetic to Dr. Walensky and her obvious desire for Americans to continue to take precautions. It was only Monday [29 Mar 2021] that she said rising caseloads had left her with a sense of "impending doom."

"If Dr. Walensky had said most vaccinated people do not carry virus, we would not be having this discussion," said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. "What we know is the vaccines are very substantially effective against infection -- there's more and more data on that -- but nothing is 100%," he added. "It is an important public health message that needs to be gotten right."

Misinterpretation could disrupt the agency's urgent pleas for immunization, some experts said. As of Wednesday [31 Mar 2021], 30% of Americans had received at least one dose of a vaccine and 17% were fully immunized.

"There cannot be any daylight between what the research shows -- really impressive but incomplete protection -- and how it is described," said Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "This opens the door to the skeptics who think the government is sugarcoating the science," Dr. Bach said, "and completely undermines any remaining argument why people should keep wearing masks after being vaccinated."

All of the coronavirus vaccines are spectacularly successful at preventing serious disease and death from COVID-19, but how well they prevent infection has been less clear. Clinical trials of the vaccines were designed only to assess whether the vaccines prevent serious illness and death. The research from the CDC on Monday [29 Mar 2021] brought the welcome conclusion that the vaccines are also extremely effective at preventing infection.

The study enrolled 3950 healthcare workers, emergency responders and others at high risk of infection. The participants swabbed their noses each week and sent the samples in for testing, which allowed federal researchers to track all infections, symptomatic or not. Two weeks after vaccination, the vast majority of vaccinated people remained virus-free, the study found.

Follow-up data from clinical trials support that finding. In results released by Pfizer and BioNTech on Wednesday [31 Mar 2021], for example, 77 people who received the vaccine had a coronavirus infection, compared with 850 people who got a placebo.

"Clearly, some vaccinated people do get infected," Dr. Duprex said. "We're stopping symptoms, we're keeping people out of hospitals. But we're not making them completely resistant to an infection."

The number of vaccinated people who become infected is likely to be higher among those receiving vaccines made by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, which have a lower efficacy, experts said. (Still, those vaccines are worth taking because they uniformly prevent serious illness and death.) Infection rates may also be higher among people exposed to a virus variant that can sidestep the immune system.

Cases across the country are once again on the upswing, threatening a new surge. Dr. Walensky's comment came just a day after she made an emotional appeal to the American public to continue taking precautions. "I am asking you to just hold on a little longer, to get vaccinated when you can, so that all of those people that we all love will still be here when this pandemic ends," she said.

Given the rising numbers, it's especially important that immunized people continue to protect those who have not yet been immunized against the virus, experts said. "Vaccinated people should not be throwing away their masks at this point," Dr. Moore said. "This pandemic is not over."

[Vaccination adds to one's sense of confidence when out in the public arena, but it is important to maintain the same personal protection protocols as prevaccination until a greater proportion of the population is vaccinated and more is known about infectiousness following vaccination, keeping in mind variants are circulating against which the vaccine is less effective. - Mod.LK]

[2] CIDRAP: cases rise

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/global-covid-19-cases-5th-straight-week-deaths-follow


In its weekly snapshot of global COVID-19 activity, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [30 Mar 2021] that new cases rose for the 5th week in a row, an increase that now includes all 6 of its regions, with deaths accelerating for the 2nd straight week.

In other developments, expert groups that continue to weigh potential side effects of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine said benefits still outweigh the risks, and the WHO today [31 Mar 2021] said that ivermectin should only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials.

In its latest situation report, the WHO said of the more than 3.8 million cases added to the global total last week, the 5 countries reporting the most were Brazil, the United States, India, France, and Poland. Meanwhile, countries reporting some of the steepest rises include Bangladesh (85%), India (55%), Turkey (47%), and the Philippines (43%).

Cases rose even in some countries in the African region, where cases had declined over the previous 2 weeks. For example, Kenya's cases increased 25% and Ethiopia's new infections increased 14%.

Regarding SARS-CoV-2 variant activity, 5 more countries reported the B117 virus that was first detected in the United Kingdom, raising the total to 130. Five more countries reported the B1351 variant that was first found in South Africa, lifting the total to 80. And 4 more countries reported the P1 virus first identified in Brazil, bringing the number to 45.

In the Americas, officials from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said today [31 Mar 2021] at a briefing that over the past 4 weeks, the region has averaged one million new cases a week, signaling that transmission is very active in many places.

Carissa Etienne, MBBS, MSc, PAHO's director, said the winding down of the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere and vacation season is being followed by rising cases in many countries. Some -- including Paraguay, Uruguay, and Cuba -- are experiencing worse outbreaks than they faced in 2020. She warned that the region's surge could be worse than its last one and called on individuals and governments to play roles in protecting communities.

Etienne said the rise in cases is overwhelming hospitals in many countries, with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy topping 80% in all but 2 of Brazil's states and Jamaica's hospitals operating well above capacity. She also said the surge is stretching supplies of oxygen and anesthetic drugs in Brazil, Peru, and elsewhere.

"This underscores the dire consequences of a pandemic that can quickly overburden our health systems: that even a well-established supply chain is struggling to cope," she said.

Active cases in the country surged past the 6-lakh [600 000] mark with the last 1 lakh [100 000] cases coming in just 4 days. This has highlighted the rapid surge of the pandemic's 2nd wave in the country.

Even though daily cases are matching the numbers in the last week of September [2020], the fatalities now are comparatively much lower. Compared to 468 fatalities on 1 Apr 2021, daily deaths on 1 Oct 2020 were 1102 while the 7-day average of casualties on that day was 1068.

Maharashtra continued to top the states' chart, recording 43 183 fresh cases, its highest ever count during the pandemic, and accounting for 53% of the country's infections on Thursday [1 Apr 2021]. Mumbai also reported a record daily peak by adding 8646 cases, a significant jump from its previous high of 6933 cases on 28 Mar 2021.

Maharashtra reported 249 deaths, the highest since 5 Nov 2020, when 256 casualties were reported. Thursday [1 Apr 2021] was the 2nd day in a row when the state added over 200 deaths.

India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh [2 million] mark on 7 Aug 2020, 30 lakh [3 million] on 23 Aug 2020, 40 lakh [4 million] on 5 Sep 2020, and 50 lakh [5 million] on 16 Sep 2020.

Though the COVID-19 situation has not yet reached the "fully controlled status", the situation has relatively come under control, Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said today [1 Apr 2021].

He told the Daily Mirror that nowadays, the country reported around 200 COVID cases while it was around 800 sometime ago. "If we analyse the trend, there is a control status at present though the situation is not fully under control."

Meanwhile, the Chief Epidemiologist told a media conference at the Health Promotion Bureau that the decrease in PCR tests was due to a lesser number of 1st contacts and added they were not hiding data related to COVID-19.

He said conducting lesser amounts of PCR tests deliberately means committing suicide. "We have not decreased the number of PCR tests. We have to bring down the number of PCR tests due to lesser amount of 1st contacts," he said.

However, Dr. Samaraweera said they had not decreased the number of random PCR tests in the country. "We have been able to identify patients following random PCR. This becomes evident with the patients detected from the Jaffna area. We were able to prevent it from leading to a bigger cluster," he said.

Meanwhile, he said they would be conducting antigen tests targeting employees leaving the economic zones during the festive season. "This will be done to prevent the COVID virus from spreading to the villages," he added.
