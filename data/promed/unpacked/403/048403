A Comment on Hepatitis A Cases Numbers in the USA
-------------------------------------------------
The most recent PROMED-mail update on the multi-state hepatitis A outbreak
[archived as: Hepatitis A - USA (02): multistate outbreak susp.
20031004.2498] states that about 23 000 people are infected with hepatitis
A virus annually. More correctly, about 23 000 cases are reported
annually. The estimate for actual infection is closer to 100 000 or more,
judging by estimates from 1997 in the "Pink Book" (Epidemiology and
Prevention of Vaccine - Preventable Diseases, 2003, p 199. DHHS, CDC).

[For checking the trends in Hepatitis A in the USA, the following data from
the CDC website are available:
From the MMWR 1 Oct 1999 / 48(RR12);1-37
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4812a1.htm>
"National Trends
In the United States, cyclic increases in the incidence of hepatitis A have
occurred approximately every decade; the last nationwide increase occurred
in 1995 (1,30). Between epidemics, hepatitis A continues to occur at
relatively high rates. In 1997, 30 021 hepatitis A cases were reported to
the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (1). After the
NNDSS data were adjusted for disease under-reporting and asymptomatic
infections, the number of cases reported in 1997 represented an estimated
90 000 persons with symptomatic hepatitis A and 180 000 persons with HAV
infection (CDC, unpublished data, 1998)."
From the CDC Hepatitis webpage on the NCID (National Center for Infectious
Disease website):

Year: Reported Acute Cases/ Estimated Acute Cases/ Estimated

1988: 28 506/ 122 000/ 305 000
1989: 35 822/ 153 000/ 380 000
1990: 31 522/ 135 000/ 373 000
1991: 24 219/ 104 000/ 288 000
1992: 23 112/ 99 000 /274 000
1993: 24 238/ 104 000/ 284 000
1994: 26 796/ 115 000/ 333 000
1995: 31 582/ 135 000/ 356 000
1996: 31 032/ 133 000/ 335 000
1997: 30 021/ 128 000/ 341 000
1998: 23 299/ 99 000/ 243 000
1999: 17 047/ 73 000/ 181 000
2000: 13 397/ 57 000/ 143 000
2001: 10 616/ 45 000/ 93 000
Using the USA population estimate of 276 000 000 (2002 data) and an estimated
incidence rate of reported hepatitis A cases of 10 per 100 000 population
[from the "Pink Book"], the estimated number of reported cases for 2002 is 27
600. This estimated number of reported cases (27 600) is much higher than
one might expect based on the trend data shown in the table above, where the
number of reported hepatitis cases was 17 047, 13 397, and 10 616 in 1999,
2000, and 2001 respectively. The "Pink Book" (Epidemiology and Prevention of
Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, 2003) estimated incidence rate for reported
Hepatitis A (10 per 100 000 population) was based on a 10-year average for
the period 1987 through 1997, and therefore the marked reductions in annual
incidence of reported cases that continued in the post-1997 period are not
reflected -- leading to a probable overestimation of the number of expected
reported cases of [and total infections with] Hepatitis A. - Mod.MPP]
