Hepatitis E, a water-borne disease, is gradually becoming a scare in
Jaipur. But, if the disease is spreading in the city, blame it on
40-year-old sewerage pipelines, which contaminate drinking water.
Experts said that around 60-65 percent youths are carriers of
hepatitis E virus in the city and that one of the major reasons for
the spread of the disease is the contaminated [drinking] water
supplied through the pipeline. Also, pregnant women are easily
infected with the disease.

The former head of the department of gastroenterology at the Sawai
Man Singh Hospital and former president of the Indian Society of
Gastroenterology, Dr Ramesh Roop Rai, said: "In Jaipur, the number of
hepatitis E patients [is] increasing and the reason could be water
contamination. Due to erosion in the water pipelines, sewer water
enters the [fresh] water pipelines, which is why infected water enters
every house."

Explaining the contamination process, the expert said that through a
combination of old sewer pipelines, which are laid down [alongside]
water pipelines, overflow of the sewer lines, and breakage in the
drinking water pipelines, the drinking water gets mixed and is then
supplied to the houses. Many reports in the newspapers have already
been published about water contamination.

Out of every 100 adults infected with the disease, 95 of them develop
encephalopathy, after which the patients become unconscious and
critical. Doctors claimed that the disease does not have a high
mortality rate. "Out of 1000 persons infected, only one could [die]
due to hepatitis E [virus infection], but it makes a bad impact on the
body," Rai said.

In Sawai Man Singh Hospital, around 8-10 patients with hepatitis E
come in for treatment every now and then. SMS medical college
principal and gastroenterologist Subhash Nepalia said: "Around 10
patients, mostly pregnant woman, with hepatitis E come to the hospital
for treatment regularly. The disease takes a fecal-oral transmission
route. So, it spreads through contaminated food and water."

Another gastroenterologist, C S Sharma, said the disease has become
common like hepatitis A. "Both hepatitis A and hepatitis E have become
common now. But, hepatitis A has a vaccine, which is administered to
children 10 years after birth. But there is no vaccine for hepatitis E
so far. Mostly, within 45 days, a patient recovers from the disease,
but there are chances that the case could become complicated, and the
patient dies," Sharma said.

Reacting on the project of replacing old sewer pipelines in the old
Walled City area, a senior JMC official said: "Since the project is
worth more than Rs 300 crore [USD 300 million], a proposal has been
sent to the state government for financial assistance. The state
government has also sent it to the Centre to seek funds under the
Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission. But, the state has not
received the funds yet. The project has been pending for more than 3
years."

[Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route.
Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food
supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of
faecally contaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and
the ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of
sporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic
spread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,
sheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk
factors for hepatitis E virus infection are related poor sanitation in
large areas of the world, and shedding in faeces. Person-to-person
transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for sexual transmission
or for transmission by transfusion.

The highest rates of infection occur in regions where low standards
of sanitation promote the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of
hepatitis E have been reported in Central and South-East Asia, North
and West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal contamination
of drinking water is common. According to the Gideon database, around
2 million cases per year are estimated to occur nationwide in India.

In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed
by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual, and
chronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of
hepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates
ranging between 0.5-4.0 percent. Fulminate hepatitis occurs more
frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate of 20
percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester.

Hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis.
Symptomatic HEV infection is most common in young adults aged 15-40
years. Although HEV infection is frequent in children, it is mostly
asymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice
(anicteric) that goes undiagnosed. Typical signs and symptoms of
hepatitis include jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and
sclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale stools), anorexia (loss of
appetite), an enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain
and tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and fever, although the disease
may range in severity from subclinical to fulminant. Further
information can be obtained from the WHO website at:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html.

Certain features of the description of the outbreak in Jaipur are not
typical of hepatitis E virus infection, namely the 60-65 percent
carriage rate and the 95 percent encephalopathy rate. It is likely
that other agents or factors are involved in this outbreak of
water-borne disease.

Jaipur is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of
Rajasthan. The city has a population of more than 3.9 million. The
location of Jaipur is shown in the map of Rajasthan at:
