[The current immediate notification of hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) in bovines is the 1st official report of the disease since the establishment of the State of Israel (1948).

HS was common in the said north eastern region during the first half of the 20th century among the water buffaloes population maintained in the marshes around Lake Hula (Huleh) and on the north eastern shores of the Sea of Tiberias, namely the Bteihah marshes (for a map dated to the said period, see http://tinyurl.com/js29fu8). The disease was declared reportable. In 1942 the bacterium caused a major epizootic, killing about 1000 head out of about 6300 susceptible animals. This outbreak was controlled by the application of a killed homologous vaccine prepared by the veterinary laboratory (of the then ruling British Mandatory Government of Palestine). Annual revaccinations followed.

After the establishment of the State of Israel, in 1948, drainage of the Hula swamps started, accomplished in 1958 when most of the Hula Lake itself was also drained. This was followed by a severe reduction in the size of the local water-buffalo population. Since then, HS has not been recorded in Israel until 2016. While in Israel's' annual OIE report for 2015, HS was included among the diseases "absent" ("last event, 1948"), according to the 2016 report, HS is "suspected but not confirmed and limited to one or more zones".

Probably, the current cases relate to grazing beef cattle. Confirmation (or otherwise) and additional epidemiological information is anticipated. - Mod.AS
