DENGUE - SINGAPORE: MOSQUITO BREEDING PLACES

Mosquitoes that bred in bamboo-pole holders were responsible for two
separate dengue outbreaks last year in Chai Chee and Marine Parade, the
Environment Ministry said yesterday. Rainwater accumulates in the holders,
which are used to support the bamboo poles residents hang their clothes on.
This attracts mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ sp that transmit dengue [viruses].
Sixty-three people fell ill in those two outbreaks. The first happened in
the Chai Chee HDB estate. It lasted from June 28 to Sept 13 and hit 29
people. In the second, 34 people fell ill in Marine Parade. The outbreak
lasted from Sept 17 to Nov 7. In 55% of the cases, bamboo-pole holders were
the breeding places -- 117 were found in the Chai Chee outbreak, and 137 in
the one in Marine Parade.
Worse still, the overall likelihood of these holders becoming breeding
places for outbreaks in high-rise areas more than doubled from 11% in 1998
to nearly 29%, last year. Such holders ought to be capped when not in use,
but few householders bother.
People should also remove stagnant water from pots, pot plates, roof
gutters, drains, floors, pails and watering cans, to keep them from
becoming breeding havens for _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

[We post this as a reminder that essentially any object that can serve as a
water container can therefore serve as a breeding place for _Aedes_ sp. and
other mosquitoes. Any container means ANY container. The little buggers are
very adaptive. Discarded auto/truck tires, flower pots at cemeteries and
elsewhere, hub caps, halved coconut shells, bird baths -- you name it. -
