The name of the parasite responsible for PGD or Hamburger Gill is:
_Aurantiactinomyxon_ sp. (Actinosporea: Triactinomyxidae). While the
taxonomy is complex and unresolved they fall in the same general
group as the parasites responsible for Whirling Disease of salmonids.
The whole group is fascinating. There has been work conducted on
sequencing the variety of Actinosporeans found associated with _Dero
digitada_ [the worm vector] and catfish ponds.
Additional references on the catfish Actinosporeans may be found in:
Pote and Waterstrat 1993, Journal of Aquatic Animal Health 5:213-218;
Bellurud and Pote et al. 1992, Proceedings of Eastern Fish Health and
American Fisheries Society; Fish Health Workshop, June 1993.
A contact for sequencing studies would be:
Dr. Larry Hanson, College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State
University, MS 39762, USA, tel: 601-325-1202
Contact for efforts on PGD control would be:
Dr. David Wise, Delta Research and Extension Center PO Box 197,
Stoneville, MS 38776, USA.
