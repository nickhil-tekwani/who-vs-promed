[The following report is thanks to Dr. Louise Martin, DVM, and Dr. Doug
Klaucke, MD, Acting WHO Representative in Nairobi, who corrected and
updated (Thu, 01 Jan 1998 13:06:02 +0300) my original draft of Dr. Martin's
Monday conversation with me. You cannot get closer to the horse's mouth
than this and we at ProMED-mail greatly appreciate their sharing this
information. We look forward to updates. Dr. Martin is presently on her
way back to Garissa. - Mod.MHJ
On Monday (12-29-97), I spoke by telephone with my ex-student Dr. Louise
Martin, who is in Garissa. She is the only veterinarian with the
international team there and the only vet in the region known to be working
on this outbreak.
On the animal side, thousands of livestock - cattle but especially sheep
and goats - are dying or dead. Martin estimates the livestock mortality
rate to be 50% to 75% in the area. The animals show a fever, with or
without constipation, passing to diarrhea and snotty noses with or without
blood, and then a terminal diarrhea (also with or without blood). There is
a "viral soup" of conditions there, with a wide variety of conditions, some
very suggestive of FMD (foot lesions but as yet she has seen no mouth
lesions), foot rot, pleuropneumonia, you-name-it. The area has been
without veterinary coverage for some time apparently due to severe
flooding. Many of the dying and dead stock are being butchered and eaten.
She has examined a 14 year-old girl who had just been taught how to butcher
goats and who had fluid and pus-filled vesicular lesions on her hands, and
lymphadenitis of axillary nodes. A frequently volunteered comment by the
meat consumers is that the cooked meat is tasteless and soft like
"over-ripe fruit", this is characteristic of high lactic acid levels.
[Historically, this affected area is close to one of the areas where
Rinderpest was not eradicated in the previous African campaign of the '60s
& '70s. MHJ
They have confirmed over 300 human deaths to date. Most died within 3-4
days, some within 12 hours, of falling ill. The condition
characteristically starts with a high fever, bad headache, adbominal pain,
passing to vomiting and diarrhea. If they vomit blood it is a lethal
prognosis, passing to epistaxis, shock, and death. Because this area is
affected by undernutrition, unclean drinking water, multiple diseases and
limited health services it is difficult to estimate the number of non-fatal
cases that may be occurring so an accurate estimate of the case fatality
rate is not possible. So far they have only got to some 12-15 villages,
but there has been a stream of people sent from further villages in
attempts to get help. One very ill small boy who had been vomiting blood
was treated with penicillin and is now sitting up in bed. The medical
facilities there are less than minimal, compounded by the two months nurses
strike. Treatment seems to be limited at this time to chloroquine and
penicillin.
While the national government initially claimed that the "bleeding disease"
is due to malaria (and there are plenty of mosquitoes and malaria), of the
22 samples checked in Nairobi for clinical malaria, none were positive.
But this disease along with many others will be present in this area where
there is extensive and widespread malnutrition. There is cholera in the
same general area. Initial results of testing the [21 human serum samples
at the National Institute of Virology in South Africa found no evidence of
Ebola, Marburg, Chikungunya, Sindbis, West Nile Fever, dengue, tick-borne
encephalitis complex, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and
hantaviruses. Sera tested at the Kenya Medical Research Institute in
Nairobi were negative for yellow fever. Testing for anthrax and Rift
Valley fever are not yet complete. There were three sera positive for IgG
to _B. anthracis_ and one possibly positive for [PA antigen. Four of 22
sera were positive by PCR for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) RNA. Three of
these four were negative for IgM antibodies to RVFV antigens, so
confirmatory tests are being done.
On the Somali side of the border the disease situation is very similar.
Case finding there has been made harder by the Muslim need to bury corpses
expeditiously.
The single telephone line is in to the International Red Cross compound.
The health team of some 8 individuals is made up of the Provincial medical
health staff, WHO, AMREF, Medicines sans Frontieres, International Red
Cross, and Medicines du Monde. The Kenya army fled. Local transport to
check villages is through the Rural Food Program vehicles. The tracks are
soft, deep mud. Thanks to the rains some villages when reached are found
to have been abandoned. There is one helicopter, and banditry. Thanks to
the national election (29-30 December) and the holiday season (25 December
through 30 December were all national holidays), it has been difficult to
mobilize national government support. All ministers were running for
re-election and the country is between governments.
The investigation is expected to continue to confirm the diagnosis [or
diagnoses, to obtain a better estimate of the magnitude of the problem,
and to determine whether it is spreading. Prevention and treatment measures
are also being planned.
