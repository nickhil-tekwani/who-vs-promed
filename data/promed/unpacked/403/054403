An outbreak of the highly contagious equine disease strangles has been confirmed in south east Cornwall. The Bodmin Moor Commoners and the Association of Bodmin Moor Commons Landowners said on Wednesday a total of 3 moorland ponies in the Minions area had been confirmed with the infection.

Julie Dowton, secretary of the Bodmin Moor Commoners and the Association of Bodmin Moor Commons Landowners, said: "We want to alert the public to this and we must do all we can to stop it spreading across the rest of Bodmin Moor. It is important that people do not touch the ponies. We are also working with Redwings Horse Sanctuary who have advice for pony owners."

Strangles is a highly contagious infection of the upper tract -- mainly the nose and throat. It can be passed on through direct contact with an infected horse or indirectly through sharing water, feed buckets, equipment, pasture, cars travelling from one site to another or a human passing the bacteria on their clothing or skin.

Early symptoms include:
- sore throat - shown by loss of appetite, difficulty eating or difficulty extending the head;
- lymph node swelling (area where head and neck join);
- depression;
- fever (temperature above 38.5C);
- a cough.

It normally takes between 7 and 14 days between contact with the bacteria and symptoms showing, although owners are warned that not all
horses will show all or any of these signs.

A spokesperson for Callington Police urged horse riders in the area to take precautions: "Horse riders are advised not to let horses drink water on the moor or come into contact with other horses. Reconsider your ride."

A spokesperson from Redwings Horse Sanctuary added: "We are aware that 3 confirmed cases of strangles have been identified in the Minions area of Bodmin Moor. We are encouraging calm among owners of horses on the moor and surrounding areas, but we would ask everyone to be vigilant and take reasonable precautions to help prevent any spread of the disease. It is also vital to call a vet if you think your horse or pony may be showing symptoms.

"Strangles is spread through contact with infected mucus, either directly between horses or indirectly with contaminated objects such as water containers. It is not an airborne disease. It is not infectious to humans or other animals, however there have been very rare cases documented in dogs. Although dogs cannot act as carriers they can physically spread the disease via their bodies (for example, their paws) so dog walkers are urged to be vigilant and heed any warning notices."
