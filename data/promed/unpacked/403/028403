North Korean authorities are currently taking steps to blockade those
regions where scarlet fever has broken out.
A laborer at a military base in Chongjin, Hamkyung Province relayed
by phone to the Daily NK on 14 Dec 2006 that the spread of scarlet
fever in the large cities on the east coast of North Korea has become
quite severe and that neither merchants nor people traveling for
personal reasons were allowed to enter or leave the area.
He also said that disease is spreading in Wonsan in Kangwon Province,
Hamhueng in South Hamkyung Province, Shinpo, Danchoen, Kilju in North
Hamkyung Province, including Haesan in Yangkang Province, the north
and almost all of the eastern regions, and that it has also recently
broken out in Hoeryong in North Hamkyung Province.
According to Chong, the authorities have no countermeasures in
response to scarlet fever other than to separate the patients from
the general public. He also said that a few days ago, he had traveled
to the Hamhung and Danchoen areas with a military travel pass and
that kindergarten and elementary school classes were suspended until
20 Dec 2006. He relayed that hospitals are already overflowing with
patients and many patients are now being treated at home.
Chong said that with the exception of the military, and people
conducting business related to the military, travel is restricted for
all citizens. As the infection spreads on the east coast, the railway
stations in the large cities are blockaded, and trains that are
passing through do not open the doors to the platform. Chong also
relayed that people who entered these areas where scarlet fever has
spread before the current travel restrictions were in effect cannot
now leave and are raising quite a clamor over it. He added that the
restrictions were to be in effect until 20 Dec 2006; however, they
could be extended.
When it gets past mid December in North Korea, severe cold weather
will start. North Korean authorities are hoping that spread of the
disease will diminish with the cold weather.

[This information is from 3 weeks ago, and it is not clear whether
the outbreak of this group A streptococcal disease is still
spreading. No absolute number of cases is reported, and no mortality
figures are given.
Ryanggang province in the northwest part of the country bordering on
China is where the outbreak reportedly began. A map of North Korea
showing the provinces can be found at:
