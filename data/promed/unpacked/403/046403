At least 25 people, including 6 women and a child, have fallen ill
with suspected anthrax contracted from dead animals in Orissa's
Sundergarh district, health official said Friday [30 Jul 2010]

The people found with the infection are residents of Dukatola village
and its nearby hamlets, some 500 km [310 mi] from state capital
Bhubaneswar, chief district medical officer Bikrant Kindo told IANS.
'All of them are responding to treatment and recovering,' he said.

About 2 days ago 2 residents of the area came to the hospital with
anthrax symptoms. 'We sent health officials to the area and found more
people having the similar symptoms,' he said. Health officials
including doctors are camping [staying] in the area and treating the
patients at their homes, he said.

Blood samples of at least 5 patients were sent Friday [30 Jul 2010] to
the Veer Surendra Sai (VSS) Medical college and Hospital at Burla in
Sambalpur district, Kindo said.

Dukatola village and its nearby hamlets have a population of about 500
and most of them belong to Oraon tribe. Kindo said the villagers told
them they had consumed the meat of dead animals recently.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease that mostly affects animals and spreads
to humans through consumption of contaminated meat. Kindo said the
district has a history of anthrax infections.

[One of the problems with diagnosing anthrax in humans is the speed
with which they start self-treating with antibiotics. This can make it
next to impossible to culture anything as the vegetative cells of
_Bacillus anthracis_ are normally very sensitive to antibiotics.
Orissa has long been plagued with this disease -- see refs. below. -
