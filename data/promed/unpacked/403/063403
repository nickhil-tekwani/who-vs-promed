Public Health England (PHE) confirms an individual has been diagnosed with monkeypox [MPX] in England.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people, and the risk to the general public in England is very low. It is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.

The patient is believed to have contracted the infection while visiting Nigeria.

The patient was staying in southwest England prior to transfer to the specialist high-consequence infectious disease centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, where [the patient is] receiving appropriate care.

As a precautionary measure, PHE experts are working closely with NHS colleagues to implement rapid infection-control procedures, including contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice. This includes contacting passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. If passengers are not contacted, then there is no action they should take.

Dr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at Public Health England, said: "Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the general public is very low. We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary."

PHE and the NHS have well-established and robust infection-control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.

This is not the 1st time that the virus has been detected in the UK. PHE reported the 1st UK cases of monkeypox in September 2018.

Background
Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. In most cases, monkeypox is a mild condition that will resolve on its own and has no long-term effects on a person's health. Most people recover within a few weeks [see comment below].

Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

[Sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2019), so it is not surprising if the individual became infected there and traveled to England during the incubation period. The USA CDC states that the incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7-14 days but can range from 5-21 days, allowing adequate time for travel prior to the appearance of symptoms (see https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html). There is no mention in the above report if the individual acquired the MPX infection from wildlife hosts or from contact with infected people. There is no mention above of the current condition of the patient. The health authorities in England are prudent to track individuals who had been in contact with the patient. Consideration of vaccination of contact individuals with the new MPX/smallpox vaccine, especially those providing care of this patient, in this type of situation may be a useful approach to prevent person-to-person transmission.

Prevention of MPX virus infections in the endemic countries in West and Central Africa will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is low.
