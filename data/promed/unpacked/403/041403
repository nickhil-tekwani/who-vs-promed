I would like to supplement on the referred post on the possibility of circulation of more serotypes of BTV in the endemic areas.

Our observations in India, 1 of the BTV endemic countries, indicate that 1-4 serotypes of BTV circulate in a flock during an outbreak and it is not uncommon to isolate more than one serotype from a single animal.

Although, the serotypes 3, 14, 18, 19, 22 are being reported for the first time from Brazil, they are reported to be circulating in Americas. In fact, most of the classical serotypes of BTV (1-24) are reported to be circulating in Americas. Apart from the eastern serotypes of BTV (BTV15, 16, 20, 21, and 23) that are limited to Australasia (eastern viruses), BTV-7 is the only exception of western serotypes not reported from Americas.

Similar to other insect borne viruses, BTV is endemic in tropical and subtropical (Source areas) with incursions into parts of temperate areas adjacent to tropical areas during insect seasons. If we assume that most of the non endemic serotypes identified in USA (BTV 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 19, 22 and 24) are incursions from tropical areas (source areas), it is not surprising to find those serotypes in Brazil.
To conclude, all the serotypes identified in Brazil are reported to be circulating in Americas. The reported outbreaks are from a tropical area ie., a potential endemic area for BT. With our experience in southern parts of India, I feel isolation of 3 serotypes of BTV in 1 year (2015) and 2 in the following year (2016) from a small geographical area or a flock in a tropical endemic area is not unlikely.

[Special thanks to the clarification made by Pandumaga Rao. It would be interesting to know the ecological mechanisms underlying the concurrent occurrence of so many different serotypes in such a small group of animals. - Mod.PMB
