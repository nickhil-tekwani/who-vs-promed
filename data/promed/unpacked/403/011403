[1] Cholera - Sudan

The total number of reported cases of 'acute watery diarrhea' [AWD] across 18 states of Sudan has reached over 35 000 people -- including 800 related deaths since August 2016 -- according to the latest update from the WHO and the Sudanese Ministry of Health. "The outbreak is affecting all demographics, with females constituting 54 percent of the cases and children below 5 years of age accounting for 8 percent," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest bi-weekly bulletin. Acute watery diarrhea (AWD) is the term the Sudanese government and international humanitarian organisations active in Sudan, have referred to.

The bulletin continues that "active transmission of AWD is ongoing in all 18 states of Sudan with the exception of West Kordofan and Northern states, where the last reported cases were on 13 Aug 2017 and 12 Sep 2017, respectively.

"The source of infection is believed to be contaminated open water sources combined with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. The report indicated that the case fatality ratio, which peaked [at the end of August 2017] at 4.75 percent, has come down to 1.53 percent."

Sudan's first cases of cholera were recorded in Blue Nile state in August 2016. Since then, the disease spread in eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira. In April 2017, sources in White Nile state reported a rapid spread of cholera. The disease then spread to North Kordofan, and fully hit Khartoum in May 2017. Throughout Sudan medical sources and people who have volunteered in campaigns to combat the spread of cholera regularly report on the number of cholera victims in specific areas.

Human rights and civil society advocates, organisations, and activists have written in a letter to the WHO to quickly intervene and effectively address the cholera epidemic in Sudan after Khartoum would declare the existence of cholera in the country. The organisation has not replied to Radio Dabanga's repeated requests to elaborate on this position.

The WHO, as well as the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) are responding to the 'acute watery diarrhea' disease by establishing health facilities in a number of Sudan's affected states, and training medical staff, a recent humanitarian news bulletin reported.

[In some countries in east Africa, acute watery diarrhea is used as a euphemism for cholera.

The Sudan or Sudan, also known as North Sudan since South Sudan's independence and officially the Republic of the Sudan, is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. It is the 3rd largest country in Africa and can found on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Lusaka)

The number of cholera cases in Lusaka, where one death has so far been reported in the recent outbreak, has reached 69, with the source of the outbreak being attributed to contaminated water. Kanyama cholera treatment centre has the highest number of cholera patients standing at 25.

Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary for administration Kennedy Malama said the number had shot up from 37 previously reported on 12 Oct 2017. "Yes, the number of patients has increased, but in terms of their condition, we are describing all of them as being stable. The update as of today [15 Oct 2017] is that on our line-list, we have a total of 69 cholera patients," he told journalists after tour of Bauleni and Kanyama Cholera treatment centres. Dr Malama said about 70 percent of the cholera patients were children under the age of 5. At Kanyama cholera treatment centre, there were 25 patients undergoing treatment while at Bauleni clinic only 1 patient was admitted.

Dr Malama, however, said from yesterday's [15 Oct 2017] treatment of the patients, there was significant improvement as all of them were in a stable condition, citing the children who were able to suck from their mothers, which was a positive gesture. Dr Malama was confident that from the intensified treatments by health workers, the majority of patients could be discharged soon.

On its part, the Ministry of Health would continue with health promotions and distribution of chlorine for chlorination of drinking water. Dr Malama advised people to take precautions such using chlorine or boiling water for drinking to reduce the risk of cholera breaking out.

He hailed stakeholders working closely with the ministry to fight cholera, but called for provision of more assistance citing chlorine.

One death, of a 3-month-old baby, has been reported so far.

In 2016, 1170 cumulative cases of cholera were reported in Zambia of which 192 were laboratory-confirmed with 31 deaths reported.

[3] Cholera - Angola (Zaire)

According to information from the health authorities of Zaire, of the more than 60 islands inhabited in the province, of a total of 120, most are affected by the outbreak of cholera that has killed at least 15 people out of 214 registered cases.

The lack of clean water on the islands and poor housing conditions are pointed out by the health authorities of the province of Zaire as the causes of the outbreak, so last week campaigned for mobilization and awareness, and distributed filters to purify water.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
