[The 1st cases of A/H7N9 infection in humans were reported in Central China's Henan province on Sun 14 Apr 2013. This is the 1st report on H7N9 in animals in Henan. Again, humans were the sentinels for (subclinical) infection in animals.

China's submission to the OIE of follow-up report No 5 just 2 days after the submission of follow-up report No 4 reflects the importance rendered by the Chinese Veterinary Services to the issue and their concern about the continued need for information on the animal source of H7N9 infection in humans.

As of 23 Apr 2013, China has confirmed 108 cases of H7N9 avian influenza in humans, including 22 deaths. The only case added today (24 Apr 2013) was a Taiwanese man who returned to Taiwan on 9 Apr 2013, showed symptoms after arrival, and has now been found positive; he is believed to have been infected in Suzhou City, Jiangsu province, where he had stayed since 28 Mar 2013.

The 108 confirmed cases in mainland China have been identified in the following territories (in brackets, their numbers): Beijing (1), Shanghai (33), Jiangsu province (24), Zhejiang (42), Anhui (4), Henan (3), Shandong (1).

Compared to the number of A/H7N9 cases confirmed in humans, the number of virus detections in animals is surprisingly low: so far, 15 "outbreaks" (locations where samples were positive) have been reported in the following submitted OIE reports:

1. Immediate notification, 4 Apr 2013 (1 outbreak): one wholesale market, Shanghai, in which there were one infected pigeon for consumption, 7 samples from chickens, and one sample from the environment; a total of 9 samples.

2. Follow-up report no. 1, 5 Apr 2013 (2 outbreaks): 2 live markets, Shanghai; 3 samples from chickens, 2 samples from pigeons, and 5 samples from the environment; total 10 samples.

3. Follow-up report no. 2, 10 Apr 2013 (5 outbreaks): 5 live markets (3 in Jiangsu, 1 Anhui, 1 Zhejiang); 11 samples from chickens, 3 samples from ducks; total 14 samples.

4. Follow-up report no. 3, 16 Apr 2013 (3 outbreaks): 2 live markets in Zhejiang (4 chickens), one location in Jiangsu (1 wild pigeon); total 5 samples.

5. Follow-up report no. 4, 22 Apr 2013 (1 outbreak): one farm in Jiangsu, one sample from a pigeon (340 "birds" destroyed).

6. Follow-up report no. 5. 24 Apr 2013 (3 outbreaks): 2 live markets in Henan ("environmental samples"), one unspecified, named location in Zhejiang (one case in a "bird").

A summary OIE report showing all 15 outbreaks (36 cases) submitted since 4 Apr 2013 and a summarising map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013297_20130424_165223.pdf. - Mod.AS]

Scientists have found that the H7N9 flu virus in humans has a similar gene sequence to that of H7N9 found in live poultry, the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) said Tuesday [23 Apr 2013].

Studies were carried out by CAAS Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and found that the H7N9 flu virus is a combination of genes from various viruses, a CAAS statement said. In the H7N9 flu virus, 6 of its inner genes are from the H9N2 bird flu virus, but origins of both its hemagglutinin (HA) gene and neuraminidase (NA) gene are not clear, the statement said.

Chen Hualan and Li Chengjun, researchers with the institute, headed the study. They collected 970 samples from live poultry markets and farms in Shanghai and Anhui. 20 of the samples from the markets were positive, and all samples from poultry farms were negative. Further work should be carried out to detect H7N9 bird flu virus to explore its sources and transmission channels, Chen said.

The research was published in the latest English version of Chinese Science Bulletin, which is sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

[The absence of positive samples from the large number of poultry farms addressed by the Harbin institute, compared to findings in live markets, has already been reported in previous postings. In fact, the only commercial farm with a positive sample, so far, was reported in OIE's follow-up report No 4. This was a pigeon farm in Jiangsu, the same province where a wild pigeon was found infected earlier.

Information about the precise nature of "environmental" (positive) samples from live markets is still pending. Could they be related to pigeons as well?

In this respect, it may be appropriate to repeat our pending RFI from posting 20130417.1652959:

"Pigeons are often found in the surroundings of human dwellings or make part of urban fauna, even if seen/reported as "wild" (pigeons kept for consumption are defined as "poultry"). According to China's follow-up report no 3 to the OIE, the "wild" pigeon was sampled in Nanjing. No positive cases in "poultry" have been reported from Nanjing; on the other hand, 5 human cases have been reported there: one on 2 Apr 2013, 2 cases on 5 Apr 2013, and 2 on 14 Apr 2013.

"Interestingly, the very 1st animal (bird) which, reportedly, was found infected by the new, zoonotic LPAI H7N9 virus strain during the emerging epidemic in eastern China, was a "pigeon for consumption".

"To assess the significance of these findings, denominator data are needed. Which animal species have been sampled in each location so far; what were their respective numbers, and what were their tests results?"

Subscribers are also referred to Mod.JW's comment in posting 20130423.1667644, referring to the surprisingly high percentage of elderly males among China's H7N9 patients:

"A wild pigeon has been found to be H7N9 positive, see ProMED archive 20130417.1652959. If elderly Chinese men spend more time in parks than women, they would be more exposed to infection from pigeons, from feather dust when they flap up from the ground and from their excreta; see illustration at http://tinyurl.com/cl8yf9d."

The mentioned requested data from the Harbin Institute and from the other diagnostic and research institutions in China are anticipated with interest and concern. - Mod.AS]

[Another question arising from the OIE reports is: What is the nature of the "Control of wildlife reservoirs" mentioned? - Mod.JW
