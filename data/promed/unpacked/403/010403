[The above chronologically presented 6 samples were collected between
30 Apr and 30 May 2011 from 4 cattle and 2 sheep units. As apparent
from the dendogram appended to the report, the 5 samples No 2-6 (Ref
No: ISR/5/2011 to ISR/9/2011, collected between 9 - 30 May 2011)
belong to one cluster, while sample No 1 (Ref No: ISR/4/2011,
collected on 30 Apr 2011 from beef cattle in Yavneel) belongs to a
separate cluster, together with samples ISR/1/2011 and ISR/2/2011,
both collected 10-11 Mar 2011 from cattle in Bet-Zera. These samples
were addressed in WERLFMD Genotyping Report of 31 Mar 2011, batch
WRLFMD/2011/00016, discussed in (archived) 20110404.1044; the full
WRLFMD report is available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00016%20O%20Israel%202011.pdf.

These results may be interpreted as presenting 2 separate
introductions of the virus into Israel, one -- most probably -- from
Jordan, the other one from Lebanon, but a Syrian origin could not be
excluded (consult a political map).

Following the absence of FMD serotype O in Israel since Feb 2008, the
1st FMDV-O cluster was initially confirmed in Kibbutz Bet-Zera on 10
Mar 2011 in 10-months-old fattening calves. Date of start was,
reportedly, 1 Mar 2011. Bet-Zera is situated 3 km [1.6 miles] from the
Jordanian border. The other outbreak belonging to the same cluster, in
Yavneel, was suspected in grazing beef cattle on 21 Apr 2011.
Detection of FMD in animals on pasture is liable to delay, compared to
housed animals; the start of this outbreak may thus have taken place
earlier. Yavneel is 6.5 km [4 miles] distant from Bet Zera (Section 3
of the interactive map at
http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html, south-west to
the Sea of Galilee; Bet Zera at x=388, y=515; Yavneel at x=316,
y=494).

The other cluster seems to have started in mid-April, initially
affecting fattening calves in Kibbutz Snir (Senir), 3 km from the
Lebanese border (more than 60 km [37.2 miles] north of
Bet-Zera/Yavneel). Similarly to Bet Zera, Senir is situated in an area
where abundant wild boar population is present on both sides of the
(double-fenced) border. The Senir farm had suffered FMD outbreaks
several times in the past, including December 2005 (ProMED-mail
archive no. 20051228.3691) and January 2008 (archive no. 20080203.0436). Remarkably, this highly invasive strain spread widely,
reaching Hadarom (south) district (sheep near Be'eri) and the West
Bank (see item 2). Both clusters demonstrate a high identity rate,
exceeding 98 percent, with the reference strain 'O/IRN/88/2009'; see
also the dendogram.

FMDV serotype O, topotype Middle-East South Asia (ME-SA),
genotype/strain: PanAsia, sub-lineage O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 ANT-10, is
known to be circulating in vast areas of the Near East, from Iran in
the east to Bulgaria in the west. In order to try control the spread
of this virus strain, updated information from all regional countries
is urgently required. - Mod.AS]

New FMD outbreaks
-----------------
1. Circular 16/2011/FMD: A new outbreak, in fattening calves in
Kibbuts Lehavot Habashan, Upper Galilee, Hazafon district (map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Lahavot_HaBashan.html).
Confirmed by virus isolation, not yet serotyped.
2. Circular 17/2011/FMD: A new outbreak, affecting cattle in Moshav
Devora (Valley of Yizreel, Hazafon district, map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Devora.html). Provisionally
confirmed by ELISA, no isolate yet but typical clinical signs in
calves.
In both cases, the respective declarations in 3- and 10-km zones
published and all other required control measures applied.
3. In a separate circular of 14 Jul 2011, the Director Field
Veterinary Services informed practitioners, official veterinarians and
other relevant parties about a lab confirmed FMD outbreak affecting
(probably unvaccinated) cattle within the territory administered by
the Palestinian Authority in the town Tul Karm (map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/WE/00/Tulkarm.html. FMDV has been
isolated by the Kimron Veterinary Institute, serotyping not yet
accomplished.

[The 2 new outbreaks in northern Israel are to become Israel's 18th
and 19th since the start of the FMDV-O epizootic in March 2011.
Clearly, the highly invasive strain of sub-lineage 'O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2
ANT-10' has become widely spread, causing outbreaks wherever
susceptible animals, even in small number, are exposed, but so far not
affecting adult dairy cows. The description of Israel's situation,
included in the Royal Society Report "Infectious diseases in
livestock" of July 2002 (article 8.10, page 88), "Experience of
routine vaccination for FMD," remains -- so far -- valid:

"In countries where FMD is normally endemic, a primary aim of routine
vaccination is to reduce productivity losses, whether that be milk and
meat production in cattle or the death of piglets in pig production.
Thus, in South America, Africa and India vaccination focuses upon
cattle, while in South East Asia the focus is on pigs and cattle.

"In other countries the priorities are different. For example, in
Israel -- an advanced agricultural country that has to be on constant
alert for FMD, being located within a heavily infected region -- there
is routine annual vaccination of all cattle with a trivalent (O, A22,
Asia 1) vaccine and all sheep and goats with a monovalent type O
vaccine. As a result there has been no FMD on dairy farms in Israel
during the past 10 years. Although there have been outbreaks, most
have been in unvaccinated small ruminants". (See at
http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/000adobes/fmd/b495royalsocietyinquiry/idl_chap.pdf).


There are some changes though: firstly, the vaccination scheme of
sheep and goats has been modified to the use of a bivalent (O and A)
vaccine in these animals. Secondly, during the current epizootic most
of the outbreaks have affected cattle, mostly young fattening animals,
rather than sheep and in spite of their recorded vaccination and
revaccination history. In this respect, subscribers are referred to
the information provided by a Turkish expert during a recent FAO
workshop (edited):

"In March 2010, the new sublineage type O panasia ANT10 was detected
by the Syrian border. 3 months later Pirbright revealed that ANT10 had
been circulating in Iran and maybe Pakistan/Afghanistan since 2009. By
Sept 2010 this strain was causing many outbreaks throughout Anatolia.
Outbreak investigation may have linked cases on the Iraq border to
animal movements from Iraq. By 13 Sep 2010 there had been 947
outbreaks, in the whole year (2010) there had been 1600 type O
outbreaks, with a tendency for severe disease and outbreaks in
vaccinated animals. GDPC [Turkey's General Directorate of Protection
and Control] thought more than 85 percent of the cattle were
vaccinated twice a year yet this epidemic still occurred."

Training Workshop on the analysis of Turkish and Iranian (GIS-VET)
FMD data. Ankara 14-18 March 2011
http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAInfo/commissions/docs/Workshop/Workshop_Ankara_march2011/report.pdf.

The current outbreak in Israel has become sizable, though larger
outbreaks have been experienced in the not too far past (e.g., 1994,
1996, 2007). Past experience allows a guarded prediction that the
epizootic may wane before October/November.

Various questions remain to be addressed. Quite clearly,
transboundary introduction has taken place; but how? airborne/fomites?
otherwise? Where (2 locations or more?), when? Are wild boars -- on
both sides of the border -- involved? if affirmed, what is the source
of their respective infection? how can the seasonality of FMD in
Israel be explained? Is the vaccine in use providing the expected
protection against the circulating virus lineage? Is biosecurity been
properly observed? And, on the scientific/research level: what has
made this particular strain so invasive?

These and additional questions await handling. Enhanced field and lab
activities, including serosurveillance in wildlife and small
ruminants, are prescribed; vaccine protection trials deserve
consideration.
