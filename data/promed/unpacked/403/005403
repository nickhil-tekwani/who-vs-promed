Corn insecticide linked to great die-off of beneficial honeybees
----------------------------------------------------------------
New research has linked springtime die-offs of honeybees critical for pollinating food crops -- part of the mysterious malady called colony collapse disorder -- with technology for planting corn coated with insecticides. The study, published in ACS' journal Environmental Science & Technology, appears on the eve of spring planting seasons in some parts of Europe where farmers use the technology and widespread deaths of honeybees have occurred in the past.

In the study, Andrea Tapparo and colleagues explain that seeds coated with so-called neonicotinoid insecticides went into wide use in Europe in the late 1990s. The insecticides are among the most widely used in the world, popular because they kill insects by paralyzing nerves but have lower toxicity for other animals. Almost immediately, beekeepers observed large die-offs of bees that seemed to coincide with mid-March to May corn planting. Scientists thought this might be due to particles of insecticide made airborne by the pneumatic drilling machines used for planting. These machines forcefully suck seeds in and expel a burst of air containing high concentrations of particles of the insecticide coating. In an effort to make the pneumatic drilling method safer, the scientists tested different types of insecticide coatings and seeding methods.

They found, however, that all of the variations in seed coatings and planting methods killed honeybees that flew through the emission cloud of the seeding machine. One machine modified with a deflector to send the insecticide-laced air downwards still caused the death of more than 200 bees foraging in the field. The authors suggest that future work on this problem should focus on a way to prevent the seeds from fragmenting inside the pneumatic drilling machines.

[This may have some effect on the disorder known as colony collapse disorder. It clearly seems to be causing death of nearby bees. But what about those not using a pneumatic drill to plant their seeds? Has the same effect been observed? If the insecticide dust can kill the bees, what about the effects if such plants are genetically engineered to allow certain herbicides (weed killers) to be sprayed on them but not harm them. Could that genetic encoding or insecticide coding be causing the death of the bees because it is translated up to the pollen that the bees gather?

While the article may elucidate a portion of the problem, it does not go far enough to answer other questions. - Mod.TG]
