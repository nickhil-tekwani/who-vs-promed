The number of bison dead from anthrax in northern Alberta has risen to 43.
Two more dead animals were found Saturday by using infrared scanners on a
helicopter, said park warden Doug Bergeson. The animals died at the same
time as the 41 dead bison already found, he said. Ground and aerial
searches will likely continue for a few more days, Bergeson added. The main
concern is that the highly infectious anthrax will spread via waterways in
the park. Most of the carcasses have been found near bodies of water.
The outbreak, about 180 kilometres south of Alberta's boundary with the
Northwest Territories, is the worst in Wood Buffalo National Park since
1991 when more than 30 bison died.
Parks officials have imposed a travel ban in the area to prevent hikers or
hunters from coming into contact with infected carcasses. Anthrax can be
contracted by humans if they ingest it, inhale it or take it in through
open wounds.

[While the last sentence is correct in some contexts, just standing by an
anthrax carcass presents few dangers other than from tabanid flies. Myself,
I prefer to stand upwind of carcasses.
I have been reliably informed that of the first 22 cases found, all but one
were bulls; the exception was a cow. This is normal in this wildlife
disease. Traditionally some 83% of all wood bison cases involve working
mature bulls, say over 7 years of age -- it is the start of the breeding
season and the hormones, stress, and lack of food greatly increase their
risk of being fatally infected.
During the 1991 outbreak they really only buried those carcasses that were
close to roads and tourist sites (e.g., high visibility). Many more
carcasses were left untouched. Carbyn et al. (1995) suggested the number of
bison killed in the '91 outbreak might have been as high as 300. It is
probable that at least one more outbreak occurred in the Park in the 90's
but was not publicly revealed. Certainly when the first carcasses were
found 2 weeks ago the Park authorities were very reluctant to talk about
it. The survey crew on the other hand was quite [disturbed, very keen on
sharing and [even demanded prophylactic antibiotics. - MHJ

Just a quick update on all that has happened in the Park this week. The
grand total of bison carcasses found stands at 44 plus 2 calves that died
of malnutrition. None of the recently found carcasses have been fresh but
surveillance flights will continue for the next week or so. All the
carcasses have been found in the same general area as before. No carcasses
have been found during surveillance flights of the Park Central, Lake One,
Hook Lake and Grand Detour areas and the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary which
were carried out during the week. [These are areas of past outbreaks.
_Bacillus anthracis_ was successfully isolated [at ADRI Lethbridge -- Well
done, Greg! from nasal and anal swabs taken from the black bear carcass
found amongst the bison carcasses. A second black bear carcass was found
Sunday 23 Jul 2000, 3 km northeast of a group of carcasses. [The second
bear was a female that had been dead for approximately 2-3 days. [There
were maggots in mouth and anus area, some bloating, and pressure build-up.
[The rectum was not prolapsed but was bulging at anus. [There was blood
in mouth and in anus, [but very little blood in circulatory system. Park
wardens collected samples taken from the mouth, anus, and nose and blood
from the carotid artery. The samples were shipped to Lethbridge on the 25
Jul 2000.
Starting on 25 Jul 2000 the park wardens have returned to each site to
confirm their latitudes and longitudes, and sunk a 10-inch iron spike in
the ground within 10 feet of the carcass.
