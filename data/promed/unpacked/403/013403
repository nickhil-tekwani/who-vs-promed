[1] Sudan: human disease in 3 states; public health response
Date: Thu 24 Oct 2019

https://www.africanews.com/2019/10/24/disease-outbreaks-in-sudan-dengue-fever-rift-valley-fever-and-chikungunya/


Over the past couple of months, Sudan has been facing numerous disease outbreaks including cholera, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), and chikungunya. Dengue fever, RVF, and chikungunya are vector-borne diseases, while cholera is waterborne. The increase of these outbreaks can be linked to the recent floods in the country that have left large pools of stagnant water, which are breeding sites for various types of vectors such as mosquitoes and houseflies. Government authorities and humanitarian partners are actively responding to these outbreaks across the country, providing health assistance, vaccinations where appropriate, and vector control interventions.

Rift Valley fever
---------------
There are 193 Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases -- including 4 deaths -- reported in Red Sea, River Nile, and Khartoum states since the onset of the disease on 28 Sept until 22 Oct 2019. The majority of cases (100) are in Red Sea. Of all cases reported, 94.8% have affected people over 5 years of age, and 83% are male.

Rift Valley fever response
--------------------------
Similar to the dengue response, SMoH activated response taskforce meetings and developed state-level preparedness and response plans. There has been a joint investigation by the SMoH, WHO, and the Ministry of Animal Resources (MoAR) in locations where the outbreak has occurred. Case definition and management training has been provided to 131 medical staff, and an isolation center has been established in Tagadom hospital in Red Sea state. In addition, 2200 mosquito nets have been distributed, 1330 homes have been inspected for breeding sites, and 3542 homes have been fogged in the state. Health promotion activities have been carried out at the household and community levels.

The major gaps and challenges faced are the limited number of partners involved in response activities, the need for better coordination between humanitarian partners and MoAR [Ministry of Agriculture], and the need to scale up activities in affected states. In addition, a more comprehensive plan needs to be developed between the government authorities and partners; more training in surveillance and case management is required; and social mobilization and vector control activities need to be intensified.

RVF is a viral disease that is spread either through the bite of an infected mosquito or by touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, or drinking raw milk from an infected animal. The disease is spread between cows, sheep, goats, and camels by mosquitoes. Infection does not appear to be transmitted from person to person.

Vaccinating animals against the disease before the outbreak occurs can prevent it from being transmitted to humans. Other methods include eradicating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding their bites. If an outbreak occurs, limiting the movement of animals will reduce the spread of the disease. As a result, the declaration of RVF can have an impact on international and domestic livestock economies. Saudi Arabia has announced a ban on importing livestock from Sudan in response to the announcement of World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) concerning documented cases of RVF.

Egypt has banned the import of cattle from Sudan after an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in eastern Sudan announced by the World Organization for Animal Health, the local press reports.

Rift Valley fever is a virus that affects both animals and humans that can cause significant economic harm if allowed to spread. Sudan's health minister said this week that authorities have detected 135 cases in areas near the Red Sea and north Darfur.

[A recent (2018) study addressed the risk of RVF introduction into and transmission within Egypt by camel imports from Sudan (Ref. 1). The results indicated that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of a large number of camels coming from Sudan. Their numbers were steadily increasing. During 2015 (last analysed year), it was about 18 000 per month. No seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported (in difference with cattle, which make a significantly smaller import slice, mainly concentrated in the Eid-el-Adha festivities season). Most of the camels arrived from western Sudan (where the current event is located) to Abu Simbel quarantine in south-central Egypt. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors (in Egypt being mainly _Culex pipiens_) is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile River, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination, or testing) seem, according to the study, to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction; the authors propose other (risk-based) surveillance strategies. - Mod.AS

[3] Egypt's alert, preventive measures, and applied coordination

Egypt and Saudi Arabia have raised their readiness to the maximum amid warnings of a threat from Sudan, amid pleas to protect the borders of the 2 countries significantly.

The Egyptian "Portal News" published a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, and the General Authority for Veterinary Services, [proclaiming] a state of extreme emergency amid suspicion of the disease Rift Valley fever in northeastern Sudan.

The website quoted Abdul Hakim Mahmoud, head of the General Authority for Veterinary Services, as saying, "The Authority is taking precautionary measures after the emergence of suspected cases of RVF."

The agency promptly took action to protect the country from the deadly disease by vaccinating vulnerable animals in border areas in the south of the country.

Mahmoud said, "Precautionary measures include restricting the movement of animals to and from the border provinces unless they [carry an ear tag with number] and [the consignment is] accompanied by a registration card where immunization against the disease [is testified]."

"Coordination is also taking place with the Ministry of Local Development to direct governors in border governorates to spray cars coming from Sudan and their animals," he added. "Quarantines in border governorates also operate 24 hours a day, and animals from them are checked."

Saudi Arabia has also announced a moratorium on livestock imports from Sudan, fearing that the RVF could spill into the kingdom.

The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture announced the suspension of the Kingdom's imports of live cattle from the Republic of Sudan, following the announcement of the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] [about] the emergence of cases of RVF in Sudan, in addition to the suspension of imports of live cattle from Djibouti Kingdom, which has been denied access to the Kingdom. [The main Saudi imports from Sudan involve sheep, not cattle; is there a translational error here? Is sheep import being continued? - Mod.AS]

In addition, the ministry explained that it has started coordination directly to assess the current situation inside the Kingdom with the Ministry of Health and the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control and with neighboring countries and continued coordination with the OIE.

For its part, Sudan, in remarks quoted by the Sudanese newspaper "Sayha," [claims that] all cattle returned by Saudi Arabia [are free] of Rift Valley fever. The Port Sudan Port Administration said that it has conducted comprehensive tests for all cattle that Saudi Arabia recently returned and confirmed that they are all free of diseases, and there were no cases.

The director of the port "Heydob," Mohamed Hassan Mokhtar, said, "Veterinary quarantines have done their part in the examination and review of livestock, and there was no case of animal disease. I declare that the veterinary quarantine is in the process of submitting the reports of doctors to the competent authorities."

Mokhtar attributed the causes of livestock deaths to hunger and lack of water for long periods of detention during the period of return to Sudan and called for lifting of the ban on the export of cattle for lack of reasons for non-export.

[Since early September 2019, there have been conflicting media reports from Sudan about the spatial dissemination of RVF, the date of the event's start, and the spectrum of the animal species involved. Earlier reports said that since early September 2019, undiagnosed fever disease cases in humans and cattle were reported from the states Red Sea and River Nile. According to the media, suspected cases in humans have been reported from additional states, namely the above-mentioned Khartoum as well as North Darfur and Kassala (20191006.6712623). No official confirmation of RVF, suspected in these locations, has become available.

In their immediate notification on RVF to the OIE, dated 13 Sep 2019, the Sudanese veterinary authorities claimed that "there were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019," "there is no cattle or sheep population in the area," and the outbreak occurred "in a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills." No follow-up report has been submitted since, nor official information on the animal disease situation in other locations/states from where human haemorrhagic disease has been reported.

Official information on RVF in Sudan is available on the website of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region, to which Sudan belongs (similarly to some other African countries such as Lybia, Egypt, and Somali). The table "Current outbreaks in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region" (at http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/outbreaks/index.html) includes the following updated information on notifiable diseases in Sudan, of which 3 are vectorborne:

Country / Diseases / Cases / Deaths / CFR (%) / Date of event
Sudan / cholera / 309 / 8 / 2.6% / August 2019
Sudan / chikungunya / 10 / 0 / - / September 2019
Sudan / dengue / 135 / 1 / 0.7% / August 2019
Sudan / Rift Valley fever / 76 / 2 / 2.6% / September 2019

Sudan is a major exporter of live animals, mainly sheep and goats. In 2017, this export's value was more than USD 476 million; most of the export is destined for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. There is also export of camels, most of them going on hoof to Egypt. In the past, both Saudia and Egypt have experienced outbreaks of RVF. While in Saudia, east African countries, in particular around the Horn of Africa, were the suspected origin of infection; in Egypt, the suspicion involved mainly camels from Sudan. Enhanced transparency and adequate pre-export measures, in line with OIE's requirements, may be helpful in minimizing the losses. - Mod.AS]

[The total number reported number of human cases since the outbreak began has been difficult to tally, since the cases have been widely scattered over 3 states. The above report does provide a total of 193 cases with 4 deaths. The ban of export of Sudanese livestock into Egypt will cause economic and social hardship for livestock owners in Sudan. In the absence of banks or similar institutions of financial support, livestock represent a kind of living bank account for their owners. Inability to export represents a loss of cash flow. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for keeping livestock in the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod.TY
