Salmonella Source in Finnish Feed Found
---------------------------------------
The source of the salmonella outbreak linked to a Raisio Feed mill has
been traced to a cooling system. The cause of the recent salmonella
outbreak that has hit Finnish pig and poultry farms has been found at
a factory of the feed producer, Raisio Feed, according to Helsingin
Sanomat. The salmonella bacteria that infected the feed produced at
the factory was pinpointed to the cooling system of the production line.

Raisio Feed has promised to bear full responsibility and compensate
for the damage caused. According to a statement put out by the
company, officials have not suggested that Raisio Feed had been
negligent or made mistakes. The soybeans brought to the factory from
abroad, which were used as raw material for the feed, had been found clean.

The cooling system had already been cleaned along with the rest of
the factory last week [23-27 Mar 2009]. Now technical improvements
are to be made. The company says that as a responsible player it
supports tighter control of imported raw materials, and control of
the processes from the factory all the way to the farm. While
consumers have not been in any danger at any stage of the outbreak,
the company has apologized to all who have been affected by the events.

On 25 March 2009, 4 more egg farms in Finland were found to have been
contaminated with salmonella, raising the total number to 27. In
addition, salmonella was found in 2 pig farms, making a total of 9 in
all that have been affected. Finland has a total of 1100 farms that
produce eggs, and 2500 farms specialized in raising pork. Samples of
a total of 800 egg farms and pig farms are to be analyzed in
connection with the salmonella epidemic. Some of the fecal samples
will be studied by the Finnish Food Safety Authority (EVIRA), and
some by local laboratories.

It takes at least a week from the initial taking of a sample before a
salmonella infection can be determined, continues the report in
Helsingin Sanomat. At present, 73 percent of egg farms have been
investigated, and 13 percent were found to have been infected with
salmonella. If all of Finland's egg farms are included, then
salmonella has been found in just over 2 percent of them.

Already, 73 percent of pork farms have been investigated, and
salmonella has been detected in 2 percent of them, which amounts to
one half of one percent of all pork farms in Finland.

[Salmonella in feed can cause problems in animals of all ages. Of
course the level of salmonella in the feed is also important and this
article does not tell us the level of contamination. Salmonella can
cause diarrhea, listlessness, and even death in affected animals.

What a feel-good article! The company promises to bear full
responsibility and compensate for damages caused (sounds like good
company business, some guilt or at least taking responsibility for
what happened) but "According to a statement put out by the company,
officials have not suggested that Raisio Feed had been negligent or
made mistakes." These 2 statements seem at odds with each other.

The article does not want to point a finger at anyone, but the cooling
system (operated by people) was the source of the problem the company
is paying for. So what happened? Did the cooling system pipe break?
What was beyond the control of the people here? How did the cooling
sytem water become contaminated in the 1st place? And how did cooling
system water get into the feed? It sounds like a typical case of a
sewage pipe leaking into the clean water supply. It was initially
suspected that imported soybeans were the source, but those tested
clean (see above).

The entire factory has been cleaned and disinfected, and contaminated
feed already purchased has been replaced by clean feed (see previous
ProMED post listed below). - Mod.TG/JW]
