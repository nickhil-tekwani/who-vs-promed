The government has issued a statewide alert following the confirmation of an outbreak of avian flu (bird flu) in 2 districts.

Minister for Animal Husbandry KP Mohanan said on [Mon 24 Nov 2014] that the H5 avian influenza virus had been confirmed in samples sent to the High Security Animal Disease (HSAD) Laboratory, Bhopal. The strain spreads between birds and can potentially affect humans.

A communication issued by HR Khanna, Assistant Commissioner, Union Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DADF), directed the State to carry out control and containment operations in the wake of the outbreak. The State has been asked to constitute teams for the purpose. A red alert has been issued in Kottayam and Alappuzha districts where the disease outbreak was noticed in ducks. 4 panchayats [local self-government Indian institution at the village or small town level], Aimanam, Purakkad, Kumarakom, and Thalavadi have been affected.

The Minister said affected birds would be culled from [Tue 25 Nov 2014] to prevent the spread of the disease. Farmers would be compensated after assessing the extent of loss. He said directions had been issued to restrict the transportation of ducks and eggs from Alappuzha to other districts. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has convened a high-level meeting on [Tue 25 Nov 2014] to discuss the steps to be taken to control the outbreak of bird flu.

In another related incident, 22 ducks brought from Alappuzha by a farmer at Mylakkara, near Kallikad, in Thiruvananthapuram, were reported to have died on [Sat 23 Nov 2014].

[On Tue 25 Nov 2014, India submitted an immediate notification to the OIE, reporting 2 outbreaks of HPAI H5 in duck farms in Kerala. Final serotyping of the H5 virus strain is anticipated soon. It will be of particular interest to find out if this outbreak is caused by the same HPAI strain which has recently caused disease in chickens, turkeys, and domestic ducks in Asia (China, South Korea, Japan) and Europe (Germany, Netherlands, UK), namely HPAI H5N8 virus of clade 2.3.4.6. - Mod.AS
