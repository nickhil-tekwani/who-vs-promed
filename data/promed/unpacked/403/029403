Another case in Piacenza, hit by West Nile virus [WNV]. The man, a 60-year-old resident in Val D'Arda, was hospitalized last August [2018] at the hospital in Parma - he was already in the Ducal city for other treatments - because of high fever. Fortunately, his condition has improved.

This is the 2nd case in the province of Piacenza of the virus transmitted by mosquitoes a few days apart. The first involved a 78-year-old hospitalized at the Guglielmo da Saliceto hospital.

WNV [infection] is an infectious disease spread in many regions of Africa, the Middle East, India, Indonesia and, with less intensity, it is also present in some areas of southern Europe. In Italy it is transmitted mainly by the common mosquito, although it is possible that the infection occurs after the bite of the tiger mosquito.

For some years the Emilia-Romagna region has activated a system of surveillance on the circulation in our territories of the virus responsible for West Nile Disease to verify the presence of this pathogen in mosquitoes and birds (where the virus is multiplied), in horses and in humans (which may be occasionally infected as a result of bites).

[According to the weekly update available on the ECDC webpage (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc); "In 2018, as of 30 Aug 2018, EU Member States reported 710 human cases: Italy (327), Greece (147), Romania (117), Hungary (96), France (11), Austria (8), Croatia (3) and Slovenia (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 265 human cases: Serbia (213), Israel (49) and Kosovo (3). To date, a total of 63 deaths due to West Nile fever have been reported by Serbia (21), Greece (16), Italy (13), Romania (12), and Kosovo (1)."

There have been 7 fatal cases reported from Italy during the week of 24-30 August 2018.

The burden of WNV cases is higher in most European countries reporting the cases which is a challenge for public health and vector control authorities. - Mod.UBA
