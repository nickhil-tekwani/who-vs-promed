[ProMED is thankful to the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project for this information.

Classical staphylococcal gastrointestinal illness is enterotoxin-related, causing self-limited, non-febrile vomiting, with no or little diarrhea, which does not sound like the illness described in this quite large prison outbreak. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is quite rarely caused by _S. aureus_ (Staph. aureus, (MRSA) - Canada: (QC) enterocolitis, antibiotic associated 20170505.5016134) but is not likely to be the cause here.

Finding one rectal swab with _Shigella flexneri_ is certainly of note but cannot, in itself, imply that shigellosis is the cause of the entire outbreak. Likewise, although _Aeromonas_ was found in a clinical specimen mixed with _Shigella_ and in 7 of 24 water samples and _Aeromonas_ can cause diarrhea (von Graevenitz A: The role of _Aeromonas_ in diarrhea: a review. Infection. 2007; 35(2): 59-64), it is still too early to attribute this large outbreak to this organism. It is possible, certainly, that the outbreak is due to multiple enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. - Mod.LL
