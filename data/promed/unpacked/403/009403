Ten days after rains and floods paralysed Mumbai, leptospirosis has struck in a big way and claimed 2 lives and affected 15 others in the 1st 4 days of July 2015.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that affects people who have waded through flood waters contaminated with the urine of rats and dogs. It is easily treatable with antibiotics if caught early but can cause multi-organ failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome if not treated in time.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Mumbai is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is the wettest month, with almost non-stop rain. At this time, parts of the city become waterlogged (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mumbai) or flooded under several feet of water, as has been reported today (6 Jul 2015) in Mumbai (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/Rain-lashes-city-water-logging-hits-city-traffic/articleshow/47964435.cms).

Leptospira are transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life.

Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by leptospira-infected animal urine (usually rat), the bacteria can enter the human body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.

The symptoms in humans appear after a 3-14 day incubation period. Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The news report above does not say whether the diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed in these patients by blood testing.

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. - Mod.ML
