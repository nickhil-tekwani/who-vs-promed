2 more horses at the Columbia Horse Center have contracted the same virus
that sickened 5 other horses last month. One is recovering and one died
last week. 3 of the first 5 sick horses had to be euthanized. The center
will remain closed until at least next month.
Equine herpesvirus causes upper respiratory infection and neurological
disease. It can be spread through the air or by direct contact.
All of the stricken animals lived in the same barn. State agriculture
officials have said the outbreak appears to be isolated and that the horse
center was not at fault.
