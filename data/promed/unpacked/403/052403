Farmers in [Bogura] district are worried as their bean plants are turning yellow over [the] last couple of weeks.

The Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) said over 560 hectares have been brought under bean cultivation this [2019] season. DAE officials said bean plants on over 300 hectares of the land have already been affected with a virus-related disease and the plants turn yellow gradually.

[An] agriculture officer of DAE said poor quality of seeds is one of the main reasons for such situation. Affected fields would not be able to give a good yield, he added.

[The common name bean is used for a large variety of leguminous crops (family Fabaceae), including species of _Phaseolus_ (common, French, runner, Lima beans), _Vigna_ (snake bean, mung bean), _Glycine_ (soybean), _Vicia_ (broad or faba bean). It is not clear which of these crops the story above refers to.

Legumes can be affected by a range of fungal, bacterial, viral and nematode pathogens, several of which are shared between several genera. Some of these legume pathogens may be seed transmitted, as seems to be implied in the report above.

While the disease above is called 'virus-related', it is not stated whether this is based on any form of reliable diagnosis. The yellowing symptoms described are not sufficient for identifying a viral or any other pathogen since they may be due to a number of causes, both infectious and environmental.
