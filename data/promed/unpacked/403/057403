Prion (PrPSc)-specific epitope defined by a monoclonal antibody

Prions are infectious particles causing transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs). They consist, at least in part, of an isoform
(PrPSc) of the ubiquitous cellular prion protein (PrPC). Conformational
differences between PrPC and PrPSc are evident from increased -sheet
content and protease resistance in PrPSc. Here the authors describe a
monoclonal antibody, 15B3, that can discriminate between the normal and
disease-specific forms of PrP. Such an antibody has been long sought as it
should be invaluable for characterizing the infectious particle as well as
for diagnosis of TSEs such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. 15B3 specifically precipitates
bovine, murine or human PrPSc, but not PrPC, suggesting that it recognizes
an epitope common to prions from different species. Using immobilized
synthetic peptides, they mapped three polypeptide segments in PrP as the
15B3 epitope. In the NMR structure of recombinant mouse PrP, segments 2
and 3 of the 15B3 epitope are near neighbours in space, and segment 1 is
located in a different part of the molecule. They discuss models for the
PrPSc-specific epitope that ensure close spatial proximity of all three
15B3 segments, either by intermolecular contacts in oligomeric forms of the
prion protein or by intramolecular rearrangement.
