In tomorrow's issue (vol. 49, no. 9) of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control will report that the Division
of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID) laboratories in Fort Collins
has detected RNA of West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes that have spent the
winter in underground structures in New York City.
Although WNV RNA (envelope, NS-1 and NS-5 regions) were detected in three
of 67 pools containing _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes, WNV has not been isolated
from these pools. Thus, the persistence of WNV in mosquitoes in New York
City has not yet been proven but the persistence of WNV RNA has. In an
editorial note MMWR comments that the reason virus has not been isolated
may be because (1) virus titer may be exceedingly low, (2) virus may be
noninfectious in overwintering mosquitoes, (3) virus may have been
inactivated during processing, (4) noninfectious WNV RNA, but not
infectious virus, may persist in the mosquitoes, or (5) the results may
have been nonspecific.
The DVBID laboratories are continuing to attempt virus isolation and
continuing other rigorous and thorough efforts to determine whether WNV is
persisting in the New York area and to determine the likelihood of another
outbreak of this virus and disease.
Although vertical transmission (from one generation to another) of WNV has
been shown in experimentally-infected _Culex_ and _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes
and vertical transmission of WNV has been demonstrated in African _Culex
univittatus_ mosquitoes, results of these studies in New York have not
provided evidence for vertical transmission of WNV there.
We assume that further information will be forthcoming but, at least for
now, all that can be said is that WNV RNA has persisted through the New
York winter. Whether the virus has also persisted remains to be determined.
