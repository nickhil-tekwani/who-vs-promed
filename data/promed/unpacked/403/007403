Leaves were collected from a cotton (_Gossypium barbadense_) stock plant
"MLC" found at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Hebbal, Bangalore,
showing mild leaf curl, some vein thickening and enations.
The infection originated from a naturally-infected _G. barbadense_ at this
site and was maintained by successive _Bemisia tabaci_ inoculations.
Sequence data generated from cloning PCR products amplified from total
MLC-leaf DNA using begomovirus-specific primers enabled the design of
primers to amplify the complete DNA-A molecule.
The sequence of the cloned complete DNA-A PCR product (2751 nt, AY705380)
had 84-85 percent nucleotide identity with Cotton leaf curl Multan virus
(CLCuMV, AJ002447, AJ002459), followed by 83.4 percent with Malvastrum
yellow vein virus (MYVV, AJ457824). A phylogenetic tree was constructed to
show the relationship of the MLC virus to other Asian begomoviruses present
in GenBank. Nucleotide identities of individual genes suggest that the
DNA-A sequenced is of recombinant origin.
A DNA-B component could not be amplified from MLC-leaf total DNA using
degenerate DNA-B specific primers. A DNA-b component was amplified using
Briddon et al. (2003) primers and its sequence (AY705381) shared most
nucleotide identity (approximately 84 percent) with DNA-b molecules from
cotton and hibiscus in Pakistan (Acc. No. AJ292769 and AJ297908).
The conserved C1 gene of the DNA-b molecule showed highest nucleotide
identities (89.1-89.6 percent) and amino acid similarity (80.5-81.4
percent) with similar sequences from tomato (AJ316035) and cotton _G.
hirsutum_ (AJ298903) from Pakistan.
Cotton leaf curl diseases in Pakistan and northern India are associated
with 5 distinct begomovirus species, which all share a similar DNA-b.
Sequence data suggest MLC has not originated from such regions, but is
associated with a new begomovirus and distinct DNA-b component.
Based on DNA-A sequence taxonomic guidelines, the virus from MLC is a new
begomovirus species for which the name Cotton leaf curl Bangalore virus is
proposed.

This piece illustrates the continual evolution of new cotton virus strains
and species. There are at least 5 strains/isolates of CLCuV known, most of
which are reported from Pakistan and western India. Cotton leaf curl Gezira
virus is the more cosmopolitan strain, occurring in Egypt and Sudan, and is
known to be present in Central Africa, Chad, Nigeria, Togo and West Africa.
Cotton leaf curl disease (CLuCD) is a serious disease of cotton and several
other malvaceous plant species that is transmitted by the whitefly _Bemisia
tabaci_. Control of CLCuD is mainly based on insecticide treatments against
_Bemisia tabaci_. Roguing, particularly of ratoon cotton from the previous
seasons crop, is recommended but appears to have little affect in reducing
disease incidence. Resistant cotton cultivars have been introduced that
were developed by conventional breeding and selection. However, recent
reports have suggested that the virus complex has overcome the resistance.
Do any of our readers know whether yields of cotton seed oil are affected
by these viruses? Let me know, please.
