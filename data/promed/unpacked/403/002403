SARS virus in civet cat
------------------------
On the basis of recent information of the World Health Organization
which traced the SARS virus to a civet cat and 2 other small mammals
in China, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) states the
following:
- as mentioned in its previous information (see press release of 11
Apr 2003), the OIE still does not dispose of any scientific evidence
to suggest that SARS-related disease has occurred in animals.
- Therefore, the OIE continues the monitoring of the evolution of the
disease and undertakes a very close collaboration with the World
Health Organization as well as with the scientists of the OIE
Reference Laboratories on the subject.

Virus detectives seek source of SARS in China's wild animals
-----------------------------
Researchers investigating the source of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) have turned their attention to the wild-animal
markets of southern China. The move follows reports that workers and
animals at the markets show high rates of infection with
coronaviruses, the family to which the virus believed to cause SARS
belongs.
The possible link to wild animals emerged on 23 May 2003, when a team
from the University of Hong Kong revealed that a coronavirus
resembling the SARS virus had been isolated from 6 masked palm civets
(_Paguma larvata_) and a raccoon dog (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) in
a market in Shenzhen, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.
Antibodies against the virus were also found in a Chinese ferret
badger (_Melogale moschata_) from the same market.
Although the virus is not the same as that believed to cause SARS --
a member of the Hong Kong team describes it as "genetically very
close, but not identical" -- 5 out of the 10 civet handlers at the
market had antibodies against the SARS virus in their blood. A
Chinese government team has since released results showing that 66
out of 508 animal handlers tested at markets in Guangdong had
antibodies against the SARS virus.
Microbiologist Kwok-yung Yuen, who led the Hong Kong team, notes that
in the general population, the level of antibodies against the SARS
virus is much lower. "This suggests that the virus is jumping from
wild animals to humans," he says.
Because the animal virus is similar to the SARS virus, but different
from other coronaviruses, it is now a prime suspect in the hunt for
the origins of SARS. The likelihood that the virus is moving the
other way -- from humans to animals -- is diminished by ongoing work
on genetic sequences of the 2 viruses. These analyses suggest that
the animal version has an extra stretch of 29 nucleotide bases.
"Viruses tend not to gain stretches of nucleotides when they jump
across species," says Klaus Stoehr, a SARS expert at the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Geneva.
But uncertainties remain over the exact source of the virus. Only 6
civets were present in the market, and the fact that they all had the
virus suggests that they were infected recently. "They could have
gotten it from another animal during transport to the markets," says
Zhang-liang Chen, a molecular biologist and president of the China
Agricultural University in Beijing. Chen's group did not find the
SARS virus in samples from 8 civets taken from other markets and in
the wild in Guangdong.

[See ProMED-mail's moderator's comment in posting 20030525.1290.
Authentic, detailed, first-hand data on the findings from the cited
investigators will improve our ability to evaluate the role of
animals as a source of SARS in China. We would also appreciate
information on the identity of the incriminated species. According to
the World Chelonian Trust web-site
<http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/Palm_Civits_SARS.htm>, the relevant
animal is the Palm Civet, _Paguma larvata_. - Mod AS].
[Perhaps the most significant aspect of the above report from Nature
is that some animals in other markets or in the wild have tested
negative for the SARS coronavirus. So it is possible that the animals
in the market in Shenzhen may have been infected from an unknown
animal or human source. A potential animal reservoir and the
direction of transmission of the virus are still unresolved issues.
Dr. Henry L Niman, (Instructor in Surgery (Bioengineering) Harvard
Medical School <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>) has observed that,
irrespective of the biological data, the molecular story remains
clear at this time. 16 of the 17 available SARS coronavirus genome
sequences have the same 29-nucleotide deletion (the GZ01 sequence
being the single exception), whereas the genome sequences of at least
2 civet cats (and the GZ01 sequence) have the same corresponding
29-nucleotide insertion. It is clear, however, that more data are
required before the biological relevance of this 29-nucleotide
deletion/insertion can be assessed. - Mod.CP]
