Dozens of farms across North Somerset have been placed under tight restrictions following outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis.

According to a map commissioned by Defra, using information from the Animal and Plant Health Agency disease-recording database, 45 cattle farms across the district are subject to restrictions, with local farmers saying the disease is becoming a major problem across rural North Somerset.

Officials at TB Free England claim the spread of the disease is out of control and could cost the taxpayer one billion UK pounds over the next decade unless further action is taken.

Farmer James Small, whose family has reared dairy herds in Blagdon for over 60 years, says bovine TB is on the increase despite ever-tightening restrictions on the movement of cattle and rigorous testing for the disease.

Cattle herds in TB problem areas are tested at least annually, and cows that react to the test are isolated and slaughtered. The remainder of the herd is subject to strict movement restrictions, meaning cows cannot move off farm, unless it is for slaughter, until the whole herd passes 2 consecutive TB tests 60 days apart.

It is understood that farms in Kingston Seymour and Nailsea have had large proportions of their herds slaughtered due to outbreaks.

Since 2008, 278 263 cattle have been killed due to bovine TB in the UK.

Despite these measures, huge numbers of farms are still being closed down with outbreaks of the disease, causing a devastating impact on the British beef and dairy sectors.

Mr Small, who is also the South West NFU regional board chairman, said: "It has massive financial and emotional implications.

"If bovine TB is detected in your herd, not only must affected animals be slaughtered but the herd is placed under restrictions whereby they must be tested at least twice, at intervals of 60 days, until they are clear.

"During this time the livestock is massively devalued. But the impact goes beyond the financial," he added.

"As a farmer, you are the carer and keeper for your animals, and you do your very best for them.

"Some are pedigree animals that have gone through generations of careful breeding only to be slaughtered before their time if they are found to have TB. The cow might be pregnant or have young calves. It doesn't matter.

"Farmers have no say in this - it can feel like a lottery, which is immensely stressful."

Bovine TB is known to be transmitted between badgers and cattle.

In bTB 'hotspot' areas -- which include the counties of the South West -- up to one in 3 badgers are estimated to have bovine TB. In North Somerset there are 346 registered cattle keepers.

A spokesperson for North Somerset Council said: "There are many reasons why a farm may be under restriction, and it may not mean there is TB present. For example, if a farm has been given a deadline for TB testing that it's not been able to meet, because the herd is so spread out, a vet hasn't been organised or for any other reasons, it will get put under restriction. If a TB test is inconclusive a farm will get put under restriction while retesting is carried out."

Farmers like Mr Small argue that bTB can be only tackled successfully when the disease is tackled on all fronts at the same time.

This means using both cattle controls and badger controls in areas where the disease is persistent and high.

In its bTB eradication strategy, the Government recognises the role badgers play in spreading the disease in areas where bTB is rife and makes a clear commitment to controlling the disease in badgers in these areas as part of the strategy.

In 2013 and 2014, badger culling in England was controversially trialed in 2 pilot areas in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset, and it was later announced that culling would be rolled out in Dorset while also being continued in Gloucestershire and Somerset.

Opponents of the cull, such as the Badger Trust and the RSPCA, have argued that attempts to control the spread of bTB should focus on vaccinating cattle and badgers rather than culling badgers.

The 2 organisations are opposed to what they feel is random slaughter of badgers -- which have special legal protection in the UK -- in return for what they describe as a relatively small impact on bTB.
