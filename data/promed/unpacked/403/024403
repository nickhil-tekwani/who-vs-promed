Indonesia: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 2
-------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 12 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed the country's 59th death from H5N1 avian influenza. The
38-year-old woman from Tangerang, Banten Province whose infection was
announced on 9 Jan 2007, died in hospital on 11 Jan 2007.
The Ministry of Health has also confirmed a new case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The 22-year-old woman
from Banten Province developed symptoms on 3 Jan 2007 and remains in
hospital. An initial investigation into the source of her exposure
found reports of chicken deaths near her home in the days prior to
symptom onset.
Of the 77 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 59 have been fatal.

Bird flu killed a 37-year-old woman in Indonesia and may have
infected hundreds of poultry in Japan as the lethal virus resurfaces
across Asia.
The woman's death late yesterday brings to 59 the number of
fatalities from the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Indonesia, Runizar
Ruesin, a Health Ministry official, said in a mobile phone text
message today. Japan's farm ministry suspects the virus killed
poultry on a farm on the southern island of Kyushu.
The new infections provide chances for H5N1 to mutate into a form
more dangerous to people. Millions could die if it mutates and begins
spreading easily between people, sparking a pandemic. South Korea,
Vietnam and Nigeria had fresh poultry outbreaks [in December 2006],
while China and Egypt found human cases. "It makes biologic sense
that where there is more virus activity, there is a greater
likelihood of some type of genetic change," Michael Osterholm,
director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious
Disease Research and Policy in Minneapolis, said in a telephone
interview today.
The H5N1 strain is known to have infected 264 people in 10 countries
since 2003, killing 158 of them, the World Health Organization said
yesterday. Indonesia recorded the most deaths. A 22-year-old man from
Tangerang, in the Banten province on the west of Java island, tested
positive for H5N1, I Nyoman Kandun, the ministry's director general
of disease control and environment, said today in a mobile phone text
message. The man is from the same province as the woman who died
yesterday. She developed symptoms on 1 Jan 2007 and was admitted to
Jakarta's Persahabatan Hospital five days later. Her 42-year-old
husband and their 18-year-old son are suffering from symptoms of
fever and respiratory infection, and are being tested for avian flu,
Mukhtar Ikhsan, a doctor at the hospital, said yesterday. Test
results are pending for the other family members and, if confirmed,
would represent the latest cluster of H5N1 cases in the southeast
Asian nation, said Ruesin, who is head of the Health Ministry's avian
flu information center.
Tests are also being run on a 27-year-old man being treated in the
Persahabatan Hospital, and 3 members of another family hospitalized
in Bandung city in West Java province, Kandun said.
The H5N1 virus has been found in fowl in 30 out of 33 provinces in
the archipelago of 18 000 islands, making it difficult for disease
trackers to detect outbreaks. "Given the situation in Indonesia,
where we have had a high number of cases in poultry and a significant
number of cases in people in the last year, Indonesia becomes one of
the high-risk areas of the world," John Weaver, a senior technical
adviser on avian flu with the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, said in an interview in Jakarta today.

A 27-year-old woman patient, who is still suspected of being infected
with bird flu, died at 11:00 p.m. on Friday night [12 Jan 2007] in
Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Metro TV station reported. If later
she is confirmed of being infected with bird flu, the death toll from
the fatal bird flu in the country would reach 60 people. A few days
before she died, a 14-year-old boy and a 38-year-old woman died from
bird flu in the same hospital.
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie
emphasized that there would be no change in the current measures
against bird flu.

[The identification of patients by age and sex is a continuing source
of confusion. Fifty-nine fatalities are now confirmed and a 60th is
probable. Two clusters of cases are suspected, but remain to be
confirmed. - Mod.CP]
