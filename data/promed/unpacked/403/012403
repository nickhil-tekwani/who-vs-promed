At least 120 head of cattle have been killed in the Atyrau region [West Kazakhstan]; the cause of the death of the animals is unknown. The Kazakh edition of "Ak Zhayik" states that 120 cows died in the Isatay district of Atyrau region in the west of Kazakhstan [map at http://tinyurl.com/y9ksmu2x] in the period from [20 Jul to August 2017].

Veterinarians do not know the cause of the animal's deaths."Since the cattle are still in the pastures, the owners themselves bring sick animals to us. Although they do not have a high temperature, they still cannot save them," said veterinarian Islamgali Mardashev.

The meat of the dead cows was sent for testing in the laboratories of Astana and Almaty, but so far there are no results [see comment below]. It is only known that before dying the temperature of the animals rises, and there is weakness and lumps under the skin.

In the summer of 2016, the Atyrau oblast similarly suffered a massive loss of livestock; more than 800 cattle died. All of them had nodular dermatitis. More than 6000 cattle were infected with the disease.

[On 17 Jun 2016, a disease which later was recognized as lumpy skin disease (LSD) was reported in the village of Chapayev, Neftebaza district, West Kazakhstan. At that point, the clinical cases were erroneously suspected as FMD; this information was published by local media, and led to ProMED-mail's post requesting additional information. FMD was subsequently excluded by lab tests. The said information, and explanatory commentaries underlining LSD as the likely etiology of the event, are available in postings 20160722.4362368 and 20160723.4365082.

On 22 Jul 2016, Kazakhstan reported (see archive no. 20160722.4363497) a single LSD outbreak in Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangashlak (western to Atyrau; map at http://tinyurl.com/ycb4j9h7), stating that it had started on 7 Jul 2016. According to the report, the susceptible population was 3557 head including 459 clinical cases of which 34 died, the 425 remaining sick animals "killed and disposed of". No stamping out applied and no additional case reported in the 12 follow-up reports, the last of which, no.12, submitted on 26 Nov 2017, stated:
1. Compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon. All 459 diseased cattle heads were destroyed and the final disinfection was carried out.
2. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.
Follow-up report no.12, with links to all previous reports, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21682.

Although according to media reports vaccination was applied, no details of such were included in the 12 follow-up reports nor in Kazakhstan's semi-annual summary report to the OIE (July-December 2016), which included the epidemiological statistics above; the item "control measures" (against LSD) did not include "vaccination".

The current media report, from a Kyrgyz source (citing a Kazakh newspaper), says that during the 2016 event, 6000 animals were infected, of which 600 died. An earlier media report, from Kazakhstan, dated 27 Jul 2016, said that the number of diseased animals "exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died" (see archive no. 20160727.4374008).

Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis in 2016, and its continued absence, so far, during the current event, is puzzling; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals.

Early report on the factual circulation and distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighboring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russia is LSD-infected (last follow-up report addressing 2 new outbreaks in Saratov oblast, adjacent to West Kazakhstan, published 24 Aug 2017).

For the diagnosis of LSD, samples from clinically affected animals should preferably be derived from their typical dermal lesions; organs from dead animals which should be sent for laboratory tests are specified in OIE's Manual. The submission of "meat of dead cows" for testing in the laboratories, as reported, may not be ideal for timely diagnosis of LSD. - Mod.AS
