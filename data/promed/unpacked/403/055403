Just today [18 Jan 2011], the death of a woman aged 41, from Los
Maitenes sector of the town of Casablanca, from [a] hantavirus
[infection] was confirmed. [The death] occurred on 6 Jan [2011] at
the Carlos van Buren Hospital in Valparaiso. [This] Information was
confirmed by the Secretariat of the Ministry of Health, being the 1st
case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the community. The victim died
of cardiovascular failure. This was confirmed by the Institute of
Public Health (ISP), an entity that contacted the family of the
deceased to launch prospective monitoring [of their health status].

Moreover, the Casablanca municipality, in conjunction with the Health
SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat], is undertaking various
actions to detect, prevent, and control of hantavirus [transmission]
in the affected rural area, in order to detect possible infections
and to educate the population about measures to be taken.

[The hantavirus involved in this fatal case is most likely Andes virus.

A child of 3 years 6 months became the 2nd fatal victim of an
infection with [a] hantavirus so far in 2011. The Institute of Public
Health confirmed that the child died 15 Jan [2011] in the Nacimiento
community in BioBio. Following the death of the child, family members
must undergo follow-up for 6 weeks, during which tests will be
carried out to determine if anyone was infected. [This is because
Andes virus can be transmitted by direct contact from an
infected person to another in very close contact. - Mod.TY]

This case is added to that of a 33-year-old man who died in the Pinto
community in Nube province, after working in a cabin that was used as
a storage area.

Given these cases, the epidemiologist unit of the Health SEREMI,
Cecilia Soto, called for the populace to adopt preventive measures,
such as ventilation of of places that have been closed up and to
adequately dispose of trash. She stated that [a] hantavirus infection
begins as an influenza manifestation, and later the [clinical]
picture becomes complicated to the point that death may result.

A total of 3 cases of hantavirus [infections] were confirmed in the
province; meanwhile another 3 suspected cases were discarded,
according to information issued by Francisco Garcia Campos, in charge
of Epidemiological Coordination. The 3 positive patients are males,
infected in the Oran area and were attended in the San Vicente de
Paul Hospital in that city. They are from the areas of Pichanal, Rio
Blanco and Oran and the infections, according to what could be
established, are related to rural and recreational activities.

Concerning the patient's developments, the epidemiologist stated that
one continues in critical condition in intensive therapy, another is
progressing well and was moved to a room in the medical clinic, while
the 3rd was released [from the hospital].

[A 10-year-old boy and his 60-year-old aunt died of a hantavirus
infection in April 2010 in Oran. This area is in the ecosystem where
Oran hantavirus is maintained in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat
(_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_). The specific hantaviruses responsible
for these 3 cases, as well as those in Chile, above, are not
specified in these reports.
