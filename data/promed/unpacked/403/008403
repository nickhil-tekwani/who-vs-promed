The Epidemiology module in GIDEON software provides global or
country-by-country information on all vector-borne diseases, including
incidence, in-country distribution, clinical features, local vectors and
reservoirs, etc. A sub-module generates lists for user-specified
epidemiological parameters; ie, mosquito-borne diseases of the world vs.
mosquito-borne viral diseases of Iraq having an avian reservior, etc. Data
concerning insecticide resistance are not included.
For further information, contact the North American distributor
(GIDEON-USA) at
telephone 1-800 3168585 or 978 927 3808; fax 978 927 1308; e-mail:

Response to: Lt Com G Tetrault:
I have a personal database of well over 14,000 references and abstracts to
the literature on the global distribution and incidence of vector and
rodent-borne diseases, their arthropod vectors and rodent-reservoirs. I
have actually discussed possible cooperation with Dr. Phillip G. Lawyer of
the Armed Forces Pest Management Board staff in the course of the recent
yearly meeting of the AMCA in Sparks, Nevada in March.
Please contact me and we can discuss possible collaboration.

Re: Insect vector risk assessment. You might try contacting CSIRO -
Entomology in Australia. They have a program (Climex) to model insect
vector populations in response to climate changes & the input data for that
program may be appropriate for your purposes.
