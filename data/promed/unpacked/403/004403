In an article entitled "Fulminant Hepatitis Associated With Hepatitis A
Virus Superinfection in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C" by Vento,
Sandro; Garofano, Tiziana; Renzini, Carlo; et al., researchers concluded
that individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at
significant risk for fulminant hepatitis and death associated with
hepatitis A virus (HAV) superinfection. From June 1990 to July 1997, the
team examined 163 adults with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and 432 patients
with chronic hepatitis C who were seronegative for HAV antibodies; tests
were conducted every four months for serum IgM and IgG antibodies to HAV.
Over the course of the study, 10 patients with HBV infections and 17 with
HCV infections acquired HAV superinfection. Of these patients, fulminant
hepatic failure developed in seven of the HCV-infected individuals, six of
whom died. All but one of the HBV patients who developed HAV had
uncomplicated courses. Since HAV infection rarely has a fulminant course
and is usually non-fatal, the research team note that "the high mortality
rate among our patients with chronic hepatitis C and HAV superinfection (35
percent) is thus surprising, as is the even higher percentage of such
patients with fulminant hepatitis (41 percent)." The authors suggest,
therefore, that individuals with chronic HCV infection be vaccinated
against HAV.
