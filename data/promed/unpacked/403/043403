Residents of Washington, DC, have come under siege by a plague of microscopic oak leaf itch mites whose bite leaves a raft of painful and itchy sores on their victims.

"We wake up at night just scratching," said Cynthia Palmer of Arlington, Virginia, told The Washington Post. "It's like we have splotches of white paint all over us now that we're using the calamine [lotion]. The sores are red and swollen, so it's not pretty."

Scientists say the mites have come to feed on the billions of cicada eggs that were left by the creatures when they emerged in the capital last spring [2021] and fall on their unsuspecting victims when they pass under an infested tree.

"It's a phenomenon related to cicadas being there, and it will dissipate. And eventually, you won't have it next year [2022], because the cicadas will not be emerging," Gene Kritsky, the dean of behavioral and natural sciences at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati, told the paper.

The bugs [mites] are 1/125 of an inch [0.2 mm] in length making them virtually invisible to the naked eye. If you're bitten, you probably won't even know until the sores begin to emerge about 10 hours later.

Many traumatized residents have sought out each other in online support groups on Facebook and Nextdoor, Washingtonian Magazine reported.

The bugs [mites] are expected to continue their reign of terror until the late fall [2021].

[The oak leaf itch mite (_Pyemotes herfsi_) is not a "bug", nor even an insect, as termed above, but rather taxonomically classified as a subclass acari of the class Arachnida. This mite is not the same as the one that causes mange (scabies). A Kansas State University bulletin has information about this mite and says, "The oak leaf itch mite, _P. herfsi_, bites humans causing itching that can lead to secondary bacterial infections. The oak leaf itch mite is a close relative of the straw itch mite, _P. tritici_, which also bites humans and may have originated in Europe. The oak leaf itch mite was first detected in the Midwest in 2004 and was responsible for widespread occurrences of itching bites from 2014 through 2017" (https://bookstore.ksre.ksu.edu/pubs/MF2806.pdf).

Clearly, it is now abundant in the Washington, DC area. Images of the mite and the skin lesions its bite causes can be seen at the source URL above. Fortunately, the mites will disappear with the onset of killing frosts in the autumn. - Mod.TY]
