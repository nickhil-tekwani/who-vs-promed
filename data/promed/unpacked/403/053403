Investigation of an outbreak of cyclosporiasis in the United States
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On [28 Jun 2013], CDC was notified of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of cyclospora infection in Iowa residents who had become ill in June [2013] and did not have a history of international travel during the 14 days before the onset of illness. Since that date, CDC has been collaborating with public health officials in multiple states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate an outbreak of cyclosporiasis. Preliminary details of the ongoing investigation are highlighted below.

Epidemiologic investigation
---------------------------
As of [18 Jul 2013], CDC has been notified of more than 200 cases of cyclospora infection in residents of multiple states, including Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, and Wisconsin. Illinois has also notified CDC of one case that may have been acquired out of state.

Most of the illness onset dates have ranged from mid-June through early July [2013].

At least 8 people reportedly have been hospitalized.

No food items have been implicated to date, but public health authorities are pursuing all leads. Previous outbreak investigations have implicated various types of fresh produce.

It is not yet clear whether the cases from all of the states are part of the same outbreak.

No common events (such as social gatherings) have been identified among the case patients.

Additional cases are currently under investigation and will be included on this page [at the source URL above] as states confirm them.
