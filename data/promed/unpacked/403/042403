Sources told The Post on Mon [12 Dec 2007] that 3 suspected cases of
human-to-human transmission [but see JW comment below] of bird flu
virus have been detected in North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Of
these 3 cases, 2 people died and the Ministry of Health has collected
samples to determine the
cause of their deaths.

Sources said about 3 weeks ago the Ministry of Health obtained blood
samples of people suspected of being infected with bird flu virus,
but their results have yet to be announced. Ministry officials said
on 21 Oct [2007], bird flu virus H5N1 was confirmed at Ijaz Shah
Poultry Farm in Abbotabad and a veterinarian, Dr Ishtiaq Durrani,
from the NWFP Livestock Department was tasked with culling as many as
3000 hens in Abbotabad from 21 to 23 Oct 2007.

As many as 200 [208 as of 13 Dec 2007 according to WHO - Mod.CP]
people have died of bird flu virus all over the world but no case of
human-to-human transmission of bird flu virus has been confirmed so
far. Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council secretary and registrar Dr
Alamdar Hussain Malik said the Ministry of Health and the World
Health Organization (WHO) were the final authority to confirm the
presence of bird flu virus in human beings. The final report about
the presence of bird flu virus in suspected cases detected in NWFP
would be released by the ministry, which has obtained their samples,
he added. He said [there are] about 25 000 poultry farms in the
country, out of which 90 percent were working without boundary walls
and precautionary measures. He said the government should register
all these poultry farms and start an awareness campaign about
bio-safety.

[This report provides the additional information that as well as the 2
people who have died, a 3rd person has been suspected to be an H5N1
case and remains alive. An unstated number of other people are
suspected cases and are under surveillance awaiting the outcome of
diagnostic tests. Confirmation of these H5N1 diagnoses from an
independent laboratory is awaited. - Mod.CP].

[An additional detail is that onset was "about 3 weeks ago" (end of
November 2007). Just because 2 brothers were involved does not imply
human-to-human transmission; both were in contact with the same flock
of poultry. - Mod.JW]
