Yesterday [6 Dec 2008], Jinghua Times reported that the daughter of a
resident of Chaoyang District has suffered fever for 2 days since receiving
hepatitis A vaccination at a Balizhuang neighborhood clinic. Prior to this,
a girl suffered fever and died after receiving hepatitis A vaccine from the
same lot at an unidentified clinic in Fengtai District.

Yesterday [6 Dec 2008], the city's Bureau of Health announced that they had
not yet received a report from disease control agencies and that the fevers
could not yet be positively attributed to the vaccines. This lot of vaccine
will not be suspended from citywide use. Beijing's disease control agencies
will closely follow the use of this lot of vaccine.

Sources say that the 2 girls both received vaccine from the same lot of
hepatitis A vaccine, produced by Sinovac Biotech Co, Ltd. The lot number is
2008052105.

Yesterday [6 Dec 2008], an official from disease control and the prevention
department of the Bureau of Health said that all vaccines in Beijing are
sourced via established channels and purchased through government tender.
There cannot be a problem with vaccine quality. So this vaccine lot will
not be suspended citywide.

Sinovac Biotech Ltd (NYSE Alternext US: SVA), a leading provider of
vaccines in China, announced today [2 Dec 2008] that the Health Services
Bureau of Fengtai District in the City of Beijing suspended the use of 83
doses of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine Healive, following a report of
the death of a minor in the Fengtai District on 27 Nov 2008, which
coincided with the administration of the vaccine 2 days prior.

The suspended vaccine was part of lot 2008052105 that passed the routine
government inspection in July 2008. To date, 19 850 doses of vaccine from
the lot have been distributed.

According to data released by the Center for Adverse Drug Reaction
Monitoring of Beijing, there is no other reported adverse reaction to the
lot to date. Sinovac has not received and is not aware of similar notice of
suspension from any other district in Beijing where the lot has been
distributed or any other part of China where other lots of the Healive
vaccine have been distributed [but see the preceding report - Mod.CP].

On 29 Nov 2008, the Beijing Drug Administration and Drug Administration of
Haidian District of the City of Beijing conducted a joint administrative
investigation that included an inspection of the company's manufacturing
site and review of its manufacturing, inspection, and sales processes and
concluded in a written report that no abnormality was found.

Sinovac has full confidence in the quality of its products. It will
continue to cooperate with government agencies in their investigation of
the incident and will provide an update once the investigation is completed.

Sinovac Biotech Ltd is a China-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses
on the research, development, manufacture, and commercialization of
vaccines that protect against human infectious diseases. Sinovac's
commercialized vaccines include Healive (hepatitis A), Bilive (combined
hepatitis A and B), Anflu (influenza), and Panflu (H5N1). Sinovac is
currently developing Universal Pandemic Influenza vaccine and Japanese
encephalitis vaccine.

[Hepatitis A vaccines, in both inactivated and live attenuated versions,
are generally considered to be safe, and hepatitis A is an acute
self-limiting illness with very low mortality. It is possible that the
deaths of these 2 girls are a consequence of contamination of either a
vaccine batch or a single multi-dose vial or syringe. The rapidity of death
suggests the presence of a toxin or toxin-producing microorganism, and the
occurrence of the deaths in 2 different districts of the city suggests a
faulty vaccine batch rather than a single defective vial.

Alternatively, however, the fever and death may have been unrelated to the
vaccine. That being said, there are 2 cases of an unusual febrile illness
associated with receipt of vaccine from the same lot but in different
geographic areas In addition, the Chinese are doing a recall/ban on
administration of the implicated lot, so perhaps they have additional
information that supports a concern that this is vaccine related. Initially
the denominator used for looking at adverse event rates is the number of
doses distributed, which suggests a rate of 1/10 000 doses distributed.
This is a high rate for "serious" adverse events. We await further news
with interest.
