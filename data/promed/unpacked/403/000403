A Hurricane Katrina evacuee has been diagnosed with cholera and
quarantined at the Tennessee Army National Guard Armory shelter at
Smyrna Airport, Tennessee Health Department officials reported Thu,
15 Sep 2005. An adult male evacuated from the Gulf Coast area was in
isolation Wed, 14 Sep 2005, away from other evacuees, emergency
responders, and community volunteers at the shelter, said Andrea
Turner, Tennessee Health Department public information director.
"We have received confirmation from the CDC of 1 case of _Vibrio
cholerae_ ... a strain commonly found in people with exposure to sea
water," Turner said. "Our department is conducting an ongoing
investigation. The evacuee is receiving medical treatment and is
isolated as a precautionary measure."
A state health physician said this strain of cholera "poses no
threat" to the public, emergency workers, or community volunteers
who've been in contact with evacuees. To date, more than 280
hurricane evacuees have passed through the Smyrna shelter since 3 Sep
2005.
"It's a non-epidemic cholera," said Dr. Tim Jones, Tennessee deputy
epidemiologist. "There's no threat to the public. I would eat lunch
there today."
Turner verified other Vibrio infections have been diagnosed in the
USA in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, but only 1 in Tennessee since
the evacuation of the Gulf Coast began 29 Aug 2005. Federal health
officials circulated information indicating 22 confirmed new cases of
Vibrio nationally, with 5 deaths in 2 states, but not Tennessee. [As
ProMED's 15 Sep 2005 posting of the CDC Dispatch stated, only 2 of
these infections have been identified as _V. cholerae_ and both were
nonepidemic non-O1, non-O139 strains. - Mod.LL]
"Most of the cases involve evacuees who have incurred cuts, abrasions
or wounds and then were exposed to contaminated sea water," Turner
said. "The possibility of transmission from person-to-person is nil."
Jones said the Smyrna-based evacuee appears in good health and has
not required hospitalization.
