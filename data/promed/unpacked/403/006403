Azerbaijan: 43 Tests Sent to British Lab for Testing
-----------------------------------------------
Azerbaijan has sent blood samples from 43 people to a British laboratory to
test for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the Health Ministry stated on
Wed 5 Apr 2006.
5 young people have died from H5N1 in Azerbaijan, which is located between
Turkey and Russia. The ministry did not say whether all 43 had been
classified as suspected avian influenza cases. It said they had cold-like
symptoms and not all had been hospitalized.
"The Health Ministry decided to send blood samples (of the 43 patients) to
London to test for the H5N1 virus, since we don't have the necessary
equipment for this in Azerbaijan," said Health Ministry spokeswoman Samaya
Mamedova. "These people came to us complaining of serious colds; they have
not been hospitalized."
Azerbaijan has a laboratory that can test for H5 avian influenza, but it
cannot identify whether someone is infected with the H5N1 virus, said the
spokeswoman. She did not say whether the 43 people had tested positive for
H5 avian influenza.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it believes the human bird flu
outbreak in Azerbaijan has stabilized. The British laboratory is
WHO-accredited.
Public health officials, citing local test results, said last week a
16-year-old girl had tested positive for bird flu. She is in hospital and
is responding to treatment, officials said. Her blood sample was among the
43 sent to Britain. She was the 1st case of human bird flu infection in
Azerbaijan since the 1st week in March 2006.
Two other people in Azerbaijan have tested positive for bird flu and
survived. One has recovered, and the 2nd is in hospital.

[2] Cambodia - 2nd death reported

Cambodia: 12-year-old Boy Killed by Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has killed a 12-year-old boy in Cambodia, the impoverished
Southeast Asian nation's 6th victim, the World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Wednesday [5 Apr 2006].
The boy, from the southeastern province of Prey Veng, abutting Viet Nam,
died on Tuesday [4 Apr 2006] night, said Michael O'Leary, the WHO
representative in Phnom Penh. He said a laboratory in the capital confirmed
the boy was infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus.
Six Cambodians have died of bird flu since the H5N1 virus 1st emerged in
Southeast Asia in late 2003. The 12-year-old's death is the 2nd this year
[2006].
Last month [March 2006], a 3-year-old girl died of the disease. The girl
lived in a village in Kampong Speu province, about 40 miles (60 km) west of
Phnom Penh.
Most Cambodian outbreaks have occurred in provinces abutting Viet Nam,
which remains the hardest hit country in terms of human deaths, but Kampong
Speu is in the middle of the country, showing the virus is spreading.
Before the latest death, 191 people were known to have been infected with
H5N1 worldwide since 2003, of whom 108 had died, the WHO has said.
Last week, a government minister said tests confirmed the H5N1 virus in
dead ducks near Cambodia's border with Viet Nam.
"This makes us worried that the virus will spread to other areas because of
our poor health system and bad communications," Deputy Agriculture Minister
Yim Vanthoeun told Reuters last Thursday [30 Mar 2006].
The H5N1 virus remains mainly a disease of poultry, but could spark a
pandemic in which millions could die if it mutates into a form that spreads
easily from person to person, the WHO says.

Minister Hatem el-Gabali said on Wed 5 Apr 2006. Gabali, quoted by the
official MENA news agency, said the latest case was a girl aged 16 months
