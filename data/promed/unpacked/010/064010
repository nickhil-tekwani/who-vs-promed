TRYPANOSOMIASIS (SLEEPING SICKNESS) IN NORTHERN ANGOLA
======================================================

The sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis humana africana) has
turned into a major time bomb in Northern Angola. By 1974, the
last year of the Portuguese colonial period, the sickness
was basically eradicated with 45 known cases under
treatment and 3 new cases reported. This was due to the very strict
and, above all, regular screening of the whole population in the
affected foci and the subsequent treatment of positive cases.
During the last twenty years, with the ongoing civil war, the
system of control broke down completely and the number of
infected people has shown an alarming increase. The estimated
figure - exact data cannot be obtained because of
the war situation - is more than one million cases [nationally].
In some of our working areas the prevalence is
up to 80% of the entire population in the remote
villages.
Brief description: Most ProMED subscribers are familiar with
this disease, but for the nonspecialist, here is a brief
(simplified) description:
The disease is transmitted only by the bite of the tse-tse fly
[Glossina] and the host in northern Angola is basically man,
with the occasional case in domestic animals (under investigation).
The trypanosome is sucked in by the fly while it is feeding,
undergoes a transition and settles in the salivary glands
from where it enters the new host's body with the fly's
anticoagulant during the bite.
The disease has two distinct phases: after the bite, for about
three months the parasite lives in the blood and lymph system, causing
symptoms similar to influenza or malaria such as muscular and bone aches,
fever and general weakness, with conventional medicine showing results.
After up to one year the symptoms disappear and the patient starts feeling
better, but nevertheless keeps on being a carrier and reservoir. In the
following, second phase, the parasite enters the nervous system
and eventually the brain. The patient gradually loses physical
strength, and the disease enters an aggressive stage, followed
by insomnia during the night and apathy/sleeping during the day
(this is the stage from which the disease got its name),
until, eventually, death, if not treated - which may be
up to 6 years after the initial infection.
Prevention is not possible, but treatment in the first stage
is quite easy, with PENTAMIDINE. In the second stage, the conventional
treatment is an arsenical drug, ARSOBAL. As it contains arsenic,
it is very toxic with a death rate of about 10% under good
conditions. The patient needs additional nourishment
(which is not always available) to support the toxicity.
One severe obstacle is the unavailability of the product on
the world market as it is only manufactured by a French
company, Rhone Poulenc, and the environmental laws of France
discourage production of the arsenical precursor, the stock of
which lasts for three to four years at most (assuming that
cases will not increase in incidence, thus using up the
supply sooner). There is a new American product, AFFLORITINE
or DFMO, with minimal side effects but the great disadvantage
of costing three times as much as ARSOBAL.
Our Project - ANGOTRIP - financed basically by the
Catholic Church of Germany, has the aim to re-activate
within the Angolan Ministry of Health the National
Programme to Combat Sleeping Sickness in three foci in
Northern Angola, which are Lucala-Samba Cajz in Kwanza Norte,
Umge-Quitexe in Umge and M'Banza Kongo in Zaire [province].
We have set up emergency tents, and received from Europe the
necessary medical and laboratory equipment to screen the
population and begin treatment in the first stage.
Basically-trained field staff is available in our areas
of activities.
Unforunately our Project does not have funds to
purchase the American product (AFFLORITINE), and the first
ARSOBAL will only be available by mid-March. (This is a death
sentence for literally thousands of patients who cannot be helped!)
Our team consists of an Angolan Project Coordinator, medical doctor
and specialist in sleeping sickness, assisted by a German
specialist and a young Angolan doctor, an Angolan veterinarian
to treat the entomological aspects and vector control and myself,
a German agricultural engineer, in charge of organizing
logistics and to "get the Project going".
Financing is secured until the end of 1997 with the exception
of the purchase of AFFLORITINE.

case prevalence there, and let us know if you see any unusual
