Health authorities in Volyn Oblast report a tularemia case in a woman from the village of Sadiv in Lutsk district. According to the results of the epidemiological investigation, it was established that the disease was probably caused by a bite of an insect (fly) on 20 Jun this year [2021].

The patient had symptoms typical of tularemia: during the day the body temperature rose, and chills appeared. On the 3rd day, there were complaints of redness and swelling of the skin at the site of the insect bite, joint pain, and enlarged cervical and inguinal lymph nodes characteristic of tularemia.

Infectious disease doctors suspected tularemia and performed the necessary selection of material for laboratory testing. Laboratory analysis confirmed tularemia. The patient is in outpatient treatment at the Volyn Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital with a diagnosis of "tularemia, ulcerative-bubonic form, moderate" [ulcero-glandular]. This is the 1st reported case of tularemia in the area since the beginning of the year [2021].

[_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats.

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or, as noted, ticks and biting insects. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal (bacteremia without focal site) form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals.

Volyn Oblast is an oblast in northwestern Ukraine. Its administrative center is Lutsk. - Mod.LL
