Epidemiological comment: On 5 Mar [2014], a private veterinarian was informed of the presence of animals with neurological signs in a livestock farm in Cerro Largo, 5th police section, Sierras de Acegua. On this farm, 2 animals had died with neurological signs. Samples were taken and sent to the official laboratory and the diagnosis of rabies was confirmed. On 24 Mar [2014], the Official Veterinary Services were informed of 2 other farms with animals with neurological signs in the same police section. In one of them, there were 16 cattle affected, and in the other, 6 cattle and a sheep. Samples were sent to the official laboratory and the diagnosis of rabies was confirmed. The Official Veterinary Services are identifying all susceptible population in a 25-km [approx. 15-mile] buffer zone (history of bites, of animal with neurological signs) as well as shelters of vampire bats colonies. The Ministry of Public Health conducted pre- and post-exposure treatment in people in contact with animals (field workers, laboratory staff and official veterinarians). The Zoonosis Committee worked in the outbreaks and around them vaccinating pets (dogs and cats).

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); no treatment of affected animals

[Rabies is regarded as one of the most important zoonotic diseases in the world (a disease which primarily affects animals, but can cause disease in humans) (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RABIES-EN.pdf).

Bats are the source of most human rabies deaths in the Americas. Bat rabies has also recently emerged as a public health threat in Australia and Western Europe (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/).

Rabies of herbivores transmitted by the common vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) is called paralytic rabies. The disease mainly attacks bovines and equines, causing serious economic losses (Acha, 1968) (http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8348.PDF).

This report was notified as a group of outbreaks -- with a total of 3 outbreaks in the area of Acegua. The epidemiological comment in the report indicates that preventive measures are being done in both animals and humans. Acegua is located in the northern zone of the Department of Cerro Largo in the eastern part of Uruguay, bordering with Brazil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acegu%C3%A1,_Uruguay).

In 2013, Brazil reported 639 cases of rabies in its 1st 6-monthly OIE report, of which 109 were located in Rio Grande do Sul, a state which borders Uruguay (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail; note: to view the information on rabies, you need to choose the country or region, and scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).
