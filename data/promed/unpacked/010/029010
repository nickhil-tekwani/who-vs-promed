From: Dr. John Kirk <jkirk@vmtrc.ucdavis.edu>

_Pseudomonas_ is a waterborne pathogen in terms of mastitis. It grows well
in slime inside water hoses and drop hoses in the milking parlor. Replacing
the water hoses will often help. Sometimes it helps just to rinse the hoses
out well before using on [washing the udders. Also check out multiple-use
vials for antibiotic treatments. Also check out the teat dips as it will
grow in some of them. And yes, treatment is usually not productive and the
infections are characteristically long term.
