[1] Sri Lanka - Mannar District

A virus fever is spreading fast in Mannar district, and daily
hundreds of persons affected by the fever are seeking treatment in
the Mannar general hospital and private medical institutions, health
officials in Mannar said. Mannar general hospital is overflowing with
the large influx of affected civilians, hospital sources said.
Mannar hospital authorities are working around the clock to provide
treatment to these patients, with limited resources. About 20
patients are admitted daily to the wards in the hospital.
The mysterious virus fever, which originated from the village of
Pallimunai, has now spread to all parts of the district, including
the LTTE-held villages, civil sources said. [LTTE = Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam].
Dispensaries in LTTE-held villages are experiencing acute shortages
of drugs and related medical supplies due to restrictions on
transporting medicines from government-controlled areas, sources said.
Medical officers in Mannar general hospital have taken steps to send
blood samples of 10 patients in a special vehicle to the Medical
Research Institute (MRI) in Colombo to identify the details of the
virus, sources said.
Medical sources speculated that refugees who returned to Mannar from
South India recently may have brought the new virus to the Mannar
area, sources said.

[2] Sri Lanka - Country-wide

Sri Lanka's health authorities are fighting to control a viral fever
spreading in the country. Already, a student of the Sri Lanka Law
College has died from the fever, and the Law College hostel has been
affected by the virus that has made over 30 students sick.
The Sri Lankan Ministry of Health doubts [suspects?] that there is
spread of chikungunya fever on the island. High incidence of this
rare form of viral fever spread by mosquitoes has been reported in
the state of Kerala in southern India.
Health authorities have taken steps to send the blood samples of
these patients to Thailand for special tests. Officials of the
Ministry of Health Epidemiology Unit say they can ascertain whether
the infection is chikungunya fever after receiving the reports. The
Ministry of Health gave assurances that this is not an outbreak of bird flu.
Over 1000 viral fever patients have been reported from the Colombo,
Mannar, Kalmunai and Jaffna areas. The Epidemiology Unit said that
necessary measures have been taken to control the spread of the viral
fever. [If chikungunya fever is suspected, these measures presumably
include mosquito control. - Mod.JW].

[ProMED thanks Brent Barrett <salbrent@sbcglobal.net>, who also
provided a copy of the latter report. This is the 1st suspected
chikungunya virus epidemic in Sri Lanka reported by ProMED. The virus
continues to spread rapidly over South Asia, and one can reasonably
expect that outbreaks will occur in neighboring countries to the east
of India and Sri Lanka. ProMED will appreciate confirmation, or
otherwise, of the chikungunya virus diagnoses in the cases reported here.
