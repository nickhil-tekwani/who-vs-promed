AVIAN INFLUENZA - WORLDWIDE (59): DENMARK, WILD BIRDS, CORRECTION

In postings 20060319.0855 and 20060319.0856, the moderator stated that no
information on avian influenza cases in Danish wild birds was available on
the OIE website.
Fortunately, this statement can be revised. Denmark did not appear within
the list of countries included in OIE's table UPDATE ON AVIAN INFLUENZA IN
ANIMALS (TYPE H5) when the posting was moderated on Sun 19 Mar 2006.
However, a notification from Denmark, which was sent to the OIE on 15 Mar
2006 by Dr. Preben Willeberg, Chief Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary
and Food Administration, is currently included in the table. The
notification is titled: "Miscellaneous: avian influenza in Denmark (in
wildlife)." See
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_27.HTM#Sec18>.
The affected population is described as "a wild common buzzard (_Buteo
buteo_) found dead on a beach a few km south of the town of Naestved." The
notification includes the following comments:
- The Danish Veterinary and Food Research Institute will continue
investigations in order to clarify whether it is the H5N1 type already
detected in wild birds in several other European Union (EU) countries, and
samples will be sent to the EU Reference Laboratory in Weybridge, United
Kingdom for confirmation.
- In accordance with EU legislation, a protection zone (minimum 3 km) and a
surveillance zone (minimum 10 km) have been established around the location
where the infected bird was found. All poultry within the zones must be
kept inside, and all poultry holdings -- including hobby holdings -- must
be registered. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration will in the
near future inspect all poultry holdings in the protection zone in order to
look for possible further spread of avian influenza. Restrictions on
movement of eggs and poultry have been imposed within the zones. All
hunting within the zones is also prohibited.
We are glad to make this correction. - Mod.AS]
