----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the comment by the moderator, while _Mannheimia haemolytica_ and
_Pasteurella multocida_ have both been identified in bighorn sheep with
pneumonia, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ was also isolated from many of the
sheep in the outbreaks in 2010 (in some instances, from 100 per cent of the
animals sampled). To date, no viruses have been positively linked to the
outbreaks but many wild sheep herds have titers to parainfluenza 3 and
(bovine) respiratory syncytial viruses and one report detected a 4-fold
increase in titers to these viruses. Researchers have had difficulty
reproducing the severe pneumonia that occurs in the bighorns with _M.
ovipneumoniae_ alone. It could be that like _M. dispar_ in calves, that
coinfection with a mycoplasma and pasteurella causes a more severe disease
syndrome. In addition, it has been determined that a leukotoxin produced by
_M. haemolytica_ serotype A1 is virulence factor for bighorn sheep.
