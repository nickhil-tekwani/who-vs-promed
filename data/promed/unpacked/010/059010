[The HPAI H5N6 ("New strain") epizootic initially started in Viet Nam on 22 Apr 2014, causing 7 outbreaks in poultry until September 2014, and declared "resolved" as of 6 Oct 2014. The relevant immediate and follow-up OIE reports and an interactive map presenting the respective locations of the 7 outbreaks, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15802. The same virus had been identified in China and Laos earlier during 2014.

The event in Laos started on 13 Mar 2014; see immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15052. The event in China started on 23 Apr 2014; see immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15200.

It remains to be established how a new AI strain has been found to be circulating in the 3 neighbouring countries almost simultaneously (see also ProMED-mail archive post 20140925.2805654).

In China, HPAI H5N6 has been found to cause human clinical cases; as of 9 Feb 2015, 3 such cases have been reported. See Mod.UBA commentary in ProMED-mail's archived 20150212.3158362.

Information on the vaccine reportedly being applied in Viet Nam for "vaccination (of poultry) in response to the outbreak" (around the outbreak?) will be appreciated. Like H5N2 vaccine, H5N6 vaccine has been applied in the past as a DIVA or "differentiating infected from vaccinated animals" to protect poultry against HPAI H5N1. An inactivated, adjuvanted, heterologous H5N6 avian influenza virus vaccine, based on low pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Duck/Potsdam/2243/84 (H5N6), was produced and shown to protect cats against a lethal high-dose challenge infection with HPAI H5N1 (http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/content/89/4/968.full).

The following abstract of an "ahead of print" paper (Ref 1) may be of interest:

"8 avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses were isolated from live poultry markets (LPMs) in Sichuan and Jiangxi Provinces in 2014, including those close to the country where the human H5N6 infection occurred. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these H5N6 viruses are novel reassortants between H5N1 clade 2.3.4 and H6N6 viruses, and have evolved into 2 distinct lineages (Sichuan and Jiangxi). Moreover, the human-H5N6 virus was closely related to the avian-source viruses of Sichuan lineage, Notably, H5N6 viruses contained a T160A substitution in the HA protein and an 11-amino-acid deletion in the NA stalk, which may aid in enhancing viral affinity for human-like receptors, and virulence in mammals. As the H5N1 virus infects humans through direct contact, infection with the novel H5N6 virus raises significant concerns that the H5 subtype is a likely candidate for a pandemic. Therefore, extensive and long-term surveillance of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in LPMs is essential".
