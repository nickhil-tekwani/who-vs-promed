Researchers are stumped by a mystery disease that could kill a small breed
of endangered bats by destroying their ability to hear and navigate in the
dark.
Suffering from extreme dermatitis on their ears, 2 native short-tailed bats
were taken from their home on Kapiti Island and are being treated at Massey
University's wildlife centre near Palmerston North. The bats are an
endangered species.
Veterinarians performed biopsies and used antibiotics to treat later
infections, but surgeon Brett Gartrell said they had not found the cause of
the dermatitis. "That's been quite frustrating. We still haven't worked out
the route cause and it doesn't occur in bats anywhere else in New Zealand
or overseas," he said.
While other breeds of native bat in the Kapiti Island nature sanctuary were
unaffected, Dr Gartrell said all 10 of the short-tailed bats had developed
the skin disease.
The dermatitis, which looked like frostbite, distorted the bat's delicate
ears and with it the ability to use their sonar "echolocation" which
allowed them to "see" in the dark. Some bats had lost up to 2/3 of their
ears, he said. "For bats it's catastrophic. They rely on their sonar to
work their way around. They rely on echolocation to live."
Though the loss would have killed other types of bat, Dr Cartrell said the
short-tailed bats had been able to maintain a healthy weight, about 14
grams, because they sometimes foraged on the ground for insects and fruit.
This adaptation, and exposure to ground-based predators, was one reason the
highly endangered species was being moved from a colony in the Tararua
Ranges to Kapiti Island.
The tiny bats, no bigger than a human hand, are one of New Zealand's few
native mammals and are high on the Conservation Department's endangered
species list.

[It is early spring and still quite cool in NZ, but it is unlikely that it
is so cool as to cause frostbite on the ears. This report specifies that
veterinarians have taken appropriate samples, so it is unlikely to be
frostbite. We look forward to learning the cause of this mysterious
condition. - Mod.TG]
