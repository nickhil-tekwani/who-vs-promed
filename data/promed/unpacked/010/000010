A Congo [i.e., Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever = C-CHF fever epidemic was
unlikely despite the fact that two people had died in South Africa during
the past two weeks after contracting the highly infectious disease, Medinfo
spokesman Dr Steven Toovey said yesterday.
Reacting to recent reports about the death of two farmers in separate
provinces from C-CHF, Toovey said there was no cause for alarm.
"Normally, there are a handful of people who contract the virus every
year," he told [the press. "The clustering of the recently reported cases
may be due to climatic change or coincidence." Those who were at risk of
contracting [C-CHF were people who were bitten by a tick carrying the
virus or who were in direct contact with fresh blood from an animal
carrying the disease, Toovey said.
The most recent [C-CHF victim was [a 45-year old North West farmer 45,
who died in Klerksdorp on Saturday. An Eastern Cape farmer died earlier
this month in the Port Elizabeth provincial hospital.

[Quite right. No epidemic on the horizon. Infected ticks feed on
livestock and farmers can contract the virus infection from these or other
ticks from the livestock or, in unusual circumstances, from the cattle
themselves. Happens more frequently than one would like. The key to case
management is rapid diagnosis because C-CHF virus (family Bunyaviridae,
genus _Nairovirus_) is sensitive to ribavirin. - Mod.CHC
