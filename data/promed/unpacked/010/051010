A woman from Baghdad who was the only confirmed case of cholera in
the Iraqi capital has died, bringing the number of deaths from the
disease in the country to 11, the WHO said Mon 24 Sep 2007.
Dr. Naeema al-Gasseer, the WHO's representative in Iraq, said the
woman died Sun 23 Sep 2007. She was found to have cholera after she
turned up last week at the hospital with a severe case of
diarrhea. An official in the capital's Sadr City general hospital,
where the woman died, identified her as a 40-year-old who came from
the Jisr Diyala area on Baghdad's southern outskirts.
Iraq has a total of 1652 confirmed cases of cholera. Of the 10 people
who died in earlier cases, all were in the northern provinces.

[The gender and age of the Baghdad cholera case has been stated by
various sources as:
- Update (40) -- this one -- a 40-year-old female who came from the
Jisr Diyala;"
- Update 39: "a 25-year-old female who lives in Jisr Diala area/
Mada'en district of Baghdad Resafa;" and
- Update 38: "an elderly man from (Abu Etham village) of al-al-Taji
district near Kadhimiyah in al-Karkh neighborhood." Further updates
may be able to clarify this discrepancy.
The previous total of confirmed cases was1633, so has risen slightly.

At least 5 people died Saturday [22 Sep 2007] in Khim VDC of western
far-flung Kalikot district due to diarrhea. The ages of those who
died ranged from an 8-year-old child to 4 adults 30-50 years old.
The death toll in the village due to the outbreak of diarrhea has
reached 76 in the last 6 months. The village is a 3-day walk away
from the district headquarters, Manwan. 52 among the dead so far were
children below 8.
Many villagers have been left helpless due to the outbreak of
diarrhea. The number of patients in critical condition has not been
ascertained. Hundreds of people were displaced in 2006 due to lack of
agricultural production as drought hit this unfertile land.
According to a person who reached the district headquarters, the
reason behind the epidemic was lack of education and contaminated
water. At least 3 people, including 2 children, have died at villages
in Simraungadh region of Bara district due to diarrhea in a week,
reports our Bara correspondent.

[Cholera has been occurring in Nepal, and most of these fatalities
may be due to this infection.

The district of Kalikot is located in the extreme central western
part of the Midwestern Region, bordering on the Farwestern Region.
Bara, on the other hand, is located in the southwestern part of the
Central Region. The Central Region is where the capital Katmandu is
located. - Mod.LL]

The cholera epidemic that was reported in Hoima District and several
parts of West Nile District has expanded to Buliisa District. "There
is an outbreak of cholera in the district," Dr Francis Nyakoojo, the
Buliisa District director of health services said on Wed 19 Sep 2007.
He said the deadly disease has so far claimed the lives of 2
residents and left over 30 people hospitalized.
He said the patients are admitted at Buliisa Health Centre. He said
the areas most affected by disease are Bugoigo, Biiso and Wanseko.
Dr. Nyakoojo said many residents of the affected areas on the shores
of Lake Albert have no toilets. He said the residents excrete in
nearby bushes, while fishermen ease themselves in the lake. He said
poor human waste management exposes residents to such diseases.
