The number of cases infected in the [legionellosis] outbreak in Lisbon rose to 46, one more face to the previous balance sheet, keeping the death toll at 4, the Directorate-General for Health announced [Sun 12 Nov 2017].

Preliminary data subject to validation published on the website of the Directorate-General for Health at 5:00 p.m. account for 46 confirmed cases of legionnaires' illness since [31 Oct 2017].

Of the total number of cases, 8 were clinically discharged, 26 are currently hospitalized, and 8 are in intensive care units.

The outbreak of [legionellosis] in the San Francisco Xavier hospital in Lisbon caused 4 deaths, on [6, 9 and 10 Nov 2017].

_Legionella_ is a bacterium responsible for legionnaires' disease, a form of severe pneumonia that usually begins with dry cough, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and difficulty breathing, and abdominal pain, and diarrhea may also occur.

The incubation of the disease is 5 to 6 days after the infection, and can last up to 10 days.

The infection can be contracted by air (respiratory), by inhaling droplets of water or by aspiration of contaminated water. Although severe, the infection can be effectively treated.

[ProMED-mail posts reported on 7 Nov 2017, that the legionnaires' disease outbreak at a Lisbon hospital involved 26 patients and 2 hospital employees; on 8 Nov 2017, 2 of the 28 patients died; and also on 8 Nov 2017, the hospital's water distribution system, the suspected source, had been remediated to remove _Legionella_. The news report above says the number of confirmed cases has now risen to 46, and the number of deaths to 4.

We are still not told what _Legionella_ species was isolated from the cases, whether the genotypes of the clinical isolates matched each other, which would establish a common source outbreak, or whether the species and genotype of the isolate from the suspected environmental source matched the genotype of the clinical isolates, which would establish the transmission pathway. Information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. Also, a timeline that dates the cases by date of onset of symptoms in relation to the date of remediation of the hospital's water system, the suspected source of the outbreak, would be helpful. - Mod.ML
