[During the period 16-18 Jun 2017, there were a total of 4 newly confirmed cases, 2 of whom were attributed to the nosocomial transmission ongoing in Riyadh -- one in a patient and one in a healthcare worker. The other 2 cases included an individual from Hufoof and an individual from Riyadh, both of whom were classified as primary cases but still under investigation for possible high risk exposures. In this same period there were 3 newly reported fatalities, 2 of whom were classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases in patients, associated with the nosocomial transmission in Riyadh. The 3rd fatality was reported from Hufoof in an individual with a history of direct exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

While it appears as though the nosocomial transmission cycles in Riyadh may be slowing down, it is too early to make definitive statements.
