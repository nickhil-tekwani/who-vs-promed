Third piroplasmosis horse reported missing
------------------------------------------
A 3rd horse that tested positive for equine piroplasmosis was
illegally removed from quarantine in June [2009], stated a report
issued to the World Organization for Animal Health (Office
International des Epizooties, or OIE) by John Clifford, DVM, deputy
administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The OIE report lists the source of the current cases as
unknown or inconclusive, with notations for illegal movement of
animals and sharing of needles
[<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8222>].

In June [2009] animal health officials confirmed equine piroplasmosis
in Missouri after a horse formerly stabled at the Raytown Equestrian
Park was hospitalized and found to be positive for the disease,
setting off a foreign animal disease investigation. The stable, home
to 64 equids, was placed under quarantine on 6 Jun 2009. On 17 Jun
2009, someone removed 2 bay Quarter Horses that had been confirmed
positive for causative organism _Theileria equi_ from the Raytown
quarantine. These horses have not been located. Another 5 horses were
euthanized 18 Jun 2009 with their owners' consent.

According to the 26 Jun 2009 OIE statement, a 3rd positive horse was
also illegally removed from quarantine in Kansas. A spokesman for the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the Kansas horse was
a gray mare that had originated from the Raytown premises.

Equine piroplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by either of 2
different protozoal parasites that attack the red blood cells. It is
characterized by fever, anemia, weight loss, jaundice, and, in some
cases, death. The case fatality rate can be up to 20 percent in naive
horses (those which have never been exposed). The only treatment is a
potent type of chemotherapy that can have serious side effects in
some horses. United States officials have screened all imported
horses for piroplasmosis for nearly 30 years.

The equids remaining at the index premises had re-tested negative for
_Theileria equi_ as of 24 Jun 2009. Additional test results were
pending at the time of the report.

[Whoever earlier took the Missourian positive horses on 17 Jun 2009
removed locks on the stable and stall doors to access the animals,
according to a statement released by the Missouri Department of
Agriculture (see <http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=14458>.
How and when -- apparently sometime between 17 and 26 Jun 2009 --
this infected 3rd horse was removed from its stable in Kansas has yet
to be revealed. The websites for the Kansas Animal Health Department
(<http://www.kansas.gov/kahd/index.shtml>) and the Kansas Department
of Agriculture (<http://www.ksda.gov/>) are uninformative. Members
and especially veterinarians should be on the lookout for these 3
horses on the run. - Mod.MHJ]
