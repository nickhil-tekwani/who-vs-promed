A ground squirrel in the Stoneyvale Picnic Area of the Angeles
National Forest tested positive for plague, Los Angeles County health
and US Forestry Service officials said Thursday [19 Jul 2007].
The squirrel was one of a dozen captured in traps on 10 Jul 2007. The
picnic area, located 5 miles (8 km) north of La Canada-Flintridge, is
expected to remain closed for at least 10 days as crews dust for
fleas and monitor other squirrels.
"Plague is a bacterial infection that could be transmitted to humans
through the bites of infected fleas. However, it is very important
for the public to know that there have only been 4 cases of human
plague in Los Angeles County residents since 1984, none of which were
fatal," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's public health
director.
In 1996, 2 ground squirrels found in the same picnic area tested
positive for plague, as did a squirrel found in an adjacent
campground in 1995.
A ground squirrel found at the Doan Valley Campground on Palomar
Mountain in San Diego County tested positive for plague earlier this
month [July 2007].
Bubonic plague is transmitted through fleabites. Symptoms may include
the enlargement of lymph glands near the fleabite and rapid onset of
fever and chills.
If left untreated, plague can result in an infection of the blood or
lungs, causing pneumonic plague. All forms of the disease are fatal
if left untreated.
Visitors in the San Gabriel Mountains can protect themselves from
plague-carrying fleas by avoiding camp and picnic areas in the
immediate vicinity of ground squirrel burrows. They should also
refrain from feeding wild animals and avoid taking their pets into
areas where they could be exposed to fleas.
"Protection with an insect repellant containing DEET is also
recommended for persons visiting the Angeles National Forest and
engaging in outside recreational activities in other areas of L.A.
County," Fielding said.

[The article does not tell us specifically what type of ground squirrel was
affected, and there are many different squirrels. The common
California ground squirrel is _Spermophilus beecheyi_ (link to image
below).
The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each rodent
species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when infected,
are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other animals unless
their natural hosts are unavailable.
Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellants appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities. - Mod.TG
