Britain's penguin population is being severely hit by a brain disease
believed to be linked to an outbreak of bird malaria. Penguin experts have
linked the deaths to a kind of avian malaria which destroys the brain,
leaving the birds weak and bringing a speedy death.
David Warhurst, malaria expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, said: "The cerebral tissues in the brain are eaten away. The
malaria makes the brain comatose and that is what kills the penguin."
Magpies carry the disease and the warm summer weather had made it
particularly conducive for midges and mosquitos to proliferate it, the
professor said.
All 26 rare penguins at Marwell Zoo in Hampshire have died and Edinburgh Zoo
has lost several since the start of the summer.
At Marwell Zoo, discarded insect-egg cases in the penguins' pool showed
midges and mosquitos were breeding there. There was no chlorine in the water
to kill the insects. The birds lost were 21 rare African penguins and 5
Macaronis, worth UKL1000 each. Anna Meredith, the veterinarian who looks
after Edinburgh Zoo's colony of 160 penguins, said: "We have had several
deaths and a lot of sick birds."
London, Whipsnade and Chessington Zoos are preparing to protect their
penguins with anti-malarial drugs.
London Zoo, which has 41 penguins, said it had lost 5 birds in the past 15
years to malaria, & will be keeping a very close eye out now. The birds
rarely show signs before they are very ill.
Avian malaria also occurs in the wild and especially hits African birds. The
disease is restricted to bird species and cannot spread to humans.
