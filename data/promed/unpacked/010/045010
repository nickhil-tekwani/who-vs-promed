Coxsackie Virus (A or B) HFMD: 15 cases in schools in Watertown, Connecticut
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Watertown school administration decided to postpone an open house set for Thursday, 22 Sep [2016], due to an outbreak of Coxsackie virus, or hand, foot and mouth disease, in all 5 schools, according to Curriculum Director Janet Parlato.

Additionally, the Suffield Swim Team and Holy Cross Boys Soccer and Holy Cross Girl Soccer teams cancelled games with Watertown on Friday [23 Sep 2016]. Those decisions were made by the administration of the other schools, as Ms. Parlato said that after cleaning and disinfecting all 5 schools on Thu afternoon and evening, that Watertown was "business as usual."

Custodial staff washed and disinfected surfaces students and staff are likely to have touched, such as desktops, chairs, door handles, hand railings, health office beds, etc.

Ms. Parlato said the schools had 15 confirmed cases since last week until Thursday [22 Sep 2016], but had no additional cases as of Friday [23 Sep 2016]. Cancelling the open house on Thursday was really the administration exercising "an abundance of caution," according to Ms. Parlato.

"There would have been a lot of parents there," Ms. Parlato said. "Rather than expose them, we postponed."

No new date has been scheduled for the open house or the swim team meet, but the boys soccer team was set for Monday, 26 Sep [2016], and the girls soccer team was rescheduled for Wednesday, 5 Oct [2016].

According to the state Department of Public Health website, hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that causes a blister-like rash that is spread by coughing, sneezing, and touching infected persons or contaminated surfaces. Coxsackie viruses are spread through close personal contact. This can occur when there is direct contact with nose, throat, and fecal discharges of infected persons. Anyone can be infected, but the disease seems to occur predominately in children under 10 years of age.

A person may spread the virus to others just prior to the onset of symptoms, during the acute stage of illness and perhaps longer, since this virus may persist in the stool for several weeks. The incubation period is usually 3-5 days.

Symptoms develop 3-5 days after exposure. Most children will complain of a sore throat or sore mouth and loss of appetite. A fever of 101 to 102 degrees F lasts 1-2 days and is usually accompanied by sores in the mouth. Sores can also occur on the hands and feet and occasionally on the buttocks. The illness is mild and lasts one week or less.

There is no specific treatment for the disease, but its spread can be prevented by paying "particular attention to hand washing and personal hygiene," according to the state website.

Children and pregnant women are at greatest risk. If diagnosed, a child will need a doctor's note to return to school.

Ms. Parlato said the outbreak is "not unique" to Watertown, as there have been a number of cases across the state.

In addition to the cleaning, a number of precautions have been put into effect. Administrators, teachers, nurses, athletic directors, and coaches will be speaking to students with a consistent message about the importance of maintaining good hygiene, including frequent hand washing and not sharing personal items, such as water bottles and utensils. The administration also asked that parents remind their children at home "about these important and appropriate precautions."

[Coxsackieviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and the genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens. Coxsackie viruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackie virus.

Coxsackieviruses are nonenveloped viruses with linear single-stranded RNA. Coxsackieviruses are divided into group A and group B viruses based on early observations of their pathogenicity in mice. Group A coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a flaccid paralysis, which was caused by generalized myositis, while group B coxsackieviruses were noted to cause a spastic paralysis due to focal muscle injury and degeneration of neuronal tissue. At least 23 serotypes (1-22, 24) of group A and 6 serotypes (1-6) of group B are recognized.

In general, group A coxsackieviruses tend to infect the skin and mucous membranes, causing herpangina, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), and hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease. Group B coxsackieviruses tend to infect the heart, pleura, pancreas, and liver, causing pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and hepatitis. Both group A and group B coxsackieviruses can cause nonspecific febrile illnesses, rashes, upper respiratory tract disease, and aseptic meningitis (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/215241-overview). - Mod.LK]

An outbreak of hand, foot and mouth virus has been confirmed in Parma City Schools [Ohio] by district officials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The virus usually begins with a moderate fever before small, round blisters begin to develop inside the mouth, usually along the tongue and inside of the cheeks. Fluid-filled blisters can appear on the tops of the hands, soles of the feet and between fingers and toes. The virus usually lasts up to 2 weeks.

Typically, hand, foot and mouth disease is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory drainage from a sick person. No medicine exists to cure the sickness. Sick children are advised to drink cold fluids and frequently wash their hands.
