1st report of _Pantoea stewartii_ in Malaysia
---------------------------------------------
In Malaysia, a new bacterial disease of jackfruit (_Artocarpus heterophyllus_) called 'jackfruit bronzing' has increasingly been observed. Symptoms are characterized by a yellowish-orange to reddish discoloration of the pulp and axis inside the fruit.

In April 2016, diseased jackfruit samples showing bronzing symptoms were collected in a plantation in Pahang state, peninsular Malaysia. Laboratory studies (isolation, PCR, pathogenicity tests) confirmed the presence of _Pantoea stewartii_ (EPPO A2 List) in symptomatic samples.

[The fruits of the jackfruit tree (_Artocarpus heterophyllus_) can weigh up to 60 kg (132 lb) with almost 1 m (39 in) in length and are amongst the largest tree fruits known. Depending on the level of sweetness of different varieties, they are eaten as fresh or preserved fruit, or as vegetable. The crop is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas.

Fruit bronzing is considered an emerging disease of jackfruit in southern Asia. _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. (Pss, previously _Erwinia stewartii_) has only recently been identified in the Philippines as the cause of this disease (see link below). Further work is needed on epidemiology and mode of spread of Pss bronzing of jackfruit.

Pss is known as the cause of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (an important disease in parts of the USA and Europe) that is transmitted primarily by and overwinters in the corn flea beetle (_Chaetocnema pulicaria_). It also causes a leaf blight of rice and is considered an emerging pathogen of that crop (as is _P. ananatis_, ProMED-mail post 20170504.5012251).

The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_, which also comprises genera pathogenic to humans or animals. However, the majority of its members are plant-associated. Species in the genus can cause diseases on a number of crops, such as leaf blights of cereals (_P. agglomerans_), pink disease of pineapple (_P. citrea_), brown stalk rot of maize (_P. ananatis_ and a novel _Pantoea_ species), center rot of onion (_P. ananatis_). The effects of different bacterial strains on hosts can vary dramatically. The bacteria are generally transmitted by insect vectors, plant material, and infected seed, making them a quarantine risk.
