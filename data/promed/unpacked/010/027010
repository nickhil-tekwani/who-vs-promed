The Interior Ministry ordered on Friday [18 Dec 2009] the west-based
Coast Guard to prevent an Iranian boat carrying weapons and sick
livestock from entering the country.

The ministry posted on its website that the livestock were found
carrying anthrax after they were tested by Qatari authorities, which
earlier prevented the boat from entering the Gulf state.

The hunt also comes amid accusations of Iranian support for the
Houthi insurgents including providing them with weapons.

Apart from the topic, a campaign is to start in the next few days
that will call for boycotting Iranian products amid accusations the
Islamic Republic of Iran supports the Houthi rebels in the far north.

Chairman of the Watan Foundation for Boosting National Loyalty,
Ibrahim Malik Shuja'a, said the campaign comes in protest at asking
for external help against the national authorities. All Iranian goods
would be affected, he said, adding there must be no exceptions.

Earlier the foundation urged the government to cut the ties with Iran
because Iranian support had already reached the insurgents, who have
been fighting the army for almost 6 years.

Field reports pointed out on Wednesday [30 Dec 2009] that 50 bodies
of Somali dead livestock were found near the coasts of Honish
archipelago in the Red Sea.

The reports, prepared by field committees and discussed by the
expanded meeting of the General Authority for Developing Yemeni
Islands held on Wednesday [30 Dec 2009], affirmed that there is no
proof that the Iranian boat, which was carrying cattle rejected by
Qatari authorities, entered the country waters.

Meanwhile, the reports denied what has been cited recently by some
media about presence of large numbers of dead animals on the coasts
of some Yemeni islands, calling those media to investigate the
credibility and accuracy in what they publish.

The expanded meeting, attended by officials from the concerned
authorities, approved mechanisms of disposal of the bodies of dead
animals found off Yemeni islands in addition to the continuation of
investigating the source of those bodies that were found near the
coasts of Honish archipelago.

The participants affirmed the need to gather the efforts of all
concerned authorities to discuss the natural and human threats to the
marine environment of the Yemeni ports and islands and develop
suitable mechanisms to address them.

Earlier in this December [2009], Yemeni west-based Coast Guard hunted
an Iranian boat that the Interior ministry said was carrying infected
livestock. The ministry ordered the Coast Guard in Hodeidah province
[governorate] to prevent the boat from entering the country waters.

It posted on its website that the livestock were found infected with
anthrax after they were tested by Qatari authorities, which earlier
prevented the boat from entering the Gulf state.

[This report denies that carcasses have been found and then issues
instructions as to how these carcasses should be dealt with. And the
nationality of the washed-up carcasses is listed as Somali, not
Iranian. All of which may be true as Somalia has traditionally sold
livestock to Saudi Arabia out of the port of Berbera. Something is
happening in this region but what, is unclear.

At its most simple an 'Iranian' boat dumped the dead animals over the
side and the carcasses washed ashore, plus or minus the live
survivors. And/or a Somali cattle boat did the same. Whatever, but
any international transshipment of sick livestock presents a
significant regional threat.

Anyone knowing what is or may be going on is asked to help clarify
the situation. - Mod.MHJ]
