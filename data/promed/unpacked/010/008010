B.C. bird flu outbreak 'concerning,' minister says, with 10 farms now infected
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in British Columbia's Fraser Valley are facing "intense disease pressure" from an avian flu outbreak in commercial farms that the agriculture minister says is concerning.

Lana Popham says normally avian flu aligns with bird migration seasons, but the latest infections in farms of the H5N1 virus have been consistent all year [2022].

The province said Monday [28 Nov 2022] 7 commercial farms in Abbotsford and Chilliwack had been quarantined with avian flu, while on Tuesday [22 Nov 2022], the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said 3 more farms in the Fraser Valley tested positive for the flu.

Popham says the federal Canadian Food Inspection Agency takes the lead when a farm reports an infection, but B.C.'s chief veterinarian has been proactive in helping to prevent the spread of the disease.

She says the testing lab is working 7 days a week with the capacity for about 300 tests a day.

The minister says the inspection agency has protocols in place to deal with infected farms and it often means "depopulation," or that the flocks will be culled.

She says the situation isn't as bad as it was in 2004, when 17 million farm birds were destroyed.

"And we're hoping it won't get there," Popham added.

There are 10 states with cases of avian influenza AH5N1
-------------------------------------------------------
The highly pathogenic AH5N1 avian influenza virus has been found in 10 states of the country, where 1.4 million birds are slaughtered, which represent 0.07% of the national flock, revealed the National Agri-Food Health, Safety and Quality Service (SENASICA).

"So far it does not mean any risk for the national supply of eggs and chicken in the country," the service said.

The strain originating from Asia was discovered in 8 commercial farms: Sonora (4), Nuevo León (1), Jalisco (2) and recently in Yucatán (1).

This is in addition to cases in 3 backyard farms in Chiapas, Chihuahua and the State of Mexico.

Previously, SENASICA reported cases had occurred in wild birds in wetlands in the State of Mexico and Jalisco, in a protected natural area in Texcoco and in parks in Baja California, Aguascalientes and Puebla.

Vaccines
--------
Given the massive arrival of migratory waterfowl, carriers of the virus, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER) announced that it has begun vaccinating birds in commercial production units, in areas of high animal health risk, and on farms where there are parent and breeder hens.

In the 1st stage of the vaccination strategy, the National Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality Service (SENASICA) and the National Poultry Farmers Union (UNA) plan to inoculate more than 6 million birds from production units in Jalisco, Sonora and Nuevo Leon," he said.

The general director of Animal Health of SENASICA, Juan Gay Gutiérrez, led a virtual meeting with more than 600 representatives of the poultry and veterinary pharmaceutical industries, in order to inform about the strategy and communicate the requirements production units must meet to access the biological.

He emphasized the vaccination strategy is complementary to the control and eradication actions carried out by the technicians of the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA).

In this sense, he called on producers to maintain and reinforce the minimum biosecurity measures and to comply with the provisions established by the National Animal Health Emergency Device (DINESA) in reference to the movement of live birds and their excreta.

Peru, Ecuador declare animal health emergency after bird flu outbreaks
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The governments of Peru and Ecuador on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022] declared 3-month health emergencies because of outbreaks of bird flu, after a wave of cases led to tens of millions of poultry being slaughtered in Europe and the United States.

Peru reported its 1st severe outbreak of the highly pathogenic type A H5 virus earlier in November [2022], shortly after Mexico said it would start vaccinating birds in high-risk areas.

Declaring a nationwide emergency, Peru's agricultural health service ordered all birds in a detected outbreak be slaughtered and buried at least 2 meters deep.

Doris Rodriguez, an official from Peru's wildlife and forestry service, told radio station RPP some 13 800 birds have died from bird flu, including around 10 000 pelicans -- mainly in the north and center of the country.

In Ecuador, the outbreak was 1st detected over the weekend at a poultry farm in the Andean province of Cotopaxi, leading to quarantine measures across potentially infected areas.

Some 180 000 birds in the area are set to be slaughtered to prevent the spread of the virus, Ecuador's agriculture ministry said in a statement. The government has guaranteed the safety of consuming eggs and chicken meat.

"During the next 90 days, it will not be possible to move birds, products and by-products of avian origin such as eggs, hens, chickens, among others, from the farms affected by the outbreak," the ministry said.

Local authorities said the detected contagion represents only 0.15% of the country's poultry population, which counts some 263 million chickens and 16 million laying birds. Ecuador's poultry sector generates around 23% of the agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

In the United States, bird flu has wiped out a record 50.54 million birds this year [2022], as the disease killed birds and farmers culled entire flocks to stop its spread. This has sent prices for eggs and turkey meat to record highs.

[4] North Carolina (Union County): backyard flock

https://www.ncagr.gov/paffairs/release/2022/BackyardFlockinUnionCountytestspositiveforHPAI.htm


Backyard flock in Union County tests positive for HPAI
------------------------------------------------------
A backyard chicken flock in Union County has tested positive for High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI). The positive sample was identified by the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Diagnostic Lab in Raleigh.

This is the 1st confirmed positive in Union County. In late spring and early summer [2022], HPAI was found at 9 poultry farms in Johnston and Wayne counties and in mid-October [2022] HPAI was found in a single backyard flock in Wake County.

"We have had evidence the HPAI virus has remained in our resident wild bird population and in migratory waterfowl, so reports of backyard positive flocks are unfortunate, but not surprising," said State Veterinarian Mike Martin.

The flock of fewer than 100 birds will be depopulated to prevent spread of the disease. Other flocks located near the infected flock will be contacted as part of ongoing surveillance.

This type of HPAI virus is considered a low risk to people according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry. The virus is also not considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food supply.

"The threat of high path avian influenza is nationwide and likely will remain through the fall and winter," Martin said. "Commercial operations and backyard flock owners should continue to follow strict biosecurity measures including keeping birds enclosed without access to wild birds or other domestic flocks when possible."

If your birds are sick or dying, report it right away to your local veterinarian, the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Division at 919-707-3250, or the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System at 919-733-3986.

The warning signs of HPAI include:
- Reduced energy, decreased appetite, and/or decreased activity
- Lower egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs
- Swelling of the head, eyelids, comb and wattles
- Purple discoloration of the wattles, comb and legs
- Difficulty breathing, runny nares (nose), and/or sneezing
- Twisting of the head and neck, stumbling, falling down, tremors and/or circling
- Greenish diarrhea

24 000 chickens euthanized after bird flu detected at Western Maryland farm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials confirmed on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022] multiple chickens from a Maryland farm tested positive for bird flu.

Officials confirmed 22 birds were tested from a farm in Washington County, and all 22 samples came back positive.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture reported the H5N1 avian influenza was detected at a Western Maryland farm that has 10s of thousands of chickens.

Bird flu makes chickens very sick.

"And, highly pathogenic means it can pass from bird to bird very quickly," said Dr. Michael Odion, a Maryland State Veterinarian.

Dr. Odion, who is in Washington County, said the chickens at the farm needed to be euthanized to contain the spread of the disease.

"The chickens on this particular farm have been depopulated very humanely," Dr. Odion said.

That means all 24 000 chickens have been killed.

The usual season for bird flu coincides with migration this time of year, but cases nationally have been popping up year-round.

"This particular virus did not read the textbook," Dr. Odion said. "We have cases in 46 states across the country."

The virus is often spread from wild ducks and geese.

"We have a highly pathogenic strain that seems to be circulating in waterfowl, other wild birds, even some marine mammals," said Dr. Pitesy, UC Davis Professor of Poultry and Food Safety.

The outbreaks nationwide are part of the cause of rising poultry and egg prices.

Dr. Odion said the public should know food safety measures are strong nationwide and those with poultry should take precautions.

"All poultry farms, whether you're commercial or backyard, should follow the strictest level, the highest level of biosecurity possible," Dr. Odion said.

Bird flu kills millions of birds, but usually does not infect people, although a Colorado man tested positive in April [2022] with minor symptoms.

Officials report 2 more cases of avian flu in Utah birds
--------------------------------------------------------
The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food reported new cases of avian influenza in Utah birds in November [2022].

The department identified cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a flock of backyard chickens in Utah County and a flock of game birds in Iron County. The department said all birds at the locations have been "depopulated and surveillance will continue in surrounding areas to prevent further spread of the disease."

This has been the deadliest year [2022] for avian flu on record, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which released data last week showing that more than 50.5 million birds have been killed by the disease. A recent outbreak at a Nebraska farm forced officials to kill nearly 2 million chickens.

Avian flu can be fatal for birds, and flocks are often culled to control the spread of disease after a bird has tested positive.

The U.S. outbreak, which began in February (2022], has contributed to rising prices for eggs and turkey meat. Turkey farms make up more than 70% of infected farms this year, and 85% of cases have been traced to wild birds.

Utah agriculture officials are asking domestic bird owners to keep birds locked inside enclosures to avoid contact with migratory birds. Flocks should also not share water, feed or grazing sources with wild birds.

In October [2022], Utah reported 6 additional cases of avian flu on turkey farms.

New avian flu cases in South Dakota, Maryland, Illinois
-------------------------------------------------------
Four South Dakota turkey flocks, one Maryland table egg breeder flock and one upland gamebird producer in Illinois are the latest confirmed cases.

Six new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been confirmed in the United States, with 4 of those being in South Dakota and 1 each in Maryland and Illinois.

The latest confirmed cases were announced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

Avian influenza in South Dakota
-------------------------------
APHIS confirmed the presence of HPAI in 2 South Dakota commercial meat turkey flocks on 29 Nov 2022 and 2 more on 30 Nov 2022. All 4 of those cases were found in separate counties.

A flock of 71 600 turkeys in Hanson County and a flock of 32 900 turkeys in Spink County were confirmed on 29 Nov 2022, flocks of 75 100 turkeys in Charles Mix County and 50 500 turkeys in Hamlin County were confirmed on 30 Nov 2022.

With the 4 new cases, South Dakota has now had 54 confirmed instances of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks in 2022. Only Minnesota has had more flocks affected by HPAI with 79.

The Spink County case follows another case in that county which was confirmed on 25 Nov 2022, bringing its total number of cases in 2022 to 5.

The Charles Mix County case was also its 5th case, although the last case there was confirmed on April 1. It had been even longer since Hanson County had an HPAI detection, with the last case there being confirmed on 22 Mar 2022. Hanson County has now had 3 cases.

This is the 1st case in a commercial flock in Hamlin County, although the virus had previously been found in backyard poultry.

Avian influenza in Maryland
---------------------------
The presence of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial table egg breeder flock in Washington County, Maryland, on 29 Nov 2022. There were 24 600 birds in that flock.

State officials quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease, the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) announced in a press release.

Maryland Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder said: "MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks."

This is the 1st HPAI case in Washington County, but the 5th for Maryland. Three of those were in Cecil County, while the other was in Queen Anne's County. This is the state's 1st confirmed case in commercial poultry since 18 Mar 2022.

Avian influenza in Illinois
---------------------------
For the 1st time in 2022, HPAI was confirmed in a commercial operation in Illinois, with an upland gamebird production farm affected. The flock, in Grundy County, included about 8000 birds.

That case was confirmed on 30 Nov 2022.

Prior to this, Illinois had only seen 4 backyard flocks affected by HPAI.

British Columbia has one more HPAI case
---------------------------------------
One more case of HPAI was confirmed in commercial poultry in British Columbia on 30 Nov 2022. This particular case was in Chilliwack, making this the 12th case for the municipality, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

Specific details about the flock size or the type of birds in the flock have not been disclosed.

With the most recent case, British Columbia and Alberta share the status as the province with the most confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks in 2022. Both have had 38 cases.

[Unfortunately, avian influenza is still causing devastation with all avian species, wild and domestic.

Multiple countries and millions of animals are affected. A sad situation for the producers, the regulators, and most especially for the animals. Hopefully, these people are receiving some sort of compensation for their animals. Flock destruction takes an emotional toll on those doing the depopulation, on those whose animals are being destroyed, on the available meat and eggs available to consumers, and likely on the coffers of all.

HPAI spread its devastation with spring migration northward, and sadly, the return trip southward has continued the trend of spreading devastation.

Extreme biosecurity methods are needed, and strictly enforced on all premises where birds are. Keep your birds inside. Use only clean water sources, not ponds or other free-standing water. Remember, clean clothes, clean boots and gloves. An added precaution is a face mask, so the caretaker is protecting him/herself and protecting the birds as well.

Our condolences to all who have suffered loss to this disease. - Mod.TG
