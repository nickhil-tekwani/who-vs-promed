Recent testing shows that West Nile virus (WNV) was found in a Swift County horse. WNV is spread by mosquitoes and are a risk to horses and people.

"This is also a high-risk time of year for horses to become infected with this disease," said Dr. Courtney Wheeler, Board of Animal Health equine program director. "We strongly encourage all horses be vaccinated against WNV."

The infected horse was euthanized.

A horse in Union County has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 1st detection of the disease in Oregon horses for the 2019 season. The affected horse is a 25-year-old Quarter Horse mare with a history of "under-vaccination" for WNV. That is, the horse had received a WNV vaccination in years past but did not receive the recommended yearly booster this year [2019]. The horse is under veterinary care and is responding to treatment.

"Horses become infected with the WNV virus by being bitten by infected mosquitoes," said Brad LeaMaster, state veterinarian. "The serious neurologic disease caused by the West Nile virus is highly preventable. There are several efficacious vaccines available, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind horse owners to contact their local veterinarian regarding proper WNV vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk."

Along with staying current with an annual vaccination, horse owners can protect their animals by controlling mosquitoes and mosquito breeding areas. Approved repellents can also provide temporary protection for the animals.

WNV causes encephalitis and affects the central nervous system. One of the most common signs of WNV in horses is weakness or incoordination in the hindquarters. There may be stumbling, leaning to one side, and toe dragging. As the disease progresses, paralysis may follow. Fever is sometimes evident, as well as changes in behavior such as depression and/or uneasiness. Horse owners who suspect WNV infection should contact their veterinarian immediately. Early treatment can often decrease the severity of the disease. About 30-40% of horses that show signs of the illness will die. The majority of WNV cases in horses occur in the months of August and September, which corresponds to peak mosquito activity.

The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) works with mosquito control agencies and local county health departments to test mosquitoes for WNV. To date, positive WNV mosquito pools have been detected in Malheur, Baker, Union, Umatilla, and Morrow counties. The detection of the virus by OHA's mosquito surveillance program provides a warning and a reminder to horse owners to make sure their horse's WNV vaccination status is current.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture confirmed on 13 Aug 2019 that a 3-year-old Standardbred mare died of West Nile virus (WNV) in Mitchell County, Iowa. The mare's clinical signs, including recumbency (an inability to rise), began 2 Aug [2019], and officials confirmed her positive on 3 Aug 2019. The 1st 2 cases of WNV in Iowa horses this year [2019] occurred in Davis and Union counties in south-central Iowa in late June [2019]. Mitchell County is in northeastern Iowa.

West Nile virus transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include
- flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

One horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV) since 5 Jun 2019. Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, DVM, is reminding horse owners to vaccinate their animals for both EEE and WNV.

"It's been a wet season, and we are seeing an unusually high number of cases at this time," said Strain. "Horses are infected the same way humans are infected -- by being bitten by infected mosquitoes -- so everyone needs to take extra precautionary measures at this time."

If a mosquito bites an infected bird, EEE or WNV can be spread to horses, dogs, cats, and humans. These mosquito-transmitted diseases can cause inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs can include fever, loss of appetite, weakness, and loss of coordination. The disease can often result in death.

WNV primarily affects birds, but can also infect bats, horses, cats, dogs, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels, domestic rabbits, alligators, and humans.

Prevention includes removing standing water where mosquitos breed and using mosquito repellants safe for animals and humans. Horses can also be vaccinated. So far, there is no vaccination approved for people against WNV. Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian regarding proper vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk.

Veterinarians are required to call the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry if they suspect WNV in a horse, as it is a reportable disease.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed a total of 3 horses residing on separate locations in Larimer, Pueblo, and Weld counties have been diagnosed with West Nile virus (WNV). The 3 cases are Colorado's 1st confirmed cases of WNV in horses in 2019. These index cases were diagnosed by Colorado State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins in late August 2019.

Vaccines in horses have proven to be a very effective prevention tool for WNV, and horses having been vaccinated in past years do need an annual booster. If a horse has not been vaccinated in previous years, it will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-4-week period.

In addition to vaccinations as a preventative measure, horse owners should also reduce local mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using [horse-safe] mosquito repellents.

Neurologic horses and reportable diseases:
Any time a horse displays signs consistent with neurologic disease, a complete neurologic examination is warranted. Unless clinical presentation, epidemiologic links, or exposure is definitive for a non-reportable disease, always consider it to be a reportable disease and notify the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office.

A complete chart of reportable animal diseases in Colorado can be found on the CDA website (https://www.colorado.gov/aganimals/livestock-health).

[Choosing to protect your horse from one disease also means it needs protection from multiple diseases. Use of combination vaccines in most cases is the best method. The vaccines generally come in combination of West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. Your horse may need an initial injection followed by a 2nd injection approximately 3 weeks later.

Reduce or eliminate any standing water providing breeding places for mosquitoes. This may include the water in the catch pan of potted plants or in old tires, or persistent standing water from a break in a pipe. Sometimes with heavy rains or prolonged rainy seasons eliminating standing water is even more important. - Mod.TG
