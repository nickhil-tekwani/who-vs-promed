State health officials are investigating reports of 4 people getting food
poisoning from _E. coli_ bacteria. 3 people were from different parts of Oahu;
the 4th was a visitor to Oahu and the Big Island, state health spokeswoman
Janice Okubo said yesterday, 29 Aug 2005.
Okubo said the onset of their illnesses occurred between 12 and 16 Aug 2005,
and none of the 4 people was hospitalized.
The bacteria can cause severe illness and death. An estimated 73 000 cases of
infection and 61 deaths occur in the USA each year, according to the CDC.
There have been a total of 9 cases of _E. coli_ 0157:H7 food poisoning
reported so far in 2005, compared with 10 cases in 2004 and 9 cases in 2003,
Okubo said.
State health officials have issued a physicians' alert, notifying doctors of
the illnesses and asking them to report similar incidents. "Right now, we
don't have any type of cause identified. There's no common food exposure
history identified," she said. Okubo said while health officials view the
incidents as a cluster of cases, they do not know if the cause is the same.

[Since no clear food link has been found between the cases to date, it is
possible that food is indeed not involved. _E. coli_ O157 can be acquired in
other ways such as from water exposure (including swimming), and from petting
zoos or other livestock exposures. More information regarding these cases is
clearly needed. Because 8-10 cases is the usual yearly count, 4 cases in less
than one week is noteworthy.
It is important to note that, since the islands of Hawaii are major tourist
attractions, sporadic cases associated with this cluster (if the cases are
related) may follow on the USA mainland or in other countries. Therefore, this
alert may help to suggest an earlier diagnosis of _E. coli_ O157:H7 disease in
a traveler returning from Hawaii or a contact of such a person.
Early diagnosis of this Shiga toxin-producing infection can help by:
- avoiding antimicrobial use that may make the complications of this disease
worse.
- avoiding unnecessary surgery if the patient presents with significant
abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea or just gross blood, which might suggest an
ischemic colitis in an adult or an intussusception in a child.
Intussusception is when a portion of the bowel slides into the next, much like
the pieces of a telescope. When this occurs, it creates an obstruction in the
bowel, leading to swelling, inflammation, and decreased blood flow to the
intestines involved.
- avoid complications by fluid expanison during the early period of illness

Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections: association with intravenous volume
expansion. Pediatrics. 2005; 115:e673-e680. - Mod.LL]
