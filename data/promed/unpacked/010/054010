West Nile fever in Argentina
----------------------------
Disease never reported before in Argentina
Translation of information received on 21 Apr 2006 (dated 19 Apr 2006) from

Service (SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and
Food, Buenos Aires:

Areco, Buenos Aires province. They have occurred in 2 breeding farms of
purebred racehorses with 294 and 331 animals respectively. The dead animals

[In just under 7 years, West Nile virus has swept through the western
hemisphere. It entered New York City in late August 1999 and has now
arrived in Argentina. There is some evidence that it has been in Argentina
since 2004; see references below.
As the virus has become endemic in the United States morbidity in horses
declined dramatically from over 10 000 cases in 2002 to less than 1000
cases in 2005. See graph from USDA-APHIS at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nsu/surveillance/wnv/wnv_trends.htm>.
In addition, vaccines have been developed and approved for use in horses,
substantially reducing the risk to horses. While the disease can cause
severe neurological signs and mortality in horses, it can be managed by
mosquito protection and vaccination. Over the years, this disease has, like
any "good disease", behaved well by becoming less of a problem as it
develops endemicity. What, of course, you don't want is a disease that
stays as virulent as when 1st recognized, one that becomes worse over time
or for which we can't develop any tools of control.
More details of the outbreak will appear in the Weekly OIE Disease
Information report, usually issued on Thursday. - Mod.PC]
