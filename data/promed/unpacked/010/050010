Last year [2017], a 26-year-old man receiving treatment for leukemia went to a Swiss hospital's emergency room with a fever, a sore throat, and a cough, and was admitted. His condition worsened, and 17 days later, he died from severe complications of measles. The man's weakened immune system was unable to fight off the disease, even though he was vaccinated against measles as a child.

A new report in Open Forum Infectious Diseases describes the man's case, highlighting the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage in the community to help protect people with compromised immune systems from measles and other vaccine-preventable infections. "Measles is not harmless, it's a serious disease," said the report's lead author, Philipp Jent, MD, of Bern University Hospital and the University of Bern in Switzerland. "There is a responsibility to vaccinate yourself to protect others, not only to protect yourself."

Following the patient's admission in February 2017, he developed additional symptoms over the next several days, including a progressive rash, mouth sores, and conjunctivitis, that suggested measles, although he had been fully vaccinated against the disease with the recommended 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 1990s. A throat swab test confirmed the measles infection. Treatment with ribavirin (an antiviral drug), immunoglobulins (a type of antibody), and vitamin A did not improve his condition. He subsequently developed severe pneumonia and died.

The case illustrates how serious measles can be, particularly for people with compromised immune systems due to cancer treatment or other causes. It also underscores the importance of herd immunity in protecting these vulnerable individuals, the report's authors noted. When vaccination rates in a community are high enough, vaccine-preventable diseases like measles are less likely to spread, which helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated (such as newborns not old enough to be immunized) or, like the patient in this case, for whom vaccines are not as effective.

When the proportion of people in a community who are vaccinated drops below this threshold, however, as it has for measles immunizations in several European countries, outbreaks are more likely. More than 41 000 children and adults in Europe were infected with measles during the 1st half of 2018, according to the World Health Organization, exceeding the annual total of European cases reported in any previous year this decade. In the USA, there had been 142 confirmed cases of measles in 2018 as of early October, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data released by the CDC in October also showed a gradual but concerning climb in the numbers of US children who reach their 2nd birthday without having received any recommended vaccines.

"Ongoing efforts to raise confidence in vaccines and increase population immunity should be intensified," the authors wrote in the case report's conclusion. Physicians caring for people with compromised immune systems, the authors noted, should also ensure that those in close contact with these patients, such as family members and friends, are fully vaccinated.

Fast facts:
- People with weakened immune systems are at risk for contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, even if they have been vaccinated.
- In this case, a 26-year-old Swiss man undergoing treatment for leukemia contracted measles and died from severe complications of the infection, despite being fully vaccinated against measles as a child.
- Maintaining high enough levels of vaccination coverage in the broader community, also known as herd immunity, can limit the spread of measles and other diseases and help protect those who are especially vulnerable.

[Vaccination protects not only the individual who has been vaccinated, but it also is important to public health to build herd immunity to protect individuals who are immunocompromised or who have comorbidities. See post [3] also. The population must maintain 90% to 95% immunity to maintain herd immunity, although a figure closer to 100% of those eligible to be vaccinated would be safer because not everyone can be vaccinated. Unfortunately, the proportion of immunized individuals is significantly lower in many countries. - Mod.LK]

Greece reported a reemergence of measles in 2017 with 1027 cases, according to the latest data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority. The increase in cases began in August 2017 and has continued through 2018.

Since the beginning of 2018, Greece has seen 3258 measles cases (1885 lab confirmed). The highest frequency has been observed in southern Greece. It concerns people of Greek nationality (mainly young Roma children, as well as Greek adults primarily 25 to 44 years of age) susceptible to measles, among them healthcare professionals who were unvaccinated or partly vaccinated.

A total of 4 deaths have been reported among the laboratory-confirmed measles cases.

In Bukovina, a village in the Rukshin, Khotyn district, nearly 40 students were sick with the measles. A school quarantine was planned for 26 Oct 2018.

Most sick children are being treated at home, but 8 children are in hospital with moderately severe cases. A pregnant teacher in the 1st class also has complications from the disease.

Measles progresses, and we see the dynamics. Some children have already returned to school, whereas 7 have already got a pair [SARS and measles are overlapping]. This year ... there are complications. Tomorrow we leave for quarantine, said the director of the school, Rusinsko Sergei Shishkovskogo.

According to doctors, none of the victims had received vaccinations. However, of note, in the village of Petranka in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, 53 children ages 5 to 13 years fell ill with measles. MOZ found a violation of the requirements regarding the storage and administration of vaccines against infectious diseases.

California struck a blow for intelligent public health policy in 2015, when the state abolished all "personal belief exemptions" from child vaccine mandates. The new rules were designed to put a stop to the stupid and irresponsible behavior of parents whose casual approach to getting their children vaccinated against a host of communicable diseases -- chiefly measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) -- places their neighbors' children and their entire communities at risk.

The new policy bore almost immediate fruit, as its sponsor, state Senator Richard Pan (Democrat from Sacramento), recently wrote in the journal Pediatrics. (Pan is a physician.) [citation: Pan RJ, Reiss DR. Commentary: Vaccine medical exemptions are a delegated public health authority. 2018:142(5).] But Pan also reported that some parents who took advantage of personal exemptions in the old days have found a way to circumvent the rules -- and some California doctors are helping them. Personal exemptions have all but disappeared, but medical exemptions are on the rise. As my colleague Karen Kaplan reports, many of those medical exemptions are bogus.

The statistics on medical exemptions come from a study, also published in Pediatrics, which found that personal belief exemptions have been eradicated but medical exemptions are on the rise. Not all are fake, but the total is higher than can reasonably be expected. (My colleagues Soumya Karlamangla and Sandra Poindexter spotted this trend in its infancy last year [2018].)

Pan reports that a rise in medical exemptions had been expected after the crackdown on personal belief exemptions because many families eligible for medical exemptions had opted for personal belief exemptions, which did not require the same level of paperwork. But the surge has taken public health officials by surprise. "MEs [medical exemptions] more than tripled," he writes, with some schools reporting medical exemption rates higher than 20%, "revealing that many students received inappropriate MEs."

What is especially alarming about this finding is that cases of measles are again on the rise in the USA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 142 cases as of 6 Oct [2018], the highest figure since the 188 cases in 2015; if current trends continue, the caseload could exceed that figure to become the highest since the outbreak of 667 cases in 2014. The CDC reported 11 individual outbreaks in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Most sufferers were unvaccinated. Among the most severe outbreaks is in Rockland County, NY, which has recorded 33 cases and asked unvaccinated pupils to stay home from school.

The trend line even prompted Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, to warn via Twitter that measles "puts young children at significant risk." He connected the spate of outbreaks and the risk of a worsening spread of the disease to "debunked skepticism of MMR vaccine and our negligent accommodation of those theories."

Gottlieb's reference is to the handiwork of Andrew Wakefield, a British physician who lost his license for fraudulently promoting a nonexistent link between the MMR vaccine and autism. His claim has been utterly discredited but still can gain the attention of credulous individuals....

California's experience with tightened vaccination regulations demonstrates their effectiveness and the remaining challenges. Pan's Senate Bill (SB) 277 eliminated nonmedical exemptions for vaccination as a prerequisite for school attendance. In 2014 to 2015, only 90.4% of California kindergartners were fully immunized, below the 94% judged to be the minimum to confer "herd immunity," or to protect even those who could not be immunized for legitimate reasons.

After the measure was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown in 2015, according to researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, and Emory, the proportion of California kindergarten students reported to have received all required vaccines increased from 92.8% in 2015 to 2016 to 95.1% in 2017 to 2018.

But the proportion of pupils receiving medical exemptions rose to 0.7% from 0.2% -- with the sharpest increases tending to occur in districts that previously had been hotbeds of personal belief exemptions. That led the researchers to conjecture that the increase was due in part to "the willingness of some physicians to write medical exemptions for parents who are vaccine hesitant [but] whose children may lack scientifically justified medical contraindications."

Pan acknowledged that SB 277 made no changes in the law related to medical exemptions, which gives the authority to licensed physicians who turn over the paperwork to parents for submission directly to school boards. That is an imperfect arrangement, Pan says. "Granting MEs to legally required vaccines is not the practice of medicine but a delegation of state authority to licensed physicians to protect public health and individuals. Essentially, physicians are fulfilling an administrative role."

It is also a problem for state and county public health officials, who have no way to gauge whether the authority is being abused by individual doctors, and for state medical regulators, who have little ability to ferret out abusers. The Medical Board of California, as Pan told me, "generally acts on the basis of complaints from patients." In these cases, however, "the patient's family is in cahoots with the medical provider" -- vaccine resisters are not likely to file complaints against the doctors who gave them what they wanted. If the board wished to discipline a doctor for issuing bogus exemptions, it would have to go to court to obtain patient records, a lengthy, costly and uncertain process.

https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/2018-10-30-dhec-confirms-measles-spartanburg-county-resident


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) received a report of measles in a Spartanburg County resident who had recently traveled outside the USA. DHEC confirmed the case after receiving test results from its certified public health laboratory on Mon 29 Oct 2018. DHEC has begun a contact investigation and is in the process of notifying people who may have been exposed in specific settings.

DHEC has notified healthcare providers to be on alert for patients with signs or symptoms of measles. Healthcare professionals should immediately report clinically suspected measles cases to their regional public health office.

"Measles is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory illness," said Dr. Linda Bell, DHEC's state epidemiologist. "It is crucial that healthcare providers and the public be aware of the symptoms associated with this disease. It is proven that the best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. I strongly encourage everyone to review their immunization records and make sure they are up-to-date on all vaccinations."

Children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine: the 1st at 12 to 15 months of age, and the 2nd at 4 to 6 years of age. Children 6 to 12 months should get an early dose of MMR vaccine if they are traveling to a country where measles is common. For all ages, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are going to be traveling to another country.

The state has confirmed a case of the measles in Ocean County, New Jersey. A Lakewood man, age 27 years, developed measles after a visit to Israel, health officials said. [See URL above for locations where exposure may have occurred.]

Anyone who has not been vaccinated or has not had measles is at risk if they are exposed. "Two doses of measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing measles," State Epidemiologist Dr. Christina Tan said.

"We urge everyone to check to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, it protects others around you who are too young to get the vaccine or can't receive it for medical reasons. If you're planning an international trip, the World Health Organization recommends that adults or adolescents unsure of their immune status get a dose of dose of measles vaccine before traveling," Tan said.

The disease is remains fairly common all over the world, including in parts of Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports there are 19 cases per one million people each year; about 89 780 people die from measles annually.

In the USA, the disease is most often brought in by unvaccinated people who traveled overseas, the CDC said. Measles is preventable through the MMR vaccine. More information on vaccinations can be found at <www.ochd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Immunization-information.pdf>.

The confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County, New York, has risen to 33, with 5 suspected cases being investigated, officials said Sun [28 Oct 2018]. Rockland County has been grappling with a measles outbreak in recent weeks -- even asking students who are unvaccinated to not attend school.

To prevent the spread of illness, the Rockland County Health Department advises anyone who may have measles to contact their healthcare provider, local clinic, or local emergency department before going for care. This will help to prevent others at these facilities from being exposed to the illness.

Rockland officials encourage everyone to be up-to-date with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine to help protect them in case of any future exposure to measles in Rockland. The Health Department held vaccine clinics in response to the growing number of cases.

https://www.itij.com/story/114907/cases-rise-measles-epidemic-brazil


According to government data, the measles epidemic currently affecting Brazil's northern states of Amazonas and Roirama has reached a total number of cases of 2192 and has caused 12 deaths. The data also show that another almost 8000 cases are still to be confirmed. Reactive vaccination campaigns that have been ongoing since the beginning of the year [2018] are continuing.

In neighbouring country Argentina, measles reports are many times lower, but health authorities in Buenos Aires are concerned about the "active viral circulation" occurring in 2 health districts, and said that "at least 3 transmission chains were identified, without having been able to find the source of infection in any of them."

Advice for travellers is that they should check their immunisation status for measles -- the disease occurs in developed and developing countries, and unvaccinated travellers are at particular risk. Although infection tends to be benign in many cases, it can result in severe illness or even death.

The measles outbreak in Yala has worsened with 859 children now having been infected and the death toll standing at 10 cases, Betong district health official Wongwit Akarawarothai said on Tue [30 Oct 2018]. Wongwit joined other health officials in knocking on doors to have people in Ban Na Kor (Moo 9) in Tambon Ai Yer Weng vaccinated, resulting in 75 children under the age of 5 years receiving vaccinations.

Betong district has now vaccinated 571 children, 88.97% of the target, but many parents were still refusing such treatment for their kids, he said. This was despite officials explaining to them that measles often affected kids ages 0 to 4 years and that although it could heal by itself, many children developed complications such as lung and brain inflammation that could turn fatal, he added.

Yala's 8 districts saw 859 measles patients -- most of whom were children between 9 months to 5 years of age who had never been vaccinated before -- and 10 deaths during the period from 1 Sep to 27 Oct 2018.

The growing outbreak has reportedly stemmed from some parents in communities still not wanting to get their kids vaccinated despite officials' attempts to spread good understanding and the previously issued statements from the Sheikhul Islam Office and Provincial Islamic Committees saying that such treatment is acceptable under Islamic principles.

This southernmost province's aim has been to get 7000 at-risk children -- especially those aged between 5 months and 5 years old -- vaccinated by 4 Nov 2018.

[11] Philippines (Western Visayas region Iloilo city): warning
Date: Mon 29 Oct
Source: The Daily Guardian [edited]
https://thedailyguardian.net/local-news/iloilo-city-at-risk-of-measles-outbreak/


Iloilo City could face a measles outbreak due to the spike in cases and low vaccination coverage in the region. Councilor Candice Tupas, committee chair on health, sanitation, and hospital services, posed the scenario in a privilege speech during the regular session of Sangguniang Panlungsod on 16 Oct 2018.

Tupas particularly lamented the decreased vaccination rate in Iloilo City. "Parents refuse to get their children vaccinated despite the increasing number of measles cases in the city. From 76% in 2017, Iloilo has a decreased output for vaccination with 29.8% of semi-annual percentage in 2018," Tupas said.

Dr. Renilyn Reyes, Family, Health and Nutrition Cluster Head of the Department of Health-Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD)-6, reported 119 measles cases in Western Visayas as of 6 Oct 2018. Reyes said Iloilo City posted 10 measles cases this year [2018]. Based on the data from DOH-CHD, 33 measles cases were reported in Negros Occidental and 29 in Bacolod City.

Meanwhile, Iloilo Province recorded 21 measles cases; Antique, 16; Capiz, 6; Aklan, 3; and Guimaras had one case. Almost 50% of the recorded cases are children under the age of 5 years, and 61% are unimmunized, according to Reyes.

On 22 Oct 2018, DOH-CHD-6, in cooperation with the City Health Office (CHO), launched a supplemental immunization activity for the measles, rubella and oral polio vaccine (MR-OPV) in Iloilo City. The campaign, which is the 1st phase for the mass vaccination program of the DOH, started with a house-to-house drive where health officials are going around barangays from 22 Oct to 22 Nov 2018 to reach 339 183 children in the city.

If the parents refuse the vaccination, CHO head Dr. Bernard Caspe said they will convince the parents that the MR-OPV vaccines are different from the Dengvaxia vaccine. "If [they refuse] especially because of [the] Dengvaxia scare, we will reiterate that these vaccination vaccines are different because these are for measles and polio. Dengvaxia is for dengue," Caspe explained.

Tupas encouraged every parent to avail of the free vaccines and participate in the immunization activity. "Remember that vaccination has been proven to be the best public health intervention.... This is not only for the health of your own children but it will also affect other children," she noted.

Reyes explained that aside from complications such as pneumonia and diarrhea, measles can also affect the central nervous system and, in worst cases, can lead to blindness or even death.

[Dengvaxia's maker Sanofi has said unequivocally that its dengue vaccination is safe, but Philippine authorities disagreed publicly over whether it could have contributed to children's deaths. The resulting controversy prompted a dangerous plunge in vaccination rates in the Philippines for other diseases, which has affected public health. Health authorities have said child vaccination rates against illnesses like measles have dropped by as much as 25% over the previous year as public anger and mistrust grew in the Dengvaxia case. The problem is now understood to be the vaccine may lead to more severe symptoms for people who had not previously been infected with dengue. But hesitancy over the dengue vaccine remains and has affected willingness to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. - Mod.LK]
