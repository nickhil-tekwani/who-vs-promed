Huge jump in influenza B cases in South Australia
-------------------------------------------------
South Australia (SA) has recorded 982 influenza B cases this year
[2011], compared with just 18 at the same [time] a year ago. SA Health
chief medical officer Paddy Phillips says many cases have been in
young people. "Around half of those affected have been aged between 5
and 19," he said. "It is likely that the older age groups will also
experience an increase in flu as the season progresses.

"This year we've seen an early start to the flu season. It started in
May and the numbers are increasing." A flu jab includes protection
against influenza B, another influenza A strain [H3N2] and H1N1.
Professor Phillips says getting vaccinated helps everyone. "The more
people in the community who are vaccinated, the more it helps to
reduce the spread of infection among family, friends, work colleagues
and the community," he said.

In all, there have been 1295 influenza cases in South Australia this
year. The Influenza Specialists Group says it has already been a bad
year for flu cases, with the number of diagnosed cases up 4 times more
than the usual rate across the nation. Chair of the group Dr Alan
Hampson says it is unclear why 2011 has been such a bad year.

[This press report amplifies some of the information presented in the
most recent WHO Influenza Update. The Southern Hemisphere winter
influenza outbreak is now in full swing and so far Australia seems to
be suffering more than other countries in the hemisphere. In
particular the prevalence of influenza B virus infection in children
and young adults seems greater than elsewhere and in previous yeas.
