A 2nd rarely reported serotype, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Kisarawe, was added to the outbreak investigation after a sample from a bearded dragon collected from an ill person's home isolated both _S._ Kisarawe and _S._ Cotham. A search of the PulseNet database identified 5 ill persons infected with the same strain of _S._ Kisarawe, and 5 non-human isolates collected from bearded dragons.

As of 6 Jun 2014, a total of 150 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Cotham (145 persons) or _S._ Kisarawe (5) have been reported from 35 states since 21 Feb 2012. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows (listed in alphabetical order): Alaska (1), Arizona (4), California (24), Colorado (3), Florida (3), Georgia (2), Idaho (3), Illinois (8), Indiana (2), Kansas (6), Kentucky (4), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (4), Michigan (6), Minnesota (3), Missouri (7), North Carolina (4), North Dakota (1), Nebraska (1), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (3), Nevada (3), New York (11), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (5), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (5), Texas (7), Utah (3), Virginia (3), Washington (4), and Wisconsin (12). Additionally, the Public Health Agency of Canada has identified ill persons infected with the same strain of _S._ Cotham in Canada.

Among 95 persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 21 Feb 2012 to 19 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than 1 year to 79 years, with a median age of 2 years. 57 per cent of ill persons are children 5 years of age or younger. 56 per cent of ill persons are female. Among 83 ill persons with available information, 36 (43 per cent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been

Investigation update
--------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health agencies indicate that contact with pet bearded dragons is the likely source of this outbreak of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologic investigation update
----------------------------------
In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. To date, CDC has received a total of 46 completed questionnaires. 41 (89 per cent) of 46 persons interviewed reported contact with reptiles or their environments before becoming ill. When asked about the type of reptile, 36 (78 per cent) of 46 persons reported contact with lizards; of these persons, 33 (92 per cent) specifically reported contact with bearded dragons, a type of lizard. Ill persons infected with _S._ Cotham with _S._ Kisarawe reported contact with bearded dragons. The percentage of ill persons in this outbreak reporting contact with a reptile is substantially higher than the 4.6 per cent of USA households that reported owning a pet reptile in a survey conducted in 2013-2014 by the American Pet Products Association. State and local health departments are continuing to interview ill persons.

Laboratory investigation update
-------------------------------
The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a USA public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is an interagency partnership among CDC, FDA, USDA, and state and local health departments. The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in salmonella and several other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens and submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories.

CDC's NARMS laboratory has tested _S._ Cotham isolates collected from 12 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain. To date, 1 (8 per cent) of the 12 isolates tested was multidrug resistant (defined as resistance to at least 1 antibiotic in 3 or more antibiotic classes), and the other 11 (92 per cent) isolates tested were pansusceptible (susceptible to all antibiotics tested). The multidrug resistant isolate has shown resistance to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline; it also was intermediate (neither fully susceptible nor fully resistant) to ciprofloxacin. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin are commonly used to treat serious salmonella infections.

Traceback investigation update
------------------------------
The pet industry continues to work closely with CDC to determine the source of the bearded dragons linked to this outbreak in order to prevent additional illnesses.

Through this collaboration, multiple potential bearded dragon breeders have been identified that supply lizards to stores in the United States where ill persons reported purchasing their animals. This investigation continues and CDC will update the public when more information is available.

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk. Previously, the UK and the USA and currently Canada have reported human salmonellosis associated with bearded dragon exposures.

Pogona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
