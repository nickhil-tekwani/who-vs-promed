[The previous FMD event was reported in December 2014 in the Zambezi region. One outbreak of FMD subtype SAT 2 was reported. Although no additional outbreaks in this region have been detected, the event is still continuing; see a summary and updated map of this event at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016902_20150128_145846.pdf>. Although the FMD serotype for the outbreak reported in Kavango East has not yet been identified, there is a high likelihood that it could be SAT2. The Zambezi Region is almost entirely surrounded by neighboring countries. Its only domestic border is a short connection in the west with Kavango East [note: where the current outbreak is located Mod CRD
