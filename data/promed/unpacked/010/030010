[Mordovia is located in the central part of European Russia in the Volga
River basin. It occupies an area of 26 200 square kilometres (10 115 square
miles) and has a population of about one million. The capital of Mordovia
is Saransk (pop. 348 000) located 600 kilometres (372.8 miles) east of
Moscow. The Republic of Mordovia is an agricultural and industrial region.

Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to
infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to
develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches,
back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision.
Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the
eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute
shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe
fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus
causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause
severe symptoms, while Seoul and Puumala virus infections are usually more
moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months. For more detailed
