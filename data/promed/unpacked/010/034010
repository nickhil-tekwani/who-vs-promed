According to the World Health Organization, of the 32 countries participating in the World Football Cup sporting event, 19 have reported measles cases during 2013. The increased flow of tourists between Peru and Brazil may create an increased risk for Peru, where measles has been eradicated since 2002, according to Magda Hinojosa, Coordinator of the National Immunization Strategy of the Ministry of Health. "So far this year [2014], there have been 210 cases of measles in Brazil. This suggests that the highest risk of importation of measles into Peru will come from the increased presence in Brazil of visitors from counties in the world where measles is still a common disease.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms, runny nose, high fever and skin rashes. It can lead to serious complications such as blindness, meningitis, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea and pneumonia, especially in children, who are the most vulnerable. This year [2014], the health sector has acquired 840 000 doses of MMR (measles, rubella and mumps) vaccine. To date over 500 000 doses have been administered. The 1st dose should be administered in children between 12 and 18 months with a subsequent booster at 4 years. In adults, it must be applied with a booster dose at least 4 weeks after the 1st dose.

The Regional Health Authority of Callao has installed vaccination facilities at Jorge Chavez Airport for those intending to travel to Brazil for the World Football Cup events.

http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/medical_countermeasures/330992-u-s-sees-record-breaking-reports-of-measles-cases/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] announced on Thursday [14 Jun 2014] that it had recorded the largest number of reported measles cases in the U.S. during the 1st 5 months of any year since 1994.

The CDC saw 288 reported cases of measles between 1 Jan and 23 May 2014. "The current increase in measles cases is being driven by unvaccinated people, primarily U.S. residents, who got measles in other countries, brought the virus back to the United States, and spread it to others in communities where many people are not vaccinated," Anne Schuchat, an assistant surgeon general and director of CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, said. "Many of the clusters in the U.S. began following travel to the Philippines, where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013." In the United States, 90 percent of all measles cases were in people who had not been vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.

The Kansas City, Missouri metro area is the site of the latest measles outbreak in the United States. Kansas is reporting 3 cases. On 19 Jun 2014, Ryan Hobart with the Missouri Department of Health confirmed 11 cases in his state. A spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment told the Examiner on 18 Jun 2014 that all of the 11 cases are believed to be linked.

Nationally, the number of reported measles cases has risen to 477, according to the weekly report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 20 states have reported illnesses. A compilation of data from the CDC, the states, and media reveals a total of 493 measles cases in 21 states. Either total is the highest seen in the United States since 1996, when the year end number of measles cases was 508.

The measles outbreak has spread to another Ohio county, adding to what is now a total of 339 cases and 8 hospitalizations in 9 counties. A 3-year-old Crawford County girl displayed symptoms of the highly contagious respiratory disease after traveling to Wayne County this month [June 2014]. The child had received her 1st immunization but after the recommended age of one year old. She was closer to her 3rd birthday, an official said. Other affected counties are Ashland, Coshocton, Highland, Holmes, Knox, Richland, Stark and Wayne, with more than half of the cases occurring in Knox County. "Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to determine where we are in the outbreak," said Dr. Mary DiOrio, an epidemiologist with the Ohio Department of Health. "The problem with measles is that it has a long incubation period. People can get it and not show any symptoms for 2 weeks."

Measles symptoms usually appear 7 to 18 days after exposure and include a fever followed by a cough, a runny nose and a red, blotchy rash on the face that spreads down the neck and down the body over several days. It is most contagious 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears. It can be deadly in babies or young children.

Over 50 000 Somali children are severely malnourished, and a measles outbreak is making them even more susceptible to the disease, according to the UN. Nearly a 1000 cases were reported in May 2014 alone, bringing the total to 2350 cases since March 2014.

Despite resumption of the Gu (April-June) rains in parts of southern and central Somalia, pasture [for grazing] and water for livestock have been limited in the northeast. The harvest is predicted to be late and/or poor, which could adversely affect the food security and nutrition situation in Somalia.

Somalia is at risk of sliding back into emergency. Early warnings that the food security situation is likely to worsen are a combination of erratic and delayed Gu (April-June) rains, a disrupted planting season, and a blockage of supply routes leading to rising food prices.

Resumption of rainfall since early May [2014] have helped alleviate moisture stress on planted crops in agriculture-dependent areas and replenished water and pasture in pastoral areas. Even with erratic rains, parts of southern Somalia have experienced flash floods which have destroyed crops and displaced households.

[Additionally, it is usually recommended that all children in developing countries diagnosed with measles should receive 2 doses of vitamin A supplements given 24 hours apart. This can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Moreover, vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number of deaths from measles by 50 percent (http://www.allcountries.org/health/measles.html). - Mod.CP]

For 5 months of 2014, Kyrgyzstan reported 10 laboratory confirmed cases of measles aged 1-14 years, accounting for 50 percent of all cases of measles. 10 percent of infections occur in children under one year who have not completed the vaccination schedule. 40 percent of those 17 years and above had not been immunised or have no documentary evidence of receipt of vaccinations against measles.

Major outbreaks of measles since the beginning of 2014 have been recorded in Kazakhstan, Russia, the USA, Europe, and Ukraine. The main reason for the adverse epidemiological situation in Kyrgyzstan has been a decline in the proportion of vaccinated individuals. This has been due partly to internal and external movements of population groups. In addition, some parents within religious groups have not permitted their children to be vaccinated. Every effort is being made to identify all children up to 6 years of age who have not been vaccinated and to persuade their parents to permit vaccination. The vaccination schedule is in accord with accepted practice.

[Kyrgyzstan is a central Asian state bordering China. Kyrgyzstan became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Resentment of widespread poverty and ethnic divisions between north and south occasionally spill over into violence, and social problems such as preventative vaccination programmes are seriously affected.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Friday [20 Jun 2014] reported the 17th case of measles in Taiwan this year [2014] and cautioned the public to take precautions to avoid the disease.

The CDC said that travelers to high-risk areas, including China, Viet Nam, and the Philippines, should observe personal hygiene after the latest infection of a 28-year-old Taiwanese man who returned from Hong Kong on 3 Jun 2014. None of the 131 people who have been in contact with the man have developed measles symptoms, the CDC said, adding that it will continue monitoring those individuals through 6 Jul 2014.

The CDC called for alert amid higher instances of measles infections in neighboring countries than in previous years. China reported 35 677 measles cases during the 1st 5 months of 2014, a 95 percent increase from last year's [2013] number.

One case of laboratory confirmed measles was recorded in the Nizhegordskom Regional Health Centre in January 2014, believed to have been imported from Moscow. The case was dealt with promptly, and there was no spread of infection. The Ulyanovsk Regional health authorities believe that returning passengers who have been attending social, sporting, cultural and scientific activities abroad are the main source of measles virus infection in the Region [oblast]. Accordingly, travellers from Ulyanovsk Region to other countries in Europe and beyond should ensure that they have received protective vaccination.

In the Russian Federation for the 1st 4 months in 2014, a total of 3265 cases of measles (rate of 2.28 per 100 000 population) were registered. This figure includes 1354 children up to 14 years, which is 15.2 times higher than the incidence in the same period in 2013. During the 1st 4 months of 2013, a total of 214 cases of measles were registered, which included 73 children under 14 years.

In order to strengthen the immunity of the population of the region, during April-May 2014, an additional catch-up programme of measles immunisation of adolescents 15-17 years of age and other socio-professional groups was organised. In different regions of the Russian Federation, about 95 000 vaccinated adolescents and about 70 000 nomadic people and migrants have been immunised.

Routinely, in accordance with the National calendar of preventive vaccination of the Russian Federation, measles vaccination was conducted twice: for children aged 12 months (vaccination) and 6 years (revaccination). Persons aged 15-35 years inclusive who were not previously vaccinated or who have no information about vaccinations against measles, or who have not had measles are vaccinated twice with an interval of at least 3 months between doses.

Measles cases in the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) tripled from 2008 to 2012, the CDC said today [13 Jun 2014] in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases in the 23-nation region increased from 12 186 to 36 456 in that span, putting a serious crimp in plans to eliminate the disease from the EMR by 2015. That amounts to an increased incidence from 21.4 to 59.5 cases per million population.

Nations with conflict and insecurity or with a high incidence of measles saw large outbreaks, with the largest in Iraq (35 822 cases, 2008-09), Somalia (27 281 cases, 2011-12), Pakistan (16 753 cases, 2010-12), and Sudan (14 139 cases, 2011-12).

Achieving measles elimination in the region requires 2 doses of vaccine, the CDC said. In 2012, 10 countries had measles vaccination coverage of 95 percent or higher; 2 had coverage from 90 percent to 94 percent; 10 had coverage under 90 percent (ranging from 46 percent to 85 percent), and one had no coverage data available.

...These [measles] cases are both from the same family as the primary school-aged child who tested positive to the highly contagious condition early this month [June 2014]. [See: Measles update 24, part 11]. Unit director Dr Penny Hutchinson said it was the 5th confirmed case locally in the past 2 months, with 41 reported across the state so far this year [2014].

She said people should be aware of symptoms, including fever, cough and runny nose. "Symptoms usually start around 10 days but can occur between 7 and 18 days after infection. Anyone who thinks they may have come into contact with the patient can also call 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) for advice."

53 people in Hamilton are now confirmed to have been stricken with measles, 3 of whom are in hospital with the highly contagious infection. Several cases were associated with Fraser High School and one at Hamilton Girls' High School and Hamilton Junior High School. Hamilton Girls' High School principal Marie Gordon said the school responded swiftly to the one confirmed case. Meanwhile, Fraser High School will return to a full cohort today [17 Jun 2014], after keeping half its numbers off on alternate days because several staff were off sick with measles.

The public health unit is still investigating at least another 8 suspected cases from across the city. Of the 53 cases, only one person had been fully immunised with 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, and only 2 cases had at least one documented immunisation. All schools have notified parents of the outbreak, and both Girls' High and Fraser High have initiated a quarantine programme which is expected to continue until 23 Jun 2014.

Amid fears the outbreak may spread to the wider community, local schools in the Piako region have cautioned families to check their immunisation status. Population Health service has sent information to all schools, early childcare centres, and general practices in the region.

The number of confirmed measles case in Hamilton has risen to 60 with 5 of those hospitalised. Measles continues to circulate, and, while still largely associated with Fraser High School, there is a single confirmed case at both Hamilton Girls' High School and Hamilton Junior High School.

Waikato District Health Board's Population Health service is investigating another 14 suspected cases from throughout the city. "It's important, with the spread outside of the Fraser High School community, that people make themselves aware of the signs and symptoms of measles and check their child's immunity status," said Waikato DHB medical officer of health Dr Anita Bell. "Information has been circulated regarding the increase in cases to all schools, early child care centres, and general practices."
