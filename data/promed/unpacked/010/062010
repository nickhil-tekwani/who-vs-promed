A 60-year-old man who declined to get inoculated for rabies after being bitten by a stray dog in Karachi's Korangi district about 45 days ago died of the disease (rabies encephalitis) at the Indus Hospital early on Thursday [17 Jun 2021] morning, officials said.

"A 60-year-old male patient was brought to the Indus Hospital last night with full-blown rabies, having hydrophobia and aerophobia. Bitten on the leg about 1.5 months back in Korangi, he didn't visit any hospital and just applied home remedies. He developed symptoms 3 days back and died early Thursday [18 Jun 2021] morning," an official of the hospital told The News.

[The official] said that with the latest death, 5 persons had died due to rabies encephalitis this year [2021] at the Indus Hospital, [which] had treated and vaccinated over 4500 people with the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) and immunoglobulin.

"There is no dearth of anti-rabies vaccine and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment at the Indus Hospital. Only those people who don't get themselves vaccinated after a dog bite or who don't complete the course of vaccination and treatment are developing rabies encephalitis," the official said.

Fourteen persons have died due to rabies encephalitis at 3 Karachi hospitals -- Indus Hospital, Civil Hospital Karachi [CHK], and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) -- since 1 Jan 2021, officials said.

During the same time, over 20 735 people have been given emergency treatment and a complete course of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin given immediately after dog-bite incidents around the wound.

Officials at the Civil Hospital said they had received the highest number of dog-bite cases -- 11 535 -- till 31 May 2021. They added that all the patients, mostly women and children, were given the anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin at the health facility.

"Two of the victims of the dog bite, [who] came with full-blown rabies at the CHK this year [2021], probably did not get the PEP treatment for the dog bite and died, as nothing can be done for a person after the development of rabies encephalitis," Dr Tariq Sohail, a senior physician dealing with dog-bite cases, said.

He said that last year [2020], 2 people had died due to rabies encephalitis, while 17 340 people had been brought to the health facility for PEP treatment. In 2019, no death occurred at the CHK due to full-blown rabies, while 31 482 people had been bitten by stray dogs and given emergency treatment and vaccination.

"In 2018, we had one person who developed full-blown rabies, while 38 721 people were brought to us after having been bitten by stray dogs, and [they were] given emergency and PEP treatment," Dr Sohail added.

So far, the JPMC has witnessed the highest number of deaths due to rabies encephalitis this year [2021]. Seven [JPMC] patients have been provided hospice care after developing full-blown rabies, Executive Director JPMC Dr Seemin Jamali said, adding that they had so far treated and vaccinated over 4700 people after dog-bite incidents.

[As in too many rabies events, declining to seek immediate treatment and get inoculated led to the inevitable fatal outcome of the case.

Community education and outreach, one of the key elements in "Zero by 30," the FAO/OIE/WHO-published "Global Strategic Plan to End Human Deaths from Dog-Mediated Rabies by 2030," is meant to minimise the number of such negligences on the side of exposed people. The other key elements are improved access to PEP, especially for the poorest; mass dog vaccination; improved disease reporting; and surveillance tools.

The "United Against Rabies Forum," announced by the directors-general of FAO, the OIE, and WHO in September 2020, seeks to accelerate the sustained effort needed to deliver on the vision of the Zero by 30 plan. The technical document is available at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UCN-NTD-VVE-2021.1.

A recent (May 2021) letter to the editor from Pakistani professionals (ref 1), included the following final comment: "In order to meet the goal of rabies eradication by 2030, prompt action needs to be taken at all levels of government, health departments, and community. Using the One Health model, a comprehensive national programme is required, one that will be responsible for creating a registry for collecting, reporting, and sharing of data. It should actively support the sampling of infected animals and seek funding for the cause. It would also be responsible for training dog catchers and vaccinators. It is only with unanimous effort, inter-sectorial, and inter-regional collaboration that we may hope to meet our goal of a rabies-free Pakistan by 2030."
