I am sending you the following information for ProMED: "An anthrax
outbreak took place in bovines (bulls) when a herd of 300 were
grazing on corn stubble. This outbreak occurred during a drought (180
days with no rain). Approximately 15 days ago, it rained about 150
mm, and animals started to die, 5 to date. The herd has been
vaccinated for almost 290 days. All the animals died suddenly, losing
blood from their nostrils and anus. The animals were skinned (there
are 3 people involved), and the veterinarians that made the
necropsies saw splenomegaly, hemorrhagic enteritis and mesenteric
adenitis. This farm had another outbreak 5 years ago. It is located
in the Partido de Olavarria province of Buenos Aires, in the area
known as Blanca Grande."

[Thanks to Ramon for this report. Anthrax is an ongoing problem in
Buenos Aires Province, and more so than in any other province in
spite of an active program to control it. But the incidence is
dropping slowly. It should be noted that this outbreak occurred after
a drought broke. This is not unusual. The rain does 2 things: it
softens the soil and encourages a rapid growth of forage, with the
result that the hungry cows graze hard on this new growth and ingest
soil, in this case contaminated. Thanks to the prolonged dry weather,
their innate resistance will be down, and, therefore, the necessary
infective dose of spores is reduced. Et voila! - Mod.MHJ]
