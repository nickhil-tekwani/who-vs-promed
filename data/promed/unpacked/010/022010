Los Rios health authorities confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus infection in a 41-year-old woman who resides in the RÃ­o Bueno community.

This information was confirmed this [Tue 21 Mar 2017] by the Health SEREMI [local ministerial office] Denise Hermann, after tests were done on the affected person.

The physician stated that this new case implicates risk factors in more than one region, so that they must determine if the place where the infection occurred will be added to the Los Rios region or to another area.

If the infection occurred in the Los Rios [region], it makes the 8th person infected there.

[The report above does not indicate how serious the woman's illness is or if she is in intensive care. If she has developed hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, her situation could be quite serious. The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the woman might have acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
