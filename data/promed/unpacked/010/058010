"One final note, Oscar Wilde indicates with 30 bites daily there has never
been a refusal for post exposure prophylaxis in Thailand, even among slum
dwellers."
Was this one of the lesser known passages of "The Importance of Being
Earnest"?
All jesting aside, shouldn't that be Henry Wilde?
[My sincere apologies to Henry Wilde, who often contributes excellent
items to this list and thanks to Andrew Jamison for pointing it out. Every
time I sit down at the computer to moderate, I tell myself - in earnest -
that it is important to get up and take a break after 3, or at worst, 4
hours. Else, the message I moderate will become wild. As you can see in
this case, it happened again. At least I didn't make reference to O'Henry
Wilde or some other malapropism and that is a step in the right direction.
