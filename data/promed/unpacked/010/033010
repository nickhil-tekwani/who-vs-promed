An outbreak of suspected schistosomiasis has been reported in Ganze
constituency, Kilifi District.

Health officials said residents relied on contaminated water from a
local pan [shallow, flat, body of water that goes dry seasonally] near
Malomani primary school in Malomani sub-location, which they shared
with their livestock.

An official at Ganze Health Centre, who requested anonymity, told
Kilifi district commissioner [DC] John Elungata that there had been
an upsurge in the number of cases of diarrhoea.

"At least 30 cases have been reported at the health centre after
residents of Malomani, Mitsenzini, Ganze, Migodomani, and Dungicha
villages came to seek treatment," he said. "People are coming from
different villages for treatment complaining of diarrhoea and stomach
pains.

"A majority of affected youths have been passing urine mixed with
blood, indicating they are suffering from bilharzia
[schistosomiasis]," the officer said. The DC urged the Ministry of
Health to dispatch a medical team to investigate the cases before the
situation worsens. He also advised residents to boil water before
drinking it. "I am asking the Ministry of Public Health to supply
purification tablets as well as chlorine powder to treat drinking
water in the affected areas," Mr Elungata said.

The DC said the Department of Arid and Semi-Arid Lands would dig
separate water pans for the residents and their livestock in various
parts of the constituency.

Ganze constituency is a semi-arid area in Kilifi District, and has
been experiencing perennial water shortages. Residents mostly depend
on water pans and ponds that collect water during the rainy season.

[A recent survey of schistosomiasis in Kilifi District found eggs of
_Schistosoma haematobium_ in urine, as identified by microscopy in 8
percent of children aged 1 to 6 years (Bejon P, Mwangi TW, et al.
PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2008; 2(2): e164). However an earlier study found
prevalence rates of _S. haematobium_ between 2 percent and 85 percent
in the east and southeastern part of the district (Kombe Y et al. Afr
J Health Sci. 1995; 2(3): 338-43).

The presence of haematuria in the report above suggests that it may be
due to _S. haematobium_, but _S. haematobium_ does not infect
livestock. Furthermore, we have no information about incubation time,
but long-term exposure to the water seems reasonable. The suggestion
that most cases are in youths is intriguing. In Egypt, young boys are
most at risk because they swim in infected water bodies, getting whole
body exposure to the infection compared to most people who only get
hands and feet wet when using the water.

Further information is needed and if the haematuria is caused by _S.
haematobium_, eggs should be easily demonstrated in urine samples. -
