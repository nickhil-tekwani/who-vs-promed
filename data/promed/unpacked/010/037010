The head of the Animal Production Department of the Regional Services for Agricultural Development in Gafsa, Mohamed Amara, stated that the control services in the region had discovered 6 foci of bluetongue disease, including 3 foci in the district of North Gafsa, 2 in the district of South Gafsa, and 1 in the district of Sidi Boubaker, involving 5 cows and one goat.

He said that no deaths have been recorded, adding that the period of spread of this viral disease in animals extends between September and November of each year.

[The following comment by Mod.SF, included in the 12 Aug 2022 ProMED-MENA posting Bluetongue - Tunisia (02): (Kef) cattle 20220812.8705005, at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8705005, is applicable:

"Since its emergence in Tunisia for the 1st time in 1999, different serotypes of bluetongue (BT) were subsequently reported: BTV-2 in 1999, BTV-1 in 2006, BTV-4 in 2009, and BTV-3 in 2016. Results of a survey published in 2022 have shown a high seroprevalence of BTV among sheep in Tunisia. The neutralization test showed the presence of the following BTV serotypes: BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4, and, for the 1st time in Tunisia, BTV-26 (see archive 20220505.8703053 [at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20220505.8703053]). Although bluetongue is enzootic in Tunisia, the risk of introduction of new serotypes, circulating in neighboring countries, is permanent.

"Also, bluetongue in cattle is clinically indistinguishable from epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) (fever, anorexia, salivation, difficulty in swallowing, oedema, bleeding, erosions, and ulcerations in the mouth). EHDV was detected for the 1st time in Tunisia and in other Northern African countries in 2006. In 2021 several outbreaks were registered among cattle and wild ruminants."

Since the end of August 2022, new introductions of orbiviruses have been reported from Spain (BTV-4, EHDV untyped), Portugal (BTV, untyped, likely BTV-4), and Italy (Sardinia and Sicily, BTV-3, EHDV). As described in the commentary above, Tunisia is BTV-endemic, BTV-3 and BTV-4 included among its 5 BTV serotypes. EHD has been reported in Tunisia since 2015, recurring in 2021 and 2022.

Orbiviruses are known to be transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges and have been, most likely, windborne from North Africa. Finalizing the serotyping of EHD in Tunisia, Spain, Sardinia, and Sicily is anticipated. When obtained, the feasibility of cattle vaccination against EHD, a disease never reported earlier in Europe, with a matching vaccine, will have to be discussed.

Details of lab tests confirming BTV activity in Gafsa and serotyping results are anticipated. - Mod.AS
