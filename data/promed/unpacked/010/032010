The number of people who have contracted the disease in the regions
since January has already exceeded 5000, with at least 65 deaths. The
number of cases in Tacloban City, which now stands at 1194, has
already reached "epidemic proportions, said city health officer Dr.
Jaime Opinion.

Records at the regional office of the DOH show that from January to
28 Jul this year [2010], 5090 people across Eastern Visayas
contracted dengue, more than 1/4 of them in Tacloban City. The number
is the highest ever since the DOH started its monitoring in 1998,
according to DOH Region 8 sentinel nurse Boyd Cerro. During the same
period last year [2009], the region had only 1279 cases with 12 deaths.

By cleaning the surroundings, particularly those considered to be
breeding grounds of dengue-causing mosquitoes, the number of cases
will decline, said Cerro. "The campaign should be done every week to
ensure that even the kiti-kiti (larvae) would die and not just the
mosquitoes," he added.

Cerro said that all the provinces and cities in the region now have
confirmed dengue fever cases. Cerro also revealed that practically
all the hospitals in the region, both public and private, have
patients suffering from dengue.

More than 1500 people in the northeastern province of Surin have been
infected with dengue fever in the latest outbreak, which killed one boy.

The latest victim in the province was a 13-year-old boy who was sent
to hospital too late and died from a shock. The infection rate has
risen to 200 per 100 000 people in the city area while that in
adjacent districts is lower but continues to increase. The spread
situation is expected to be more serious than last year [2009].

The provincial hospital has asked the people and concerned agencies
to help clean up breeding sites of house mosquitoes in order to
control the spread of dengue fever. People are advised to seek
immediate medical attention if they are suspected of being infected.

Dengue fever on the rise
------------------------
Dengue fever has spread out rapidly in several southern, central and
central highland provinces. The number of infected people
hospitalized has increased sharply.

In southern Kien Giang province, nearly 800 cases of dengue fever --
3 of them fatal -- have been reported with children comprising half
of the total. In July [2010] alone, there were 155 diagnosed
patients, 23 more than in June [2010].

In central highland Kon Tum province, 322 people have contracted the
disease in 36 communes and districts. July [2010]'s infection rate is
3 times what it was a year ago [2009]. The provincial preventive
health centre said that the rainy season will boost populations of
mosquitoes, which are the main carriers of the disease.

In central Quang Tri province, although no fatalities have been
reported for the past few days, the number of infections has
increased sharply. In July [2010], 32 were confirmed, more than the
total number of cases in the 1st half of the year [2010].

Quang Tri province's preventive health centre sent doctors to halt
local outbreaks and co-ordinate with local authorities to eradicate
mosquito larvae and conduct mosquito survey in areas reporting infections.

According to health experts, the increase in the number of dengue
fever cases can be attributed to local negligence in carrying out
preventive measures.

A Wilton Manors woman said Thursday [29 Jul 2010] she caught the
tropical disease dengue fever on a 4 Jul [2010] vacation in Key West,
making her the 1st South Floridian outside the Keys to get the
mosquito-borne virus [in Florida. There have been several dengue
cases in Florida that have been acquired in other countries. -
Mod.TY]. The 51-year-old nursing student ... said she learned
Wednesday [28 Jul 2010] that lab results showed she had been stricken
with dengue fever [virus]. Officials from the Florida Department of
Health confirmed the case. The Broward County Health Department is
now investigating 3 probable cases, a spokeswoman said.

Key West has been struggling since September [2009] to contain the
1st outbreak of dengue fever in 65 years spread by mosquitoes living
in the continental United States, other than a limited number of
cases along the Texas-Mexico border years ago.

Health officials have confirmed at least 19 cases of the disease so
far this year, as recently as last week, after counting 27 cases
among Key West residents and one tourist last fall. It's the 1st time
since 1946 that locally acquired dengue has appeared in the same area
for 2 years in a row. The virus circulating in Key West has been a
milder strain so far, but stronger strains and repeated infections
with dengue can cause severe illness, internal bleeding and death.

Officials also worry that if Key West tourists get the virus there,
and then get bitten by mosquitoes when they return home, dengue fever
[virus] could spread into other areas. 2 of the 19 cases were
tourists from the Tallahassee area and one was from outside Florida.

Luckily, South Florida populations of _Aedes_ and other mosquitoes
are low right now because of the generally dry weather, said Joseph
Marhefka, manager of Broward County Mosquito Control.

Key West officials, meanwhile, have been trying to dial down dengue
fears caused by national news reports on the outbreak. "I'm trying to
dispel the notion that Key West is this well of dengue," said Chris
Tittel, a spokesman for the Monroe County Health Department. "It's
not an epidemic by any means."

The state remains on alert for the possible emergence of a new
serotype of dengue [virus] -- both DHF classical -- which could lead
to "an epidemic similar to those recorded in 2005 and 2006," warned
the State Secretary of Health and Social Welfare, Agustin Lara
Esqueda. He indicated that this possibility is noted due to "the new
serotypes of dengue [virus] that have been recorded in Jalisco,
Nayarit and Guerrero [states]."

The official explained that while cases of dengue in the state have
declined by nearly 60 percent compared to 2009, "it is necessary that
people do not let their guard down and participate in preventive actions."

State and municipal authorities will carry out, starting this week,
the National Basic Sanitation Day, now that "the state is going
through a critical stage due to the rainy season and there exists the
possibility that another [dengue virus] serotype circulates."

Lara Esqueda explained that Colima [State] has declined to 3rd place
nationally in incidence of dengue (fever) and now contributes less
than 8 percent of total cases in the country, against 22 percent in 2009.

Colima has currently registered just under 670 registered cases of
dengue fever with, so far, no deaths from the disease. In this
regard, he reported that from 2007 to date, only one [virus] serotype
has been in circulation, but in Jalisco currently (virus serotypes) 1
and 3 are circulating, in Guerrero 1 and 2, while in Michoacan and
Nayarit serotype 1 is in circulation.

The Secretariat of Health declared a state of alert in Nuevo Laredo.
Just one dengue case is confirmed, although 115 samples have been
sent for laboratory tests.

[So far in 2010] Baja California Sur registered the presence of the
mosquito vector of dengue virus, _Aedes aegypti_, in its 5
municipalities, with 304 [dengue] cases, said the director of Health
Services of the Secretariat of the Department, Fernando Moreno.

For its part, in Nuevo Laredo, the head of the Sanitary District V,
Jaime Emilio Serrano Gutierrez, said this month 13 suspected cases of
dengue fever had been reported, for whom tests were sent to the
laboratory in Ciudad Victoria, where they will be analyzed. He
emphasized that this year there is only one confirmed case of this
disease, indicating that currently the city is on high alert for an
outbreak, caused mainly by all the water that stagnated with the
flooding of the Rio Grande.

He explained that this year "have been 24 suspected cases of dengue
fever, 10 of them negative, one positive and 13 more are in the
analysis and results will be provided in 2 weeks."

The health secretary of the state of Queretaro, Mario Cesar Garcia
Feregrino confirmed 4 cases of dengue in the municipality of Serra
Jalpan that were seen in the general hospital in the area.

Yucatan [has] 642 patients of the virus [infection]. 8 days after
starting the Emerging Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control 2010,
health authorities reported significant progress in the program,
after covering more than 264 of Merida's neighborhoods. To date,
Yucatan recorded a total of 642 dengue cases, of which 364 are
classic and 278 DHF. Of these, 399 are in Merida. [This is an
extremely high proportion of DHF cases, suggesting that many
non-hemorrhagic, classical dengue fever cases are going unreported. - Mod.TY]

[control], campaigns have contributed to the reduction of its impact,
"but are not the determining factors to halt the epidemic. Despite
the campaigns carried out there is a very high number of mosquito
breeding sites because the essential thing is the extermination of
mosquito breeding sites," she said.

According to the epidemiological report of last week, the figures for
the disease [dengue] are 6458 confirmed cases or which 99 are DHF and
one death is reported. "We hope this does not increase. The problem
that has aggravated the situation in the region that also has
generally increased, is climate change that is the main reason," she

positive results for the population itself.

[12] Brazil (Roraima, dengue type 4 suspected)

<http://www.bvnews.com.br/cotidiano6528.html>

After 28 years of disappearance of dengue [virus] serotype 4, the
Roraima state Secretariat of Health through the Coordinator General
of Health Surveillance announced today [30 Jul 2010] the 1st
suspected case of dengue [virus type 4] in the state. The patient was
an adult male who presented with symptoms of the disease. The
physician requested laboratory test from the Roraima Central Public
Health Laboratory, which reported dengue [virus] type 4.

This Sunday 1 [Aug 2010] a laboratory technician of the Roraima
Central Laboratory will travel to Belem in order to analyze the
samples collected from the patient, together with the technical staff
of the Instituto Evandro Chagas, the reference laboratory of northern
Brazil. The definitive dengue typing results will become available in
20 days, per the norms of the Ministry of Health. [ProMED awaits
with interest confirmation of the serotype of the isolated virus by
the national arbovirus reference laboratory in Belem. - Mod.TY]

According to Alexandre Salomao, the patient is doing well and does
not need to be admitted to hospital. Actions to combat dengue in the
state continue.

Roraima registered its 1st dengue epidemic between 1981 - 1982. At
that time, dengue [virus] serotypes 1 and 4 were isolated. Since that
time there has been an intensive campaign to combat the [mosquito]
vector. The fact that the state is on the border with Venezuela,
where all 4 dengue [virus] serotypes are circulating, facilitates the
entry of these viruses into Brazil.

As of July of this year [2010], 5295 dengue cases are confirmed in
