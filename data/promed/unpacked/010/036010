LYMPHOMA - CHINA (XIAN): REQUEST FOR INFO
**********************************

From: "IHC" <ihc@swipnet.se>

One of our patients, working and living for a year near Xian in the
People's Republic of China, has developed a T-cell rich B-cell
lymphoma.
He has lived in a minor city in an apartment with mildew problems,
and been in everyday contact with the local population. He, and his
workmates, is now very much concerned about the possibility that
he has contracted the disease from some environmental factor in
the area, infectious or non-infectious.
Can anyone comment upon this? Is the frequency of lymphomas,
especially of this type, known to anyone to be relatively high in this
area? Does anyone know if exposure to mould could trigger the
development of lymphomas? What about exposure to a disease
panorama including TB and diseases caused by unsanitary
conditions, is the risk to develop lymphomas raised under such
circumstances?
