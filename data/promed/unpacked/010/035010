A Comment on Tick-borne Encephalitis in Europe
----------------------------------------------
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is very common in Russia, although there are
only a few reports with epidemiological data (I know about one annual
report indicating 5000 cases).

TBE is the disease subsuming Central European encephalitis (CEE) and
Russian spring-summer encephalitis (RSSE) and is caused by 2 very closely
related flaviviruses and transmitted by 2 hard ticks: _Ixodes ricinus_ and
_Ixodes persulcatus_). TBE is spreading, with an actual distribution
pattern from eastern France (in the West), to northern Japan (in the East),
and from Scandinavia (in the North), to Croatia and northern Italy (in the
south).

Besides the prevention of tick bites (repellents like DEET being less
effective than against mosquitoes), vaccination is an excellent
prophylactic tool, but unaffordable for many people in Russia. In Europe 2
vaccines are licensed: FSME immun(TM) (FSME is the German abbreviation of
"Early Summer Meningo-Encephalitis", a name that in fact is misleading,
since there is another peak in the fall) by Baxter and Encepur(TM) by
Chiron Behring.

[The International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (7th Report, Academic Press,
2000) lists Tick-borne encephalitis virus as a species in the Mammalian
tick-borne virus group of flaviviruses with 3 subtypes; European subtype,
Far Eastern subtype and Siberian subtype. As far as I am aware, current
vaccines are effective against all 3 subtypes -- but further information
confirming this would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
