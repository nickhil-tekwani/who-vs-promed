[The source is unclear. This was on a different village from that reported in February 2011, so we cannot presume that it was a repeat infection from a contaminated cattle grave. Livestock anthrax is sporadic in Croatia and therefore there is a potential for seemingly random deaths to not have the attention they deserve as this outbreak fortunately did this time. When there is feed contamination it is characterised by multiple outbreaks in a singular area, reflecting the feed distribution, and have no pattern as we usually see with farm to farm spread. And it stops as suddenly as it had started. We must await the result of their investigation. - Mod.MHJ
