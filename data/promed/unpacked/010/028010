More than a dozen dogs in a Utah city are infected with leptospirosis, a potentially deadly bacterial disease that can spread to humans.

There have been at least 13 confirmed cases of leptospirosis in dogs in St. George, KSL reports. Ten of the cases involve dogs being treated at the local veterinary clinic Red Hills Animal Hospital, while the 3 remaining cases are at other veterinary facilities in the area.

Veterinarians think an infected dog, possibly from Arizona, that stayed at a local boarding center called Red Rock Pet Resort may have spread the illness to other dogs, per KSL http://KSL.com. However, the source of the infection has not been confirmed.

"Leptospirosis did not originate at our facility; it can exist everywhere in nature. It's the No. 1 zoonotic disease in the world. It was likely carried into our facility by an infected dog and then passed on to other dogs," Red Rock Pet Resort said in an 8 Sep 2019 statement on Facebook.

Officials at the facility suspect the infected dog urinated in a "doggie pool" and subsequently infected other dogs.

"We're unable to determine which dog introduced this disease to our facility," the statement said.

According to PetMD, "Leptospirosis is an infection of bacterial spirochetes, which dogs acquire when subspecies of the _Leptospira interrogans_ penetrate the skin and spread through the body by way of the bloodstream. Two of the most commonly seen members of this subspecies are the _L. grippotyphosa_ and _L. pomona_ bacteria. Spirochetes are spiral or corkscrew-shaped bacteria that infiltrate the system by burrowing into the skin."

After a dog is infected, the bacteria spread through the animal's body, multiplying in the liver, kidneys, eyes, and other areas of the body.

"Soon after initial infection, fever and bacterial infection of the blood develop," the pet health website said. "The extent to which this bacteria affect the organs will depend on your dog's immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully. Even then, _Leptospira_ spirochetes can remain in the kidneys, reproducing there and infecting the urine. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal for animals if the infection progresses, causing severe damage to these organs. Younger animals with less developed immune systems are at the highest risk for severe complications. The vaccine is proven to protect dogs against most forms of leptospirosis and is critical to controlling the disease."

In dogs, which typically pick up the bacteria in muddy areas with stagnant surface water and heavily irrigated pastures, signs of a leptospirosis infection include fever, sore muscles, shivering, weakness, lack of appetite, increased thirst and urination, vomiting, and runny nose, among various other signs. Sometimes, however, the infected animal does not show any signs.

Leptospirosis is zoonotic, meaning it can spread to humans. Humans can contract the disease through contact with the urine or body fluids -- excluding saliva -- from infected animals or via contact with contaminated water, soil, or food.

"The bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth), especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water can also cause infection," says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In humans, signs include high fever, headaches, muscle aches, abdominal pain, jaundice, and vomiting, among other symptoms in the 1st phase of infection. In the 2nd (if a 2nd phase occurs), symptoms are much more severe and can lead to kidney failure, liver failure, or meningitis, according to the CDC.

The infection is treated with antibiotics in both humans and animals. A leptospirosis vaccine is also available for dogs.

"The vaccine is proven to protect dogs against most forms of leptospirosis and is critical to controlling the disease," veterinarians said, according to KSL.

[The population is more mobile, and for many years, vaccinations against lepto decreased, which left a naive population all across the nation. A pet from one region can easily bring the disease to another region because of our highly mobile society. Please have your dog vaccinated against this disease. I mention this because the article mentions Red Rock Pet Resort. This may be a doggy day care, or a longer-term boarding issue. As our population is mobile, the dog may have traveled and brought the disease back to the boarding facility without showing any clinical signs but still able to infect other animals.

"Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs.

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and, rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness, some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, and others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool, or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, a veterinarian may recommend a number of other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good, but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _Leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection."
