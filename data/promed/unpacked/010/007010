Feral pig tests positive for pseudorabies
-----------------------------------------
A feral hog infected with pseudorabies has been captured and shot in
Midland County, Michigan, says Keith Creagh, director of the state
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The disease and the growing number of wild pigs helped earn them a
"nuisance species" designation by the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR), which relaxes hunting restrictions on the animals; and this
latest finding of a diseased pig helps support a proposed sporting pig
ban that Department of Natural Resources employees could enforce
beginning 1 Apr (2012?), should restrictions not be enacted.

"The DNR is blowing a lot of smoke out there," said Doug Miller, a
construction worker who owns Thunder Hills Ranch in Jackson County,
which raises swine for controlled hunts. "The fact that that pig has
pseudorabies has nothing to do with (sporting pig owners). Our animals
are 100 percent tested."

Creagh said the USDA Wildlife Services commenced the Midland County
trap-kill-and-test program for hogs in June [2011]. Since that time, 6
feral hogs were captured and tested for pseudorabies and other
diseases. "One of the samples, it was a young, female sub-adult, came
back positive for pseudorabies," Creagh said. "And that's why we're
killing feral swine."

A sporting pig ban was to take effect 8 Jul 2011, but the DNR delayed
the action until 8 Oct 2011 to give legislators time to create
restrictions if they choose.

The order would prohibit owning or breeding non-livestock swine. A
Saginaw County gaming facility, which offered hog hunts to the public,
"depopulated" its Eurasian hog population in 2008 after an "endemic"
pseudorabies outbreak that affected 5 tested pigs, Creagh said.
Officials responded by banning the importation of hogs by game
ranches.

Creagh said he can't "definitively" say, but believes the captured
samples were of the "exotic and invasive" Eurasian bloodline
originally imported as game. Because of the H1N1 flu scare in 2009,
bio-security among livestock farmers was "really tightened," Creagh
said. He said livestock hogs are raised "mainly" indoors;
consequently, the chances of an escaped or wild hog interacting with a
domestic livestock pig and spreading disease is "slim-to-none."

If infected, pseudorabies restricts weight gain, resulting in
less-robust livestock, the main concern of pig farmers, Creagh said.
But Miller said "You don't see any real physical signs of them having
it until quite late in the disease."

[For a full description of porcine pseudorabies (PRV) go to
ProMED-mail 20080508.1578 and read the moderator's comments. PRV is an
extremely contagious herpes virus. Despite its name, PRV is not
related to rabies, and it is not contagious to humans; however, other
animals, including cattle, and pets, particularly dogs, are
susceptible to infection; it can be lethal in dogs.

Although the pig is the only natural host, the virus can infect
cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, and goats as well as wildlife, including
raccoons, opossums, skunks, and rodents. Experimental studies in
nonhuman primates indicate that rhesus monkeys and marmosets are
susceptible, but chimpanzees are not. Reports of human infection are
limited and are based on seroconversion rather than virus isolation.
Infections in horses are rare. In wild pigs, as in this case, it
presents a very significant risk to stock and yet one more reason to
severely cull wild and feral pigs.
