Pakistan reports 1st polio case in 15 months
--------------------------------------------
Type-1 wild poliovirus was confirmed in a child from North Waziristan on [22 Apr 2022]

A 15-month-old boy was paralysed by wild poliovirus in the 1st such case in 15 months. This is the 3rd case of wild polio to be recorded globally in 2022.

The type-1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) was confirmed in the child from North Waziristan on [22 Apr 2022] by the Pakistan National polio laboratory at the NIH, Islamabad, with the onset of paralysis on [9 Apr 2022].

The Pakistan polio laboratory also confirmed the detection of a positive environmental sample collected on [5 Apr 2022] from Bannu district of the same province. Both the viruses are closely related to each other.

Pakistan had reported 1 case last year [2021] with onset on [27 Jan 2021] in Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.

"This is, of course, a tragedy for the child and his family and it is also very unfortunate both for Pakistan and polio eradication efforts all over the world. We are disappointed but not deterred," Secretary Health Aamir Ashraf said. "The case has appeared in Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the poliovirus was detected in the environment late last year [2021] and where an emergency action plan is already being implemented."

The health secretary added, "The National and Provincial Polio Emergency Operations Centres have deployed teams to conduct a full investigation of the recent case, while emergency immunisation campaigns are underway to prevent further spread of the wild poliovirus in Pakistan."

[Vaccination drive kicks off on [24 Apr 2022] at https://tribune.com.pk/story/2353523/vaccination-drive-kicks-off-on-april-24]

Southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had been identified by the polio programme as the area most at risk after wild poliovirus was detected in environmental samples in the last quarter of 2021. Positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had been found in DI Khan and Bannu divisions.

"This validates the programme's concerns about virus circulation in Southern KP and strengthens our resolve to reach every child with the polio vaccine," National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig said.

To address the challenges in Southern K-P, the government and global polio partners had already initiated an emergency action plan to address the challenges in this part of the province," Dr Baig added.

In 2020, the K-P reported 22 cases, while no wild poliovirus cases were recorded in the province last year [2021].

Substantial progress has been made recently, with most areas accessible to implement immunisation campaigns, but deep-rooted problems and security concerns remain in limited areas. Despite the challenges, the programme's brave frontline workers continue to reach children with the life-saving vaccine.

Wild poliovirus types 2 and 3 have been eradicated globally, while WPV1 cases are at a historic low. Two other WPV1 cases have been reported this year [2022], 1 each in Afghanistan and Malawi.

The programme is capitalising on the momentum gained in the last year and continues to strive for zero-polio. Parents must continue to vaccinate their children during every immunization round until they reach the age of 5.

Pakistan remains 1 of only 2 countries in the world with circulating wild poliovirus, together with Afghanistan. Polio is a highly infectious virus and until this last remaining epidemiological bloc wipes out polio, children all over the world remain at risk of life-long paralysis or fatality by the poliovirus.

[While the last WPV1 associated AFP case reported from Pakistan (Balochistan) was in late December 2020, there have been multiple isolates of WPV1 from environmental samples In December 2020, and January, February, March, June, July, August and September of 2021 with isolates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sind, Punjab, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts.

Hence, the handwriting has been on the wall that circulation of the WPV1 had not as yet been interrupted in Pakistan. (see the following reports: Poliomyelitis update (21): global (WPV1 Pakistan ES, cVDPV2 multicountry) 20210904.8644347 (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Poliomyelitis update (18): global (WPV1,cVDPV1,cVDPV2), Pakistan violence 20210808.8577968 (Sindh), Poliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008 (KPTD), Poliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001 (1 each in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Poliomyelitis update (04): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210312.8242333 (3 each in Punjab and Balochistan.), Poliomyelitis update (03): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210309.8236114 (1 each in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan), Poliomyelitis update (02): global, WPV1, cDPV 20210222.8205197 (1 in Khyber Pakhtoon [Pakhtunkhwa] and 3 in Balochistan) and Poliomyelitis update (01): Pakistan, global (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone) RFI 20210102.8064119 (1 AFP case Balochistan, prior week had 4 positive ES in Sindh)).

It's also important to note that the WPV1 isolated from an AFP case in Malawi (Poliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529, Poliomyelitis update (08): Malawi WPV1, WHO 20220305.8701806) reported in February 2022 but had onset in November 2021 was genetically related to a WPV1 identified as a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.

In conclusion, the WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan, somewhat below the radarscope.
