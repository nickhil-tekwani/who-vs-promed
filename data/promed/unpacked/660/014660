A recent death of a snow leopard at the Padmaja naidu Himalayan Zoological
Park has caused a stir. It is only one of 14 snow leopards having died at
the zoo in the past 3 years. There have also been 14 Siberian tiger deaths
in the same 3 year period.
Similarly there have been 10 red panda deaths during 1997-98 time frame.
Recently tuberculosis has claimed the lives of several Himalayan Black
bears and the 2 remaining are infected.
This number of deaths in this short of time is [unacceptable] in any ones
eyes. Part of the problem may be the lack of veterinary facilities.
Repeated and frequent sedation is dangerous as physiology and the response
to the sedatives vary to a great extent from species to species and from
animal to animal. Wild species frequently sedated and transported into
Darjeeling for any veterinary treatments or care. This is dangerous to the
animal is not desirable. It has resulted in the death of a Himilayan tahr.
There is obviously a lack of veterinary facilities at the zoo but there is
also a lack of veterinary care as the veterinary position has been unfilled
for 10 years.
