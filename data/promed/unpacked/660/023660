In November 2017, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) identified an outbreak of acute hepatitis A. The increase in cases observed in Kentucky was well over the 10-year average of reported hepatitis A cases. Several cases have been infected with hepatitis A virus strains genetically linked to outbreaks in California, Utah, and Michigan. Similar to hepatitis A outbreaks in other states, the primary risk factors remain illicit drug use and homelessness. A contaminated food source has not been identified, and transmission is believed to be occurring through person-to-person contact.

[The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically. During the past 3 reporting months, the weekly number of reported new cases has remained close to or more than 100. Now we are over 4000, and it remains unclear what steps are being taken to stem the tide of this unprecedented outbreak. This posting reported 40 overall deaths; this is a hike from 25 2 weeks before, and it is unclear whether this is correct. - Mod.LL

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injection and non-injection drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and affected local health departments are investigating an increased number of hepatitis A cases in Ohio. ODH has declared a statewide community outbreak of hepatitis A after observing an increase in cases linked to certain risk factors since the beginning of 2018. Outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring in several states across the USA, including neighboring states of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable liver disease that usually spreads when a person ingests fecal matter -- even in microscopic amounts -- from contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by the stool of an infected person. Hepatitis A can also be spread from close personal contact with an infected person, such as through sex.

People at increased risk for hepatitis A in this outbreak include:
- people with direct contact with individuals infected with the virus;
- men who have sex with men;
- people who use street drugs whether they are injected or not;
- people who are incarcerated;
- people experiencing homelessness;
- people who have traveled to other areas of the USA currently experiencing outbreaks.

Symptoms of hepatitis A include fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, clay-colored stools, and jaundice. People with hepatitis A can experience mild illness lasting a few weeks to severe illness lasting several months.

People who believe that they are at high risk for hepatitis A infection should contact their healthcare provider or local health department for information about vaccination. People who know that they have been exposed to someone with hepatitis A should contact their healthcare provider or local health department to discuss post-exposure vaccination options. Individuals who experience symptoms of hepatitis A should contact their healthcare provider.

Hepatitis A Outbreak Summary (19 Feb 2019):
Number of cases: 1746
Illness onset range: 5 Jan 2018 - 13 Feb 2019
Age range: 1-84 years
sex: 60% male
Number of hospitalizations: 1092 (63%)
Number of deaths: 6
Number of counties with cases: 69 (78%)

[Ohio has been averaging 60 new reported cases per week over the last 6 weeks and is 3rd highest in total number after Kentucky and West Virginia. This week's newly reported cases are higher at 89.

As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official: "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations.

The ACIP in 2018 voted unanimously to recommend adding homeless individuals to the list of those who are at increased risk of hepatitis A infection or severe hepatitis A disease. That list now includes travelers, men who have sex with men, users of injection and non-injection drugs, people with clotting-factor disorders, people who work with nonhuman primates, people who anticipate close personal contact with an international adoptee, people with chronic liver disease, and homeless individuals (https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20181031acipmeeting.html). - Mod.LL]
