According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) dated Tue 24 Jun 2014, the epidemic of hemorrhagic fever declared in January [2014] has killed 270 people in Guinea, 66 in Sierra Leone, and 34 in Liberia, the latter, 2 countries bordering Guinea.

Guinea
------
Imam Thierno Ousmane Camara, a highly respected Muslim Guinea preacher, requests "the President not to minimize this disease that unfortunately continues to cast a pall over families."

An AFP journalist noted that in Conakry, there was no information campaign any more, not on radio or television, or in the streets. In bus stations, the port, and the airport, the controls are kept to a minimum, or are nonexistent. Bleach buckets are placed at the entrance of popular restaurants to sanitize hands.

Trader Mamadou Dian Sidibe says there is no more vigilance on the border with Liberia. "I come back, everyone is afraid, but nobody protects, I have not seen a single health officer who tells how to prevent its spread. The situation is serious between Guinea and Liberia," he said.

Liberia
-------
In the Liberian capital, Monrovia, anger against government inaction is the same as in Conakry. "Suppose the case of Ebola is true, what does the Department of Health do to raise awareness among people who are for the most part illiterate? Nothing," exclaims a 38-year-old [who works as an executive secretary]. There is no campaign, no specific measures, except for isolation rooms in hospitals for suspected or confirmed cases. "We don't have any budget for large campaigns," a Liberian health official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

In New Kru Town, considered as the largest focus of [Ebola virus disease, EVD] in the province of Montserado, where the capital Monrovia is located, the population continues to live as if the epidemic does not exist. [A resident] explains: "We are Africans, we are used to living in a community, and we will continue to live in a community, to shake hands like good Africans and eat together as good Africans. It's not necessary to scare us."

[2] Sierra Leone: foreign workers leaving

At least 20 overseas Filipino workers [OFWs] from Sierra Leone, West Africa are scheduled to arrive [in Philippines] in batches from 28 Jun to 18 Jul 2014 amid declarations by experts that the deadly ebolavirus in West Africa is now "out of control."

Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) quarantine doctor Noel Ramirez said the 20 OFWs manning agencies requested the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to help pull them out of the area because of the rapid spread of the dreaded disease. With more than 60 outbreaks in hotspots, international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders [MSF] earlier declared EVD out of control.

Ramirez said that they have the names of the 1st batch of returning OFWs, and "our focus is to monitor them, get vital information, and give them the health information and check list for our reference."

[3] Sierra Leone: civil society organizations
Date: Thu 26 Jun 2014

http://allafrica.com/stories/201406270930.html


Following the devastating outbreak of [EVD] in the country that has claimed the lives of over 50 Sierra Leoneans, local civil society organizations [CSOs] have come together to form the Civil Society Platform on Ebola (CSPE) to support the overall response to the deadly epidemic. The group, according to a press release, comprises a number of civil society organizations which first met on 20 Jun 2014. The meeting was convened at the Society for Democratic Initiatives-Sierra Leone (SDI-SL), with head offices in Freetown.

In attendance were representatives from African Youth Coalition Against Hunger (AYCAH), Transparency International Sierra Leone (TI-SL), Pikin-to-Pikin, 50/50 Group, Budget Advocacy Network (BAN)/NACE, Center For Accountability and Rule of Law (CARL), NewsWatch Newspaper, Every Child Matters Sierra Leone (ECM-SL), Society for Democratic Initiatives (SDI), Center for the Coordination of Youth Activities (CCYA), Network Movement for Youth and Child Welfare (NMYCW), and Health for all Coalition.

The platform, the release states, was created as a space for sharing information, coordinating civil society activities, and providing opportunity for organizations and individuals to contribute to ongoing initiatives.

"Recognizing that it is the duty of all Sierra Leoneans to play a role in the prevention and eradication of the disease, civil society finds itself similarly compelled to act. The need to augment the ongoing efforts is urgent. Therefore, CSPE has committed to contribute its members' resources to see an end to [EVD] in Sierra Leone," the release, issued yesterday [25 Jun 2014], states.

At the meeting, participants agreed that in this emergency situation, awaiting directives and donor funding would not be in the best interest of the population. The members agreed that an immediate and coordinated response, with whatever resources available at hand, is the only assurance to mitigate the damage and loss of life. "This outbreak of Ebola is a national crisis and necessitates a national response, both from the government and civil society," the group said.

Among many planned interventions, the group has agreed to engage in sensitization and information dissemination efforts to help reach those in the most affected communities. A bulletin of updates, according to them, will also be compiled and shared to keep the public abreast of the situation.

"Furthermore, acknowledging the essential shortage in personal protective equipment and disease prevention material such as gloves and chlorine, CSPE organizations will contribute to help fill these gaps. Each of the organizations is dedicated to carrying a share of the burden in their individual capacities," the release says. "CSPE is committed to support the Ministry of Health and Sanitation's effort, and to assist in the accurate information sharing that is critical to effectively bringing the spread of EVD to a halt."

[Denial is still a major problem.

The withdrawal of foreign workers before they start to produce cases is a sensible precaution to protect their home countries.

The coordination of multiple civil society groups in Sierra Leone to combat EVD is a great step forward and ought to be matched by the other 2 frontline countries. - Mod.JW
