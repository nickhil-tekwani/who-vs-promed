Southwest Georgia Public Health District is investigating clusters of pertussis, primarily associated with young children, in Colquitt, Mitchell and Thomas counties, Southwest Georgia Public Health District health director Dr Jacqueline Grant, said. Additional cases have also been confirmed in other counties. "Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an infection caused by bacteria," Grant said. "It spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes."

Pertussis can cause serious, even life-threatening, complications in babies and young children who are not fully vaccinated, Grant warned. "More than half of infants younger than 12 months old who get pertussis require hospitalization," she said. "Since 2013, there have been 7 cases of infants with pertussis in our district; 4 of those were hospitalized, and 3, all under 2 months old, required intensive care outside of the area."

She said the district epidemiologist and staff are working with area schools and child care facilities, which are especially prone to see clusters of whooping cough, to identify and manage cases of the disease and keep it from spreading.

"We are asking contacts of patients with confirmed cases to get in touch with their healthcare providers," said Southwest Georgia Public Health District epidemiologist Jacqueline Jenkins. "Early recognition of cases, effective treatment and prophylaxis and vaccinations are vital to limiting the spread of pertussis."

Grant stressed that women should be vaccinated against pertussis with every pregnancy to protect their babies. "The best time to receive the vaccine, known [as] Tdap, is between 27 and 36 weeks," she said. "If it isn't administered during pregnancy, it should be provided immediately after she gives birth. It should also be given to all of the baby's caregivers to provide a cocoon against pertussis infection."

The rate of pertussis cases in San Diego County [California] continues to run far ahead of 2013, with 10 new diagnoses reported last week, the county Health and Human Services Agency announced on Wednesday [9 Apr 2014]. Nearly 200 cases of the disease that's also known as whooping cough have been logged so far in 2014, nearly halfway to the total for all of 2013, which was 430, according to the HHSA. By this time in 2013, 39 cases had been reported.

Two years after a KPBS/inewsource investigation posed serious questions about how well the whooping cough vaccine works, new research confirms the vaccine is failing at a higher rate than expected. "A greater number of children are getting sick with pertussis in 2014, said Dr Wilma Wooten, the county public health officer. "Parents or guardians should make sure their children have received all the recommended doses of the pertussis vaccine." She said it is also important that parents and other caregivers recognize symptoms immediately so that those sick with pertussis can get immediate treatment, and not spread the illness.

Infants younger than one year old are especially vulnerable because they do not have the full 5-dose series of pertussis vaccinations.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] says 34 cases of whooping cough have been reported in southern Alberta since the beginning of 2014, and stress that there could be many more. One family in the community is urging parents to get their children immunized against pertussis after their 4 month old son became very sick.

A Lethbridge family is urging families in the community to get their children vaccinated after their son is very ill and under quarantine with whooping cough. The mother said, "Each [coughing fit] is really scary because it sounds like he's choking. It's day and night, so we take turns holding him through the night and switch off every attack." The infant ended up contracting whooping cough from his parents after his dad caught a very bad cough shortly after he was born.

The parents both had their pertussis vaccinations 9 years ago. They hope that their story can encourage other parents to get their children vaccinated. "Anyone who is pregnant or in that 5 to 10 year range needs to be getting it," the mother says. "Even if there's no outbreak. When you have an infant in the family, it's serious."

"Pertussis is really quite serious, especially in infants under the age of 6 months. This bacterium can intervene with their ability to breathe, and it can really lead to death," said Dr Judy MacDonald from the AHS.

The last outbreak in the South Zone was in 2012 and claimed the life of one infant.

[Vaccination of the pregnant mother towards the end of gestation is probably the best individual way of protecting an, as yet, not fully vaccinated infant against the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.

Clearly, much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from _Bordetella pertussis_ infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63 per cent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997-2000, there were 11.8 per cent with pneumonia, 1.4 per cent with seizures, 0.2 per cent with encephalopathy, and 0.8 per cent died [56/7203]. This compared with parallel numbers of 28 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and less than 0.1 per cent in infants 6-11 months of age (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm).

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 per cent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea sometimes with hypoxia-induced seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental O2 in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL]
