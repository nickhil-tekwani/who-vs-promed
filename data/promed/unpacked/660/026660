Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the crayfish plague infection, which is notifiable to the OIE, was detected on 5 crayfish farms in the process of passive surveillance (reported cases) and identified as _Aphanomyces astaci_ infection. Movement restriction was implemented on the infected farms. The clinical and epidemiological investigations of surrounding crayfish farms were conducted. No other case or evidence of crayfish plague infection was detected.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises / establishment (s); surveillance outside containment and / or buffer zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result

[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 2.2.1 Crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.01_CRAYFISH_PLAGUE.pdf.

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_) are spelled out in chapter 9.1 of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.9.1.htm.

Redclaw (_Cherax quadricarinatus_) is a freshwater crayfish native to parts of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Redclaw has also been grown in New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and the US.

They are often called "freshwater lobsters" for their physical resemblance and large size -- red claw can grow to over one pound (454 g; http://www.ncagr.gov/markets/aquaculture/aussieredclawcrayfish.pdf and http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/pests-diseases/freshwater-pests/species/redclaw).

Redclaw are tolerant of a broad range of environmental conditions, have a simple reproductive cycle and fast growth rates which has generated interest in the species for commercial aquaculture and ornamental aquarium use.

The name 'redclaw' comes from the fact that mature male specimens display distinctive red patches on the claws. The male is larger than the female reaching a maximum of 25 cm (9.8 in) in length and weight up to 600 g (1.3 lb). In their native range, redclaw inhabit a diversity of freshwater habitats including still ponds, small creeks, isolated rock pools, and fast flowing rivers (http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/pests-diseases/freshwater-pests/species/redclaw).
