A confirmed case of Hendra virus has killed a horse in News South Wales for the 1st time in 2 years.

The horse from a property west of Macksville on the mid-north coast has been buried and a 2nd horse vaccinated and tested along with other animals on the farm.

It is the same region where the virus, which is spread by flying foxes, killed 10 horses at 8 properties 2 years ago.

The Department of Primary Industries says there is a low risk to 4 people, including a vet, who came into contact with the sick animal. There have been 8 cases of Hendra virus in horses across the border in Queensland in the past 12 months.

The bat-borne disease has claimed the lives of 4 of the 7 people infected and has worried horse owners and workers since it was first identified in Brisbane in 1994.

It has killed more than 80 horses in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Last year [2012] a vaccine for horses was released after research was fast-tracked, but no vaccine exists for humans.

[Keeping horses from around fruit trees which seem to attract the bats appears to be important, but it is equally important to vaccinate the animals. When a vaccine can protect your animals, and build a barrier between people and the disease, then vaccination is the only prudent thing to do.
