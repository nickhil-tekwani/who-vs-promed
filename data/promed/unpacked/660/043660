Yemen is fighting a cholera outbreak in the south eastern province of Hadramout [Hadramawt], with local and international health bodies carrying out an emergency vaccination campaign.

Outbreaks in the remote Hajjar district usually last from April to September, and cases vanish in the following months. But this year [2020], the district's main hospital reported receiving new cases of cholera in October, November, and December for the 1st time in decades. UNICEF, the WHO, and health authorities in Yemen, alarmed by the increase in cases, joined forces to carry out an emergency cholera vaccination campaign in Hajjar from 20-25 Dec [2020].

"The continuing arrival of new cases to the hospital is a source of concern to us, and it is an indication that cholera is endemic in Hajjar," Abdullah Awadh Bahendi, the director of Hajjar's main hospital and the director of the Health Ministry's district office, told Arab News.

The campaign targeted 40 000 people in the district's rural and urban regions. Hundreds of posters and leaflets were distributed, and trucks roamed around, broadcasting messages about the campaign's significance. Health worker Nashwa Mubarak said awareness activities that took place before or during the campaign had yielded fruit, as most Hajjar residents took the vaccine with little objection. "As a woman, I target women who would not accept male visitors, and I also convince hesitant women," she told Arab News.

Health officials said they had registered at least 250 confirmed cases of cholera and one related death in Hajjar since April [2020], compared to 520 cases and 6 deaths in 2019. WHO said that health facilities had recorded 167 278 suspected cases with 48 associated deaths from 1 Jan to 2 Aug [2020]. The highest numbers of cases were reported in the western province of Hodeidah, 26 936, followed by Sanaa with 24 593.

Health officials in Hajjar attribute the regular resurgence of cholera to crumbling sewage and drinking water systems, in addition to seasonal gatherings of people during the harvest of date palm trees. Houses discharge sewage in the open or to small holes close by. Flash floods and heavy rains have largely destroyed sewage and water systems in urban areas, prompting people to use polluted water.

"The rains and floods have devastated water pipelines," Bahendi said. "The cholera reemerges when people turn to unclean water." He added that the latest humanitarian interventions from the Health Ministry and international organizations had helped to reduce the number of cholera cases. "Reasons behind cholera outbreaks have nothing to do with the war. We demand building sewage and water systems for Hajjar, which would help ending cholera."

Floods isolate villages due to their rough geography, making it difficult for health workers to reach the sick. Bahendi suggested building several health centers in remote villages along with rehydration corners for dealing with mild cases of cholera and equipping health centers with staff and ambulances. Residents in Hajjar said fixing water and sanitation systems should be a priority and that they had no choice but to drink unclean water because they could not afford to buy processed bottled water.

Khaled Al-Kaledi, the head of the health department at the Hadramout office of the Health Ministry, said the office had classified Hajjar as a high-risk district due to the high number of cholera cases compared to other areas in the province. He added that officials, including him, had taken the vaccine to convince the public it was safe. "People's reactions with the campaign are amazing," he told Arab News.

[The calculated case fatality rate from this continued epidemic is quite low, strongly suggesting that many of the cases are not cholera. Even with that, the numbers reported in this continuing catastrophe are difficult to wrap one's head around.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
