South African authorities are slaughtering 600 pigs in the eastern province
of KwaZulu Natal after the first farm outbreak of foot and mouth disease
(FMD) in the country in more than 40 years, officials said on Sunday.
National director of Veterinary Services Gideon Bruckner said the deadly
disease had been contained and should not threaten South Africa's
agricultural exports to the European Union, its main trade partner.
"At this stage this disease is only confined to the 1 farm so there's no
need for further action unless it spreads," he said. The virus, which has
so far killed 70 pigs at the farm in Camperdown, had been introduced by
infected pig swill brought illegally on a ship from an Eastern country, he
said.
Apart from a domestic strain of the virus endemic in South Africa's most
famous game reserve, the Kruger National Park, it was the first outbreak of
FMD to hit domestic livestock since 1956, Bruckner said.
FMD is a highly contagious disease among cattle, sheep and swine. It causes
significant economic losses to livestock farmers and normally leads to bans
on animals, meat and even grain from affected areas.
Bruckner said the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health had been
informed of the outbreak. "We hope that there won't be [a ban on
agriculture exports because we are following international guidelines --
it has been contained and it's not a national disaster," he said.
Police and army members had set up road blocks in a 10 kilometer radius
around the affected farm to ensure that vehicles were disinfected and were
carrying out tests on animals within 30 kilometers, Bruckner said.
Carcasses of slaughtered pigs, along with a few cattle and goats, were
being buried rather than burned to ensure the wind did not spread the virus.
South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper said an EU ban would lead to the loss
of export earnings worth 2 billion rand ($277 million) a year.
