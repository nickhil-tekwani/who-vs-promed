Hog cholera spreads in Mimika, killing thousands of pigs
-------------------------------------------------
Classical swine fever, also known as "hog cholera," has affected thousands
of domestic pigs since April 2004 in Mimika regency, Papua, killing at
least 8700 animals.
The highly contagious virus was first detected in the villages of Kwamki
Lama, Utikini, Djayanti and Kwamki Baru, but its presence was only
confirmed a few months later by researchers at the Veterinary Investigation
and Examination Body in Maros, South Sulawesi province.
Elias Inte, head of the provincial Animal Quarantine Office, said he
regretted the spread of the virus, which affects both domestic and feral
pigs. Humans are not affected.
According to AR Puntadewa, head of the Animal Husbandry Office in Papua,
the virus was spreading rapidly throughout Mimika, where at least one pig
died daily. "It is the 1st case in Papua. Pigs in Papua have been free of
deadly viruses and other contagious diseases for years," he said.
He suspected that the virus was probably imported to Papua in November 2003
among hundreds of pigs from several regencies, especially those from Dobo
and Tual in Maluku, as part of a government aid program for underprivileged
Papuans.
Pigs are a crucial livestock in Papua, comparable to chicken in Java.
Puntadewa said the imported pigs appeared to begin infecting local pigs
soon after their arrival. In order to prevent further spread of the virus
to other regencies, Puntadewa said he had ordered the regent to stop the
distribution of pigs outside Mimika.
He added that, for the time being, animal husbandry officials were helping
local residents and pig breeders vaccinate pigs suspected of
infection. Infected pigs usually show acute symptoms such as fever,
depression, loss of appetite and even convulsions.
Viral transmission occurs by direct contact with infected pigs or the
ingestion of products from infected pigs.

Hog cholera breaks out In Papua province
---------------------------------------------
Pigs are suffering an outbreak of hog cholera (Classical Swine Fever) in
Indonesia's Papua province, and officials have shipped vaccines to the
remote region to counter its spread, the government said Tuesday.
The outbreak was first detected 2 weeks ago and is centered in the
province's southern coastal Mimika area, said Sudarmono, from the
government's Animal Husbandry Department.
"It is the 1st case in Papua. We've sent 5000 ampules of vaccine to contain
the outbreak," said Sudarmono, who like many Indonesians uses a single name.
Sudarmono said it was difficult to assess the number of pigs infected
because most Papuan farmers live in remote, mountainous jungles. It was
unclear whether any had died yet.
Farm-raised pigs or wild boars can carry hog cholera, which is transmitted
through waste or saliva. It can kill an animal in a matter of weeks, but
has no known effects on human beings.

[CSF, also known as hog cholera, is a contagious List A viral disease of
pigs. The causative virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family
_Flaviviridae_. There is only one serotype of CSF virus.
The disease may run an acute, subacute, chronic, or inapparent course,
depending on a variety of viral and host factors of which the age of the
animals, the virulence of the virus, and the time of infection (pre- or
post-natal) are of greatest importance. Adult pigs usually display less
severe signs of disease than young animals and stand a better chance of
survival. In pregnant sows, the virus may cross the placental barrier and
reach the fetuses. In utero infection with strains of the virus of moderate
or low virulence can result in what is referred to as the "carrier sow"
syndrome followed by prenatal or early post-natal death, the birth of
diseased piglets, or an apparently healthy but infected litter. An outbreak
of CSF has serious consequences for trade in pigs and pig products, causing
severe economic losses. Further details on CSF, its diagnosis and the
vaccine, are available in chapter 2.1.13. of OIE's Manual of Standards for
Diagnostic Tests & Vaccines.
