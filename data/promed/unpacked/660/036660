Caution urged for Queensland potato growers following Victoria outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Queensland potato growers are being urged to look out for signs of
disease in their potato crops after the devastating pest potato cyst
nematode [PCN] was detected on a property near Thorpdale in
Victoria's Gippsland region [ProMED-mail post no. 20081021.3334].
Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries [DPI&F] General
Manager of Plant Biosecurity, Neil O'Brien said growers should
contact the department if they spot anything unusual in their crops.

"The recent announcement of the Victorian Department of Primary
Industries about the discovery of PCN has prompted us to urge
Queensland potato growers to be vigilant," Mr O'Brien said.
"Currently, there is no evidence of PCN in Queensland. However, PCN
has had a big impact on the Victorian and Western Australian potato
industry and has the potential to spread to Queensland if we're not
careful. PCN could have a devastating impact on not only our potato
industry, but our nursery industry too. I urge all Queensland growers
to ensure they are not bringing in contaminated seed potatoes," he
said. "While entry restrictions play an important role in protecting
Queensland, industry and local growers still need to remain vigilant
and always check and double check the health and quality of the goods
they are receiving."

Mr O'Brien said it takes about 6 to 7 years from the time PCN is
introduced into an area before the nematode reaches a detectable
level. During this time the nematode can spread throughout the crop
and to other properties. PCN can reduce yields by as much as 90
percent, proving to be a force to be reckoned with.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and
pale (_G. pallida_) cyst nematodes cause serious crop losses in
potato. They can also infect other solanaceous crops and weeds, and
cysts containing viable eggs can survive in the soil for up to 20
years. Disease management includes exclusion and crop rotation with
non-host species. Race identification is important for the use of
resistant crop cultivars. For more information on the PCNs please see
previous ProMED-mail report no. 20080714.2138.

Evidence to date suggests that only race 1 of the golden nematode is
present in Australia, and this species has been found previously in
Victoria. It is therefore more likely that this is the pathogen
involved in the recent outbreak. Extensive surveys are being
conducted in Victoria in response to the PCN detection to determine
pathogen spread, and a 20 km (12.4 mi) quarantine zone was placed
around the initial detection site restricting movement and cutting
off all trade with the rest of the country.
