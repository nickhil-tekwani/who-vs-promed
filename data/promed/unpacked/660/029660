Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments
In Korhogo, hares and rabbits were found dead. The carcasses showed signs of convulsion, polyuria and epistaxis. In Abidjan and Agboville, breeding farms are affected. The most frequent clinical signs are: loss of appetite, sudden deaths preceded by prostration and respiratory distress. Some cases of epistaxis have also been observed. At postmortem exam, a necrotizing liver was observed, petechiae on the trachea and a more or less hemorrhagic pneumonitis.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Laboratoire National d'Appui au Developpement Agricole (LANADA) (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
_Leporidae_ (unidentified) / - / 5 Apr 2016 / Positive
Rabbits / - / 5 Apr 2016 / Positive
Rabbits / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 30 Apr 2016 / Positive
Rabbits / real-time PCR / 5 Apr 2016 / Positive
Rabbits / real-time PCR / 30 Apr 2016 / Positive

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis of wild and domestic European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). RHD is caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_, family Caliciviridae).

Genetic and antigenic comparison and epidemiological data indicate the existence of 3 main RHDV groups:

i) The "classical RHDV", including genogroups G1-G5, 1st reported in China (People's Rep of) in 1984. To date, this RHDV has been reported in over 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe, and Oceania and is endemic in most parts of the world where European rabbits live naturally or are domesticated.

ii) The subtype RHDVa/G6 identified in Europe on 1996 and currently reported in other continents (Oceania, Asia, and Americas).

iii) The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recul√© et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a 2nd RHDV serotype http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf.
