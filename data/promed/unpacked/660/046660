For the 2nd time in a week, a human rabies death has been reported at the Indus Hospital in Karachi. Last week, a 6-year-old boy died from the lethal virus, and this Tuesday [25 May 2021], a 24-year-old man succumbed to rabies.

A report from the Pakistani news source Dawn states that "the patients received improper and inadequate treatment at government hospitals."

In the case of the young child, who received bites to the face, rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) was never administered; proper washing of the wounds and improper administration of the injections were noted in the report.

In the case of the young man, who had a wound to the forehead, again, RIG wasn't administered, the wound was stitched, and a misdiagnosis of diarrhea was given.

The Malaysia Ministry of Health reported a human rabies death in Sarawak, which was confirmed positive on 5 May 2021.

The 45-year-old female citizen was living in Rh Janggu, Sungai Tepus, Selangau, Sarawak. She has a history of being bitten by her pet dog on the left hand while disposing of the dog, who was fighting with another dog on 9 Mar 2021.

The case had washed the wound and sought treatment at the Tepus Health Clinic the same day [9 Mar 2021]. Wound treatment was performed, anti-tetanus injections were given, and follow-up appointments were given. Unfortunately, the case has dropped out of follow-up treatment [see comment]. Upon successful detection, the case was given the 1st dose of anti-rabies vaccine injection on 29 Apr 2021.

However, the case complained of eye pain, weakness, and numbness in the left hand while attending the 2nd dose injection on 2 May 2021 and was admitted to the ward at Sibu Hospital for treatment. Clinical samples for rabies virus detection test were taken and sent to the laboratories of Sarawak General Hospital and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS). The results of the sample were reported positive for rabies on 5 May 2021. In the meantime, the patient's condition was deteriorating, and the case had died on 6 May 2021 at 7:13 am with a diagnosis of rabies encephalitis.

With the addition of new cases, the latest number of rabies cases in Sarawak for 2021 is 3 cases. Meanwhile, since the rabies epidemic was declared on 1 Jul 2017 in Sarawak, the number of cases was 34 with 32 deaths. There were 2 surviving cases of children with severe neurological complications.

When a rabies virus infection that occurs in an animal bite wound is not treated immediately, it will result in death if the infection has reached the brain. Therefore, MOH would like to advise the public, especially in Sarawak, to always take preventive measures to prevent rabies virus infection, namely the following:

- wash the wound with running water and soap for at least 15 minutes if the person is bitten or scratched or exposed to animal saliva;
- seek immediate treatment at the nearest health clinic or hospital;
- ensure that the complete anti-rabies vaccine is received according to the appointment given by the medical practitioner, even when executing the movement control order (PKP) during this COVID-19 pandemic; and
- do not handle any wild animals, including wild [stray, unowned] dogs and cats.

[The tragically delayed PEP treatment of the victim, starting only 40 days after her suspected exposure, may have been caused by the case history as presented and assessed in the hospital. As described, "she was bitten by her pet dog on the left hand while disposing of the dog, who was fighting with another dog on 9 Mar 2021." Getting to hospital on the same day, rabies involvement was probably not (or only slightly?) suspected, and, therefore, only wound treatment performed, anti-tetanus injections given, and follow-up appointments given. The patient was detected and treated (vaccine, no RIG) only on 29 Apr 2021. No information on the health of her pet dog nor of its vaccination history is given. In case the dog was still alive when the patient was detected, it is rather unlikely this dog was the source of infection. This case deserves a thorough investigation, which should include also the identification of the other dog involved in the 9 Mar 2021 event and an update of the guidelines for Sarawak's hospitals. - Mod.AS

[3] Thailand (Surin): human, cat suspected

A 39-year-old woman in the northeastern Thai province of Surin died the day before yesterday (19 May 2021) of rabies after being in close contact with 3 stray cats that had already passed away [see comment].

The family of 4 has 12 cats and 2 dogs, but the animals have never been vaccinated against rabies.

On 7 May 2021, the woman developed a sore throat, became tired, and was unable to drink water. Her husband took her to Samrongtap Hospital for a check-up.

She rested at home on 11 May [2021], but the symptoms got worse. Her husband took her back to the hospital, and the doctor gave her pills for stomach problems and to relieve stress. His wife was later unable to drink water, and her husband took her back to the hospital. When her situation deteriorated, the woman was sent to Surin hospital.

She was there in an emergency room from 11-12 May [2021], and a doctor said she had a serious lung infection. As the situation worsened, the doctor sent samples of the woman's saliva, urine, and hair for examination to the Medical Sciences Department in Nonthaburi Province. Unfortunately, the woman came to the end of her life.

The Surin Public Health Office said that a person bitten by a rabid dog normally almost always dies. To stop the problem, pet owners should take their animals to the vet at all times to get an injection for rabies.

[Surin is one of 13 provinces declared by the Thai Department of Livestock Development as "rabies red zones" (March 2018) after the disease spread to several parts of the country. The Department stated that these provinces include Surin, Chon Buri, Sumut Prakan, Chachoengsao, Nan, Buri Ram, Ubon Ratchathaini, Chiang Rai, Rot Et, Songkhla, Rayong, Tak, and Sri Sa Ket. The department also announced rabies-prone areas in 42 other provinces.

Last week [week of 17 May 2021], a man from the village Gargour of the Agrib commune of Sfax governorate died at the age of 76 years after being bitten by his dog infected with rabies, according to the Diwan FM correspondent.

The same source added that the man and his wife were bitten. The man did not vaccinate against rabies, which led to his death 40 days later. On the other hand, his wife received the vaccination and monitored her condition and is now in good health, according to the same source.

The Agriculture Department turned to the dog vaccination process at the village of Gargour, while the National Guard, in coordination with the municipality, launched a campaign to eliminate stray dogs.

The newswire above reports the 4th human case of rabies registered in 2021. More information about previous human cases registered during the current year [2021] in Tunisia can be found in PRO/MENA archive no. 20210519.8370247>. - Mod.SF

The elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies is entirely possible, yet rabies is considered to still kill nearly 60 000 people per year, almost half of them children. Today, rabies is a disease of poverty. The poorest and most marginalised are most at risk, not only from the trauma of dog bite and risk of death, but by rabies' harsh economic consequences, estimated to be over USD 8.6 billion per year. Many die due to high treatment costs or lack of access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Mass dog vaccination is a proven, cost-effective way to save human lives by stopping transmission of rabies at its source. While a variety of animal species can host rabies, dogs are responsible for 99% of human cases. Disease models and real-world experience show that sustained vaccination coverage of 70% of dog populations is sufficient to stop transmission of the disease between dogs, and from dogs to humans. Eliminating rabies in dogs is therefore key to sustainably preventing human disease.

The information was included in the introduction to a global plan for rabies control and elimination which was agreed by FAO, OIE, and WHO in "Zero by 30: The Global Strategic Plan to End Human Deaths from Dog-mediated Rabies by 2030" ("Zero by 30"; https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/03/zero-by-30-final-130618.pdf). Key elements include improved access to PEP, especially for the poorest, as well as mass dog vaccination, improved disease reporting, and surveillance tools and community education and outreach.

"Zero by 30" was planned to include 3 phases:
- Phase 1 ('start up'), 2018-2020, 29 countries, the funding requirements for which estimated at USD 16.5 million;
- Phase 2 ('scale up'), 2021-2025, adding 52 countries in rabies elimination, to give a total of 81 out of 100 endemic countries;
- Phase 3 ('mop up'), 2026-2030, engaging the 19 remaining endemic countries in the rabies elimination efforts, as communities, nations and regions advance to reach Zero by 30.

A report of 3 Mar 2021 on the situation of "Zero by 30" at the end of 2020 is included for download in WHO's technical document "United against rabies forum: zero by 30: one health in action", at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UCN-NTD-VVE-2021.1. The document includes data from several countries and the following statement:

"While a number of countries have drawn up national rabies control programmes, key actions, including sustained mass dog vaccination campaigns, surveillance and reporting, remain limited. The coronavirus pandemic has further hindered progress. Overwhelmed public health systems have less capacity to treat potential cases of rabies exposure and individuals bitten by dogs have been less likely to seek help. Medical supply chains have been disrupted and dog vaccination campaigns cancelled or postponed. Laboratory services for rabies have been reduced, surveillance capacity has been redirected, and in-country training and community outreach activities have been suspended or cancelled.

"Yet the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health has never been more evident. The world needs to make One Health a reality. At a time when zoonotic disease and One Health are at the forefront of the global agenda, United Against Rabies is bringing multiple sectors together."

Hopefully, "Zero by 30" will manage to return to its operational mode the soonest, in tandem with improvement on the COVID-19 front. - Mod.AS]
