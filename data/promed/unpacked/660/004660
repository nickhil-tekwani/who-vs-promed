Swine Fever in U.K.
---------------------------
The largest outdoor pig production company in the United Kingdom, British
Quality Pigs (BQP), has admitted illegally moving 884 pigs out of a
[classical swine fever (CSF)-infected area in Stradbroke on 5 Sep 2000.
They have been fined 4000 GB pounds (6000 US dollars) according to local
press reports.
BQP ran a contract "multi-site" (age segregation) pig production system in
East Anglia involving approximately 250 farms. The company has been sold in
recent weeks. The court was told after the first CSF outbreak that BQP had
put pins on a map identifying all the farms where its pigs were.
In the Stradbroke area, 2 farms (both called White House Farm) were
identified. One was outside the surveillance zone and the other inside the
boundary by the width of a road. BQP stated the pigs were moved from the
wrong farm. The illegal action was said in court to have had no adverse
affect on control of CSF in the area. More details and updates of the CSF
situation are available at: <http://www.pighealth.com/csf.htm>
