[A 15 Jul 2022 report states that as the monkeypox outbreak grows in the United States, demand for the vaccine is outstripping the nation's supply, Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of CDC, said at a news briefing on Friday: "We don't yet have all the vaccines that we would like at this moment," she said. When the supply crunch will ease, is unknown. The federal government made another 131 000 doses available to states and other jurisdictions on Friday [15 Jul 2022]. But the scope of the outbreak remains unclear, in part because diagnostic testing has been slow and limited. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/health/monkeypox-vaccine-supply.html)]

The state Department of Health (DoH) has identified 2 additional cases of monkeypox, including the first on Hawaii Island on Friday [15 Jul 2022]. This brings the total number of cases in Hawaii to 8. According to the Health Department, one individual is a Hawaii Island resident with a history of travel to the mainland. The second newly reported case is an Oahu resident. Connections to previously reported cases are under investigation.

"Vaccination and treatments are available, and we encourage anyone with monkeypox symptoms to contact their healthcare provider," said health director Dr Elizabeth Char. At this time, health officials said the risk to most Hawaii residents remains low. The DoH continues to conduct contact tracing and coordinate vaccination and treatment.

Health experts said monkeypox can spread through direct contact with body fluids, lesion material, or items used by someone with the virus. It can also be spread through large respiratory droplets.

After India reported its first case of monkeypox, experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Friday [15 Jul 2022] said the infectivity of the viral disease is less but it can be fatal for children. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Friday released guidelines for the management of monkeypox disease.

The ministry listed points for the general masses to avoid contracting the disease, which included avoiding contact with sick people and avoiding contact with dead or wild animals (rodents, monkeys). Members of the public have also been advised to visit the nearest health facility if they come in close contact with a monkeypox-affected person or an area with the affected persons or animals.

India reported its first monkeypox case -- a traveller from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who arrived in Kerala 3 days ago and tested positive for the viral disease -- on Thursday [14 Jul 2022].

Union Health Ministry rushed a high-level multi-disciplinary team to Kerala to collaborate with the state health authorities in instituting public health measures in view of the confirmed case of monkeypox in the Kollam district of Kerala.
