Date of confirmation of the event: 16 Jul 2017
Date of event resolved: 18 Jul 2017
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Perry County, Perry, Alabama
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Jul 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 18 Jul 2017
Epidemiological unit: livestock market
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a positive case. 11-year-old beef type cow.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, random mutation

Epidemiological comments: As part of the United States' targeted surveillance program for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a case of atypical BSE was identified in an 11-year-old beef type cow. This atypical BSE was classified as L-type. Native cases of BSE in the United States have all been atypical BSE cases; this is only the 4th case of atypical BSE identified in over 20 years of surveillance. The last case was in 2012. The identified animal did not enter any food supply channels and at no time presented a risk to human health. Specified risk material removal and the ruminant-to-ruminant feed bans continue to be effectively applied.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, modified stamping out, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 15 Jul 2017 / Positive
Cattle / Western blot / 16 Jul 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The US Department of Agriculture identified a case of "atypical BSE" in an 11-year-old beef-type cow thorough its established surveillance program. The animal tested positive on a screening test, but follow-up tests at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the atypical form of the agent. As noted in the OIE report, this is the 1st detection of BSE in the United States since 2012. The United States has identified 3 other prior cases of atypical BSE, bringing the total number of atypical BSE cases to 4. There was one case of classical BSE (feed transmitted) that was detected in 2003, but that case was associated with an imported cow from Canada. Classical BSE was the agent responsible for the extensive cases, primarily in Europe, and which was associated with the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to cattle. Today, following the removal of specified risk materials such as brain and spinal cord, and the prohibition of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, classical BSE is very rare. Atypical BSE is thought to occur spontaneously. It occurs sporadically in older cattle at a very low rate. It is not unusual for countries with good surveillance programs to identify atypical BSE.
