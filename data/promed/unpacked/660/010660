[Dr Gongora had originally stated that they were only using US or
European Newcastle vaccines but local news reports said they were
using Guatemalan vaccines. Clarification was sought.- Mod.MHJ]

Given that backyard poultry [owners] cannot use the commercially
available vaccines as [vilas] are too [big] (10 000 to 25 000 doses per
vial) we had to look for smaller-dose vials. Thus a risk analysis was
conducted; the lab was visited in Guatemala; and the use of 150-dose
vials of Newcastle B1 live strain was approved from the approved lab
in Guatemala.

[We appreciate Dr Gongora's clarification on the vaccines being used
in Belize. It may seem to be a trivial point but not all Newcastle
vaccines are created equal and they are live vaccines. The Belizeans
wisely took care and checked the Guatemala source out first.

In the past, backyard poultry have been a reservoir for this disease
in Central and South America. In the early 1970s when parrots suddenly
became very popular, wild parrots were trapped and held in the
trappers' villages until the birds were sold to middle men for export
to the US. Unfortunately these parrots contracted Newcastle disease
[from the poultry] in the villages and then introduced it to the US.
The same epidemiologic pattern introduced African Newcastle virus into
Europe. - Mod.MHJ]
