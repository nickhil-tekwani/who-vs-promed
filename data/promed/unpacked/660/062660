Sweden has reported 3 outbreaks of histamine poisoning in tuna from Vietnam in the past 3 months. The outbreaks, which have affected about 60 people, do not appear to be directly related as the tuna originated from different batches. Patients are from different municipalities in southern and central Sweden.

Symptoms were typical for histamine poisoning and included swelling, hives, irregular heartbeat, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

In the latest outbreak, which began in early July [2020], involving histamine in thawed tuna from Sweden, with frozen raw material from Vietnam, about 20 people from 5 different municipalities fell sick after eating tuna from the same batch. Most of them had bought the fish in retail stores.

Patients in the 2nd outbreak caused by histamine in frozen vacuum-packed yellowfin tuna loins from Vietnam, via the Netherlands, were reported from [29 May to 12 June 2020]. A total of 9 people had eaten tuna from the same batch at 3 different restaurants in 2 different municipalities were affected.

The earliest outbreak in May [2020] was due to histamine in frozen yellowfin tuna loins from Vietnam, also via the Netherlands. All 30 reported cases had consumed a dish with tuna at the same restaurant. This batch was produced by one of the larger operators in Vietnam, which supplies several wholesalers in Europe. It was produced in June and shipped in July 2019 and only distributed within Europe.

Local authorities are responsible for the outbreak investigation and tracing food batches. The Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) is the national contact point for Europe's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). In 2020, histamine in fish from Vietnam has been responsible for 6 reports on RASFF, including the 3 outbreaks from Sweden and another alert in May from the same country about histamine in frozen tuna loins. In January [2020], Portugal issued a border rejection for frozen tuna belly with skin due to histamine levels and in June [2020], Hungary warned of histamine in thawed yellowfin tuna fillets from Vietnam via Slovenia.

Mats Lindblad, from the Swedish Food Agency, said investigations started due to reports of food poisoning. During the enquiries, high levels of histamine in tuna were confirmed in all 3 outbreaks. "It is always necessary to keep tuna well chilled, but no particular advice has been issued to food business operators in Sweden due to the outbreaks because in this case the high levels of histamine arose before the implicated batches were brought into Sweden," he said. "No restrictions have been placed on fish from Vietnam. But considering high levels of histamine in tuna from different countries frequently are reported, it is, of course, important that producers of tuna make further efforts to avoid the problem."

Onset of histamine food poisoning symptoms can range from minutes to several hours following ingestion of toxin. Typically, the average incubation period before illness is 1 hour. The most common symptoms of histamine, or scombroid fish poisoning, are tingling or burning sensation in the mouth, facial swelling, rash, hives and itchy skin, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. They usually resolve within several hours without medical intervention.

Production of histamine is related to mishandling of food due to storage at incorrect temperatures. Once histamine has been produced, it cannot be eliminated by normal cooking or freezing temperatures.

Abstract
--------
"Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (e.g., tuna, mackerel, bonito) are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term "scombroid fish poisoning" to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled, are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 hours. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on ensuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

Abstract
--------
"Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing needed to augment HACCP efforts will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time."
