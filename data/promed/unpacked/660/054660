WHO to visit Algeria as new plague cases reported
---------------------------------
A World Health Organization (WHO) team is due to visit Algeria 29 Jun 2003
amid an outbreak of bubonic plague, a Health Ministry official said. A 12th
case of the plague was reported today near Oran, Algeria's second-largest city.
11 cases have been confirmed over the past weeks near Oran, most in the
town of Kehailia, 400 km west of Algiers. One child has died.
"A WHO technical assistance team, including plague experts, arrives on 29
Jun 2003. They'll study the plague," said the official.
Bubonic plague killed an estimated 25 million people during the Middle Ages
but is now treatable with antibiotics. The disease is [usually - Mod.LL]
spread to humans through bites from fleas infected by rats.
