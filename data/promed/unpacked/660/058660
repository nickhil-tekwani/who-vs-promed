The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [6 Jul 2020] reported the nation's 1st case of infant botulism in 2020, a 4-month-old boy in northern Taiwan.

The boy was introduced to homemade solid food in the middle of May 2020, but began to experience constipation and loss of appetite on 23 Jun 2020, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Guo Hung-wei said, adding that he was taken to the hospital when he developed a fever and shortness of breath on 25 Jun 2020.

In the hospital, the boy also experienced a rapid heartbeat, limb weakness, decreased deep-tendon reflex and drooping eyelids, leading healthcare professionals to suspect infant botulism, he said. A test of the boy's feces found the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ type B, confirming the diagnosis, he added. The case involves the youngest botulism patient since it was designated a notifiable communicable disease in 2007, Guo said, adding that the local health agency collected food samples to try to pinpoint the source of infection.

Botulism has only sporadically been reported over the past few years, with 2 cases in 2015, 6 in 2016, and none in the past 3 years, he said.

The boy might have eaten food contaminated with _C. botulinum_ spores, which can germinate and then multiply in a baby's intestines, producing a dangerous toxin, CDC physician Lin Yung-ching said.

The symptoms, which appear in 3 to 30 days, can include constipation, fatigue, sleepiness, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, general weakness and difficulty breathing. Botulism can be deadly, he added.

People should thoroughly cook food -- for at least 10 minutes -- and stir evenly, Lin said, adding that canning food should be avoided, as containers might carry pathogens if they are not disinfected and stored properly.

[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and, many times, a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breastfed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on infant botulism in New York City [ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144]:

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. [This form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG-IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
