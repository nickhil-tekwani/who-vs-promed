Anthrax in Peru
---------------
This report is a translation of information received on 12 Jan 2005 (dated
11 Jan) from Dr Oscar Dominguez Falcon, director general for animal health,
National Animal Health Service (SENASA), Ministry of Agriculture, Lima:
Reason for immediate notification: a sudden and unexpected increase in the
distribution, incidence, morbidity or mortality of a listed disease
prevalent within a country or zone/compartment.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 11 Jan 2005.
Date of start of the event: 27 Dec 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: postmortem.
First administrative division / species / new rate of disease incidence /
new mortality rate
Pampa La Julia / bov / 20 per cent / 20 per cent
Pampa La Julia / cap / 12 per cent / 12 per cent
Description of affected population: the outbreak occurred in Sama Valley,
Pampa La Julia division, in Tacna department, at the border with Chile. The
outbreak area contains 55 head of cattle and 26 goats on a piece of land
covering 36.8 hectares. In the perifocal area there are 2900 head of
cattle. During the outbreak 11 cattle and 3 goats died.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory of diagnosis / Species examined / Diagnostic test used
SENASA Animal Health Laboratory / bov / culture on tryptone soya agar and
blood agar; isolation of the bacterium
Date: 6 Jan 2005 / Results 11 Jan 2005
Source of outbreak: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- vaccination;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).
Vaccination in response to the outbreak:
First administrative division / species / number of vaccinated animals /
vaccine
Tacna district / bov / 1100 / attenuated live virus vaccine
Sama district / bov / 2685 / attenuated live virus vaccine
Treatment of affected animals: no.
Other details/comments:
Without first checking the accuracy of their information with SENASA, some
of the media incorrectly reported this outbreak of anthrax to be foot and
mouth disease. The national directorate of SENASA sent the media concerned
an explanatory letter to ask them to rectify their mistake and accept
responsibility for any consequences that may result (the last outbreak of
foot and mouth disease in the country was reported in July 2004 after more
than 44 months of remission (Disease Information 2004; 17(38): 268, 17 Sep)).

[Thanks very much to Dr Rodriguez for sending in this report, which again
confirms that the outbreak referred to below is indeed anthrax. It is not
the 1st time outbreaks in animals have been misreported in the media.
One useful epidemiologic tool veterinarians have is the distribution of
disease among species, which can sometimes be helpful in eliminating FMD as
the cause of outbreaks, particularly vesicular ones. The key in this case
is that humans, cattle, and goats are susceptible to anthrax, while humans
are not (for all practical purposes) susceptible to FMD. - Mod.PC]
