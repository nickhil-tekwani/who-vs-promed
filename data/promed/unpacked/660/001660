AEROSOL TRANSMISSION (4)
========================

Subject: Aerosol Transmission
The initial posting on this topic, aerosol transmission of bloodborne
viruses, focused on the possibility of such for Ebola virus. This posting
included a citation of a review of the evidence for aerosol transmission of
HIV(see Favero M, Bolyard EA, Surgical Clinics of North America, December
1995 issue). Favero and Bolyard concluded that the evidence to date did not
support aerosol transmission of HIV, especially when the principles of
aerobiology were applied. I suspect that occupational transmission during
surgery would more likely result from "splashes"(perhaps potentiated by use
of powered instruments) onto unprotected mucous membranes or into the eyes
or percutaneous introduction via contaminated sharps rather than respirable
virus-containing particles.
In a related topic, new evidence of transmission of other bloodborne viruses,
hepatitis B virus(HBV) and hepatitis C virus(HCV), has been published in the
most recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine(Feb. 29, 1996
issue(I believe)). Two articles identified a surgeon as the source of HBV
and HCV respectively for the involved patients. Neither surgeon recalled
obvious instances of accidental injuries intraoperatively during the
implicated procedures. The latter investigation however included
experimental evidence that the surgeon, during tightening of wire sutures
experienced "paper thin" cuts and HBV was recovered from the surgeon during
this "mock" suturing procedure. Heretofore, this mechanism of transfer of
infectious viral particles has been unrecognized. The accompaning editorial,
however offered thoughtful perspective in that the episode of nosocomial
transmission of HBV likely could have been avoid altogether if the surgeon
had agreed to receive offered immunization against HBV. In addition, these
reports should not serve as renewed call for serologic screening of
healthcare workers for bloodborne pathogens rather continued improvement in
equipment and techniques to minimize occupational transmission.

Subject: potential for arthropod/aerosol transmission
I just noticed the statement by Dr. Constantine concerning transmission
of HIV through aerosol or arthropod vectors. While I agree that this is
highly unlikely based solely on epidemiologic considerations, there is
NO reason to expect approximately equal prevalences by age group for an
arthropod-borne disease. As a rule, where ever such a disease has become
established, prevalence increases with increasing age. Also, there are
known "risk factors" for the transmission of HIV virus. As most people
under the age of 10 are not sexually active or IV drug users, one would
not expect many infections in this age group. To the best of my knowledge,
nearly all cases in children have been explained by known risk factors -
blood transfusion or close contact with a known case.
As for the aerosol transmission discussion, the ability of a pathogen to
cause an infection via the aerosol route does NOT mean that the pathogen
can be transmitted by this route naturally. For example, artificially
created aerosols (e.g. centrifuge accidents or intentional exposure of
laboratory animals) have been known to infect laboratory workers and
experimental animals for many years. However, for a pathogen to be
transmitted via aerosol naturally, there must be a mechanism for the
pathogen to get "into the air" so to speak. This is usually accomplished
via an infection of the lungs, and then coughing produces the aerosol (e.g.
pneumonic plague). Again, all of the considerations mentioned in earlier
messages (i.e., stability of the pathogen, ability to infect the lungs and
produce an aerosol, amount of pathogen produced, etc.) all apply when
considering the potential for aerosol transmission.
