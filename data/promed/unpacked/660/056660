A New Begomovirus Species Causing Tomato Leaf Curl Disease in Varanasi, India.

publication 6 Jan 2003.
In November 2001, a leaf curl disease of tomato, manifested by yellowing of
leaves, upward leaf curling, leaf distortion, shrinking of the leaf
surface, and stunted plant growth was observed in tomato-growing areas in
the Varanasi and Mirzapur districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Yield
losses were up to 100 percent. A begomovirus was transmitted by whiteflies
and grafting to tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) cv. Punjab Chuhara.
Inoculated plants developed symptoms identical to those in naturally
infected tomatoes.
For characterization of the virus, viral DNA was isolated from artificially
inoculated tomato plants using 1 percent CTAB (2) followed by concentration
of supercoiled DNA by alkaline denaturation (1). A geminivirus was
confirmed by PCR using DNA-A degenerate primers (3), and a 550-bp amplified
product was obtained from artificially and naturally infected plants.
Full-length viral genomes of DNA-A and DNA-B were cloned in plasmid pUC18
at HindIII and XbaI sites, respectively. Partial tandem dimers of the viral
clones were infective to _Nicotiana benthamiana_ (Nb) and tomato cv. Organ
Spring through particle bombardment.
Infected Nb exhibited downward and upward leaf curling, big veins, leaf
puckering with interveinal chlorosis, and stunting. Symptoms in tomato were
identical to those in naturally infected plants. Cloned DNA also infected
_Capsicum annuum_ cv. California Wonder (upward leaf curling and stunting)
and tobacco cv. Xanthi (leaf curling and crinkling) but failed to infect
_Phaseolus vulgaris_, okra, cotton, or _N. glutinosa_.
The Varanasi isolate was sap-transmissible from bombarded plants to Nb and
tomato cv. Organ Spring. DNA-A alone infected Nb (upward leaf curling and
big veins) and tomato cv. OrganSpring (mild leaf curl), but symptoms were
delayed and milder.
Full-length genome sequencing revealed DNA-A (AY190290) contained 2757 nt
and DNA-B (AY190291) contained 2688 nt. DNA-A of the Varanasi isolate
shares 98.4 percent identity with a DNA-A sequence (AF449999) obtained from
a tomato showing leaf curl symptoms from the same region and 97.1 percent
identity with an isolate from Gujarat (900 km from Varanasi).
All 3 sequences represent isolates of the same species, herein called
Tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus, based on the priority of submission of the
DNA sequence for the Gujarat region (ToLCGV; AF413671). All isolates noted
were obtained from GenBank. However, except for the DNA-A sequence, no
other information is available for these ToLCGV isolates.
DNA-A of the ToLCGV-Varanasi isolate shares 66.8 percent identity with
Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus, severe strain (ToLCNdV-Svr) (U15015), and
84.1 percent with Tomato leaf curl Karnataka virus (U38239). No DNA-B has
been reported for these two ToLCGV isolates, and no infectious clone
proving the etiology of the disease has been constructed, except for
ToLCGV-Varanasi. DNA-B of ToLCGV-Varanasi shares 79.2 percent homology with
ToLCNdV-Svr and 84.1 percent with ToLCNdV-Luc (X89653).
These results suggest that the Varanasi isolate is related to ToLCGV, a
previously undescribed geminivirus species causing a devastating tomato
leaf curl disease in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.

[According to a report in the Economic Times Online (28 June 2002),
scientists at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore have
selected 3 tomato cultivars that are resistant to Tobacco leaf curl virus.
For years tomato crops have been affected by the virus in India, causing
yield losses of 50 to 100 percent.
