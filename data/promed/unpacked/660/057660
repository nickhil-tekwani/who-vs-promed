Australia free from equine influenza for 3 months
-------------------------------------------------
The last cases of equine influenza (EI) in Australia occurred on 9 Dec 2007
in New South Wales and on 25 Dec 2007 in Queensland. Since that time,
Australia has undertaken substantial surveillance to demonstrate the
disease is not present and has not identified any further infected cases.

Following the diagnosis of equine influenza in late August 2007, Australia
implemented a rigorous control and eradication program. The response
included an initial national horse standstill, movement controls,
trace-forward and trace-back, strict biosecurity measures, and strategic
vaccination in buffer zones and infected areas. Extensive surveillance was
also undertaken in both affected and unaffected regions.

The control measures restricted EI to parts of New South Wales (NSW) and
Queensland only. All other Australian states and territories (Victoria,
Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and the
Australian Capital Territory) have remained free from the disease. The
multi-faceted surveillance program has included epidemiological, clinical
and laboratory investigations.

There has been free movement of horses throughout Australia since 14 Mar
2008, together with a regulatory framework to facilitate tracking of animal
movements. This has provided a massive national sentinel animal program as
thousands of horses from affected zones move into regions that were never
affected. Assuming no further evidence of active EI infection is found, on
30 June 2008, Australia will confirm that the EI virus is no longer
present. However monitoring and surveillance for EI will continue,
consistent with the current OIE requirements and as part of our ongoing
surveillance for exotic disease.

The successful response to EI is a significant animal health achievement.
It highlights Australia's capacity to identify, diagnose and manage animal
disease incursions, as well as highly developed and effective emergency
management systems.

The response has also demonstrated Australia's unique partnership between
government and industry that includes shared responsibility for managing
the response.

[Their work to rid their country of equine influenza is to be commended.
Certainly they will be closely examining imports and hopefully reporting
any illness even remotely looking like EI. - MOD.TG]
