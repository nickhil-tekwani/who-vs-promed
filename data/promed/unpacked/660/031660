[Since the last ProMED-mail update on 4 Jul (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (04): Saudi Arabia, Iran, WHO 20140704.2585758) there have been 6 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia, including 2 deaths, bringing the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia to 721 including 295 deaths (case fatality rate: 40.9 percent) . All 6 cases had clinical disease (were not asymptomatic contacts screened for evidence of infection), were non-healthcare workers, and occurred in Arar, Hafoof, Jeddah, Ryadh, and Taif. It appears as though the newly reported case in Arar (see 6 Jul 2014) was also reported to have died, although there is a discrepancy between the history of comorbidities in the 2 reports.

Health Ministry announces 2 new cases of coronavirus
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, MoH, has announced 2 new cases of coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Abu Dhabi, which are stable and receiving necessary medical care.

The Ministry in a statement confirmed that it is coordinating with the competent departments and other medical authorities in the country, and has taken all necessary measures as per international standards and recommendations from the World Health Organisation, WHO.

To help prevent respiratory illnesses, the MoH has advised the public to wash hands often with soap and water (if not available, use hand sanitiser), cover nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then throw the tissue in the trash. "Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people with fever or flu-like illnesses," it says.

The Ministry also advised Hajj and Umrah pilgrims to take necessary vaccines 2 weeks prior to their journey to Hajj and Umrah. "Elderly, those with chronic illnesses and immune deficiencies, pregnant women and children below 12, are advised to postpone Hajj and Umrah this year [2014]," the MoH said.

The Ministry stated that the WHO confirmed the virus is not a public health concern at the moment, and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade.

The MoH confirmed that it is monitoring the situation closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

[3] UAE, 2 new cases - media report, RFI
Date: Wed 9 Jul 2014

Two new cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been detected in the capital [Abu Dhabi], the UAE Ministry of Health confirmed on Wednesday [9 Jul 2014].

Both individuals are reported to be stable at present, and are continuing to receive the necessary treatment. A ministry official told Gulf News that one of the infected patients is Emirati, while the other is of Arab origin. Both are middle-aged. "They are being treated at Mafraq Hospital and are expected to be discharged within a few days," he added.

The authority added that there is no cause for panic, and advised people to simply practise general hygiene measures, including regular handwashing, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing and use of sterilisers.

According to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) release on [4 Jul 2014], a total of 827 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported since September 2012. More than 280 patients have succumbed to the disease, with the majority of fatalities in Saudi Arabia.

In the UAE, many infected individuals have eventually recovered from the disease without medical intervention. As Gulf News reported in April [2014], Dr Fareeda Al Hosani, manager of communicable diseases at the Health Authority Abu Dhabi, explained that infected patients are hospitalised after being diagnosed in accordance with an international precautionary measure to keep them under observation, and away from healthy individuals.

In a bid to limit the spread of the virus, the UAE ministries of health and foreign affairs and the Saudi Ministry of Health have also recently advised that pregnant women, children, those aged above 65 and individuals suffering from chronic diseases reconsider their decision to perform the voluntary Umrah pilgrimage in Makkah. Pilgrim numbers tend to soar during the month of Ramadan [from 28 Jun 2014 to 28 Jul 2014], and afterwards as the time for the mandatory Haj pilgrimage draws near [approximately 1-6 Oct 2014].

There is still no cure for MERS-CoV and its route of transmission is not known, although Middle Eastern camels have been detected as harbouring the virus. Last month [June 2014], the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai launched a study to determine how the MERS-CoV may be transferred from camels to humans.

At present, the WHO still does not recommend any travel and trade restrictions or screenings at points of entry, but it advises extra caution for patients with chronic diseases.

"Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating," the WHO release advises. It adds that people should avoid drinking raw camel milk or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.

[The reports of the 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in the UAE at present do not provide epidemiologic details other than approximate ages ("middle aged" -- 30? 40? 50? 60? -- depends on one's criteria), the fact that one is an Emerati (from the UAE) and the other is "Arab" (does this refer to nationality or ethnicity?). More information on travel histories and other possible high risk exposures would be greatly appreciated.

In addition, results of studies addressing possible routes of transmission of the MERS-CoV from camels to humans would also be greatly appreciated when they become available.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On [30 Jun 2014 and 1 Jul 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for Saudi Arabia reported an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a death in a previously reported case.

Details of the case reported on [30 Jun 2014] are as follows:
A 15-year-old boy from Riyadh city, Riyadh Region who became ill on [26 Jun 2014]. He visited a hospital where samples were collected for laboratory test on [28 Jun 2014]. Following laboratory-confirmation with MERS-CoV infection on [30 Jun 2014], the patient was called back and admitted at the hospital. He is currently in a stable condition. The patient had a recent history of travel to Mecca city, Mecca Region. He had no history of contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV. The patient had no history of contact with animals or history of consumption of camel products in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms.

Details of the 2 cases reported on [1 Jul 2014] are as follows:
A 53-year-old pharmacist from Najran city, Najran Region. He became ill on [16 Jun 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on [28 Jun 2014] and is currently in a stable condition. He was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV infection on [30 Jun 2014]. The patient has underlying medical conditions. He has no history of contact with animals or history of consumption of camel products in the last 14 days prior to developing the illness. He travelled to Abha city, Asir Region, 20 days before falling ill and stayed there for a day.

A 28-year-old-housewife from Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. She became ill on [23 Jun 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [29 Jun 2014], and is currently in a stable condition. The patient was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on [30 Jun 2014]. She is reported not to have any underlying medical condition. The patient had no contact with previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV, and no history of travel. She has no history of contact with animals or history of consumption of camel products in the 14 days prior to developing the illness.

Investigation into contacts of the patients are ongoing.

An additional death in a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV infection has also been reported.

Globally, 827 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 287 related deaths, have officially been reported to WHO.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the WHO update from 4 Jul 2014, there have been a total of 827 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 287 deaths, officially reported to WHO. This tally does not include 7 additional cases and 3 deaths reported on the Saudi MOH website during the period 2-9 Jul 2014 (see above reports and prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (04): Saudi Arabia, Iran, WHO 20140704.2585758 for more details) and the 2 newly reported cases in the UAE on 9 Jul 2014. The addition of these cases would bring the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 836 cases, including at least 290 deaths (case fatality rate: 34.7 percent.

Noteworthy is that 2 of the 3 newly confirmed cases reported to WHO in the above update have been reported as "recovered" by the Saudi Arabian MOH (see section [1], 8 Jul 2014 -- the 15-year-old Saudi male and the 45-year-old expat male), and the 3rd, who had been reported as admitted to the ICU, is now reported as in "stable condition" (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (04): Saudi Arabia, Iran, WHO 20140704.2585758, reported on 1 Jul 2014).

Disconcerting information is the lack of known high risk exposures on the part of the newly reported cases, other than a pharmacist who may have unknowingly tended to a client with a respiratory illness compatible with MERS-CoV infection. The month of Ramadan began approximately 12 days ago. During this month there is an expected increase in individuals performing the lesser pilgrimage known as Umrah. It awaits to be seen if there will be significant transmission of MERS-CoV during this period or if the apparent decrease in numbers of cases reported in Saudi Arabia are reflecting a lower level of transmission. - Mod.MPP]
