Over 100 children belonging to the Johane Marange Apostolic sect in
Mbire District, Mashonaland Central Province, were last week [week of
20 Sep 2010] forcibly immunised against measles following an outbreak
that claimed several children over the past month.

A home-based care worker in Mudzengerere village, Mr Fibion Rupiya,
sought assistance from the police and health officials after realising
that several children belonging to the sect who were dying had
suspected symptoms of measles. "This outbreak apparently started a
month ago in Katsande Ward but we did not know that it was measles. A
lot of children belonging to this sect died, some were clandestinely
buried and we cannot really account for the number of deaths. "When
the number of children dying among the same group continued to grow,
we suspected measles but were ignorant of its symptoms so we sought
assistance from health officials and the police (to get access into
the community)," said Mr Rupiya.

He said a team of health officials immunised the children last week on
Monday and Tuesday [20-21 Sep 2010]. "Some children were locked up in
bedrooms and others were hidden in the bush but we assisted them in
identifying homes where we knew there were children who should be
immunised," Mr Rupiya said. Some of the women members of the sect
whose children were immunised against their doctrine, applauded
authorities for forcing all children to be immunised saying their
husbands were not willing to discuss the subject. One woman said she
had so far lost 4 children to measles, but her husband insisted that
holy water would save them. The Mudzengerere woman said she learnt
that immunisation worked when one of her children was immunised at
school in May [2010] without the family's knowledge. She said when a
fresh outbreak attacked the child this month [September 2010], it was
mild but her other child who had never been immunised before died
after contracting the disease. She had already lost 2 children during
the initial outbreak in February and March [2010]. The 2 had never
been immunised before.

Dr Yevai Chiradza and his team were on the ground when The Herald
visited the area on Friday [17 Sep 2010] but could not give details of
their assessment of the situation referring all questions to the
provincial medical director. He only said they were conducting
follow-up visits to assess the situation. Village head Mr Chigada
Mudzengerere said the crisis could have been averted if there were
proper communication systems in place in Mudzengerere Village. Mr
Mudzengerere said there were no telephones in the area making it
difficult to call for assistance when tragedy struck. He appealed for
assistance to build a satellite clinic in the village that is home to
nearly 500 people.

At least 70 children died of measles in Mashonaland Central recently.
About 24 deaths were confirmed by health officials in Chiweshe, while
the remainder were reported in Mbire.

[The current measles outbreak in Zimbabwe remains uncontained with the
recent deaths of 70 children in Mashonaland Central province during a
2 week period (see ProMED-mail post, archive no. 20100924.3460). It
remains to be seen whether the forcible vaccination of a few children
belonging to religious sect will have any effect on the course of the
outbreak.
