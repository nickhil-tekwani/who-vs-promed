At least one person died and 267 others have been hospitalised in a
suspected anthrax outbreak in Indonesia's eastern island of Flores after a
meal of water buffalo, state Antara news agency said yesterday. Villagers
consumed the meat of a dead buffalo in Reo village, in Manggarai
sub-district, on February 28 and two days later complained to the local
health center that they had broken out in red spots. One person died and
two others were in critical condition.
The water buffalo they had eaten had died on the way to a quarantine
station, but the carcass could not be analyzed for anthrax because all the
meat had been eaten, Manggarai police chief Lieutenant Colonel Suharto
said. "We cannot blame the owner of the buffalo because he had already
warned people not to eat the meat of the dead buffalo," Suharto said.
"We consider the incident a tragedy, but the police have no evidence (of
whether it is anthrax or not), because it was all eaten up." The chief of
the Manggarai farming office has set up a team to investigate the case.
Anthrax is an infectious disease of wild and domesticated animals,
especially cattle and sheep, caused by a bacillus, and can be transmitted
to humans [through ingestion or handling tissue while butchering or cooking
the meat.

[Why can the health officals not confirm or deny anthrax through tests on
critically ill patients? - Mod.TG
[In SE Asia anthrax is more common in buffalo and pigs than elsewhere in
the world. However, the number of people sick, 268, would be a record for
enteric anthrax or even a mixture of cutaneous cases ("red spots"?) among
the butchers plus enteric cases among the diners. The usual case numbers
for "severe" outbreaks is in the range of 1-3 dozen people, maximum. In
Muslim countries autopsies are usually frowned upon, which can severely
limit the quality of their data. Logically, though, there should be
adequate opportunities for suitable sample collection from the sick. - MHJ
