Outbreak of Monkeypox in Republic of Congo Confirmed
----------------------------------------------------
This morning we received confirmation from the CDC Poxvirus Section in
Atlanta, Georgia, that results of samples sent on 3 patients, are
definitely positive in the case of 2 of the 3 patients. Both confirmed
cases demonstrated "significant viremia at the vesiculo-pustular stage of
disease, which may indicate a poor prognosis and significant viral
shedding." The third patient was one of the first infected. All her
lesions were already healed when we collected her blood, therefore it makes
sense that she is no longer shedding virus. These are the first confirmed
cases of monkeypox in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville).

The fact that this epidemic is centered at the government hospital among
close contacts of health-care staff who have limited exposure to forest
animals, but ongoing exposure to patients with active lesions at the
hospital, underscores the urgent need for administration of smallpox
vaccine. We will do what we can using barrier methods, waste disposal,
patient isolation, and ongoing training of staff in universal precautions
(a misnomer, because the equipment needed for such precautions is not
universally available) to try to prevent the human-to-human transmission
that is obviously occurring.
In talking with other health-care providers working in the Likouala region,
it is clear that this disease has likely been present in the Likouala
Region for quite some time. This would make sense, given the fact that the
climate and living conditions of this inundated tropical rain forest region
are virtually identical to those of Equateur Province in Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), which is located just across the Oubangui River
from the Likouala Region in Republic of Congo, where the world's largest
recorded outbreak of human monkeypox infection occurred in 1996-97. There
is significant daily interchange of foodstuffs, bush meat, and persons
between the 2 countries. In fact one of the biggest bulk-food markets in
Impfondo (district capital of the Likouala Region) is on a no-man's island
in the middle of the River, located on the border between the 2 countries
(we call it affectionately "Market in the Middle"). There are also still
tens of thousands of refugees from DRC Equateur Province living on the ROC
banks of the River. Many people in Impfondo have relatives living on both
sides of the River. It is not at all uncommon for Congolese from ROC to
plant gardens (for subsistence farming) in the forest in DRC and vice-versa.
This epidemic is not over. An 18 year old female was admitted to the
government hospital on Tue 24 Jun 2003. We appreciate all of your support
and encouragement in trying to deal with this epidemic. Here in Congo, the
US Embassy staff has been very helpful, as have been the folks from the
Ministry of Health, and the staff at the government hospital. We'd also
like to thank MSF-Holland in Brazzaville who just donated an initial supply
of barrier/protection equipment.
More help is needed. As in many other places where monkeypox is known to
be transmitted to humans from indigenous species (not imported vectors), in
Impfondo, there is no adequate facility or infrastructure to deal with this
situation. That's why we are here: striving to start a mission hospital,
to help alleviate/prevent this kind of situation.
