Turkey's Meat and Milk Board has confirmed that anthrax was detected at a farm in the Gölbaşı district of Ankara where cattle imported from Brazil were kept, the Cumhuriyet daily reported.

According to a written statement from the board, "There is nothing to be concerned about because the infected meat was not released to the market." But the board failed to mention that 50 out of 3959 cattle had died of anthrax.

According to a T24 news website report, the board vaccinated more than 10 000 animals at farms in the area.

The cattle were imported from Brazil just before Eid al-Adha, the Muslim festival during which animals are sacrificed to God.

Authorities have found that 4000 cattle imported from Brazil for Turkey's Meat and Milk Institution ahead of the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha or the "Feast of Sacrifice" and kept in a farm facility in the Gölbaşı district of capital Ankara are infected with anthrax.

Animal sales have been stopped in the Ahiboz and Günalan neighborhoods that are just 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] away from the farm where the affected cattle are kept. Local breeders in the Gölbaşı district are angry, asking how the authorities allowed those "infected animals" to enter the country in the 1st place. They said their businesses have also been affected.

However, the Forestry and Agriculture Ministry said as a rule, all animals imported into the country are quarantined at a specific site and tests are run on those animals for 21 days to make sure they do not have any diseases before they are allowed to be sold on the market.

A total of 3959 cattle were shipped from Brazil ahead of the Feast of Sacrifice for the Meat and Milk Institution. However, when some of the animals died, teams from Gölbaşı's Agriculture and Forestry Directorate launched an investigation to determine why they perished and discovered traces of anthrax disease. Following the findings, 60 animals from the herd were terminated and the farm was placed under quarantine.

The Meat and Milk Institution has assured the public that meat produced from the infected farm or affected animals have not been sold on the market.

The breeders from Ahiboz and Günalan said the facility where the affected animals are kept was established 20 days ago and they learned about the anthrax disease on the 2nd day of the Feast of Sacrifice, on [22 Aug 2018].

The villagers, who noted the bovines arrived one week before the Feast of Sacrifice, complained the "animals should not have been brought here before being checked for any diseases." "There are a total of 10 000 cattle in Ahiboz and Günalan," said Şener Karatay, the village head, adding that the local breeders have been also affected. They [breeders] cannot sell their animals because of the quarantine. They have a debt to the Agriculture Cooperative, state-run lender Ziraat Bank and private banks" he explained.

Veterinarians from the Forestry and Agriculture Ministry have vaccinated 10 000 cattle against anthrax in the neighborhoods near the affected farm.

Meanwhile, Forestry and Agriculture Minister Bekir Pakdemirli has ordered for an inquiry into the anthrax incident in Gölbaşı. "All necessary precautions have been taken and implemented to prevent the disease from spreading to other animals," the ministry said in a statement.

Speaking to Cumhuriyet, villagers said dogs and birds ate the meat of the dead cattle, which had been dumped near a creek next to the farm. The bodies of the animals were finally buried 3 days after the anthrax was detected.

[The 2nd report has a photograph of the facility holding these 4000 animals. It is just a massive holding pen with few facilities -- water, feed -- for these animals. It must be stressful for them. The handling of the dead animals was of the moment and showed no preplanning or proper preparations. Fortunately the surrounding livestock have been vaccinated, and hopefully these beasts are scheduled for the Eid. - Mod.MHJ
