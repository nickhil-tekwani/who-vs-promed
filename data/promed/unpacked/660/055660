[1a] Serial Infections: Impact of co-circulating strains
Date: Fri 17 Jul 2020

Different strains of the new coronavirus could be infecting people in some communities at once, pushing up the death toll from the disease, according to a new study. Researchers from the UC Berkeley school of public health said variations of the pathogen circulating in Europe and the United States could be causing "serial infections" in some people, confusing the immune system and triggering an overreaction or even death. "If one strain is still highly prevalent, the situation should be closely monitored, especially for severe disease occurrence, and social distancing should still be maintained to make sure the 2nd strain doesn't get introduced," Lee Riley, professor and chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the school and lead author of the study, told the South China Morning Post.

The team's findings, which have not been peer-reviewed, were posted on the preprint service medRxiv.org on Wednesday [15 Jul 2020].

Previous studies found that as Sars-CoV-2, the official name for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, spread from person to person, it acquired an important mutation called D614G. This mutation could improve the physical stability of its spike protein and make it more infectious, according to some research.

[The concept of serial infections may partly explain individuals reporting mild symptoms in the 1st exposure and subsequent exposure to a variant resulting in a dengue-like exaggerated immune response with more severe symptoms; more data is obviously needed to validate whether these are re-infections by genetic variants or repeated infection by the same strains, how vulnerable a less than perfect immune response to the virus leaves the infected, and its implications for the effectiveness of a vaccine. - Mod.UBA]

[1b] Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission

Abstract
Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34 412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found 2 subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The 2nd infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the 1st infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.

Discussion summary
------------------
- This genomic analysis of 34 412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the GISAID database found 2 dominant subclades of the virus co-circulating in Europe and the United States derived from the Wuhan HU-1 strain isolated in China in December 2019.
- The dominant subclades were significantly associated with some of the high cumulative CFR [case fatality rate] regions in Western Europe, the United States, and in California, even after controlling for differences in the initiation of social distancing measures, population age structure, prevalence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, number of hospital beds/1000 population, and number of RT-PCR tests/1 million population done.
- In the United Kingdom, the cumulative proportion of the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant was low (6.4%) but the UK's CFR was one of the highest in Europe at 14%. The UK reported more than 255 000 cases and 40 000 deaths at the end of 1st week of June 2020. Thus, in regions where the case numbers are high, the numbers of these circulating dominant mutants would also be high, even if the relative proportion of one may be low. Part of the high mortality rate of COVID-19 observed in the UK, therefore, could still be related to the high level of co-circulation of these dominant strains (figure 2, table 2 - see source URL).
- In California, Santa Clara county reported a high cumulative CFR (5.1%) relative to San Francisco at 1.6%. The 2 mutants together accounted for over 90% of the strains circulating in Santa Clara in late March 2020 but both fell rapidly to less than 5% by early April 2020 (figure 3). It should be noted that this county reported less than 3000 cases and 150 deaths at the end of 1st week in June 2020.
- The co-circulation of dominant SARS-CoV2 subclades raises a disturbing possibility that people living in places with high prevalence of co-circulating strains may get serially infected with each variant. The 2nd infection may trigger an immune response not unlike the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) observed in diseases such as dengue. In settings where a population gets serially exposed to different strains of the dengue virus, the exposed individuals may mount varying levels of heterotypic antibody response directed at the different viral strain that do not neutralize but enhance binding of the strain to enter host cells (10). Infected with SARS-CoV2, those with underlying medical conditions are likely to mount lower levels of neutralizing antibody response to the 1st infection, putting them at risk for ADE-like response during the 2nd infection.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced on 17 Jul 2020 that it had confirmed that 293 people in Tokyo [under the age of 10 to 90. sic] were newly infected with the new coronavirus. The number confirmed per day in Tokyo exceeded the number of 286 people on the previous day, 16 Jul 2020, [which was ]the highest number [to date].

According to the capital, out of 293 people, the total number of people in their 20s and 30s was 210, accounting for more than 70% of the total, while the total number of people in their 40s and 50s was 58, close to 20% of the total.

151 out of [the] 293 people were close contacts of people confirmed to have been infected [already], and the infection route of the remaining 142 people is not yet known. 69 of the 293 are employees and customers at host clubs, cabaret clubs, and other stores that entertain. Of these, 49 were in the Shinjuku area.

In addition, there are 24 diners, 10 at facilities such as nursing homes and medical institutions, 16 at home, 15 at work, and guests at stage performances in theaters in Shinjuku Ward. Also, 10 students were infected at a training camp in the sports club of Chuo University.

This makes a total of 8933 people confirmed infected in Tokyo. But no deaths were confirmed on 17 Jul 2020 in Tokyo.

Tokyo is aiming to increase the number of beds for patients from 1000 to 2800 in response to the increase in the number of people infected with the new coronavirus. As of 16 Jul 2020, the number of beds actually secured was over 1500. Experts are concerned that the speed of increasing patients may exceed the number of beds.

[3] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 660 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 745 confirmed cases, 295 deaths
[C] Italy: 244 216 total cases, 35 042 deaths
[D] Iran: 271 606 total cases, 13 979 deaths
[E] USA: 3 833 271 total cases, 142 877 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.UBA]

[There were 16 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours; 3 were imported, and 13 were locally acquired in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. While it is now 13 days with no new cases reported from Beijing, it appears another cluster is under way in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. According to another media report, the area will do mass testing.

There were 42 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (12 imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 64 new cases. The CHP HK page, however, mentions a total case number of 1778 cases in Hong Kong so far (comprising 1777 confirmed cases and one probable case). The newly reported cases announced today [19 Jul 2020] involve 23 males and 41 females aged between 16 and 86 years. Among them, 4 had travel history during the incubation period. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/16/P2020071600800.htm).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 34 cases with 1 new death, compared with 39 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (17 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 95 consecutive days. There were 21 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (10), Gwangju (10), and Daejeon (1); and 13 imported cases: airport quarantine (7), Gyeonggi (4), and Jeju (1). 11 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases (compared with 8 provinces yesterday, 17 Jul 2020).

Detailed updates on the 34 cases reported yesterday (18 Jul 2020) including information on clusters can be found in notices 443 and 444, at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well. The increase in cases in the past few days has been paralleled by increases in reported deaths.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +249 cases and +14 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (16 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +233 cases and +11 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases increased slightly, but cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, the main provinces at the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). The provinces reporting the largest numbers of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period are Lombardy (88), Emilia-Romagna (40) and Veneto (34); Lazio (20), Liguria (18) and Campania (15) are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (3 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 73 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 57 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Interpretation: So far so good, but there are periodic signs of localized increased transmission. Time will tell.

[D] Iran: 271 606 total cases, 13 979 deaths

Iranian president, Hassan Rohani, on 18 Jul 2020 estimated that as many as 25 million Iranians could have been infected with the coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak, as he urged the public to take the pandemic seriously. Rohani cited a new study by the Health Ministry in offering the unprecedentedly high number of 25 million coronavirus cases. Iran's population is around 81 million people. "Our estimate is that until now 25 million Iranians have been infected with this virus and about 14 000 have lost their dear lives," Rohani said.

"The report says that there is the possibility that between 30 and 35 million other people will be at risk," he said. Rohani said more than 200 000 people had been hospitalized, while adding that the number was expected to double in the coming months. He did not say what the report's estimates were based on. The study has so far not been made public.

Experts and others have long said that real numbers of coronavirus cases in Iran are higher than the confirmed figures. A parliamentary report released in April 2020 said Iran's death toll is likely nearly double the officially reported figures. Given insufficient testing, the report said the number of people infected at the time was probably "8 to 10 times" higher than the confirmed figures.

According to the latest figures released by the Health Ministry on 18 Jul 2020, Iran has 271 606 infections while the death toll stands at 13 979. In recent weeks, Iran has seen a surge in its daily death toll.

Authorities on 18 Jul 2020 reimposed one-week restrictions in the capital, Tehran, including banning religious and cultural functions, closing cafes, indoor pools, amusement parks, and zoos in an effort to contain the deadly pandemic.

New York City had a cumulative total of 217 895 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 18 Jul 2020 (+333 since 17 Jul 2020) including 18 771 (+13 since 17 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4617 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, South Carolina and Ohio. Note that 6 of the 10 states are located in the south east region of the country. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1538 to 10 328. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 45 states and entities now have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportional increase of newly confirmed cases was 2.0%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 19.2% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, but gradually slowing down, but may reflect a change in reporting in the USA that began on Mon 13 Jul 2020.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 18 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 47 313 367 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

- The African region reported 7.1% of the global newly reported cases and 2.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 72.9% (13 373) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 3.3% (600), Algeria 3.2% (593), Ghana 2.4% (447), Kenya 2.1% (389) and Madagascar 2.0% (378).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.29% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 52.6% (1735) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 20.0% (659), Australia 12.9% (425), Singapore 9.9% (327), China 2.4% (82), and South Korea 1.2% (39).

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline, the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region, the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the slow but steady increase in the Africa region and a slight increase in the Western Pacific region today [18 Jul 2020].

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 14 414 748, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India crossed the one million case mark on 16 Jul 2020.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (63 259) followed by India (37 407) and Brazil (26 549). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (56.1%). A global total of 604 243 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4904 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Peru, Argentina, and Bangladesh. These 10 countries are the same as 3 days ago, just slight variances in order (15 Jul 2020). All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2709 to 63 259. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. Also worthy of note is that 6 of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SARS-CoV-2 activity in this region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 9.0%, again consistent with the ongoing pandemic but slowing down in terms of daily growth.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing on a daily basis even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
