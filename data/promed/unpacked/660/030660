A strain of the malaria virus that multiplies rapidly has been
discovered in Sarawak, and the health authorities are very worried.

Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan Hong Nam said teams of
malaria experts from the State Health and Medical Services Department
discovered this rapidly-spreading mosquito-borne disease when
investigating the malaria outbreak in the Bario highlands deep in
interior northern Sarawak.

"The outbreak in Bario was caused by a fast-growing strain that
multiplies rapidly within 24 hours instead of the usual 48 hours or
72 hours. This is something that we (state health authorities) are
very worried about. Because it spreads very fast, it can attack the
body organs rapidly, even the brain," said Dr Chan, who is also
Sarawak Disaster Relief Committee chairman.

Dr Chan said yesterday [3 Aug 2008] that this malaria strain was "not
a normal thing in this state" and expressed worry that no one knew
how many areas were infected by this strain.

"The health teams deployed in Bario are now collecting as much data
as possible on the latest situation in the affected regions. We want
to accurately identify those places infected by this fast-spreading
strain," he said.

The Star last week highlighted the malaria outbreak in the Bario
highlands after 21 Penans were floored by high fever and had to be
flown out to hospitals in Miri and Marudi.

Initially, 2 Penan settlements -- Urur Dalan and Semirian -- were
found to be infected. The outbreak then spread outside of Bario and
hit Long Jikitan, a settlement located nearer to Miri.

Dr Chan said he was hopeful that the same drugs used to treat
previous malaria cases could deal with this fast-spreading strain.

[The phrase "fast growing" implies that the outbreak may be due to
_Plasmodium knowlesii_, which has a cycle of just 24 hours in the
host, compared to 48 hours for _P. falciparum_ malaria and 72 hours
for _P. vivax_ malaria. This, however, needs to be confirmed.

A recent study of the _Anopheles_ malaria vectors in Sarawak
identified _Anopheles latens_ as the main vector for _P. knowlesi_
malaria parasites and showed that _A. latens_ obtains blood meals
from humans and monkeys indiscriminately (Tan CH et al. Bionomics of
Anopheles latens in Kapit, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo in relation to
the transmission of zoonotic simian malaria parasite Plasmodium
knowlesi. Malar J. 2008 Mar 31;7:52).

Bario is located in Sarawak (Malaysia) close to the border of
Indonesian Borneo:
