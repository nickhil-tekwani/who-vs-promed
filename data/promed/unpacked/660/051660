Another strange disease has been reported in the Western district of Kibaale, with symptoms similar to those of the 1st strange cases that were detected in Mubende district in the central region, about 70 km [45 miles] away (see Undiagnosed fever - Uganda (07): (MD) RFI 20180805.5948143).

Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the Ministry of Health's senior public relations officer, has confirmed that a 5-year-old girl presented with symptoms of vomiting and headache before her blood samples were taken to Uganda Virus Research Institute for further diagnosis. Ainebyoon says the samples are being tested for suspected haemorrhagic fevers of Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo fever and yellow fever viruses.

The incident comes hardly a week after the Ministry of Health reported 16 cases of a strange disease in Mubende district, with 8 deaths recorded in the villages of Kalenzi , Kayembe, Sunga and Kasambya.

He says the girl has been transferred to Mubende Regional Referral Hospital, where an isolation unit was created to handle similar cases.

[This case is similar to those that occurred in the Mubende district some 70 km (45 miles) distant. As with those cases, apparently, health authorities consider these to be hemorrhagic fever cases because of the types of tests that have been done, with negative results for the Mubende cases, although the symptoms mentioned in the above report are of only severe headache and vomiting with no indication of hemorrhagic manifestations. The information provided is too non-specific to speculate on the etiological agent that might be involved.

There have been several instances of undiagnosed hemorrhagic disease in Uganda this year [2018].

ProMED would be interested in receiving additional information about any test results, any other laboratory tests that might have been conducted locally, or details of symptoms and physical findings. - Mod.TY
