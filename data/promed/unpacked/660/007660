Virginia: 1st Fatal Human Case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in 2003
---------------------------------------------------
A Gloucester County man in his 70s has died from eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE), the 1st death of the year from a mosquito-borne disease
in Virginia, state health officials said. The man contracted the disease on
26 Aug 2003 and died on 16 Sep 2003, said Reuben Varghese, health director
for the Three Rivers Health District. The death is the only human EEE case
reported so far in 2003 in Virginia. 8 cases have been reported nationwide
and 4 have resulted in deaths.
EEE is considered the most deadly of the mosquito-borne diseases, and
usually affects animals, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The virus attacks the central nervous system,
causing the brain to swell. Symptoms range from mild, flu-like illnesses to
coma.
In Virginia, there have been 7 cases of EEE in horses in 2003, according to
the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Those cases were
in Suffolk, Chesapeake, and the counties of Halifax, Madison, Pittsylvania,
and Powhatan. An infected horse indicates that mosquitoes carrying the
disease are nearby and may threaten human health.
There was also a group of 8 emus in Stafford County that died, one of which
was diagnosed with EEE. Health officials said it is likely that the other
7, which were not tested, died of the same disease.
People older than 50 and younger than 15 are most susceptible, though, and
35 percent of people who survive have lingering neurological problems. A
third of people who contract the virus die from it, the CDC said.
The federal health organization began tracking EEE in 1964, and has
documented 200 cases, most in the eastern United States. 4 were in
Virginia, with the last in Portsmouth in 1998. By contrast, West Nile virus
has killed 93 people nationwide so far in 2003 -- fewer than 2 percent of
people who contracted it. 7 cases have been reported in 2003 in Virginia,
with no deaths. In 2002, Virginia recorded 29 human West Nile infections,
including 2 deaths.
State officials are preparing for what could be a significant increase in
the mosquito population due to standing floodwaters and surges from
Hurricane Isabel. Suzanne Jenkins, an epidemiologist with the Virginia
Department of Health, said salt water from the ocean may have enlarged salt
marshes that incubate certain breeds of mosquitoes. Jenkins said the state
is weighing whether to conduct aerial spraying to control the mosquito
population.

[This is the 4th death in the USA during 2003 so far among 8 recognized
cases; a death rate of 50 percent, compared with less than 2 percent for
West Nile virus infections. This illustrates clearly the relative severity
of these 2 mosquito-borne diseases. - Mod.CP]
