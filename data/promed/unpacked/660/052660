[Bulgaria initially notified to the OIE its 1st 2 outbreaks of H5 on 22 Oct 2017, one in a commercial duck unit of approx. 10 000 birds on a farm in Stefanovo, Dobrich and the other on a backyard farm in Uzundzhovo, Haskovo. The notification, and a link to a map, was published in 20171023.5398822. Reportedly the event had started on 17 Oct 2017.

The information on the strain involved, namely H5N8, derived from a DEFRA (UK) assessment of 22 Oct 2017 (see 20171024.5401457).

On 25 Oct 2017, the Bulgarian participants presented to EC's PAFF Committee (Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed), during its periodic meeting in Brussels, a presentation with more details on the 2 1st outbreaks and the measures undertaken (see at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20171025_pres_hpai_bgr.pdf).

The previous HPAI H5N8 event in Bulgaria started on 19 Dec 2016 and was declared resolved on 30 Apr 2017, involving a total of 72 outbreaks (links to all reports and a cumulative map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22044).

Bulgaria's follow-up report, confirming the identity of the causative agent and its diagnostic background, and providing epidemiological data on the spread of the virus since 22 Oct 2017, is expected. - Mod.AS
