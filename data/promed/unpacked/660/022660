The Press Service of the Smolensk Region has reported an outbreak of measles cases in the region. The diagnosis of measles was confirmed in 3 residents of the village of Valutina: 2 young men aged 24 and 26, and a 6 month old baby. The 3 cases were classified as imported cases, and it was established that the diseased had been contracted in Tula region. To prevent an outbreak of measles in the village, all local residents have been vaccinated against the disease, a total of 82 people, all of whom had contact with one or other of the 3 measles cases.

The Regional Emergencies Ministry stated that measles is often a cause of early death among young children worldwide. In adults, the disease can take a severe clinical form. Most often, measles outbreaks have occurred in the period from December to May with peaks occurring every 2 to 4 years.

Measles is an acute infectious disease, followed by fever up to 40-41 deg C [104-105.8 deg F], inflammation of mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, rash, and intoxication of the whole organism. Most complications occur in children under the age of 5 years.

An unfavourable epidemiological situation with regard to measles virus infection exists in Udmurtia at the present time. The Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] press service has reported that during 2013 a total of 12 people, including 3 children, have been hospitalised. 8 of these patients, including 3 children under 2 years of age, are confirmed cases of measles by laboratory diagnosis. 9 of the adults and 3 of the children had not received measles vaccination. 11 of these patients were from Izhevsk and one from Glazov. All are workers in at risk occupations -- workers in trade and public catering, individual entrepreneurs.

An investigation has found that the initial cases were associated with a trip to Moscow to the "Lublin" market, where cases of measles were reported in October and November [2013].

In 2012, 39 cases of measles, 12 of them children. In most cases, the sick had not been vaccinated against measles and the outbreak spread by nosocomial infection among unvaccinated people. It is believed that the measles virus had been imported from Thailand. Prior to that, by 2005 Udmurtia had been declared free of measles virus infection.

According to experts, the only effective way to protect against measles is vaccination. Vaccination is routinely administered twice to children at 1 year and 6 years of age. Adults are not vaccinated provided they have documentation of previous vaccination or have been vaccinated twice with an interval of 6 months. Once administered, measles vaccination protects for life.

In Udmurtia about 2000 children have been fully vaccinated by the age of 6, and another 1445 have received at least one dose (72.2 per cent). The main reason for the of persistence of measles is the relatively large number of unvaccinated children -- 1252 or 63 per cent.

[3] Philippines (vaccination campaign)

One week after issuing an alert on measles in Metro Manila, the Department of Health (DOH) on Monday [16 Dec 2013] started a massive vaccination campaign in the metropolis to protect children from the disease. In a statement posted on the government website [http://www.gov.ph/2013/12/16/doh-ncr-leads-measles-vaccination-in-metro-manila/], DOH Metro Manila head Eduardo Janairo said they will not wait for an epidemic to take place before taking action against the disease. "This is to ensure that virus transmission will be averted. We have an adequate amount of vaccines to provide everyone who needs to be immunized," Janairo said. "We will not wait for an epidemic of measles to spread and affect a large number of our children. It must be stopped aggressively so that we can prevent large-scale outbreaks that can lead to serious illness and even death," he added.

At least 3 deaths had been reported -- up from 2 last week [week of 9 Dec 2013], the DOH said. The fatalities include a 9 month old child in Caloocan, a 4 month old in Malabon, and a 2 year old in Muntinlupa.

Janairo said there is still no treatment or cure for measles, adding it is best to have people and their children "vaccinated to be protected." "I call on all parents to go to the nearest health center in your community and have your one to 12 year old children vaccinated against measles. As parents, we have the responsibility to ensure the health and safety of our children," Janairo said. The same statement said the DOH kicked off its campaign at the covered court of Purok Molave in Barangay Addition Hills in Mandaluyong City. Janairo said measles vaccination teams will be deployed in 17 local government units in Metro Manila regardless of the number of measles cases there. Last week [week of 9 Dec 2013], the DOH advised residents in Metro Manila to take precautions against measles, after noting deaths and a rise in cases in at least 5 cities in the National Capital Region [NCR]. Janairo cited records showing a rapid rise in measles cases in Las Pinas, Muntinlupa, Caloocan, Manila, and Paranaque Cities.

The DOH said local health officials have started to seek vulnerable children aged 0 to 59 months old in their areas to be vaccinated, so they would not develop the disease. "Measles is extremely contagious and anyone who is exposed to someone with measles will surely get the disease unless they have been vaccinated or already had measles before. Those who live through a case of measles retain their immunity for life," the DOH said.

Citing data from its Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit, the DOH noted 233 confirmed measles cases from 1 Jan to 14 Dec [2013]. Janairo earlier advised parents and guardians of children to look out for symptoms including: common cold symptoms like high fever, cough, runny nose, sore eyes that can last for several days appearance of a red, blotchy rash "If you believe you are exposed to someone with measles, you should observe for measles symptoms to appear after 9 days. Some person can be affected immediately before the rash appears four days after being exposed." he said.

Although measles has been practically eliminated in the US, measles cases spiked in 2013 because of international travel, according to a new study. Published in the 5 Dec 2013, issue of JAMA Pediatrics, the study was led by Mark J Papania, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Importation of measles continues, Papania wrote, and American doctors should suspect measles in children with high fever and rash, "especially when associated with international travel or international visitors." Health care providers should report suspected cases to local health departments. On an average day, 430 children -- 18 every hour -- die of measles worldwide. In 2011, there were an estimated 158 000 measles deaths, the CDC found. In the US, there are usually only around 60 cases per year, but there was a spike in 2013, according to the study. The estimated 175 cases were linked to individuals who brought the infection home after foreign travel.

"A measles outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere," said CDC director Tom Frieden. "The steady arrival of measles in the United States is a constant reminder that deadly diseases are testing our health security every day. Someday, it won't be only measles at the international arrival gate; so, detecting diseases before they arrive is a wise investment in US health security."

Currently, only one in 5 countries can rapidly detect, respond to, or prevent global health threats caused by emerging infections. Improvements overseas, such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems, training disease detectives, and building facilities to investigate disease outbreaks make the world -- and the United States -- more secure, according to CDC. "With patterns of global travel and trade, disease can spread nearly anywhere within 24 hours," Frieden said. "That's why the ability to detect, fight, and prevent these diseases must be developed and strengthened overseas, and not just here in the United States."
