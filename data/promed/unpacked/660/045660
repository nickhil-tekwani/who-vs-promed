Another person with salmonellosis is being treated at the hospital in Cacak [Morava], central Serbia, director Dr Radoslav Milosevic said on Wed 22 Apr 2015. However, the new patient, an 85 year old man, did not come from a nursing home in the village of Vranici where 5 elderly people died of this form of foodborne illness during the past week. According to Milosevic, the patient is "a neighbor" of the Dvoje nursing home. He added that the condition of 2 other patients the hospital is treating for the same disease has deteriorated.

Currently, the Cacak hospital is treating 9 salmonellosis patients, while one more has been admitted to the Uzice Health Care Center. The nursing home salmonellosis epidemic was reported on 16 Apr 2015. 41 people have been infected, among them the staff and 2 locals. Five people have passed away.

Labor Ministry's Social Protection Inspection chief Biljana Zekavica told the media that "shortcomings have been identified in the work of the nursing home's employees," but that those shortcomings would not have been grave enough "to cause this kind of epidemic". She told Tanjug that "the entire facility has not yet been inspected", and that results of microbiological tests are also pending. According to Zekavica, the nursing home's license could be revoked, but the outcome will be known "once all relevant institutions submit their reports that will determine any deviations from the norm."

The police in Cacak have formed a team to investigate the salmonellosis outbreak, said chief Predrag Pavlovic, and added that autopsy reports for the 5 victims have not yet been completed.

[The elderly represent a significant cohort of those acquiring salmonellosis because of higher incidence of morbidity and mortality, along with the very young and those who are immunocompromised. The report offers no information regarding the potential food source of the outbreak, and we would appreciate further information from informed sources. - Mod.LL
