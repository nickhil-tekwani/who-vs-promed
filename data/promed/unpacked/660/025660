The Montana Department of Livestock announced on Wednesday [5 Jan 2022] an animal in a Madison County cattle herd, within Montana's brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), has been confirmed positive for brucellosis.

The positive animal tested as a "suspect" on a whole herd test conducted in December 2021, the Department of Livestock said. Pathologists at the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory collected tissues and forwarded the samples to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, where infection was subsequently confirmed.

The ranch has been placed under quarantine and an epidemiological investigation has begun. The positive animal tested negative the prior year [2020], which allows the Department to reduce the scope of the disease investigation.

Voluntary whole herd testing is an effective method for DSA producers to protect their herd. Early detection of infections not only allows producers to detect the disease before it spreads within the herd but also minimizes the time required to clean up a herd, and thereby shortens the duration of quarantine, which allows herd owners to control when testing happens, often by pairing with other ranch management activities.

"A high rate of testing, much of it voluntary, is the primary reason we continue to find affected herds rapidly," said State Veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski. "A robust testing program minimizes the impact to the operation and protects our state and trading partners." Zaluski commended Montana producers within the DSA for their high rate of compliance with brucellosis testing regulations.

Past cases of brucellosis in livestock were the result of transmission from infected wild elk as determined by an epidemiological investigation that included genetic fingerprinting (genotyping) of the cultured bacteria. The source of infection in the Madison County herd has not yet been determined.

This is the 11th brucellosis-affected herd detected since the creation of Montana's DSA in 2010. Prior to the creation of the DSA, if 2 or more affected herds were detected in a 2-year period, the state would have lost its brucellosis Class Free Status. Currently, brucellosis-affected herds are not subject to depopulation if cases are found within a DSA, and states can maintain their Class Status.

[This article is referring to the bacterium _Brucella abortus_. The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers, but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. The investigation as to where this case of the disease came from is ongoing.

Large animals, especially elk and bison, may have no obvious signs of the disease. The _Brucella_ bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints.

In humans, this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound or even intact skin, or a splash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughter workers and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection; however, if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk.

When a person is infected, clinical signs and symptoms may include fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful. Other joints such as ankles, hips, knees and shoulders may be swollen, warm, and painful.

The DSA is so named because this particular area is no stranger to this disease, and this area is subject to additional surveillance. However, they are catching cases earlier in cattle and able to deal with fewer animals having the disease and spreading the disease. It's nice to see the producers and the veterinarians of the state office working closing to contain this disease. This close watch for the disease in the DSA is likely why it was caught early. - Mod.TG
