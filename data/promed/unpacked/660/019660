Canine influenza seems not to be a new disease but to have been around
for probably a century or more. See a couple of recent articles on
this: Morens DM, Taubenberger JK: Historical thoughts on influenza
viral ecosystems, or behold a pale horse, dead dogs, failing fowl, and
sick swine. Influenza Other Respi Viruses 2010; 4(6): 327-37

and Morens DM, Taubenberger JK: Pandemic influenza: certain
uncertainties. Rev Med Virol 2011; doi: 10.1002/rmv.689. (Epub ahead

While it is true that we can say canine influenza was not proven to
exist before the virology era, when viruses began to be isolated, that
can also be said about human and equine influenza too. But most ID
historians think the exhaustively documented clinical and
epidemiologic evidence compiled over centuries makes it unlikely that
all the epidemics/pandemics were anything other than the exact same
disease we see today. In particular there are many independent
documentations of horse to dog transmission during equine epizootics
of what to all intents and purposes seemed then, as now, to be
influenza, as well as occasional evidence of transmission between
humans and dogs. Over a century ago influenza, transmitted from horses
to dogs, was seen in racing greyhounds. While we can of course be
conservative and say there is no evidence that any of these diseases
were influenza, it is also possible to consider all of this old
influenza activity as clues to how influenza evolves and is
maintained.

[As David Morens points out, equine influenza outbreaks have been well
known for more than a century. James Law, the 1st professor of
Veterinary Medicine in the United States pointed to the transmission
of equine influenza to dogs in his 1874 report to the Department of
Agriculture -- see reference below.

Equine influenza was a high impact disease because mortality may have
been 1 or 2 percent but occasionally spiking up to 10 percent of
horses in an area. In those days, horses were critical to the economic
well being of a community because of the transport and power they
provided. We will probably never know what virus exactly was being
passed to dogs but the equine influenza historical record is quite
clear and the transmission of that disease to dogs was described by
the foremost veterinary authority of the day.

It is only prudent to not completely discount this fact of
transmission in our thinking about the epidemiology of influenza.
Moreover, recent developments as described in Paul Gibbs's review of
equine and canine influenza, indicate that no matter what the history,
the canine influenza virus has arrived -- heralded by the 1st
isolation of H3N8 equine influenza in dogs in 2004 in Florida
Greyhounds. Since then we have identified an H3N2 in Korea in 2007,
the transmission of H5N1 to dogs in Thailand in 2005, and the
isolation of H1N1 in China in 2009. Most important, from a
surveillance point of view, is the fact that the equine influenza H3N8
has now spread to dogs in 35 states and can be considered endemic in
the USA.

Clearly, if we want to have a good idea of what the "influenza"
situation is across the world, we should be taking a "One Medicine,
One Health" approach. This would suggest that we do surveillance on
wild birds, poultry, swine, horses, and now dogs as well as humans.
Surveillance efforts in horses could be built upon actions taken at
present to ensure equine health when they move internationally and
with movement between states. Attempts to perform surveillance in dogs
will be more challenging because there is no public health or
population health structure that can be mobilized currently. However,
such efforts should be undertaken as a joint "One Medicine, One
Health" approach to influenza. The lack of animal health or public
health didn't seem to intimidate James Law, or his student, Daniel
Elmer Salmon, the 1st person to earn a DVM degree in the United
States. Ergo, we shouldn't be bamboozled either.
