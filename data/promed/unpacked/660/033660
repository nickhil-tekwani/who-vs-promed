Tunisia has reported 160 cases of _Shigella sonnei_, a dangerous intestinal infection that spreads quickly and is resistant to antibiotics, the Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) reported on Thursday [22 Dec 2022].

"Most of the cases have been cured. One death was recorded last month [November 2022], that of an 8-year-old girl who had complicated health conditions before being admitted to hospital," Hechmi Louzir, director of the Pasteur Institute, was quoted as saying.

The _Shigella sonnei_ bacteria causes severe diarrhea that is often bloody and can lead to serious complications for children, such as fever, stomach pain, and nausea. The bacterium is transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, according to the health official.

[ProMED has been reporting on an outbreak of shigellosis in Tunisia due to a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain of _S. sonnei_ that began in October 2022 (ProMED posts Shigellosis - Africa: Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, RFI 20221123.8706869; Shigellosis - Africa (02): Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, fatal, RFI 20221125.8706901; and Shigellosis - Africa (03): Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, fatal, RFI 20221127.8706941).

We were told initially based on the report from 19 Nov 2022 that there were more than "200 cases in a number of governorates, most of them among children, but the infection was also transmitted to some elderly people" and that the strain of _Shigella sonnei_ causing this outbreak was multidrug resistant (https://bit.ly/3guT3by). However, we were never told the drugs to which the strain was resistant. The next news report dated 23 Nov 2022 said one death occurred among 69 children. The 3rd news report said that there was a total of 96 cases with ages ranging from 6 to 80 years. The news report above says there have been 160 cases of antibiotic-resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infection in Tunisia.

In 2015, ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of MDR _Shigella sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people, that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016, ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on WGS, that clustered among MSM; 9 further cases were identified in the USA (ProMED post Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf).

More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak in Tunisia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources to clarify case counts, the extent of this outbreak geographically within Tunisia, the genotype of the outbreak strain, if there is one, and the antibiotics to which the outbreak strain is resistant. - Mod.ML
