Poultry farmers are back on alert after a second outbreak of the
deadly Newcastle disease of poultry in almost as many weeks --
this time in western Sydney.
About 30 000 birds were vaccinated after a veterinarian confirmed
the presence of the disease at the weekend. A spokesman for
NSW Agriculture said the speedy detection and vaccination had
ensured no birds needed to be killed.
But he said nobody could guarantee the disease -- which led to the
destruction of 2 million birds during an outbreak last April -- would
not strike again.
The outbreak in western Sydney followed the discovery of a new
strain of the disease at Mangrove Mountain, on the Central Coast,
shortly before Christmas 1999. About 4 million birds were
vaccinated there, and the spokesman said there had been no
reports of deaths due to the disease. In the western Sydney
outbreak, only 2 sheds needed to be vaccinated -- that of the
affected farm and a neighbouring property.The vaccination allows
birds to develop immunity to the disease in about a week.

[This particular strain seems to have a vaccine available and is in
all probability not the same strain as the one earlier in 1999 that
resulted in the destruction of so many birds. However, there is no
definite confirmation of the strain, only that early detection and
vaccination has prevented mass slaughter. - Mod.TG
