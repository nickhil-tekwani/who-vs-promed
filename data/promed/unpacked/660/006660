[In Mongolia's immediate notification on this event (see ProMED-mail posting 20130709.1814699), the serotyping was reportedly pending; within 2 days the national laboratory accomplished the serotyping and -- commendably -- immediately notified the result to the OIE.

The 2 outbreaks are adjacent to each other, in west Mongolia close to China's border and within 25-50 km [15.5-31 mi] from the Russian border and from East Kazakhstan, respectively. These 3 countries have recently reported FMDV serotype A. China's territories are known to be infected since early 2013 by an FMD virus strain of serotype A, topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Sea-97. The same strain has been reported from Russia, initially on China's border. Genotyping results of the Mongolian isolates, if/when available, will be appreciated.

A total of 3 FMD serotype A outbreaks have been reported in May-June 2013 from East Kazakhstan. Genotyping results have been subject to repeated requests (pending). Most probably, the strain is similar to the one identified in China and Russia. - Mod.AS
