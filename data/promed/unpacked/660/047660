CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM / GREAT BRITAIN
Follow-up report
See also: 19 Aug 2000
Follow-up report No. 1
Text of a fax received on 25 Aug 2000 from Dr J.M. Scudamore, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, London:
End of previous report period: 13 Aug 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[32, 127, dated 19 Aug 2000).
End of this report period: 25 Aug 2000.
Epidemiology: as of 25 Aug 2000, no further cases of classical swine fever
(CSF) have been confirmed on any holding in Great Britain. Detailed
investigations into the source of the infection continue.
Diagnostic findings:
Studies at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge suggest that:
a) the virus causing each of the five recorded outbreaks is the same;
b) it belongs to the genotype 2.1;
c) it can be distinguished from the genotype 2.1 virus responsible for the
1997/98 epidemics in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy;
d) it is more related to, but still not identical to, the viruses isolated
from limited CSF outbreaks in Austria and Switzerland in 1993, and in Italy
in 1992 and 1995.
According to the Community Reference Laboratory in Hannover (Germany),
there are no reports of other recent outbreaks of CSF in Europe this year
caused by genotype 2.1 strain viruses. It therefore appears that this
outbreak has been caused by the introduction of a virus not currently
present in Europe.
Control measures during reporting period: on 14 Aug 2000, the European
Commission adopted Decision 2000/515/EEC banning the export of live pigs
and semen from England. Subsequent to a meeting of the Standing Veterinary
Committee in Brussels (Belgium) on 22 Aug 2000, the European Commission
adopted Decision 2000/528/EEC. This came into force on 25 Aug 2000 and
reduced the area subject to the ban to 3 counties (Norfolk, Suffolk and
Essex) of England.
