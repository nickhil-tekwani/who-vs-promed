Public Health is reporting one new case of Legionnaires' disease in the Moncton region as part of an outbreak declared last Friday [6 Aug 2021]. The latest case brings the total number of people ill with the severe form of pneumonia to 7. Bruce Macfarlane, a spokesperson for the Health Department, told CBC News on Thursday [12 Aug 2021] that the latest case was a person who did not live in Moncton.

Macfarlane said officials are testing cooling towers in the western part of the city with preliminary results expected Monday [16 Aug 2021]. Macfarlane said in an email that testing began on Wednesday [11 Aug 2021] and continued Thursday at 11 sites.

On Sunday [8 Aug 2021], Dr. Yves Leger, the regional medical officer of health, told CBC that the 1st case was reported 27 Jul 2021. Of the 6 initial cases, 5 lived in the Moncton region while the other had visited the region within 14 days of developing symptoms of the illness. Leger said all 6 of the initial cases led to those people being hospitalized, some in intensive care. Macfarlane said the latest person is not severely ill and is not in hospital.

The illness is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. It can be found in natural waterways as well as man-made systems such as air conditioners, cooling towers, spas and decorative fountains. The illness can be contracted by inhaling water droplets with the bacteria.

Public Health has said that anyone with fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches should seek medical attention, particularly those over 50 years old and people with chronic lung or kidney conditions, who are immunosuppressed, who have diabetes or are smokers.

Sixteen people became sick with Legionnaires' disease as part of a 2019 outbreak in Moncton traced to cooling towers at Organigram's Moncton production plant in western Moncton. The company directed questions about the latest outbreak to Public Health on Monday [9 Aug 2021].

[Moncton, with a population of 71 889 residents (2016), is the largest city in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the inland center of the Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island); Greater Moncton, encompassing Moncton and the towns of Riverview and Dieppe, has a population of 144 810 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncton). A map showing the location of Moncton can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moncton,+NB,+Canada.

Cooling towers in the western part of Moncton, where the Moncton Industrial Park West is located, are currently the suspected source.

Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_, if available, can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. - Mod.ML
