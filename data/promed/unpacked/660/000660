A case of anthrax in livestock has been discovered in the Bulgarian village of Yasenkovo, in the northeastern Shumen Region.

A 58-year-old man has tested positive for skin anthrax after becoming infected by a sick lamb. According to Shumen Regional Health Inspectorate the alert has been received on Wednesday [11 Sep 2013]. The man has been admitted to the infectious diseases unit of the Shumen hospital. He was sent there by his GP. The infection happened earlier this month [September 2013] after he slaughtered a sick lamb.

The patient is being treated with antibiotics and is in good condition. His family and everyone with whom he had been in touch have been placed on antibiotics as well.

The slaughtered lamb has been sent to the incinerator. The yard has been disinfected and 1500 sheep, horses, cattle, and donkeys in the village have been vaccinated. The village has been put under a 15-day quarantine.

Samples have been sent to a Sofia laboratory for testing. The results are expected within 2 days.

[This outbreak is to the west of Takach and separated by a couple of north-south roads. So we can presume that there is no direct rural communication. Which suggests that we are seeing but the tip of a series of livestock anthrax outbreaks in Shumen. That this farmer was infected from butchering a "sick lamb" may be a journalistic misidentification of the animal, as lambs are uncommonly affected; so it may well have been a wether (yearling castrated male) or a young ewe. Sheep are usually infected from grazing and secondary cases from licking the blood extravasated from anthrax carcasses -- the salty content is attractive.

There were 2 other reports on this outbreak (in Bulgarian) but both essentially identical with the posting above at http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=2299009 and http://health.actualno.com/Myj-ot-shumensko-selo-priet-v-bolnica-s-antraks--news_438397.html
