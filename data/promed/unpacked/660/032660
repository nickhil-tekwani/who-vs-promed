An outbreak of anthrax in the Kasane area is threatening to reduce the
buffalo population in Chobe National Park. According to Department of
Wildlife and National Parks officials, 19 carcasses have been found since 8
Sep 2004, and tests indicate that the animals died from the disease.
Kasane-based district wildlife coordinator Molothanyi Othomile said more
animals were likely to die and that they had started burying the carcasses
so scavengers such as vultures did not feed on the meat. However, he said
there was no sign that predators like lion, jackal and hyena were
interested in the carcasses. Othomile appealed to the public to stay away
from the carcasses and report any sightings of dead animals in and outside
Chobe National Park.
This is the 1st outbreak to hit the park. [Anthrax, elephant - Botswana
(Chobe-NP) 20000307.0313 listed below describes an outbreak there in 1998,
referred to (presumably incorrectly) in Anthrax, wildlife - Botswana (Chobe
Natl. Park) 20040920.2600 as having occurred in 1996. - Mod.SH]

Meanwhile, a senior Agricultural Resources Board officer, Lekitane Mhaladi,
said that the veld fire, which has destroyed vast areas of land in the
Kasane Forest Reserve, had displaced many wild animals. Mhaladi said that
large numbers of wildlife in the Chobe District would now travel long
distances to the river to drink, without any thing to feed on.
Since the outbreak, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) the police, wildlife
officials and the general public have been battling the blaze.

Botswana anthrax outbreak spreads
---------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak that has killed close to 200 buffaloes, elephants, and
a hippo in Botswana has spread to Namibia, where it is posing a serious
threat to livestock, officials said on Thursday.
Game rangers have found the carcasses of 180 buffaloes, 10 elephants, and a
hippo at Chobe National Park in northern Botswana since the outbreak on 8
Sep 2004. The outbreak has forced authorities to close about half of the
park, which is a major tourist attraction and is home to the Chobe river on
the border between Namibia and Botswana. "We have received reports that the
disease has crossed into Namibia. We are trying to establish how," said
acting wildlife district coordinator Obert Gwapela.
The permanent secretary in the Namibian Ministry of Environment and
Tourism, Malan Lindeque, said 5 elephants and 4 buffaloes have died but
added that officials suspect the animals contracted the disease in Botswana
and died shortly after crossing the border to Namibia.
Game parks in the Caprivi region in Namibia are not in danger for now,
Lindeque said, but expressed concern about livestock, which can contract
the disease if they come into contact with the carcasses of the dead
animals. "Our concern now is the livestock of the rural people. Our
officials of veterinary services are busy vaccinating the livestock and are
burning all carcasses found to prevent the spread of anthrax in Namibia."
Botswana tourism officials have been inundated with cancellations and fear
major financial losses in a country where tourism brings in about 104
million [Pula? If so, about USD 21.9 million] in revenue.
Anthrax has broken out before in the Chobe National Park. The most recent
previous outbreak, in 1996, was attributed to buffaloes that had strayed
into the park from Namibia. Wildlife authorities are trying to nail down
the origin of the acute infectious bacterial disease, which mainly affects
wild and domestic animals but can also pose a risk to humans exposed to the
infected animals or their tissue.

[A number of points arise.
It is hard to say from this distance what part the bush fires in the park
are playing. They will have direct effects through stress and dehydration
(trekking to the remaining water holes), and by increasing the animal
concentrations at these points, where the water can become contaminated by
dead animals and vultures washing themselves; and indirect effects through
the high temperatures decreasing the innate resistance of the various
affected species.
That scavengers have not been seen to be feeding on fallen animals is
merely a function of food availability -- they are gorged. In addition,
vultures, if they are like our buzzards, once they feel full they become
picky about what they will eat. This varies by individual; some will then
look for snakes, others for other choice species, others will just snooze
or glide enjoying the air and local activity.
If possible, carcasses should be burnt. But this can present serious
problems when there is a lack of firewood and staff. Hippos and elephants
are fuel-hungry species. If all else fails, the best option is to stop
scavengers opening up carcasses for the first 3 or 4 days so that the
carcass can ferment and the pH drops to acid levels, thereby killing the
vegetative cells. Without oxygen they cannot sporulate. In this way the
environmental contamination is minimal, even if the carcass is later opened
and the bones fed on and dragged around. - Mod.MHJ]
