Delaware: Eastern equine encephalitis virus detected in sentinel chicken
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A state disease monitoring network has detected a form of mosquito-borne
encephalitis that could threaten people and horses in the Delaware City
area, state officials reported. Discovery of eastern equine encephalitis
virus (EEEV) so far north was described as "unusual", because past reports
have been confined to more southern areas. The disease surfaced in 2003 in
tests on a chicken kept as part of a live animal "sentinel" system that
screens for diseases statewide. [Chickens become infected with EEEV when
bitten by infected mosquitoes, but usually show no symptoms. Blood samples
taken at intervals are tested for the presence of EEEV or specific
antibodies. - Mod.JW]
People infected with EEEV usually suffer only mild flu-like symptoms. It
can lead to more severe problems, however, including sudden onset of high
fever, severe headache, stiff neck, mental confusion, and muscle weakness.
Individuals experiencing symptoms should see their physician immediately,
the Division of Public Health warned. Residents should take steps to
avoid mosquito bites, including use of mosquito repellents and long-sleeved
shirts and trousers.
Agriculture department officials advised horse owners to contact their
veterinarian if they suspect the disease. Symptoms in horses include
listlessness, muscle spasms in the head and neck, tremors or staggering,
and hind-limb weakness. [Since the vaccine needs 2 weeks to take effect,
waiting until one of your horses is sick is probably leaving it too late to
protect the rest. - Mod.JW]

[The appearance of eastern equine encephalitis virus in a sentinel animal as
far north as the state of Delaware is unusual and a timely warning to horse
owners of the need to consider protective vaccination for their animals.
Infection of humans is comparatively rare, but the outcome may be severe and
a much greater hazard than exposure to West Nile virus infection. CDC
statistics indicate that there are on average only 5 human cases of eastern
equine encephalitis virus infection reported each year, but infection kills
about one in 3 persons, and survivors may suffer brain damage. Fatality rates
are highest in the elderly and lowest in young adults. Among survivors,
sequelae are most frequent in young children. - Mod.CP]
