Belarus has restricted the import of cattle from Lithuania because of the bluetongue disease, BelTA learnt from the veterinary and food surveillance department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

The department reported that the State Food and Veterinary Service (SFVS) of Lithuania suspended the issuance of veterinary certificates for cattle export because bluetongue antibodies were detected in Lithuanian cattle.

"In order to prevent the penetration of the virus to Belarus, the country has imposed temporary restrictions on the import of cattle, wild animals, zoo, and circus animals susceptible to bluetongue, camels and other animals of the camel family (lamas, alpacas, vicunas), semen of bulls, rams, and goats, as well as embryos of cattle upon the permits issued earlier. The restriction will be in place until the epizootic situation has been clarified in Lithuania," the department informed.

Belarus has temporarily suspended the issuance of permits for the import of the above-mentioned products from Lithuania.

The bluetongue virus was first detected in South Africa in 1876. The virus is of no hazard to human beings, but can cause deadly diseases in ruminant animals.

[Following the recently published Russian suspicions on the origin of BTV-14 identified there since late 2011, information on the BTV-14 situation in Lithuania and other Baltic countries has been requested in ProMED's postings (20121123.1422112 and 20121127.1426885). Similarly, information on the current situation in the Baltic countries of another _Culicoides_-borne virus, Schmallenberg (SBV), has been requested (commentary in ProMED posting 20121128.1428668).

Lithuania exports live cattle to various countries. According to the most recent available information (FAOSTAT/FAO statistical database), the main customers during 2010 were (in parentheses, number of cattle exported from Lithuania to each country) Netherlands (43 970), Poland (29 127), Israel (24 670), Belgium (12 530), and Spain (10 926). - Mod.AS
