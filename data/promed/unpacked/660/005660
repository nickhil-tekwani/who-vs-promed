WHO will take vaccine gamble with swine flu
-------------------------------------------
When World Health Organization [WHO] officials ask vaccine
manufacturers to start producing vaccine to fight swine flu in a few
weeks, they will be taking a calculated risk. Flu vaccine companies
can only make one vaccine at a time: either seasonal flu vaccine or
pandemic vaccine. Production takes months and it is impossible to
switch halfway through if health officials make a mistake. While some
countries like the United States may be better prepared than others
American officials say production for next year's vaccine batch is so
advanced they're nearly finished, whereas the situation for many
other countries is unknown.

About 70 percent of the world's flu vaccines are made in Europe, and
the WHO is trying to figure out how many doses of seasonal flu
vaccine remain worldwide before asking vaccine manufacturers to start
pumping out pandemic vaccine instead. "It's a big decision...We've
never done this before," said Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the
WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research. Kieny said the decision would
be like guessing which vaccine the world will need most, but that the
WHO would try to hedge its bets by tallying existing seasonal flu
vaccine stocks. "We are gambling whether or not we will have enough
seasonal vaccine, but it will not be an 'either-or' situation," she
said.

Vaccine makers can make limited amounts of both seasonal flu vaccine
and pandemic vaccine though not at the same time but they cannot make
massive quantities of both because that exceeds capacity. The
impending decision to make pandemic vaccine will also complicate
matters for countries in the southern hemisphere, where the flu
season is just starting. The WHO usually makes recommendations about
which seasonal flu strains should go into next year's southern
hemisphere flu vaccine in September. But if vaccine manufacturers are
already making pandemic vaccine in the fall, that will mean fewer
doses of flu vaccine for people in the southern hemisphere.

Regular flu kills between 250 000 to 500 000 people worldwide every
year. So far, swine flu appears relatively mild, except in Mexico.
Until experts know how contagious and deadly the virus is, they won't
know how many people actually need to be vaccinated. If it remains
mild, it is possible many people won't need a shot. But if swine flu
evolves into a more deadly strain, more shots may be needed to
protect wider swathes of the population. Another possible
complication is that the pandemic vaccine will be made using the
strain available now; whether that will work if the virus mutates
isn't certain. At the moment, the WHO has a bit of breathing space.
The key component for the pandemic vaccine, the "seed stock" from the
swine flu virus, will not be available for a few weeks. The WHO has
already put major vaccine makers on alert they may be asked to switch
to making pandemic vaccine soon. According to Chris Viehbacher, chief
executive of Sanofi-Aventis, Europe's biggest vaccine maker, his
scientists are "working around the clock" on preparations for making
a swine flu vaccine for when the WHO comes calling.

But they too are waiting for more information. "It is premature to
forecast how many doses of swine flu vaccine we could produce,"
Viehbacher said, noting the company needs to see how much antigen,
the active ingredient in a vaccine, is required for each shot. If all
goes well, the 1st doses should be available several months after
production begins.

In the U.S., the government hasn't yet decided what to order. "It
would all depend on how the outbreaks and the emergency unfolds,"
said Dr. Ruben Donis of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, who is heading the U.S. vaccine work. Vaccine makers have
a few options when it comes to making pandemic vaccine. They could
add the pandemic strain to the regular vaccine, but adding that extra
strain reduces the number of shots you can make. Manufacturers might
also use adjuvants, components used to stretch a vaccine's active
ingredient.

Recent work on H5N1 vaccines, the bird flu strain many thought would
ignite the next pandemic, may also help. John Treanor, a vaccines
expert at the University of Rochester said that adjuvants developed
during H5N1 research may come in handy now. He said public health
officials were indeed facing a vaccine dilemma. "There is only a
certain amount of capacity for vaccine manufacturing," he said. "One
has to make some well-reasoned choices, sometimes based on incomplete
information."

[A question which has still to be addressed in this debate is the
extent to which vaccination with seasonal influenza virus vaccine
will provide some degree of immunity or amelioration of symptoms in
vaccinees. The symptoms of the illness in those experiencing
infection with the novel H5N1 strain with few infections have been
mild (the Mexican population apart). It would be interesting to know
to what extent this relates to the seasonal influenza virus history
of patients. - Mod.CP]

[2] Surveillance history

Questions Linger Over the Value of a Global Illness Surveillance System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Scott Dowell was sorting through e-mail messages on 20 Apr 2009
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta
when he decided to cruise through that day's outbreak reports from
the agency's Global Disease Detection center.

The agency receives scores of such reports every day, and a team of
analysts sorts through them looking for patterns. But Dr. Dowell, the
director of the CDC's division of global disease detection and
emergency response, said he liked to puzzle over them himself on
occasion. And that day, reports from Mexico caught his attention.
Mexican authorities had noticed a worrisome increase in severe
pneumonia among young adults. He recalled that just 3 days earlier a
colleague had told him about 2 children in California who had
contracted a unique form of swine flu. The odd thing was that these
children did not live on a farm. In fact, they had had no known
contact with pigs.

Now these Mexican pneumonia cases. Dr. Dowell sent an e-mail message
to a colleague. "Hard to see from these 3 reports whether this is
above expected," he wrote, according to an e-mail message provided to
The New York Times. "Well worth watching however, in view of the new
swine influenza virus in San Diego and the connection with Mexico."
Dr. Dowell's intuition would soon pay off when swabs from Mexican flu
patients were found to have a flu strain identical to those of the 2
Californians, a finding that would confirm the possibility of the 1st
global flu pandemic in more than 40 years.

The discovery resulted from an expensive and evolving illness
surveillance system constructed over the past decade. Did the system
work? Was it sensitive enough to catch a serious outbreak quickly and
save lives? Or was it too sensitive, alerting the world to a virus no
more dangerous than the usual seasonal flu bugs? The answers cannot
be known for days, if not weeks.

One of the 1st hints that Mexico had a problem came to the World
Health Organization (WHO) on 10 Apr 2009 in an unofficial report. The
Geneva-based organization has an extensive intelligence network of
hundreds of its own offices and thousands of experts. It also uses a
sophisticated media and Internet scanning group to uncover reports of
strange or unreported illnesses that governments miss. The 10 Apr
2009 report was from its media group, which had found articles
reporting a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses in La Gloria,
Mexico, a pork-producing town in the state of Veracruz.

"Most of the signals we pick up don't turn out to be anything," said
Dr. Michael Ryan, director of the WHO's Global Alert Response. "We
can't call up countries 10 times a day and ask what's going on." Dr.
Ryan's team decided that this report was serious enough to ask
Mexican authorities about. "It was unusual because it was the end of
the flu season," he said. On 12 Apr 2009, Mexican authorities
responded by saying that they had investigated the outbreak and
determined that it had ended on 3 Apr 2009, satisfying Dr. Ryan's
team, Dr. Ryan said. That same day, Mexican authorities alerted the
CDC to unexplained cases of severe respiratory illness. On 17 Apr
2009, the multiple surveillance systems at the WHO uncovered a report
of an unusual case of a pneumonia death in Mexico that was reported
to be similar to those in China during an outbreak of SARS (severe
acute respiratory syndrome). "Again, we requested verification from
Mexican authorities," Dr. Ryan said. A few hours later, Mexican
authorities responded that lab tests had failed to find any
connection to a SARS-like virus or even a flu virus. "At that point,
we were reassured," Dr. Ryan said.

On 22 Apr 2009, Mexican authorities formally alerted the WHO about a
worrisome increase in pneumonia cases among young adults, a report
Mexico had sent to the CDC 2 days earlier. On 23 Apr 2009, a CDC test
confirmed that the Mexican cases were identical to those in
California, and officials realized they had a potential pandemic.
Mexico's chief government epidemiologist, Dr. Miguel Angel Lezana,
said this week that his center alerted the Pan American Health
Organization, a regional arm of the WHO, on April 16 about an
unusually late rash of flu and pneumonia cases in Mexico. Officials
at the regional group said they received a notification on 18 Apr
2009 that Mexico had declared the alert. Then, 2 days later, on a
teleconference call, the CDC, the Pan American Health Organization,
and Mexican and Canadian health authorities discussed what measures
of cooperation they could take.

The next day, Mexico updated its information, reporting that it had
found "atypical behavior of influenza in different cities." By 22 Apr
2009, health authorities from the 3 countries were back at another
teleconference call to assess the risk. Although there have been
questions about whether information moved back and forth quickly
enough across the different agencies, Dr. Lezana said that "there was
an intense and fluid exchange between ourselves and our colleagues."
Dr. Ryan praised the swift responses from Mexican authorities to
queries from the WHO, and he said a few days would hardly have
mattered to the global response to the outbreak. Dr. Dowell agreed.
Genetic testing suggests that the original swine flu virus, known as
influenza A(H1N1), probably jumped from pigs to humans sometime
between late November 2008 and January 2009, and that the virus began
infecting large numbers of people sometime in mid-March 2009. [The
jump from swine to humans is conjecture and is not supported so far
by evidence. - Mod.CP]

If officials could have somehow learned of the initial outbreak in
mid-March and blitzed the La Gloria region with antiviral drugs like
Tamiflu, the outbreak might have been contained, Dr. Dowell said. But
once it began popping up in various regions of Mexico, containment
became impossible and mitigation measures like vaccine production,
which needs weeks and months, not days, became the next response.
"I'm struggling to understand [how] anyone who thinks the public
health response would have been different if this was reported
globally on 20 or 22 Apr 2009 instead of the 23rd," Dr. Ryan said.

There is little evidence that the swine flu outbreak is any more
dangerous than routine infections from the usual strains of seasonal
flu viruses. So whether the world's improved surveillance system
provided a benefit or simply scared millions of people needlessly is
still uncertain. Dr. Dowell said he had no doubts that early warnings
of even relatively mild, new flu strains are important. "Seasonal flu
viruses cause 36 000 deaths every year, and if this new pathogen
causes that much disease and death, that's significant," Dr. Dowell
said. "If we have an opportunity to slow the spread, buy ourselves
time and reduce the number of people who get infected, that's
definitely worth doing."

[Proper evaluation of this outbreak will depend on elucidation of the
evolution of the complex genome of this virus and the identity of its
swine and non-swine hosts prior to its appearance in humans Mexico.
There may not be a quick answer. - Mod.CP]

[3] H1N1 and H5N1 range overlap
Date: Sat 2 May 2009
From: Michael Steinle

H5N1 and H5N1
-------------
Perhaps I have just missed it, but I am surprised that no one has
talked about the fact that H1N1 and H5N1 are now present
simultaneously in at least 2 regions -- Egypt and Southeast Asia.
H1N1 is seemingly very transmissible but not very lethal
(comparatively) and H5N1 is not readily transmissible but relatively
virulent. The possibility of cross-infection and a resulting very
transmissible and virulent strain seems more plausible now. Is there
any research on this issue?

[Since 2003 avian A (H5N1) influenza virus has had opportunity to
interact with human strains of seasonal (H1N1 and H3N2) influenza
virus, but that so far this is not known to have occurred. It may be
that the overlap of the ranges of the novel H1N1 strain and H5N1
avian influenza virus has increased the probability of interaction
and evolution of a human transmissible H5N1 strain. However it is not
apparent yet that the novel H1N1 is more transmissible than the
current seasonal influenza viruses, nor that its spread will be
sustained during the northern hemisphere summer. - Mod.CP]
