This summer's 1st known case of Potomac horse fever in Maryland was confirmed at the Star Community Equestrian Center in Hagerstown on 8 Jul 2015, where one horse is currently recovering, according to officials.

Ginny Reed, director of the Star Community Equestrian Center -- a residential day program and equestrian program for abled and disabled adults and children -- said the female horse is under the care of a veterinarian and will recover.

"She's doing fine," Reed said. "We just had the one horse come down with it. It's not contiguous to humans or horses. It's an illness like any other horse illness. It's really not a big deal. We've had it before and so have many other stables."

But according to Dr. Shannon Oliver, the veterinarian treating the horse, Potomac horse fever -- caused by horses ingesting infected aquatic snails, dragon flies and other insects that thrive near water -- can be fatal.

"Horses can die (from the disease), especially if they are not vaccinated," Oliver said. "The (Star Community Equestrian Center) horse was vaccinated, but it's not 100 percent."

The vaccine helps reduce the signs, which can include fever, depression, diarrhea and lethargy.

Oliver, who works at the Century Equine veterinary clinic, said she treated the horse with antibiotics orally and intravenously. The horse also received oral medication to treat the diarrhea and fever, and intravenous fluids. "She seems to be coming along nicely," she said.

Oliver said she has not heard of any other cases of the disease in Maryland or Pennsylvania.

This summer's unusually wet weather may be a contributing factor to contracting the disease.

"It doesn't necessarily have to be wet weather, but potentially with more rain, there are more insects," Oliver said.

In July of 2013, the Maryland Department of Agriculture issued a warning to horse owners concerning several cases of Potomac horse fever that were confirmed in the area due to the unusually wet weather, officials said.

"This is typical of what we see in wet summers, and equine vets in the region are very familiar with the disease," former state veterinarian Dr. Guy Hohenhaus said at the time. "They are very capable and well positioned to provide good care for their clients' horses."

Vanessa Orlando, the public information officer with the Maryland Department of Agriculture, said the agency is not aware of any Potomac horse fever cases breaking out this summer. She was also unaware of the case at the Star Community Equestrian Center, since it was not reported.

Veterinarians typically report confirmed cases to the agency, but not all the time. Oliver said she had yet to report the horse at the equestrian center.

Although there is no absolute way to prevent exposure to the Potomac horse fever, The Equiery, a monthly publication for horse owners in Maryland, said there are precautions that can be taken, including:

- Vaccinate horses.
- Reduce a horse's exposure to insects that live near water. Clean water buckets and troughs frequently and remove any insects.
- Keep stable lights off at night to discourage insects from being attracted to the barn, and keep troughs or buckets away from light sources to lower the risk of flies falling into them.
- Restrict horses from accessing flowing streams or ponds, as well as standing water or low-lying areas in pastures to avoid snails.

"You can't get rid of it, and you can't control it," Reed said. "Not at all. It's like Lyme disease with ticks."

[If the disease is not a reportable disease, meaning it must be reported, then it is understandable that some vets do not report the disease to their state office.

This disease has been referred to in the past as equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, or equine ehrlichial colitis. It is best known for its gastrointestinal signs such as enteritis and diarrhea. This disease is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an intracellular organism which is a member of the Erlichiaea family.

According to the isolates obtained from clinical cases, there is diversity in the organism, and each isolate has a different pattern of antigenic proteins. Therefore, Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by more than one strain of _N. risticii_.

_N. risticii_, _N. sennetsu_, SF agent, and _N. helminthoeca_ are antigenically cross-reactive, and inoculation with _N. sennetsu_ protects horses from Potomac horse fever (15,21).

Current vaccines are only made using one strain, which likely explains its lack of efficacy in some cases.

Cases of PHF have a seasonal presentation with the highest number of cases with clinical signs in July, August, and September.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the route of infection and have revealed that a parasite, living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects, is a reservoir for _N. risticii_. The parasites and _N. risticii_ have been found in adult and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies. Therefore, the seasonality of PHF is likely related to the seasonality of the flying insect.

But how does an equid become infected? These types of insects do not feed on warm blooded mammals, so it is likely that an equid may ingest an aquatic insect or snail while grazing, or consume a flying insect that has landed in drinking water. It has also been suggested that the insects might be attracted to the barn area by outdoor lights during the night.

The typical clinical signs observed in horses with PHF include: fever, anorexia, colic, depression, ileus (nonmotile gastrointestinal tract -- the horse does not defecate) or diarrhea, and laminitis [inflammation of the hoof - Mod.SH].

Clinical signs and severity vary, but common to all cases of PHF is the manifestation of colitis. The onset of colitis can result in depression and anorexia and may or may not be accompanied by a fever and/or diarrhea. However, some horses with PHF can pass normal-looking feces without showing any signs of colitis.

The 1st prominent sign of PHF often observed by owners is a decrease in feed intake. In fact, some horses may not initially show any other clinical signs except not eating. Usually, this anorexia is followed by dehydration and toxemia characterized by very bright looking mucous and a bright red/purple line on the mucosal surface above the teeth (toxic line).

Many equids, upon becoming infected with PHF, will develop a fever with an initial rise in temperature of about 103-106 degrees F [39-41 degrees C], but the presence of this fever may go unnoticed as this initial fever resolves within hours. However, it is often followed by 3-7 days of persistent fever, along with other clinical signs.

Laminitis often develops in cases of severe endotoxemia, but in some occasions it can be the only clinical sign. Laminitis in most cases results in euthanasia of the equid within days of the onset.

_N. risticii_ can cause abortions, and it is related to placentitis and retained placenta in most cases. The aborted fetus will show signs of the infection as well.

The drug of choice to treat _N. risticii_ infection in equids is oxytetracycline. The organism is inside the cells and is, therefore, difficult to treat. Oxytetracycline is able to interfere with the control mechanisms of _N. risticii_ and allows the macrophage to eliminate the organism. Oxyetracycline should be administered by a licensed veterinarian once a day for 3 to 5 days, and it is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease.

Several vaccines are commercially available in the United States, but their efficacy is questionable. Research has shown that once an equid develops an infection with _N. risticii_, the equid can develop an immunity to that particular strain for as long as 20 months.

In contrast, vaccination has been associated with a poor immune response. Research has shown that only 50 per cent of the vaccines are protective at 6 months after vaccination, and protection decreases to 33 per cent after 9 months. Vaccination may decrease clinical signs, but it will not prevent infection and illness.
