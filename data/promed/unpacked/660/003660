FERAL CAT CONTROL (7)
=====================

Has anyone done any population modeling of feral cats? What percentage of
the population would have to be killed to decrease the cat population by 80%?
How long would the control measures need to go on? For ever? If there is a
reproduction control program in place, what proportion of the females would
need to be sterilized to reduce the population? what about males? Which
method is most effective in regards to population reduction -- killing or
neutering?
The point is -- we need to subject this debate to the same rigorous science
investigation as we do with any animal control project. Cats, in particular,
engender a lot of strong feelings in the human population, so we should be
sure that we are discussing facts and not emotions.
Just a thought...

Also regarding Predation and Neutering of Cats.
It is an established fact in Veterinary Medicine that neutering a Tom cat
will decrease its wandering range, as it no longer will be searching for in
heat females to breed. (I do not know if neutering a female cat will keep it
closer to home too.) This is one of the reasons we encourage neutering Toms
as these cats stay closer to home and get in less intercat interactions
(fights, etc.)
The interesting question is whether this reduces predation on wild life as
the cats have less range for contact. Or perhaps it increases predation, as
these cats have less to preoccupy them, so the normal hunting behavior
consumes more of these (bored?) cats time.

[- In my experience, neutering toms, especially if done early, significantly
reduces their chances of traumatic encounters with motor vehicles ... a
major cause of premature deaths. Hunting ability is very individual. Feral
cats are much more likely to have been taught to hunt by their mothers and
will do so efficiently. Without this early training, the domestic cat is
usually an incompetant hunter. But I have had two neutered queens that took
up hunting at around 5 years old and became essentially 100%, skillful hunters.
