A survey of viruses affecting French bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) in
Iran includes a 1st report of southern bean mosaic virus and bean pod
mottle virus.

Box 19395-1454, Tehran, Iran. Plant Dis. 89:1012, 2005; published
on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1012B. Accepted for publication 7 Jun
2005.
A survey was conducted from 2003 to 2004 to identify viruses
infecting common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.) in different growing
areas of East Azarbaejan Province of Iran. A total of 300 French bean
samples with symptoms of viral infection (mosaic, vein clearing, leaf
rolling, yellowing, and leaf distortion) were collected.
The samples were tested for 8 viruses using the tissue-blot
immunoassay procedures (TBIA) (2) and double-antibody sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). ELISA
tests for Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus
(BYMV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Bean common mosaic necrosis
virus (BCMNV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean leaf roll virus
(BLRV), and Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV) were used. In addition,
antiserum was provided by S. A. Ghabrial (University of Kentucky,
Lexington) to test for Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV).
Serological tests showed that SBMV and BPMV were present in 12
percent (35 samples) and 5 percent (15 samples) of samples,
respectively. BCMV, BCMNV, BYMV, BLRV, CMV, and AMV were more common
and were detected in 155, 105, 80, 46, 30, and 10 samples of 300
samples, respectively. These 6 viruses were previously reported in
other pulses and in French bean in Iran (1).
The presence of SBMV and BPMV were verified in samples by
transmission to French bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), cowpea (_Vigna
unguiculata_), and soybean (_Glycine max_) indicator test plants
(3,4). Inoculation with extracts from SBMV-positive plants produced
systemic mottle and mosaic symptoms in soybean (cv. Gorgan-3) and
French bean (cvs. Dubbele Witte and Cheete). In cowpea (cv. Mashad)
and French bean (cv. Pinto), inoculation produced necrotic local
lesions. Inoculation with extracts from BPMV-positive plants produced
severe mosaic, leaf distortion, and puckering in soybean (cv.
Gorgan-3) and French bean (cv. Tendergreen). No symptoms were
observed in cowpea (cv. Mashad). Cvs. Pinto and Bountiful bean
reacted with necrotic local lesions.
All indicator test plants tested positive for the presence of SBMV or
BPMV as expected using DAS-ELISA.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BPMV and SBMV naturally
infecting French bean in Iran. These viruses can cause a serious
problem to other leguminous crops grown in Iran.

[BPMV was 1st reported in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ cv. Tendergreen; from
Charleston, USA; by Zaumeyer and Thomas in 1948. It causes
significant crop losses in soybean. It is spread primarily by the
bean leaf beetle _Cerotoma trifurcata_ (bean leaf beetle), _Colaspis
brunnea_ (grape colaspis), _Diabrotica balteata_, and southern corn
root worm (_D. undecimpunctata_). BPMV is stable, easily transmitted
mechanically and occurs at relatively high levels in seed coats from
seeds of infected soybean. Yields from infected plants are lowered by
10-40 percent, grain quality is reduced both in oil and protein, seed
germination is lower, and delayed maturation results in a condition
known as "green stem." It can also be transmitted by mechanical
inoculation, by grafting, but is not transmitted by seed or by
pollen. BPMV spreads in the North American region.
The fact that BPMV has been reported in Iran is interesting,
suggesting that infected seed may have been used for planting.
SBMV was 1st reported in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ from samples collected
in Louisiana and California, USA by Zaumeyer and Harter in 1943.
There are several strains (cowpea strain (strain C), Ghana strain
(strain G), severe bean mosaic strain or Mexican strain (strain M)
and the type strain (strain B). Symptoms persist in _P. vulgaris_,
_Vigna unguiculata_, _V. mungo_ and _Glycine max_. Symptoms include
mosaic and/or mottle, and stunting (especially in _Vigna
unguiculata_). SBMV is transmitted by beetles (_Ceratoma trifurcata_
and _Epilachna variestis_). It can also be transmitted by mechanical
inoculation, by grafting, seed (3-7 percent in _V. unguiculata_ cv.
Early Wilt Resistant Ramshorn), by pollen to the seed and transmitted
by pollen to the pollinated plant. It has been reported from the
African region, the North American region, the South and Central
American region and France. SBMV probably entered Iran via infected
seed; BPMV undoubtedly entered Iran in virus-infected seed.
The strategy for disease management involves managing the bean leaf
beetle. Growers should consider a later planting of soybean,
especially if BPMV was a yield limiting factor in 2004. Late planting
can result in an increased risk of soybean aphid activity at a
sensitive growth stage. Plant soybean varieties with the ability to
yield in the presence of BPMV. Use good quality seed that is not
mottled, and consider the field history of this problem before making
decisions as to whether to spray for the bean leaf beetle. Sprays
must be carefully timed to be effective.
Resistance to SBMV is not yet available, but partial resistance to
BPMV exists in soybean varieties. Partial resistance is expressed as
acceptable yield, low seed mottling and a low incidence of green stem
in the presence of BPMV. Soybean varieties differ in yield and
incidence of mottled soybean seed in the presence of BPMV. Early
soybean planting can coincide with high populations of over-wintered
bean leaf beetle adults moving into soybeans to feed and lay eggs.
This timing increases the chance of BPMV transmission to soybeans.
