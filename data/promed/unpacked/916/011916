Suspected Murray Valley encephalitis case in NT
-------------------------------
The Northern Territory Health Department says it has been alerted to
the 1st possible case of the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease
Murray Valley encephalitis for this year [2010]. The department says
the affected person recently travelled around the Territory,
including Alice Springs and Top End areas. It will not give any more
details about the suspected case until it finishes testing the
patient.

There were cases of Murray Valley encephalitis, or MVE, in the
Territory last year [2009] and both were fatal.

The department says MVE is the most dangerous mosquito-borne disease
in the Northern Territory. It is warning people to take precautions
in areas where there are mosquitoes.

The symptoms of MVE include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness,
and seizures, especially in young children. Despite treatment, 25 per
cent of people die from the infection and at least 25 per cent will
have residual neurological effects.

Some MVE activity has recently been found in sentinel chickens in
Tennant Creek, Jabiru, and Nathan River.
