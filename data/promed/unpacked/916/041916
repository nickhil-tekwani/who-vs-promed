In Germany in the summer and autumn of 2016, several cases of illness in children were observed that were accompanied by acute flaccid paralysis. For the entire year 2016, 16 of such polio-like cases were registered with the Robert Koch-Institute. In an article in the current issue of Deutsches Arzteblatt International (Dtsch Arztebl Int 2017; 114 (33-34): 551-557), Johannes Hubner et al. describe this disease on the basis of 2 case reports, in which the neurological symptoms ranged from flaccid paralysis of the arm to tetraplegia requiring intubation and ventilation.

In the children under study, the main characteristic was damage to the anterior horn of the spinal cord as confirmed on MRI or lesions as a sign of motor neuron injury as confirmed electrophysiologically. A pathogen could almost never be detected in cerebrospinal fluid, but epidemiological associations and confirmation of viruses from stool specimens or respiratory secretions pointed at enteroviruses as the likely pathogen. The prognosis of such polio-like disease with flaccid paralysis of differing severity cannot be estimated at the beginning--it ranges from hardly detectable impairment of the arm movement to care dependency in permanent severe symptoms. Targeted therapeutic measures are not available. No sufficient evidence currently exists for the effectiveness of corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, or antiviral medications.

The authors express concern that since 2012, several cases of severe flaccid paralysis have been observed in several countries, which closely resemble the symptoms of poliomyelitis, but which are caused by different pathogens that are often not identifiable. The term "acute flaccid paralysis with anterior myelitis" has been adopted, in order to distinguish the symptoms from those of classic poliomyelitis.

Conclusions from Hubner et al.:
"Polio-like courses of acute encephalitis with flaccid paralysis in children have been described in many European countries and in the US in recent years. Epidemiological associations indicate that these conditions are caused by enteroviruses, even though CSF testing for pathogens tends to return negative results in almost all cases. More frequently, it is possible to detect pathogens in stool or respiratory secretions, but this does not prove a pathogenetic relationship. Other causes (bacterial or viral infections) and Guillain-Barre syndrome must be ruled out. The characteristic MRI pattern plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of the condition.

"Although AFP with anterior myelitis or grey matter involvement (i.e., evidence of inflammation of the spinal cord involving the grey matter including anterior horn cell bodies) comprises a subset of patients with AFP, these cases can be challenging to distinguish at initial presentation before clinical, imaging, and laboratory study results are available. Thus, specimen collection to definitively rule out poliovirus infection from possible differential diagnoses should be considered among all patients with AFP of unknown etiology or a suspected viral etiology. This is particularly important for persons who are unimmunized and have a history of travel to countries with endemic polio or countries that use OPV for routine immunization.

"Physicians treating patients with AFP of unknown etiology should work with their local and state health departments to rule out poliomyelitis early during the course of disease. To ensure adequate specimens for poliovirus testing, specimens should be collected according to CDC and WHO guidelines.

"Epidemiologic and laboratory investigation did not identify poliovirus infection as a possible cause for the observed cases. No common etiology was identified to explain the reported cases, although EV-D68 was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens of 2 patients. EV infection, including poliovirus infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of AFP with anterior myelitis and testing performed per CDC guidelines.

"Common features among the clinical presentations of patients included an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal prodrome less than 10 days before AFP onset (83 percent), CSF pleocytosis (83 percent), and absence of sensory deficits (78 percent) ". -more...
