A 5th Louisville resident has died from hepatitis A, according to the Louisville health department. The death happened "in the last 5 days or so," said Dave Langdon, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. The department did not release the name or age of the person who died.

Langdon said the number of hepatitis A cases per day has declined to about one, down from 4.1 in April 2018. "It obviously could go up before the end of the month," he said. A hepatitis A outbreak was declared in Louisville in November 2017. As of 14 Aug 2018, there were 580 cases of the disease, with 5 related deaths.

Statewide, there have been 8 deaths and more than 700 hospitalizations associated with the illness as of 4 Aug 2018, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health. The city's health department said in a news release that it will continue to work to control an outbreak of acute hepatitis A, which it said has been centered around the city's homeless population and drug users but others have been affected as well.

[The total number of cases of acute hepatitis A infections in Kentucky related to this epidemic as of 4 Aug 2018 was 1341 with new statistics likely available soon. This number has continued to rise significantly, with 50 or more newly reported cases per week. The state could soon have more cases than the 2nd and 3rd highest states combined. - Mod.LL]

Health officials in Clermont County said they are experiencing an increase in cases of hepatitis A. The Ohio Department of Health declared a statewide outbreak of the illness in June 2018. To date [14 Aug 2018], there have been 225 cases reported in Ohio.

Hepatitis A is a virus that affects the liver. It can be spread from person to person or by eating or drinking food that is contaminated with the virus. Food can become contaminated with the virus when a person does not wash their hands after using the bathroom and then prepares or touches food. Spread of the illness in the current outbreak is primarily occurring from person to person in high-risk groups, officials said.

People at higher risk for getting sick from hepatitis A during this outbreak include people who have direct contact with someone infected with the virus, men who have sex with men, people who use street drugs (regardless of whether they are injected), people who are incarcerated, people experiencing homelessness, and people who have traveled to areas outside of the US currently experiencing outbreaks.

Symptoms of hepatitis A include fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, clay-colored stools, and jaundice (yellowish color to the skin and eyes). "We are working with at-risk populations to help prevent even more people from getting sick," Health Commissioner Julianne Nesbit said in a news release. "Whether you are considered to be at high risk or not, anyone can get hepatitis A. So, we encourage everyone to get vaccinated and wash your hands."

Since November 2017, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has been investigating an outbreak of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV). Cases have been infected with HAV strains genetically linked to outbreaks across the US. Indiana has an average of 20 cases of hepatitis A per 12-month period.

Indiana is one of several states experiencing a hepatitis A outbreak, and outbreak-related cases have been confirmed across the state. Information on other outbreaks can be accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Transmission is presumed to occur person to person; no contaminated commercial food product has been identified. Based on CDC guidelines, populations who are homeless, transient, incarcerated, or use illicit drugs and their close direct contacts are considered at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A.

If you believe you have been exposed to hepatitis A or are homeless, use injection or noninjection drugs, were recently incarcerated, or had contact with someone who has hepatitis A, contact your healthcare provider about the hepatitis A vaccine.

To reduce the risk of hepatitis A transmission, people who have not received 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine may ask their healthcare providers for protection. Additionally, always wash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom, after changing diapers, and before preparing meals for yourself and others. Do not attend work or school if you are experiencing symptoms of hepatitis A, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, tiredness, stomachache, fever, dark-colored (cola) urine, light-colored stool, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes). Symptoms may take as many as 50 days from exposure to appear.

Using the outbreak definition, the ISDH will update this website each Friday to reflect counties that have 5 or more outbreak-related cases. The ISDH updated the outbreak definition on 20 Jul 2018 and may reflect additional cases that were not included in previous outbreak case counts.

As of 10 Aug 2018: total cases, 364; hospitalized, 161; death, 1.

[Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (CA) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total are in individuals outside the described cohorts. - Mod.LL
