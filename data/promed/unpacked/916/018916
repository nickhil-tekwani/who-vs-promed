The United Kingdom's deputy chief veterinary officer has confirmed H5N8 avian flu in a small flock of chickens and geese at a premises near Diss, South Norfolk. A 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone have been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

The flock is estimated to contain approximately 35 birds. A number have died, and the remaining live birds at the premises are being humanely culled. A full investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection.

Public Health England advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and the Food Standards Agency is clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. Keepers are urged to continue to be vigilant and look out for the signs of avian flu in their flocks, informing the Animal and Plant Health Agency should they suspect infection.

The government has only recently relaxed the Avian Flu Prevention Zones and a ban on poultry gatherings, which were lifted across England since 15 May 2017. The government still advises keepers to follow industry standard best practices on biosecurity, including minimising movement in and out of bird enclosures, cleaning footwear, keeping areas where birds live clean and tidy, and feeding birds indoors.

Despite the outbreak today [3 Jun 2017], the most recent case of H5N8 in poultry in England was confirmed on 6-7 May 2017 in Lancashire and before that on 24 Feb 2017.

In March 2017, millions of UK free range eggs temporarily lost their status after hens were forced to spend weeks inside barns as part of the government's emergency bird flu measures.

[A risk assessment by experts at the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs [DEFRA] regarding the incursion of HPAI H5N8 into the UK's poultry premises during the 2017 spring to summer season (updated 11 May 2017) is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/613652/updated-qra-avian-flu-may2017.pdf. As apparent from the map in annex 2 of the said document ("Breeding mallard populations in the United Kingdom and their relative abundance"), the breeding mallard population in the currently affected area (South Norfolk) is relatively high.

HPAI H5N8 continues its circulation in Europe and elsewhere, affecting poultry and non-poultry birds, though the seasonal peak is over. The most recent OIE report involving this strain was submitted on 2 Jun 2017 by Belgium, addressing a small holding with captive birds of the Phasianidae family (unidentified); see the OIE report in 20170603.5081763. The event took place in the Belgian province Luxembourg (not to be confused with the country Luxembourg).

Avian influenza has also been reported by the media on 2 Jun 2017 from the neighboring country, Luxembourg, where 3 poultry farms were reportedly affected (stamping out applied). The virus strain has not been disclosed. The text of the media report was, in fact, identical to the official report by Luxembourg's Ministry of Agriculture (see https://www.gouvernement.lu/7024066/02-grippe-aviaire?context=519177). Information on the serotyping of the causative agent is anticipated. - Mod.AS
