The Health Ministry on Friday [19 Nov 2021] said it has received reports that the H5N1 strain of avian [influenza] has been detected at 2 Israeli farming communities. According to the ministry, the reported cases were at a turkey farm on Ein Tzurim in southern Israel, and on a duck farm at Kfar Baruch in the north. The ministry said "it was decided to provide preventive treatment to those defined as contacts," and that its offices in the north were reaching out to schools and others who visited the petting zoo at Kfar Baruch. There have been no reported cases in Israel of H5N1 among humans [ever].

The Health Ministry added that the bird farms were "under the treatment" of the Agriculture Ministry, without elaborating. The H5N1 subtype of avian flu can be deadly if transferred to humans. Israeli and Palestinian growers have dealt with sporadic outbreaks of the virus over the years, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled to stop the virus from spreading.

In 2006, southern Israel's poultry industry was brought nearly to the brink of collapse, growers said, after a number of culls following the discovery of bird flu.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the submission above.

The Ministry of Agriculture published on Sun 21 Nov 2021 the following press release (in Hebrew, translated): "H5N1 avian influenza was detected in 2 foci. The first focus is a duck farm in Kfar Baruch, keeping 17 500 ducks, and a turkey farm in Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, which has 21 000 turkeys.

"Upon receiving the laboratory test results confirming avian influenza, the veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture isolated the holding and started the application of the control measures. The office conducts active monitoring in all the surrounding poultry farms, as well as elsewhere.

"At the same time, the ministry operates in full coordination with the Ministry of Health."

The distance (as the crow flies) between Ein Tzurim (Hadarom district, south west) and Kfar Baruch (Hazafon, centre north) is 100 km (62 mi); for their respective geographic locations, see map at https://tinyurl.com/4zbsew58.

With the addition of the 2 new outbreaks, Israel's number of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, since the start (29 Oct 2021) of the current season's epizootic, totals 4. The last previous H5N1 event in Israel took place in 2015.

During the winters 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, HPAI H5N8 was recorded. The final HPAI report of the 2020/2021 season -- during which HPAI H5N8 was predominantly identified in wild, migrating birds -- was submitted to the OIE in June 2021 (available, with map, at https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/avian-flu-7-21/he/animals_health_avian-influenza_Follow-up-report-7-H5N8-wild-animals-FInal-07-06-21.pdf).

Israel is situated on main flyways of migrating birds. No infected birds are known to have been identified (yet) during the current season. Updated information on undertaken surveillance activities will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
