State health authorities announced today [8 Aug 2008] that another
_E. coli_ [O157] case linked to ground beef has been identified in a
Massachusetts resident, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the
state to 7. Public health interviews with affected individuals
revealed that they ate ground beef products from Whole Foods Markets
during the month of July 2008.

Based on this information the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health (DPH) is advising consumers not to eat any fresh ground beef
product purchased at Whole Foods Market between 2 Jun 2008 and 6 Aug
2008. This includes ground beef and ground beef patties from the meat
counter as well as from the prepackaged meat cooler. Any remaining
product should be thrown out. Consumers are also advised to check
their freezers for ground beef products they may have purchased last
month [July 2008] and frozen.

Officials from the supermarket chain have cooperated with staff from
DPH during the agency's investigation to determine the source of the
contamination. Preliminary findings suggest that ground beef products
that were previously identified as part of a nationwide recall may
have entered the retail supply at Whole Foods during June and July of
2008 [see ProMED post E. coli O157 - USA (03): (OH, MI), ground beef
conf., recall 20080701.2010].

In July 2008, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
announced the extension of a national recall for ground beef produced
by Nebraska Beef, Ltd. due to possible _E. coli_ contamination.
Nebraska Beef produces products under the Coleman brand name, and a
review of records from Whole Foods indicates that some of the stores
received product from the recall list. At this time, it is not known
why the food listed under the USDA recall was sold to the public
after the recall date.

DPH, USDA, and Whole Foods are continuing to investigate the outbreak
and will provide additional information as it becomes available.
Whole Foods has removed from their stores all ground beef product
from Nebraska Beef as a precautionary measure.

The Massachusetts cases range in age from 3 to 60 years. They include
residents of Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex counties. They reported
becoming ill between 10-29 Jul 2008. At least 5 of the cases were
hospitalized.

[Whole Foods Market of Austin, Texas, is asking customers who may have
purchased ground beef from June 2 though Aug. 6 to dispose of the
product and return it to the store with the packaging or receipt for a
refund. For more information, consumers can call 512-542-0878. - Mod.JW]
