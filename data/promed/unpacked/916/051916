Ministry steps up vaccination drive against FMD
------------------------------------------------
The department of agriculture and water in Majmaa, where 20 camels died of
foot and mouth disease (FMD) last week, has started a campaign to vaccinate
some 7500 cows against the viral disease, according to Nasir Al-Hosainan,
director of the department.
Speaking to Arab News, he said there were no fresh cases of FMD infection
in the region. He urged cattle owners to bring their animals from pasturing
areas to the pens to give them the vaccines.
Agriculture and Water Minister Dr. Abdullah Muammar said more than 2400 FMD
cases had been detected at 46 farms in the country.
"46 sites infected with FMD have been registered up until Sunday" in
different regions throughout Saudi Arabia, said the minister. He said 2417
animals - 1767 cattle, 650 sheep and goats - had been infected, adding 88
cattle and 141 sheep and goats had died while 30 others had been slaughtered.
He said veterinary teams would continue to test cattle in all the Kingdom's
provinces to detect new cases of the disease as well as isolating infected
sites. The minister urged farmers to "notify the authorities immediately
after the disease manifests itself." The Agriculture Ministry will continue
to distribute vaccines, he added.
Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Sheiha, director of the agriculture and water
department in Riyadh, said 7 confirmed FMD cases had been reported in the
region. They were discovered in Dareyya, Ainiya, Muzahamiya, Huraimala,
Alkharj, Majmaa and Wadi Al-Dawasir. He also reported suspected FMD cases
in the region.
Speaking to Al-Jazirah newspaper, Sheiha said the ministry had taken
precautionary steps to contain the disease. "We have also enlightened
farmers on how to protect their animals from the disease," he added.
Meanwhile, a committee from the environmental health department is
currently conducting a survey of farms having reported suspected FMD cases.
A number of cattle farms in Qatif, Jubail and Ahsa reported suspected cases
of FMD in recent days.
