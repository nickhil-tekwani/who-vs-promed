Anthrax outbreak in suburb of Tbilisi, Georgia
-----------------------------------------------
A cluster of 9 cases of cutaneous Anthrax was reported on 9 May 2004 in a
Tbilisi suburb, close to the Gardabani district. Several active pockets of
the disease have been identified in this district over the past 5 years.
People from this neighborhood use the Gardabani district for pasturing cattle.

Epidemiological investigation identified the source of the infection to be
a sick cow that was slaughtered on 29 Apr 2004 -- without veterinary
controls -- by its owner and 3 of his neighbors. Another 5 neighbors took
part in the washing and processing of the meat. All persons who became ill
are adults: 6 male and 3 female.

An epidemiological team was sent by the Ministry of Labor, Health and
Social Affairs of Georgia to investigate the outbreak. 80 exposed persons,
who consumed meat, have been traced and are being monitored. It was also
established that another 30 persons, in another village, had consumed
contaminated meat at a funeral repast. This meat had been brought to the
funeral repast by a person from the neighborhood. The persons involved are
also undergoing active surveillance by the local Public Health authorities.
Those who had consumed burgers prepared from the meat of the sick cow are
taking antibiotics.

All remaining meat has been withdrawn by the veterinary service and
destroyed. The area where the slaughter took place has been disinfected.
Refrigerators where contaminated meat was stored have been disinfected as well.

All persons with manifest anthrax (all having the cutaneous form) are in
the Tbilisi Infectious Disease Hospital. Clinical and environmental samples
have been taken by the mobile epidemiological team of the National Center
for Disease Control and Medical Statistics of Georgia (NCDC).

[Our thanks to Dr. Bakanidze for this detailed, authoritative, and quick
report on the human anthrax cases in Tblisi. It demonstrates the public
health damage that can be done by extra-regulatory, and informal, meat
sales. Georgia has a severe anthrax problem in its livestock. The disease
is regularly seen in a number of areas, and the government is struggling to
develop an efficient, and effective, veterinary control program. Human
cases have been regularly reported since 1995: 33 cases in 1996, 4 cases in
1997, 11 cases in 1998, 51 cases in 1999, 21 cases in 2000, and 26 cases in
2001. This is not the 1st time urban cases in Tblisi have been only the tip
of a rural epidemiological anthrax iceberg. Gardabani district is regularly
blamed, but it suffers from being close to Tblisi, and, consequently, is
reported upon in the press. Some of the 2001 cases were in Abkhazia,
Zugdidi disrict. - Mod.MHJ]
