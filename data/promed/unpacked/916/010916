Detection of cases of cholera in the Chandan Nagar locality of
Kartarpur has put the health authorities on alert again. Earlier, the
death of a person near Nurmahal due to cholera had put the health
authorities in a spot. Stool samples of the diarrhoa patients,
collected by the health authorities after finding more than 20 cases
of severe diarrhea in Kartarpur on Tuesday, 17 Aug 2010, were found
to test positive for _Vibrio cholerae_.

Although restricted to a single locality, the magnitude of the
outbreak was severe. Suspecting cholera behind the incident, the
stool samples of patients were sent to Government Medical College for
a microbiological examination.

Confirming the report, Dr RL Wassan, DHO [district health officer],
Jalandhar, said out of the total of 4 stool samples taken by the
department on Tuesday [17 Aug 2010], 2 tested positive for cholera.
Additionally, 3 water samples, out of the total 4 taken from the
locality, were also declared unfit for drinking after laboratory
examination, he confirmed.

A cholera epidemic that has killed more than 350 people in Nigeria
since the start of the year [2010] now poses a threat to the entire
country, the health ministry said on Wednesday, 25 Aug 2010.

"Epidemiological evidence indicates that the entire country is at
risk," the ministry said in a statement.

"Reports received so far from 11 states show we have recorded 6437
cases with 352 deaths from cholera in 2010. Most of the outbreaks
occurred in the northwest and northeast zones" of the country, it stated.

Surveys carried out by the ministry showed that less than 40 percent
of the population in the affected states have access to adequate
toilet facilities, the statement said.

In addition, World Health Organisation figures indicate that 42
people have died in northeastern Yobe State in the past week from a
form of gastroenteritis, characterised by vomiting and diarrhea,
which are also cholera symptoms.

Cholera has killed 297 people in the west African nation of Cameroon,
health officials said Wednesday, 26 Aug 2010.

The outbreak, which began in May 2010, has exceeded 3000 cases, said
Dr Eric Mintz, the leader of the [US] Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team.
The agency has an office in Cameroon. "It's a lot of cases and a lot
of deaths," he said in a telephone interview. "More deaths than
should be expected under the best of conditions."

The country's northern region has been particularly hard hit. 3 of 10
prisoners diagnosed with cholera at Maroua Central Prison in the far
north were among the dead, the officials said.

CDC's Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected
repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently in 2009.

About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north,
bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not
have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and
Energy official. Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent
flooding has aggravated the situation. The affected area is home to
some 5 million people, according to UNICEF.

Torrential rains that continue to pour down in the southern and
northern parts of Chad have led to flooding with harmful consequences
to the local population. The neighboring countries such as Cameroon,
Nigeria, and Niger have already experienced cases of cholera.

In Chad, cases of cholera have been confirmed by the Ministry of
health in the region of Lac and Mayo Kebbi East. 3 deaths were
registered so far. Those regions are disaster prone areas and are
badly affected by the continuation of rains. The Chadian Health
Ministry organized an emergency meeting with the humanitarian
partners and an evaluation mission has been set up to carry out an
assessment in the disaster areas. The aim of this mission is to
conduct a rapid evaluation of the outbreak and take some actions
regarding the immediate assistance to provide.
