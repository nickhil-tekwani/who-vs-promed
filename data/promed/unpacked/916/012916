Zaire: over 50 cases of sleeping disease in Zaire province
-----------------------------------------------
At least 57 cases of sleeping disease were diagnosed from October to
November 2004 in Angola's northern Zaire province, according to an active
campaign of information gathering conducted by the Institute for Combat and
Control of Trypanosomiasis (ICCT).
Speaking to the Angola Press Agency (Angop), the head of the department of
ICCT in Zaire, Francisco Mayala, advanced that, for this 5th phase of the
campaign, held in Mbaza-Congo, Cuimba, Nzeto, and Noqui districts, 4 mobile
teams were created, which are supported by technicians from Luanda who
surveyed about 22 673 people. The Kindege commune, Nzeto district,
registered the largest number of cases -- a total of 37 -- followed by
Luvo, in Mbaza-Congo, with 13, and Kuimba and Noqui districts, with 5 and 2
cases, respectively.

[Sleeping sickness in Angola was almost eradicated by 1975 but flared up
again during 27 years of war. Following a declaration of peace in April
2002, the return of displaced people to Angola helped spread sleeping
sickness. The disease is difficult to detect, until the parasites pass from
the blood to the brain, when the classical symptoms, such as sleepiness,
occur. Consequently, there is usually considerable under-reporting of the
disease.
2 parasites cause human trypanosomiasis in Africa, _Trypanosoma brucei
gambiense_ and _T. b. rhodesiense_; the former occurs in Angola. Vectors
are tsetse flies, of which there are 23 species, 6 of which are divided
into 2 or more subspecies. In Angola, the likely vectors are _Glossina
palpalis_, _G. fuscipes_, or _G. tachinoides_, but I have no information on
the actual species causing recent transmission in Angola.
Drugs used to treat people -- such as melarsoprol, pentamadine, and
eflornithine -- are toxic. The treatment regime for melarsoprol varies from
country to country, but in Angola, it has, in the recent past, been
administered as 3-4 consecutive injections given every 24 hours, with an
interval of about a week before the 2nd and 3rd course of injections.
Elsewhere, pentamidine has been given as 10 injections on alternate days,
or used for 2 days prior to a course of melarsoprol. It is unclear what
regimen is currently being used in Angola.
Pyrethroid-impregnated attractant traps have been used in many sub-Saharan
countries, including Angola, to trap and kill the tsetse flies, as well as
ground or aerial applications of mainly pyrethroid insecticides to kill
adult tsetse resting on vegetation. But, spraying, especially aerial
application, is expensive and needs considerable organization. References:
