Fish kill puzzles shore dwellers
--------------------------------
Al Michaud noticed them in the open waters when he took his boat out for a
short jaunt Monday afternoon [14 Jun 2010]. Terry and Vicki Kolton found 19
strewn along their North Shores beachfront on Monday night.

Scads [plural noun, informal, chiefly North American * a large number or
quantity: they raised scads of children. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] of dead fish --
mainly sheepshead, catfish, some perch and walleye -- washed up along Lake
Erie beaches from Bolles Harbor to North Cape on Monday afternoon and
evening, helped ashore by strong easterly and north easterly winds.

"We get dead fish a lot, but nothing like this where your arms get tired
trying to bury them all," Mr Michaud said. "Usually after some of the
fishing tournaments, we'll end up with some dead ones on the beach, but
this is unusual to have this many on our beach," Mrs Kolton said.

State officials said they had 4 separate reports of dead fish, all seen in
a short stretch of the Lake Erie shoreline in Monroe County, but they said
the deaths probably were due to natural causes.

"There are a lot of scenarios possible, but we do not suspect at this point
any widespread pollution or anything like that," said Gary Towns, fisheries
supervisor for the Lake Erie management unit of the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources and Environment. He said the deaths might have been
caused by "spawning stress." Fish are still in a weakened condition from
winter weather because they've been eating less. As the water warms, their
metabolism increases and they divert much energy to strenuous spawning
activities. "Some of these are old, big fish and they're at the end of
their lives anyway, and they're trying to spawn one more time," Mr Towns said.

Another factor could be VHS, a fish virus that has taken a toll before.
"That could be a possibility -- that it's another wave of that -- but
there's no way to test because there are no fresh samples." He said fish
must be in the throes of dying or have had just died for accurate results.

Lakeside dwellers said the fish they saw were in a state of decomposition,
with some missing eyes or other parts.

That led Mr Towns to suggest the fish that washed up might be from a
commercial netter working the area. He said a netter has a license to
trap-net along the Lake Erie shoreline in Michigan waters. The trap nets
catch the fish live, but if rough weather or storms prevent the netter from
hauling the catch, the fish can get beat up and coupled with rising water
temperatures, could deteriorate.

"I noticed, on my beach, about a dozen fish," Mr Michaud said. "I buried
them because they stink to high heaven. We were out on the lake about a
mile or so and you could just see them all over the place," he continued.
"These fish had no eyes in them, they looked pretty bad."

Mr Towns said there was a small fish kill in the area about 4 weeks ago and
an east wind that also caused dead fish to wash up along portions of the
shoreline. He said it occurred right after a spike in air temperatures.

Building waves on Tuesday [15 Jun 2010], however, apparently reclaimed the
fish bodies and transported them elsewhere.

[It is possible the fish died of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). The
article does not provide us much information, aside from the fact there are
a lot decomposing fish on the beach. While it is true that decomposition
will adversely affect any results from histopathology, it seems that
molecular techniques should be able to identify VHS.

As the number of dead fish is so large, clean-up may be delayed, allowing
the bacteria responsible for botulism to grow in the carcases. The longer
the dead fish remain on the shore, the more likely it is that birds will
consume the free morsels of fish, and potentially encounter and develop
botulism.

We would welcome further information about the cause of this die-off, if it
becomes clear. - Mod.TG
