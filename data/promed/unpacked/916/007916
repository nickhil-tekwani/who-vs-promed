A plant-based toxin is suspected of sickening a dozen diners -- sending 4 to intensive care -- after they ate at a restaurant in Markham, Ont., the region's top doctor said Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] as the local public health unit investigated what happened.

Dr. Barry Pakes told local media the toxin aconite -- found in herbs, roots, or a flower -- is suspected to be involved. He said York Region Public Health has no reason to think diners were intentionally given the toxin.

Pakes said 12 people sought medical attention and 4 were in intensive care but appeared to be improving.

The health unit said Monday [29 Aug 2022] it was probing what took place at Delight Restaurant & BBQ over the weekend, noting the restaurant had since been closed.

Anyone who ate at the restaurant on Saturday or Sunday [27-28 Aug 2022] -- including those who had dine-in, takeout, delivery, and leftovers -- and is feeling unwell is advised to seek medical attention.

The health unit said the restaurant was co-operating with the investigation.

Audrey Champoux, press secretary for Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino's office, said the minister was aware of the "concerning reports of a suspected food-borne poisoning" in Markham.

"We continue to monitor for details as they are developing. We'd like to wish a speedy recovery to those who were affected and fell ill," Champoux wrote in a statement.

An intensive care physician at a Toronto hospital said a notice about diners falling ill after eating at the restaurant had been circulating among the region's ICU community.

The notice was shared among those who work at ICUs in the Greater Toronto Area, Dr. Michael Warner of Michael Garron Hospital said on Twitter.

York Regional Police said they were "made aware of an incident on Sunday [28 Aug 2022]" in Markham but directed questions to the local public health unit.

[Herbal preparations in some extractions or preparations tout the benefits of this plant. It has to be thoroughly soaked and worked to lose the majority of its toxic principles. You may find various pill or tablet formulation in some shops that sell herbal preparations. There are those who promote its beneficial properties, and some who would disagree.

But aconite is toxic in most forms.

"Abstract
Introduction: Aconitine and related alkaloids found in the _Aconitum_ species are highly toxic cardiotoxins and neurotoxins. The wild plant (especially the roots and root tubers) is extremely toxic. Severe aconite poisoning can occur after accidental ingestion of the wild plant or consumption of an herbal decoction made from aconite roots. In traditional Chinese medicine, aconite roots are used only after processing to reduce the toxic alkaloid content. Soaking and boiling during processing or decoction preparation will hydrolyze aconite alkaloids into less toxic and non-toxic derivatives. However, the use of a larger-than-recommended dose and inadequate processing increases the risk of poisoning."

"Mechanisms of toxicity: The cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity of aconitine and related alkaloids are due to their actions on the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of the cell membranes of excitable tissues, including the myocardium, nerves, and muscles. Aconitine and mesaconitine bind with high affinity to the open state of the voltage-sensitive sodium channels at site 2, thereby causing a persistent activation of the sodium channels, which become refractory to excitation. The electrophysiological mechanism of arrhythmia induction is triggered activity due to delayed after-depolarization and early after-depolarization. The arrhythmogenic properties of aconitine are in part due to its cholinolytic (anticholinergic) effects mediated by the vagus nerve. Aconitine has a positive inotropic effect by prolonging sodium influx during the action potential. It has hypotensive and bradycardic actions due to activation of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Through its action on voltage-sensitive sodium channels in the axons, aconitine blocks neuromuscular transmission by decreasing the evoked quantal release of acetylcholine. Aconitine, mesaconitine, and hypaconitine can induce strong contractions of the ileum through acetylcholine release from the postganglionic cholinergic nerves.

"Clinical features: Patients present predominantly with a combination of neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal features. The neurological features can be sensory (paresthesia and numbness of face, perioral area, and the 4 limbs), motor (muscle weakness in the 4 limbs), or both. The cardiovascular features include hypotension, chest pain, palpitations, bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, ventricular ectopics, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. The gastrointestinal features include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The main causes of death are refractory ventricular arrhythmias and asystole, and the overall in-hospital mortality is 5.5%.

"Management: Management of aconite poisoning is supportive, including immediate attention to the vital functions and close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Inotropic therapy is required if hypotension persists, and atropine should be used to treat bradycardia. Aconite-induced ventricular arrhythmias are often refractory to direct current cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs. Available clinical evidence suggests that amiodarone and flecainide are reasonable 1st-line treatment. In refractory cases of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, it is most important to maintain systemic blood flow, blood pressure, and tissue oxygenation by the early use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The role of charcoal hemoperfusion to remove circulating aconitine alkaloids is not established.

"Conclusions: Aconite roots contain aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, and other _Aconitum_ alkaloids, which are known cardiotoxins and neurotoxins. Patients present predominantly with neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal features. Management is supportive; the early use of cardiopulmonary bypass is recommended if ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock are refractory to 1st-line treatment.
