Update on statement made by FAO spokesman in Hanoi
--------------------------------------------------
The United Nations' food body said on Friday that there was no evidence of
avian flu in pigs, dismissing an earlier report from U.N. representatives
in Vietnam that had raised fears of an escalating crisis. A Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) spokesman in Hanoi had earlier said that the
bird flu virus had been found in the nasal cavities of several Vietnamese
pigs, but an FAO scientist in Rome said the tests he had referred to were
not up to standard. "The news that he reported was based, we believe, on
studies with an experimental test. It is essential that we base analyses on
sound science," Peter Roeder, an FAO animal health expert told Reuters. He
said the tests did not conform to the standards established by world animal
health body OIE, which said on Friday it would not be surprised if pigs in
Asia tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus. Roeder said the FAO was
investigating the exact origin of the earlier report, a potentially dynamic
development in the avian flu crisis which has killed millions of poultry
and 16 people. Pigs have a similar immune system to humans and suffer from
a wide variety of diseases that also infect people. FAO said it would not
be surprising if sampling the nasal cavities of swine in any country led to
the detection of influenza viruses in a small portion of animals but that
at this stage nothing had been proven. "Right now there is no justification
for saying there is H5N1 virus infection in pigs in Vietnam," said Robert
Webster, World Health Organisation animal flu expert.

Bird flu claims 18th victim as experts warn it is still out of control
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from Asia's bird flu crisis has risen to 18, with a fatality
in Vietnam as international experts warned the disease was still out of
control and criticised governments for their tardy response. After 2 days
of emergency talks in Rome, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
urged governments to launch a vaccination campaign to contain the spread of
avian influenza, which has struck 10 Asian countries. "The epidemic has not
been brought under control and we need an urgent response," said FAO
director Jacques Diouf, adding that the disease must be prevented from
spreading geographically and to other animal species.
The warning came as traces of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu
were discovered in pigs in the Vietnamese capital and its surroundings. "We
have seen evidence from nasal swabs taken from pigs in the Hanoi area that
H5N1 is present," Anton Rychener, head of the FAO in Vietnam told AFP. "We
are now studying what the best course of action is."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that H5N1 could kill
millions across the globe if it combined with a human influenza virus to
create a new highly contagious strain transmissible among humans. This
situation could be exacerbated if pigs are found to carry H5N1 as they are
an ideal "mixing vessel" for bird and human viruses, experts say.
Rychener said bird flu had been detected in non-poultry animals in previous
bird flu outbreaks around the world.
Peter Cordingley, spokesman for the WHO's Western Pacific Office in Manila,
said the organization was unable to provide any immediate comment on the
potential impact on human health this new development could have.
Taiwan, meanwhile, ordered a cull of 230 000 chickens Friday after fresh
outbreaks of the less virulent H5N2 flu strain were found at eight farms.
Some 98 000 birds were slaughtered following earlier outbreaks, but so far
the island remains free of the H5N1 virus, which doctors said Friday had
claimed another life in Vietnam.
So far the WHO says it has no concrete evidence of human-to-human
transmission. It says contact with sick poultry is the main cause of infection.
An Australian microbiologist said on Friday that although the chances of a
new pandemic strain arising from a mix of human and bird flu viruses were
"very small" they were greater than at any time since the last pandemic in
1968. "Things are happening with the bird flu which are unprecedented and
we have far more outbreaks and in more countries than is usual," Professor
John MacKenzie from the University of Queensland told AFP. "I think this is
the worst scenario possible and it does concern me enormously." He
described Severe Acute Respiratory Sydnrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800
people worldwide, as "a wake-up call" about what could happen with the flu.
Health experts meeting in Rome called Thursday for a targeted vaccination
campaign that would create a buffer zone around an affected region and the
continued cull of birds in order to contain the disease.
But they also strongly criticized Asian governments for failing to report
outbreaks quickly enough, and said greater transparency was essential. The
FAO said an emergency regional meeting would take place at the end of the
month in Thailand to coordinate implementation of the Rome recommendations.
China is one of the countries facing charges of covering up bird flu
outbreaks. 13 of the country 31 regions were host to either suspected or
confirmed cases, but the government has insisted there are no human infections.
South Korea, meanwhile, began culling 30 000 chickens and ducks after a new
bird flu outbreak was discovered at 2 farms south of Seoul. Singapore has
so far maintained that it is free from the disease, but local media
reported Friday that 30 birds had mysteriously died.
Although global health authorities are unsure about the origin of the
virus, they have said migratory birds may be spreading it across Asia.

Non official information relating to avian influenza in pigs
------------------------------------------------------------
Unconfirmed rumours are actually in circulation to the effect that pigs in
Vietnam are showing serological evidence of infection by H5N1 virus which
is currently responsible for the outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in
the region.
Even if this information is confirmed, it would not constitute a surprise
because the potential susceptibility of pigs to avian influenza virus is
well known.
This finding would indicate that the pigs which have been tested were in
contact with the virus and have developed antibodies against the virus
detected by the tests.
Under the present circumstances, the OIE recommends to countries that are
infected with avian influenza to closely monitor pigs which are in contact
with infected birds and cull those in which the presence of the virus is
confirmed.
[Contradictory statements are the outcome of the complex and alarming
situation which is currently seen in 10 Eastern Asian countries affected by
this epizootic, especially in view of its public health implications.
Confusion can be avoided by the timely involvement of authorised reference
centres.
The OIE has a global network of over 150 Reference Laboratories and
Collaborating Centres, which are designated to pursue all the scientific
and technical problems relating to a named disease on the OIE lists. The

China reports 5 more bird flu cases in fowl
-------------------------------------------
China yesterday confirmed 5 more cases of bird flu in fowl, one in a new
province, and said 4 more suspected outbreaks of the disease had been detected.
4 cases were confirmed in the eastern province of Anhui and 1 was
determined in Jiangxi Province, where no previous cases of bird flu had
been confirmed, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
1 suspected case each was also found in Jiangxi and Yunnan Provinces and 2
in the province of Guangdong.
The latest figures mean that the country has 32 bird flu outbreaks,
including 10 confirmed ones and 22 suspected ones, in 13 mainland regions.
So far, no cases of human infection of bird flu have been reported and bird
flu has been brought under control in areas hit by the disease on the
Chinese mainland, Vice Health Minister Wang Longde said at a press
conference in Beijing yesterday. Wang rejected rumors circulating in recent
days of human cases, saying they were groundless and that there was no
attempt at a cover-up. "I can say in a responsible way that there is no
human infection in China," Wang said, slowing his words for emphasis.
Added Vice Agriculture Minister Liu Jian, "It is not true that we have this
disease (in humans) but did not report it."
While vowing stringent measures to stop the virus before it spreads to
people, Liu acknowledged that defenses against bird flu are weak and
vulnerable, in parts of China because of the country's size and its
developing reporting systems. Liu promised to boost communication between
the central government in Beijing and local officials and vowed to continue
paying compensation to farmers whose chickens and ducks were killed to
contain the disease. He said researchers were studying possible virus
mutation and that surveillance has been stepped up, especially along the
country's borders, where infected poultry might slip in.
The Chinese government is confident in the fight, Liu said. He acknowledged
that "some parts of our animal disease-prevention system are weak and
vulnerable, and the public has limited knowledge about the disease and ways
to prevent it." Liu said the sheer size of China and its still-improving
disease reporting systems have been drawbacks in the fight.
The poultry population in China is quite big, and production methods are
quite diverse. That has brought us some difficulties in controlling this
epidemic, he said. It remains an arduous task for China.
Jia Youling, a poultry expert with the ministry, urged caution when eating
eggs but said there was no cause for serious alarm. There is a chance that
in affected regions eggs may carry bird flu, Jia said. "We suggest that
when eating eggs, they be very well boiled."
Liu said China's previously announced plans to destroy all poultry in a
3-kilometer radius of an "affected locality" were being carried out.
As of Wed, 4 Feb 2004, more than 1.2 million chickens, ducks and geese had
been slaughtered across China to prevent the spread of the disease.
2 new vaccine plants are scheduled to start production soon, Liu said. No
human vaccine has been developed for the bird flu now striking much of
Asia, but experts believe that an existing animal vaccine provides at least
partial protection from the current strain.

[The situation in China should be a matter of great concern. So far, 32
outbreaks of Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, of which
22 are still to be confirmed by laboratory tests, have been reported in
China. All those outbreaks seem to have taken place in commercial farms
which grow chickens, ducks, geese and (in one case, Anhui, 3 Feb 2004)
doves. However, the majority of the poultry enterprises in China are of
small holders; many of these countless holdings, where birds are kept in
close proximity to pigs and humans, might be infected. The authorities
encounter a tremendously difficult task in their declared endeavor to
monitor all those holdings and carry out control measures.
The disease has already been recognized in 13 out of the 31 main provinces
and autonomous regions of China. 4 of the infected provinces have common
borders with neighboring countries: Yunnan (Burma, Laos and Viet Nam);
Guangxi (Viet Nam); Gansu (Mongolia); Xinjiang (Pakistan, Afganistan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazachstan, Russian Federation and Mongolia).
In view of the news on enhanced vaccine production in China, we repeat our
request to obtain information on the characteristics of the vaccine,
officially reported to be in use in China since 2002. - Mod.AS]
