Since the Mongolia Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry reported the 1st ASF outbreak on 15 Jan 2019, 10 ASF outbreaks were reported in 6 provinces (aimags); the virus was also detected in meat/meat product in Ulaanbaatar City. The outbreaks were in backyard settings; the authority culled all pigs and disinfected the affected areas. A strict movement control has been implemented in control zones restricting even human movement for 14 to 28 days.

Viet Nam
--------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks in its 2 northern provinces on 19 Feb 2019. The Prime Minister on the same day through Directive No. 04/CT-TTg requested ministers, heads of ministerial-level agencies, government-attached agencies and chairpersons of provincial people's committees and centrally administered cities to concentrate on directing and implementing synchronously and effectively, urgent measures to control ASF. Affected farms were depopulated, and a strict movement control has been implemented in the provinces; in other provinces, a permit is required for moving animals.

3. [New] actions taken by China
A. On 15 Feb 2019, 3 batches of frozen soup pork dumplings produced by Sanquan Company, Henan Province were suspected to be ASF virus nucleic acid positive, in the samples collected in Xiangxi City, Hunan Province and Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. The company has suspended the batch through all sales channels.

B. In response to media reports on detection of ASF virus in pork products (dumplings), the State Administration for Market Regulation and MARA have required enterprises to immediately trace-back the source of raw material. The 2 ministries have sent a joint investigation team, required pork producers to further strengthen control and prevent contaminated pork raw materials from entering food processing.

[The above FAO update includes also a table presenting a list of affected cities in each infected province since 3 Aug 2018, a figure illustrating the number of China's ASF-reported villages by region and onset month, and a list of useful links.

A new research study by Kansas State University addresses the transmission of ASF virus in water and feed. A relevant press release is available at https://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/2019-02/asf21319.html.

It would be interesting to note whether the 3 Asian countries addressed in the FAO update have been carrying out ASF surveillance in wild boars in their respective territories. - Mod.AS
