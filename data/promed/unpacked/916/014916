Information on H5N1-infected birds found in Hong Kong so far in 2006
had been uploaded onto the website of Hong Kong Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department
(<http://www.afcd.gov.hk/news/news_e.htm>), a spokesman for the
department said on Tuesday [7 Mar 2006].
Details available include the infected species, submission date for
laboratory tests, and location found, together with a distribution
map, according to a government press release on Tuesday.
A number of H5N1-infected bird cases have been reported recently and
all the bird parks in Hong Kong nature reserves and big parks have
been closed as a move to prevent the possible prevention of [spread
of] the deadly virus.
Hong Kong had also decided to suspend the import of live poultry from
neighboring Guangdong Province starting 5 Mar 2006 after receiving a
notification by the Ministry of Health of a confirmed case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza virus in Guangzhou City,
Guangdong's capital.
A set of safety guidelines for handling and disposing of dead wild
birds is also available on the website.
The web pages will be updated regularly once new information is
available, the spokesman added.

Under the title "Prevention of avian influenza", the HK website
includes 2 other documents which are now becoming useful for bird
fans beyond China or Asia:
1. Management of birds;
2. Safety guidelines for handling and disposing of dead wild birds.
A worldwide list of species affected by H5N1, based upon referenced
reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in animals, divided
into 4 groups (wild, captive/sanctuary, domestic and experimentally
infected), has been prepared by the National Wildlife Health Center,
USGS; see
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/affected_species_chart.jsp>.
The list includes presently 9 mammal and 88 avian species, with
common and scientific names. - Mod.AS]

Albania on Wednesday [8 Mar 2006] confirmed its 1st case of the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in a chicken found in the southern
Sarande coastal region, near the border with Greece.
"The first case of H5N1 bird flu has been found in a hen at the
village of Cuke in the Sarande region," Agriculture Minister Jemin
Gjana said. "There is no cause for concern; it's just one chicken,
not a tsunami."
The findings were confirmed by a reference laboratory in Weybridge,
UK. A quarantine was in place in an area within a 3-km (2-mile)
radius of where the chicken was found and veterinarians would monitor
farms within a 10-km (6-mile) radius.
The bird flu virus has spread rapidly since the beginning of Feb
2006, and is now present in most European countries. It has infected
176 people worldwide, killing 96 of them since 2003.

Swedish authorities said Wednesday [8 Mar 2006] they had found 4 more
cases of the H5 bird flu subtype in wild ducks [species?!], however
more tests were needed to determine whether it was the deadly H5N1
strain.
The Swedish board of Agriculture said they had sent samples to the
European Union laboratory in Weybridge, England for confirmation.
Sweden has had no confirmed cases of H5N1 yet. Authorities are
awaiting results from the European Union reference laboratory in
Weybridge on samples that tested positive for the H5 subtype.
The latest 4 cases were found in the cities of Karlskrona and
Oxelosund on Sweden's southeastern coast.
"It was not unexpected that the authorities would find new cases at
various places and more will probably be found," the Swedish Board of
Agriculture said in a statement.
