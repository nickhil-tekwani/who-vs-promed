B. Diagnostic tests used:
- post-mortem -- pleuritis, fibrin strands, lungs marbled in appearance,
with hepatisation and adherence to chest wall;
- polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (lung sample);
- 76 out 105 sera tested positive by complement fixation test;
- _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ Small Colony (MmmSC) isolated
from one lung.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the outbreak is believed to
originate from infected animals smuggled from a neighbouring country.
