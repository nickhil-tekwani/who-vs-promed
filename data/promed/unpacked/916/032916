Kenya: Rift Valley Fever
-----------------------------
As of Thu 21 Dec 2006, the Ministry of Health has reported 12 cases
with 11 deaths of Rift valley fever in the northwestern [sic;
actually North Eastern] province of Kenya. The areas affected are
Korakora, Shanta Abak, Shell Gulliet and Shimbirey, all in close
proximity to the [provincial] capital city, Garissa.
Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) has been confirmed by the Kenya
Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, laboratories in some samples collected
from Garissa.
The Ministry of Health, Kenya has sent investigation teams to
Garissa, and WHO has been requested to support the Ministry of Health
in the outbreak response and to coordinate further international
technical assistance. Social mobilization activities, including
targeting health workers, are underway, but access to affected areas
in Garissa is difficult due to flooding in the area.

[This is a good time to remember Dr. Louise Martin, veterinarian, of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta,
Georgia, USA, who participated in investigating the 1997-98 outbreak
of Rift Valley fever in the same remote area of Kenya. She spent
Christmas 1997 in the field, and her reports of the initial and later
stages of the epidemic investigations were posted on ProMED. Locally
she was not free of criticism for doing this, even though it
engendered great support globally. She was another who put public
health before personal considerations. Tragically, Louise was killed
on 7 August 1998 in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. She
was honored with the 1998 ProMED-mail Award for Excellence in
Outbreak Reporting on the Internet. - Mod.JW]
