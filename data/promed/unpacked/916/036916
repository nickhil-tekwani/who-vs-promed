Preliminary Report on Dengue fever in patients from Luanda (Angola) diagnosed in Lisbon, Portugal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever in patients coming from Angola is being observed at our Travel Medicine Clinic and at the Infectious Disease Unit of the nearby Egas Moniz Hospital.

In March 2013, 8 patients were diagnosed [with dengue virus infections], 7 of them in the last 2 weeks of this month [April 2013]; 11 additional patients were diagnosed so far in April 2013. Ages ranged from 22-67 years; 3 patients were female. Patients were residents or travelers to the Luanda metropolitan area, Angola, and most of them were Portuguese. All patients had an acute febrile disease, and most of them were already out of the febrile period when observed; no severe forms or complications were seen.

Laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was established at the Tropical Clinic Unit Laboratory of the Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical (IHMT, Lisbon) using the Standard Diagnostics Bioline Duo (IgM/IgG) Rapid Test.

Samples from 4 potentially viremic patients were selected to detect dengue virus (DENV) using RT-PCR at the Virology Laboratory of the Medical Microbiology Unit of the IHMT. The 1st PCR round was performed according to Lanciotti et al (1992, J.Clin.Micro., vol.30, n3, pp: 545-551), with adaptations from Harris et al (1998, J.Clin.Micro., vol.36, (9):2634-2639). The 2nd PCR round was a multiplex designed to serotype DENV according to the amplification product obtained (482bp-DENV1; 119bp-DENV2; 290bp-DENV3; 392bp-DENV4). In the 4 samples, amplification detected product compatible with RNA from DENV1. Sequencing and viral culture are ongoing.

[ProMED receives relatively few reports of dengue virus infections in Africa, so the above firsthand report from Dr Seixas is very valuable and appreciated.

It is becoming increasingly clear that dengue fever virus infections in Africa are substantially underreported. On Fri 12 Apr 2013, Angola's Health minister Jose Van-Dunem assured Luanda residents that the health facilities were on alert and had dengue under control. http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/saude/2013/3/15/Dengue-cases-under-control-Health-minister,957dd9ec-8984-4af3-ae4c-3530df5da0e4.html.
