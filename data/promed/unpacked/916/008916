The number of people confirmed to be infected with chikungunya virus has climbed to 40, up from 32 announced by Mombasa County Health authorities on [Fri 5 Jan 2018] following tests by Lancet Group of Laboratories and the Kenya Medical Research Institute.

The last chikungunya outbreak in Kenya occurred in Mandera in mid 2016. Mombasa County Health Chief Officer Dr Khadija Shikely said on [Fri 5 Jan 2018] that hundreds of others were suspected to be having the disease after presenting themselves to various public and private health facilities in Mombasa with symptoms associated with the disease.

[A WHO report issued on 17 Jan 2018 stated that the outbreak has affected all the 6-sub counties namely, Mvita, Kisauni, Nyali, Changamwe, Jomvu, and Likoni. Most cases are found on the island, Mvita. By [4 Jan 2018], the Ministry of Health had reported 69 cases of which 32 samples have been tested at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Labs in Nairobi. 27 of the cases were found positive while 5 were negative.

ref: Bordi L, Carletti F, Lalle E, et al. Molecular characterization of autochthonous chikungunya cluster in Latium region, Italy. Emerg Infect Dis. 2018; 24(1):178-80.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report partial molecular characterization of isolates from an autochthonous chikungunya virus [CHIKV] cluster in the Latium [Lazio] region of Italy. E1 sequences from 3 patients differ substantially from sequences from the 2007 outbreak in Italy and lack the A226V substitution associated with increased viral fitness in the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito vector.

[Discussion]
------------
Further, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis that included 42 available CHIKV sequences from different parts of the world, including sequences previously analyzed in our laboratory. The analysis, based on a partial E1 sequence, showed that the virus involved in the online Latium region outbreak belongs to the broad group comprising isolates from the East/Central/South African (ECSA) clade and clusters with the Indian Ocean lineage. This finding is similar to what was observed for the 2007 Italy outbreak, but the current sequences are placed in a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree (bootstrap value 0.83). This branch also includes recent (2016) isolates from Pakistan and India, suggesting a more recent origin of the new epidemic strain, compared with the previous one affecting Italy. It is noteworthy that, unlike the isolates obtained from the 2007 outbreak in the Emilia Romagna region, the E1 sequences from the ongoing outbreak lack the A226V mutation, as do all the recent isolates placed on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. Further study will establish the relevance of this and other genetic signatures to the fitness of the virus for the local mosquito vectors and will determine the extent of transmission cycles in humans.
