The Department of Animal Husbandry has issued guidelines to the people and directed its staff to be on alert after bird flu cases were reported from Kozhikode district in Kerala. According to sources, the disease was confirmed among chicken in a farm in Kodiyathur grama panchayat, and at a private nursery in Vengeri within Kozhikode Corporation limits on Friday [6 Mar 2020].

There had been suspicion about the disease since Thursday [5 Mar 2020] when samples of the dead birds were tested at the department's regional lab in Kannur. It was confirmed through the tests conducted at the National Institute of High Security Diseases, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

Meetings involving higher officials were held at the state and district levels to take stock of the situation. Officials said that there is no cause for worry. Meanwhile, the Kodiyathur grama panchayat banned the functioning of chicken farms and chicken stalls, and the sale of birds and chicken dishes in hotels within its jurisdiction.

This is the 2nd instance of bird flu in Kerala in the past 5 years, as hundreds of ducks had been infected with the disease in the Kuttanad region of Alappuzha district.

[For the location of Kozhikode in the Indian state of Kerala, see map at https://tinyurl.com/vvhjdon. Earlier HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] outbreaks in India were concentrated in the sub-continent's north eastern regions (see the OIE global map presenting HPAI in poultry since November 2019 at https://tinyurl.com/tu7dplh; click on India and zoom in).

OIE's avian influenza portal presents periodic overviews of HPAI disease events (in poultry and non-poultry including wild birds) reported to the OIE's early warning system by its members. The most recent periodic report covers the period 25 Jan-14 Feb 2020. During the said period, all outbreaks of HPAI in poultry in Europe were caused by H5N8. In Asia's poultry, 5 strains were reported: H5N1, H5N6, H5N2, H5N5, and H5N8. The detailed report is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/HPAI_asof14022020_Final.pdf.
