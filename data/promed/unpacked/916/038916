highly pathogenic avian influenza risk in Southeast Asia. PNAS, 25

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus that emerged
in southern China in the mid-1990s has in recent years evolved into
the 1st HPAI panzootic. In many countries where the virus was
detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other
countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control
efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the
continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic
ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice
cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on
separate studies carried out in Thailand and Viet Nam. In addition,
recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice
cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing.
This article analyses the statistical association between the
recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of 5 key environmental
variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers,
duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for 3 synchronous epidemic
waves in Thailand and Viet Nam. A consistent pattern emerges
suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human
population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively
low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based
on the 2nd epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its
predictive power when extrapolated to Viet Nam, which supports its
application to other countries with similar agro-ecological
conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential
application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.

UN links ducks, people, rice paddies for bird flu
-------------------------------------------------
Concentrations of ducks, rice paddies, and people are primarily
responsible for outbreaks of potentially deadly bird flu across Asia,
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Wednesday [26 Mar
2008]. "Rather than chickens, (these) are the major factors behind
outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in Thailand and
Viet Nam, and are probably behind outbreak persistence in other
countries of the region such as Cambodia and Laos," said a report by
the Rome-based agency.

It said a group of experts had studied a series of outbreaks between
early 2004 and late 2005 under senior FAO veterinary officer Jan
Slingenbergh, publishing its findings in the latest issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States.
"We now know much better where and when to expect H5N1 flare-ups,"
Slingenbergh said. "With virus persistence becoming increasingly
confined to areas with intensive rice-duck agriculture in eastern and
southeastern Asia, evolution of the H5N1 virus may become easier to predict."

By comparing satellite mapping of rice paddies, to show the
concentration of ducks feeding on leftover grains in harvested
fields, to outbreak timelines, the researchers were able to draw a
link and pinpoint periods when the risk of the virus spreading is at
its greatest. The role played by people comes in terms of population
density, with people numbers influencing duck movement. "In Thailand,
for example, the proportion of young ducks in flocks was found to
peak in September-October," the report said. "These rapidly growing
young ducks can therefore benefit from the peak of the rice harvest
in November-December." It added: "Meat ducks are slaughtered around
the Chinese New Year (in January or February, depending on the year),
a time when the volume of sales-related duck movement rises considerably."

90 percent of the world's 1044 billion domestic ducks are in Asia,
with 775 million of them, or about 75 percent, in China and Viet Nam.

In 2005, Thailand introduced the need for animal health certificates
for duck farmers, along with subsidies for indoor keeping of the
birds, feeds and enclosure building. "Together, these measures
stopped the H5N1 transmission cycle and since late 2005, Thailand has
suffered only sporadic outbreaks," the report noted.

Slingenbergh added that indiscriminate mass vaccination -- which the
authors found had little long-term effect in Viet Nam, for example --
should be replaced by such targeted disease control measures working
off local rice-duck calendars and known hotspots.
