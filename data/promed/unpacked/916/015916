Two horses were tested positive for glanders disease in Jhajjar district of Haryana. Glanders, a contagious disease, primarily affects horses. It is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. "Glanders among equines is incurable. Horses that contracted the disease will be euthanised. [A total of] 143 blood samples were sent for testing," said Dr Manish Dabas, Deputy Director, Animal husbandry.

[Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form, known as "farcy", also occurs. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. There are no vaccines.

Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95% within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. In fact, fatal cases, which were known to be common, have become rather uncommon.

India leads the list of remaining glanders-endemic countries.
