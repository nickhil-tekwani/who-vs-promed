RVF [Rift Valley fever] disease back in Asir?
---------------------------------------------
A case of a 40-year-old Bangladeshi worker who has been admitted into
the ICU [intensive care unit] in a private hospital in Asir region
with suspected laboratory characteristics of the Rift Valley fever
(RVF) has brought back harsh memories of the early reports of the
outbreak of the disease in Jizan, border city with Yemen, in
September 2000. The man was initially diagnosed with an unknown type
of fever and elevated liver enzyme levels, both indicators of the RVF.

The Asir Agriculture Department has recently acted on media reports
of suspected cattle infected with the disease in different villages
in the region by sending specimens from there for lab analysis in
Riyadh for immunoglobulin M (IgM). The lab tests were positive for
IgM, antibody to Rift Valley fever virus in domestic ruminants.

"There are strong suspicions of the RVF outbreak again in the region,
but they are still not confirmed," said Mubark Al-Mutalqah, director
of the Asir Agriculture Department. The symptoms could be either a
real viral infection or a side effect of the antibody injection
previously used on the animals to ward off the virus, he said. "We
are still waiting for the final lab reports from the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of Agriculture to confirm the source of the
IgM as we are closely monitoring the area," he said.

If the disease were confirmed, the government agencies would work
hard to combat it through sending planes to spray insecticide to kill
the mosquitoes, which are thought to be spreading the disease. RVF is
a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease affecting domestic ungulates
(especially goats and sheep) characterized by large epizootics during
periods of heavy rainfall with associated outbreaks in humans. Most
human infection is associated with an uncomplicated febrile illness
or is unapparent.

More severe complications include retinitis, hepatitis, renal
failure, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and death. According to
recent research, if the disease breaks out, it may be transmitted in
an approximately 600 km (373 mi) area, including the flood plains of
the wadis [valleys] extending from the Sarawat mountains to the Red
Sea coastal plains. The duration from disease onset to
hospitalization is 3.3 days and the average time from disease onset
to death is 6.3 days. [References to the said data -- probably
derived from previous Saudi observations -- will be appreciated. In
any event, the generally acceptable data on case fatality rate of RVF
in humans does not exceed 1-2 percent. - Mod.AS]

A Health Ministry report said Rift Valley fever killed 124 people in
the Kingdom between September 2000 and May 2001, while 760 of the 884
infected people recovered.

The Kingdom has since either banned or carefully examined the import
of livestock from several African countries as well as from Yemen.

Although Rift Valley Fever was first identified in 1930, after an
epidemic among sheep in Kenya, it has also affected Egypt,
Madagascar, Mauritania, and Somalia, according to the World Health
Organization.

In case the described suspected human RVF case is confirmed, this is
bad news since it may be indicative of RVF virus circulation in Saudi
Arabia, provided the patient was not infected elsewhere (East
Africa?). If confirmed, RVF must already have involved (undetected or
unreported) infections in ruminants, particularly sheep and goats.
The virus can spread by vectors (mosquitoes) and by exposure of
humans or susceptible animals to infected tissues.

The most striking features, expected in (unvaccinated) ruminants, are
mass abortions and mortality of offspring (which -- in the most
susceptible animals, namely lambs younger than 4 weeks -- may reach
almost 100 percent). The timing of the current event is most
unfortunate: the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca) is due to start in
just 3 days, on 6 Dec 2008. The Eid-ul-Adha (Festival of the
Sacrifice), when millions of ruminants will be slaughtered, is due on
8 Dec 2008. The expected influx of over 2 million pilgrims for the
Hajj, as well as the presence of a large migrant population, generate
high human and animal traffic that present a challenging agenda for
public health. Returning pilgrims may, if infected, transfer the
virus to other regions.

The Saudi authorities are expected to take the appropriate measures
avoiding the introduction into Mecca of animals from the south and
prescribing intensive veterinary inspection of the slaughtering
process, particularly antemortem inspections. Infection of humans
with the RVF virus may occur by their exposure to organs,
particularly blood, of viraemic animals. Reportedly, the exposure of
humans to aerosols in slaughtering facilities and home slaughtering,
during the major 1977-78 epizootic in Egypt, was a main contributor
to the very high morbidity and mortality observed.

The potential risks within this period as well as other peculiar
ecological factors have been discussed in the paper, "The evolving
transmission pattern of Rift Valley fever in the Arabian peninsula"
by Shamsudeen F Fagbo, Ann N Y Acad Sci 969: 201-4 (2002) (abstract
available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381591?dopt=Abstract>).

Saudi Arabia initially reported the presence of RVF during 2000 and
the 1st quarter of 2001. Saudi investigators raised later the
speculation that the RVF virus had been introduced into the Arabian
peninsula earlier, namely in 1997/1998 during the RVF epidemic in
East Africa, via introduction of infected imported livestock or via
windborne infected mosquitoes, and that climatic conditions have
promoted sufficient vector populations to support transmission in
Saudi Arabia and Yemen. (See A Madani et al: "Rift Valley Fever
Epidemic in Saudi Arabia: Epidemiological, Clinical and Laboratory
Characteristics". Clin Infect Dis. 2003 Oct 15; 37(8):1084-92;
abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14523773>).

In October 2004, the Saudi authorities reported to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) that RVF seropositive cases were
detected in 4 sheep flocks, without any clinical evidence either on
the positive cases or on the contact animals. The Saudi 2007 report
to the OIE indicates "confirmed infection without clinical cases"
(animal species not specified). Has the disease become endemic in
certain regions?

RVF vaccination is, reportedly, carried out in Saudi Arabia,
involving sheep, goats, cattle, and camels (2007 data). Vaccination
figures, (geographic and population) coverage, and details of the
vaccine applied (killed or live attenuated?) will be helpful.

Official confirmation or -- hopefully -- denial of the suspected
human cases, and results of recent surveillance in animals, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
