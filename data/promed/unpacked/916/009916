Scientists may have found out what makes the H5N1 influenza virus so deadly
-- bird flu viruses have a gene that may make them especially destructive
to cells, U.S. researchers reported on Thu 26 Jan 2006.
All the avian influenza viruses studied by a team at St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis had the gene and none of the human influenza
viruses did, they said.
People infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus in Viet Nam and Thailand had
the "avian" version of the influenza virus, as did the victims of the 1918
influenza pandemic, which killed tens of millions of people globally, the
researchers said. But the [human] influenza viruses that cause the normal
seasonal human misery, and those that caused the less deadly 1957 and 1968
human influenza pandemics, do not carry the avian genes.
These findings, published in the journal Science, may provide a way to
identify the more dangerous viruses and may also help companies trying to
make better flu drugs, said Clayton Naeve, the St. Jude's team leader. "We
documented a clear difference between avian viruses and human viruses. [But
much more work will be required] to demonstrate this actually contributes
to virulence in nature," Naeve said in an interview.
Naeve and his colleagues have been working to sequence the genomes of all
known influenza viruses. No one has done this, even though [influenza A]
viruses have just 8 genes and are relatively simple organisms, the
researchers said. "This is information we expect will be very important in
understanding the attributes of this virus -- how it will cross from birds
to humans. We are releasing these data so that other investigators
worldwide can mine it for information," he said. The researchers used a
collection of samples of 11 000 influenza viruses, including 7000 avian
influenza viruses, assembled by St. Jude's Dr. Robert Webster over a period
of 30 years. "We have sequenced a diverse sampling of 336 avian influenza
viruses from this collection including isolates from ducks, gulls,
shorebirds and poultry collected in North American, Eurasian, and
Australasian countries, primarily during the years 1976 to 2004," the
researchers said.
The H5N1 virus has been found in birds for decades but it was seen first to
infect people in 1997, in Hong Kong. Since it resurfaced in 2003, it has
infected at least 152 people and killed 83 of them, according to the World
Health Organization. It has killed or forced the culling of hundreds of
millions of birds. H5N1 does not yet pass easily from person to person but
experts fear it will mutate into a form that does so, sparking a pandemic
that could kill millions or tens of millions.
Clayton Naeve's team may have identified 2 proteins to watch. They are
called NS1 and NS2, for non-structural protein 1 and non-structural protein
2, and they are made only once the virus has infected a cell. The avian
versions seem to allow the virus to do much more damage to a cell than the
human versions of NS1 and NS2, Naeve said. "We were surprised to see a lot
of variation in this NS protein[s]. That was the clue. We felt it must be
playing an important biological role," he said.
It is possible that a mutation that would allow a flu virus to more easily
infect people will weaken the NS protein, Naeve said. But no one knows. "As
time progresses one might expect that signature to change into a less
virulent form," he said, or it may not, as was apparently the case in 1918.
"I don't think anybody can predict at this time what the future holds for
the H5 outbreaks. It's pretty scary," Naeve said.

Unique resources at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital let researchers
generate a "gold mine" of data to track evolution of avian influenza virus
genes and understand how they cooperate to cause disease. Investigators at
St. Jude's have completed the first large-scale study of avian influenza
virus genomes, thereby doubling the amount of genetic information available
on the genes and proteins of these viruses. The results of the project
could lead to major insights into the avian influenza virus known as H5N1,
the researchers said. H5N1 is the bird flu virus currently infecting humans
in Asia and Eastern Europe, and flu experts fear it could mutate in a way
that would allow it to cause a worldwide pandemic in humans.
"These studies provide the first fundamental insight into the evolution of
influenza viruses in nature -- the source of all influenza viruses that
affect humans, domestic animals and birds," said Dr.Robert G. Webster, a
member of the Infectious Diseases Department and holder of the Rose Marie
Thomas Chair at St. Jude. "This information is a true gold mine, and we are
inviting all of the miners to help us unlock the secrets of influenza."
Webster is an internationally renowned expert on avian influenza viruses
and a co-author of the report that appears in the 27 Jan 2006 issue of Science.
St. Jude was uniquely positioned to conduct these studies because it houses
Webster's large collection of bird flu viruses collected over several
decades. The hospital is also home to St. Jude's Hartwell Center for
Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, which provided the necessary expertise
and biotechnology resources; and its supercomputer has the power needed to
conduct these studies.
"Despite the major threat to human health posed by these viruses, there was
very little information available on the entire genomes of avian influenza
viruses," said Dr. Clayton Naeve, Director of St. Jude's Hartwell Center.
"The St. Jude Influenza Virus Genome project provides a major contribution
to our understanding of H5N1 and other bird flu viruses. Now we're in a
much better position to understand what makes these viruses tick. And that
could help us learn how to control the avian influenza viruses that
threaten humans." Naeve is senior author of the report in Science.
The project produced 70 million bases of sequence information leading to
DNA sequences for 2196 genes and 169 complete bird flu genomes from the St.
Jude collection, including representatives of all known subtypes of the
virus including H5 bird flu. Preliminary analysis of these data and
development of new analysis software has led to the discovery of new forms
of bird flu genes, how these viruses evolve through time, and the
identification of genes that travel together through evolution. The St.
Jude research also made an intriguing discovery that avian influenza
viruses have a particular molecular feature that human influenza viruses do
not have, which may cause them to be more toxic when infecting human cells.
"The major accomplishment of this project is that it gives the scientific
community significantly more new data and analytical tools to use in the
study of these potentially very dangerous viruses," said Dr. John C.
Obenauer, a Bioinformatics associate research scientist at St. Jude's
Hartwell Center. "In the future, that might lead to effective strategies
for controlling outbreaks of these viruses in birds and humans." This work
was primarily funded by ALSAC, the St. Jude fund-raising arm, with
additional support from the National Institutes of Health, a Cancer Center
Support grant and the Hartwell Foundation.

[The paper referred to above is published in the 26 Jan 2006 issue of
Science (DOI: 10.1126/science.1121586) and is entitled: Large-Scale
Sequence Analysis of Avian Influenza Isolates. The authors are John C.

Determination of the complete sequences of the genomes of 169 influenza A
viruses, including representatives of all known subtypes, is a very
significant achievement, providing a new database for analysis of the
biological properties of influenza A viruses. The systematic
distinctiveness of avian and mammalian influenza A viruses revealed by
these data suggests that the reassortment of genome subunits to produce a
novel human pandemic virus is likely to be a rarer event than generally
assumed.
Interestingly, the data point to the importance of the NS1 and NS2 gene
products in determining severity of cytopathogenicity and by inference
indicate that these proteins may play a role in virulence and/or host range
in vivo. The NS1 and NS2 proteins are both encoded in segment 8 of the
genome of influenza A virus. NS1 and NS2 share 10 amino terminal residues,
including the terminal methionine, and the NS2 protein is derived by mRNA
splicing from segment 8 RNA. NS1 inhibits transport of mRNA from the
infected cell nucleus and acts as an inhibitor of interferon, whereas NS2
functions as a nuclear export protein. - Mod.CP]
