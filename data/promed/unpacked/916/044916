Disappointing BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) figures for January
were issued yesterday [31 Jan 2000, showing there were 14 cases of the
disease, 1 more than in January 1999. The figures come after the highest
annual total on record in the Republic last year, when 95 cases were
recorded in the national herd.
But while the January figures were high, the age profile of the cattle was
moving in the right direction. None of the animals which developed BSE was
younger than 5 years. This would appear to indicate controls to prevent new
outbreaks of the disease have been successful, and the Department of
Agriculture is predicting a falloff in cases in the coming year.
Two of the cows were aged 8; 3 were 7; 5 were 6-year-olds; and the
remaining 4 were aged 5 years, according to a Department spokesman. Three
of the infected animals came from farms in Cork, 2 were found on Monaghan
farms, two in Wexford and two in Galway, and there was 1 case each in Cos
Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth, Meath and Leitrim.
The Department said 10 of the animals came from dairy herds, with the rest
from beef-producing suckler herds. The January cases bring the total number
of cases of the disease, first identified here in 1989, to 461 over the
10-year period.
Under the Government's slaughter-all policy, every animal on a farm where
the disease is identified is slaughtered despite there being no evidence
the disease can be spread from animal to animal. Contamination of animal
feedstuff has been identified as the cause of the disease, which has
devastated the British dairy herd. It is believed the Irish cases were
caused by contaminated feed being imported and fed to cows here.
