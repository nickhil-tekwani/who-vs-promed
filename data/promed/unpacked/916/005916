The Public Health Veterinary Services (PHVS) Unit said there had been 28
cases of rabies reported within 8 months of this year [2010].

PHVS chief Dr PL Harischandra said yesterday [7 Sep 2010] that 4 of the
cases reported had been from the Gampaha District. 3 were from Kurunegala
[district] and 3 from Galle [district], he said. However, Polonnaruwa,
Hambantota, and Nuwara Eliya [districts] were free of rabies.

The PHVS has been able to sterilise 50 000 bitches in all parts of the
country during the 8 months of this year [2010]. A more humanitarian method
was advocated to control rabies by sterilising stray dogs. "Our aim is to
control the disease by controlling the number of strays in the country, Dr
Harischandra added.

[If the number of human rabies cases in Sri Lanka maintains the level of
2010's 1st 8 months (28), this may mean an encouraging decrease, compared
with previous years (OIE figures 55, 59, and a preliminary 56, respectively
for 2007, 2008, and 2009). New stray dog control guidelines were adopted by
the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2009. The guidelines, in
Chapter 7.7 of the International Terrestrial Animal Health Code --
including the paragraph "Reproductive control" -- are available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.7.7.htm>.

One of the basic requirements for an effective control is "estimating the
existing number, distribution and ecology" of the stray dog population. It
will be interesting to note if the 50 000 sterilised bitches are strays. -
