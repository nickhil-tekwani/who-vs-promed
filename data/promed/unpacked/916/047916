Re: >[... When are health workers going to be trained to understand that
public health
measures -- monitoring & prevention -- are at least as important as
treatment? - Mod.JW>
The answer to your query is education and commitment.
We in education do maybe at best only a fair job in pointing out to the
health professionals in the education system the importance of, and their
responsibility for, notifing the appropriate public health officials about
the occurrence of a reportable disease.
Let us assume the system is reporter friendly (when medical records are all
computerized from the time the patient is seen to him or her being cured
will be an ultrafriendly system), the health care provider still has to be
shown the importance of reporting -- importance to his or her practice, to
the patient, and to the community. The commitment is for the health care
provider and the local public health officials to work together to control
and prevent disease.
We all have to recognize the advantages of prevention as distinct from cure.
I might emphasize that CDC constantly addresses these problems and has
developed a great perspective on public health surveillance.

The addition of a requirement for medical diagnostic laboratories to report
positive tests to health departments has worked very well for STD's [in
Canada. Might this not be extended to other diagnoses?
