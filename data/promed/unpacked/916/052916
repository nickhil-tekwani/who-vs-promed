The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) today [4 Aug 2021] confirmed that 2 white-tailed deer in the town of Esopus, Ulster County had died after contracting epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). DEC is currently following up on reports of several other dead deer in Dutchess, Ulster, and Westchester counties.

EHD virus is an often fatal disease of deer transmitted by biting midges, small bugs often called 'no-see-ums' or 'punkies'. The disease is not spread from deer to deer and humans cannot be infected by deer or bites from midges.

The EHD virus was first confirmed in New York in 2007 with relatively small outbreaks in Albany, Rensselaer, and Niagara counties, and in Rockland County in 2011. From early September to late October 2020, a large EHD outbreak occurred in the lower Hudson Valley, centered in Putnam and Orange counties, with an estimated 1500 deer mortalities.

Once infected with EHD, deer usually die within 36 hours. EHD outbreaks are commonest in the late summer and early fall when midges are abundant. EHD signs include fever, hemorrhage in muscle or organs, and swelling of the head, neck, tongue, and lips. A deer infected with EHD may appear lame or dehydrated. Frequently, infected deer will seek out water sources and many succumb near a water source. There is no treatment or means to prevent EHD. The dead deer do not serve as a source of infection for other animals.

EHD outbreaks do not have a significant long-term impact on deer populations, but deer mortality can be intense in small geographic areas. EHD is endemic in the southern states where there are annual outbreaks, so some southern deer have developed immunity. In the northeast, EHD outbreaks occur sporadically and deer in New York have no immunity to this virus. Consequently, most EHD-infected deer in New York are expected to die. In the north, the 1st hard frost kills the midges that transmit the disease, ending the EHD outbreak.

Sightings of sick or dying deer should be reported to the nearest DEC Regional Office [https://www.dec.ny.gov/about/558.html] or environmental conservation police officer [https://www.dec.ny.gov/about/28461.html]. DEC will collect samples from deer and analyze data from deer reports to determine the extent of the outbreak.

Department of Agriculture and Markets reminds veterinarians in the region to be aware of the disease and to report suspicious cases among captive deer.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group or bluetongue virus (BTV) group (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_O. hemionus_) in the United States. In North America, there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although whitetail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886.

EHDV and BTV are transmitted between their ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Available data suggest that the species of _Culicoides_ that transmit EHDV are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as for BTV.

_C. variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector in North America for transmission of EHD in nature. "A deer must be bitten by a midge carrying the virus to become infected. The disease is not transmitted directly from one deer to another but must go through the insect vector. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and have ceased within 2 weeks of the onset of frost, which kills the midge.

"Experimentally, the disease can be transmitted to susceptible deer by the inoculation of virus-laden material from infected deer by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or oral routes."

"Clinical signs
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar," although molecularly they are not the same disease.

"White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and fever (affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature) Eight to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate and die.

"Pathology
The gross and histological lesions of EHD have been characterized by, as its name implies, extensive hemorrhage. Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel walls. The hemorrhages range from pinpoint to massive in size and involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Generalized edema and increased pericardial fluid are consistently found in EHD. These changes also reflect the widespread interference with normal blood circulation.

"The virus can be recovered from a variety of tissues of animals which have succumbed to EHD. These include blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, and muscle.

"Diagnosis
A combination of case history, characteristic signs and lesions, and the isolation of the virus is necessary for a diagnosis of EHD. Useful aids in obtaining a diagnosis are the epizootic nature of the disease, its seasonal occurrence, its spectacular hemorrhagic lesions, and the extensive edema. Because of the similarity of its symptoms to other diseases, such as bluetongue and malignant catarrhal fever, the isolation and identification of the virus are essential.

"Methods to be used for virus isolation are inoculation of cell cultures, inoculation of susceptible sheep or deer combined with serologic monitoring, and intravenous inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs.

"Treatment and control
There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently impossible, impractical, and unwarranted.

"Significance
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect on the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics that do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas.

"Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals, most commonly hoofstock, but rarely causes disease.

"The edibility of the venison is not impacted by the disease. There is no evidence that humans can contract the EHD virus either from the midge or from handling and eating venison.

"Pets and wildlife cannot be infected either by midges or from EHD-infected deer carcasses."
