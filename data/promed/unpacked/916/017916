What you need to know:
- In 2017, Crimean-Congo fever broke out in Nakaseke and Kiboga districts, claiming 8 lives.
- According to the World Health Organisation, the fever is a disease spread widely and caused by a tick-borne virus.
- The animals become infected by the bite of the infected tick and the virus remains in the animal's bloodstream.

Health officials have placed Nakasongola on high alert after the district registered a Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever case that claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy on Tuesday [29 Nov 2022].

The deceased was a Primary Six pupil and a resident of Kikoiro village in Lwampanga sub-county. Blood samples taken to Entebbe Hospital on Tuesday [29 Nov 2022] confirmed the disease.

Dr Agaba Byamukama, the district health officer, told this publication yesterday [1 Dec 2022] that more than 4 facilities that handled the case couldn't detect the fever.

"The health teams from Entebbe Hospital handled the body professionally and the burial was conducted by a health burial team on Tuesday. We are undertaking the contact listing for monitoring," he said.

"Unfortunately, the patient was handled by various health facilities but we are already in contact with the respective health facilities to ensure contact listing and further management of the condition," Dr Byamukama said.

Health officials said the 12-year-old went through Lwampanga Health Centre IV, Nakasongola Health Centre IV, Kiwoko Hospital in Nakaseke District, Mulago National Referral Hospital, and ended up at Entebbe Hospital where he died.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Saleh Kamba, confirmed the district health teams had been joined by the veterinary office to help the field teams establish the origin of the disease with guidance from the Ministry of Health.

"We don't want to find ourselves in a risky situation. Fortunately, the residents that had tried to disorganise the safe handling of the body were later calmed down," he said.

[Nakasongola District is located in the Central Region of Uganda.

At present, there is an active Ebola virus disease outbreak in Uganda. Confirmed cases have been reported from Kampala, Kassanda, Masaka, Mubende, and Wakiso districts in the Central Region; Bunyangabu, Kagadi, and Kyegegwa districts in the Western Region; and Jinja District in the Eastern Region.

In the African region including Uganda, there are many types of viral hemorrhagic fevers which continue to pose serious health risks: Marburg and Ebola haemorrhagic fevers, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Lassa fever, yellow fever, and the newly emergent arenavirus. With this wide range of differential diagnoses, it is essential that all cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome, whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified so that necessary public health measures can be implemented as soon as possible. - Mod.UBA
