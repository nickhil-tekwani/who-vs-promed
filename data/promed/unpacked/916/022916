Peruvian Health Minister Alejandro Aguinaga said Sunday that the poisoning
that killed 24 children was probably due to "bad handling" of food given to
them for breakfast last Friday at their school in the Andean village of
Taucamarca.
Investigations by the district attorney, police and technicians with the
Health Ministry determined that the children's deaths were due to poisoning
by ingesting a toxic phosphorus substance mixed in with the milk they drank.
The Health minister said that there must have been "bad handling" of the
milk, which led to it being mixed with the insecticide that contained the
poisonous substances.
Presidential chief of staff Edgardo Mosqueira explained that the
investigation established that the food given to the students came in good
condition from the factory where it was prepared.
The tragedy, which has affected the entire country, took place in the
Andean village of Taucamarca, some 70 kilometers (44 miles) southeast of
Cusco, which is a difficult place to reach.
Sectors of the political opposition are demanding a thorough investigation
of the case to determine responsibilities and the sanctioning of the guilty
parties.
School breakfasts are given to the country's schools by the state
Compensation and Social Development Fund to help support children from poor
families.
