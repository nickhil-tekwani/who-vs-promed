Officials warn residents to be aware of any unusual behavior in raccoons, as an outbreak of canine distemper has affected several in the areas of Point Pleasant Beach, Point Pleasant and Bay Head. Canine distemper is a "contagious and serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems of puppies and dogs," according to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation (AVMF). "The virus can also be found in wildlife such as foxes, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, mink and ferrets and has been reported in lions, tigers, leopards and other wild cats as well as seals."

The virus can be transferred through animal coughs and sneezes, shared food and water bowls, and animal equipment, according to AVMF. Symptoms of the virus include discharge from the eyes and nose, fever, coughing, vomiting, convulsions, circling behavior, paralysis and hardening of the footpads, according to AVMF.

Those with puppies younger than 4 months old or dogs that have not been vaccinated should be aware that these animals have a higher risk of contracting the disease. As the outbreak has been spotted in local raccoons, officials warn residents to keep an eye out for unusual raccoon behavior, such as being outside during the day.

Residents should contact police if they see a raccoon acting abnormally; pet owners should ensure their animals are up to date on vaccinations. So far, 5 raccoons have been euthanized in the borough due to the outbreak, according to Point Pleasant Beach officials.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of "shyness"; animals can seem "dumb" and/or "friendly." Animals showing similar behavioral signs might be rabid. It is important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
