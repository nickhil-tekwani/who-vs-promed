Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (abbreviated as SNNPR), with an estimated population of 14.9 million people in 2007, is one of the 9 ethnic divisions (kililoch) of Ethiopia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nations,_Nationalities,_and_Peoples'_Region). SNNPR, Ethiopia's most rural region, is located in southwestern Ethiopia. The SNNPR contains over 45 indigenous ethnic groups. Woredas are administrative divisions of Ethiopia. Konso woreda is a special woreda, an administrative subdivision that is similar to an autonomous area, named after the Konso people. A map showing its location can be found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Ethiopia_zone_region.jpg. Alle woreda became newly independent from Konso woreda and Dirashe woreda in January 2011 (http://wikimapia.org/30613894/Golango-Alle-Woreda). - Mod.ML
