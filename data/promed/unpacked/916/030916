Scattered reports of white-tailed deer being found dead in recent
weeks in parts of Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks Region
6 have prompted state biologists to enlist the help of landowners and hunters.

"Folks who are out in the field and notice deer that have recently
died from unknown causes are asked to call our office in Glasgow at
to report the number of animals and the exact location," said Region
6 Wildlife program manager Mark Sullivan.

"We've been awaiting the results of testing on several deer that have
recently been found, to determine whether they've died from epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or some other traceable cause," Sullivan
said. "We just learned that a sample from one of the deer tested
positive for EHD. There doesn't appear to be reason for alarm, but we
are seeing a few deer dying rather suspiciously. With help from the
public, we hope to determine the extent of the incidents. It may not
be widespread at all."

EHD is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild
ruminants, especially white-tailed deer. The disease, characterized
by extensive hemorrhaging, fever, and a resultant urge to be near or
even immersed in temperature-controlling fresh water, has been
responsible for significant die-offs over the years in the northern
United States and southern Canada.

A similar hemorrhagic disease commonly called bluetongue also occurs
throughout the US and Canada, but the 2 diseases are clinically
different. Both diseases can affect mule deer and pronghorn antelope,
but not as commonly as white-tailed deer.

Outbreaks of EHD and bluetongue most commonly occur during the summer
and early fall, and animals typically develop signs of EHD about a
week after exposure. Along with dead deer, landowners and hunters are
asked to watch for deer that have lost their fear of humans, may be
weak and salivating excessively, or are semiconscious.

In cases of bluetongue, hemorrhaging and lack of oxygen in the blood
may result in blue coloration in the animal's mouth. Overall, the
hemorrhages from these diseases range widely in size and involve a
variety of different tissues and organs. Infected animals usually die
within 36 hours of showing signs.

At this point there is no known treatment or control of these
diseases, which researchers say have not been found to affect humans.
EHD is spread by tiny biting flies, so a hard frost that kills these
insects ends the spread of any ongoing outbreaks.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is not uncommon in many states.
EHD is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild
ruminants. This malady, characterized by extensive hemorrhages, has
been responsible for significant epizootics in deer in the northern
United States and southern Canada. A similar hemorrhagic disease
called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2 diseases are
antigenically different, although there are similar clinical signs.

The 1st occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in
1955, when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_) succumbed in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was
considered a new disease of deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic
disease" was suggested to describe its main clinical and pathological features.

Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily
among white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O.
hemionus_) and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have also
succumbed.

The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_
biting fly or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly
incriminated vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer (as in Michigan, New
Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single epizootics that do not
recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as experienced in
South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the disease
appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October)
and have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.

Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer
develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A consistent
characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially
lose their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, develop rapid pulse and respiration, and
finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the
blood result in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name
"bluetongue." Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of
observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.

The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by
extensive hemorrhage, ranging from pinpoint to massive in size, and
involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs
appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved
being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract.
Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the
blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel walls.

Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant
effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers
drastically. Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild
ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals but rarely
causes disease. Presently there is no evidence that the virus crosses
into humans.
