New corky bark-like syndrome in vines with Australian Shiraz disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'Shiraz' is the principal wine grape variety in Australia. Unfortunately, it is sensitive to a number of viruses. In 2004, we reported the association of _Grapevine virus A_ (GVA, genus _Vitivirus_) with a syndrome in Shiraz which is spreading in South Australia. Infected plants show delayed growth in spring, reddening of leaves, green canes and a rubbery texture in autumn. The disease was named Australian Shiraz disease (ASD). A similar disease in Shiraz vines involving GVA as well as _Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3_ has been reported from South Africa, but its exact aetiology is not known.

ASD incidence in Australian samples received by us for general virus testing increased from 3.4 per cent in 2001 (728 samples) to 16.6 per cent in 2004 (1279 samples). Yield losses of up to 98 per cent within 6 years of grafting Shiraz onto established Chardonnay root stocks have been observed.

Since 2014, additional symptoms of swollen cracks on stems resembling corky bark disease (CB) have been noted in ASD vines in some local vineyards, while other vineyards continue to exhibit the original ASD symptoms only. CB has been reported to be associated with _Grapevine virus B_ (GVB, genus _Vitivirus_), but this virus could not be detected in the affected ASD vines. These only contained GVA, as well as one latent virus (_Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus_) which was also present in asymptomatic vines.

We conclude that CB symptoms cannot generally be considered a reliable indicator for the presence of GVB. CB is under quarantine in Australia and any diseased imported material is destroyed. However, the unequivocal association of GVB with CB now must be questioned, as we have also previously detected symptomless isolates of this virus in Australia [ProMED-mail posts 19990618.1034, 19991006.1787].

Further research is needed to clarify the aetiology and epidemiology of bark cracking observed in ASD vines in Australia. Possible causes may include a new severe strain of GVA or an as yet unidentified additional infectious disease agent. Micrografting onto indicator varieties is being used to investigate if bark cracking without GVB can be replicated.

[Vitiviruses (type member GVA) are transmitted by mealy bug vectors (family Pseudococcidae), infected planting material and grafting. Members in the genus are implicated as causal agents of the grapevine rugose wood disease complex, which includes corky bark. An estimated yield loss of over 20 per cent has been attributed to GVA, depending on grape cultivar and location, even in asymptomatic infections. In some leafroll affected table grape cultivars, it may lead to decline and death of plants. Symptoms (corky bark) induced by GVB have been reported to differ for molecular variants of the virus (see links below).

The report above illustrates the importance of molecular quarantine testing even for pathogens that are already present in a country, since different strains may show significant variation in pathogenicity.
