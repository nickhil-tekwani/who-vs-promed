Outbreaks of Alternaria Brown Spot of Citrus in Brazil and Argentina.
N. A. R. Peres, Instituto Biológico, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; J. P. Agostini,
INTA, Montecarlo, Misiones, Argentina; and L. W. Timmer, University of
Florida, CREC, Lake Alfred. Plant Dis. 87:750, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0407-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 20 March 2003.
_Alternaria alternata_ (Fr.) Keissler causes lesions on leaves, twigs, and
fruit and reduces yield and fruit quality of many tangerines (_Citrus
reticulata_) and their hybrids (2). Severe outbreaks of Alternaria brown
spot were observed on 'Murcott' tangor (Citrus reticulata × Citrus
sinensis) trees in southern São Paulo, southern Minas Gerais states in
Brazil, and in Misiones and Corrientes provinces in Argentina.
A single diseased 'Fortune' tangerine tree was observed in a grove in
Misiones. On young leaves, brown-to-black lesions often expanded to cover
large parts of the leaf, causing abscission of young shoots and dieback of
twigs. Lesions were often surrounded by yellow halos. On fruit, darkspecks
from 0.2 to 0.5 cm were observed, and severe infection caused premature
fruit abscission.
Isolations were made on potato dextrose agar (PDA) after surface
sterilization of leaf and fruit tissues in 1.5 percent sodium hypochlorite
for 1 min. Plates were incubated at 27 C in the dark for 1 week. Isolated
colonies were olive brown to black, and the fungus was stimulated to form
conidia by scraping the surface of the mycelium. The pathogen was a typical
small-spored _Alternaria_ species, and the morphological characteristics of
the conidia and conidiophores fit the description of _A. alternata_.
Inoculation of 3 detached young shoots of 'Murcott' with a conidial
suspension (100 000 conidia per ml) confirmed pathogenicity of 3 isolates
obtained from widely separated groves in southern and eastern São Paulo
State in Brazil and one from Misiones Province in Argentina. A control
treatment with an equal number of shoots was sprayed with distilled water only.
After 48 h, all isolates caused dark lesions on the leaves, characteristic
of the disease. Symptoms were observed on inoculated, but not on control
shoots. Koch's postulates were satisfied by reisolation of the fungus from
symptomatic tissue in all cases.
Although Alternaria brown spot was reported previously in neighboring Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil on 'Dancy' and 'Ponkan' tangerines (1), serious disease
problems now occur on 'Murcott', an important commercial variety in the
major production area in Brazil.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of Alternaria brown spot in
Argentina.

[Alternaria brown spot, caused by _Alternaria alternata_ pv. _citri_,
affects Minneola tangelos, Dancy tangerines, Murcotts, and less frequently
Orlando tangelos, Novas, Lees, and Sunburst. In rare cases, it may also
infect grapefruit. Under severe disease conditions, the disease results in
extensive fruit drop and must be controlled on processing and fresh market
fruit. Copper-containing fungicides are effective for that purpose, but
development of copper-resistant strains through exposure to high
concentrations of fungicide may be a concern. -Mod.DH]
