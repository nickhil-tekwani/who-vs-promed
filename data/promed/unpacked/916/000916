4 _E. coli_ children in hospital
-----------------------------------
4 children with _E. coli_ [O157] infection are being treated in the
hospital, as the number of cases in the south Wales outbreak rose again to
115 across 32 schools.
A boy of 4 from the Cynon valley was airlifted to Alder Hey Hospital,
Liverpool on Saturday night, 24 Sep 2005. A boy and girl, both 9, are also
in stable condition in Alder Hey. A girl of 3 is "satisfactory" in Bristol.
New figures on Sun 25 Sep 2005 showed 25 people, mostly children, have been
admitted to a hospital in the past week.
The Alder Hey spokeswoman said a boy and girl with _E. coli_ infection had
been responding to treatment, and some improvement had been seen in another
boy admitted several days ago. The outbreak control team said more of the
new cases were acquired within families and from people who had eaten
cooked meat from premises other than schools.
Officials warned a further rise was likely but not because the outbreak was
still "live." They said the bacterium sometimes took more than a week to
present with symptoms.
The latest schools with infections are Ynyswen Infants, Treorchy, Rhondda
Cynon Taf, and Cwrt Rawlin Primary, Caerphilly, while Hawthorn Primary,
Pontypridd, was added on Sun 25 Sep 2005.
It has been linked to Bridgend meat supplier John Tudor and Son. The Food
Standards Agency has told any business which received cooked meat from the
company to withdraw it immediately and contact their local authority.
Officials have said there is no conclusive evidence that Tudor's is the
source of the infection. The company said it had had no previous hygiene
problems and is cooperating fully with investigators.
An emergency prohibition order has been taped to the company's premises
instructing the firm to stop trading.
The notice said a court was satisfied there was evidence to show "an
imminent risk of injury to health" from the "unsanitary condition of the
premises resulting from inadequate disinfection procedures."
It said a "vac packing process which allows cross-contamination" was "in an
unclean condition and which is located underneath the electronic fly-killer."
Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired an inquiry into Britain's worst
outbreak of the same strain, _E. coli_ O157, in Lanarkshire in 1996, has
suggested that the new inquiry could investigate prepared food that would
not be cooked.
17 people, mostly elderly, died and about 500 were affected in the Scottish
outbreak, which was traced to a butcher.

have been recognized, and, just as important, cases seem to be occurring
now with no relationship to the schools. - Mod.LL]
