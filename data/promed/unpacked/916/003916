In in a community of the Porongo municipality, Santa Cruz department [state of province equivalent], in the past 3 days positive animal rabies cases have been registered, leading authorities to intensify the vaccination campaign, the ecological Sistema radio of the Red Erbol reported.

Rabies cases have been detected in a horse and 2 dogs in the Los Batos community, where, despite this, the people do not contribute to the animal vaccination effort undertaken by the San Juan Bautista health service and departmental Health Services (SEDES).

The local authorities stated that the vaccination campaign will be increased up to next week so that the animal owners will finally be aware [of the problem] and do the vaccinations to avoid disease [virus] transmission to humans.

[Rabies in dogs, occasionally with transmission to humans, has been occurring sporadically in Bolivia over the past 6 months. An intensive vaccination campaign in the area will be helpful in reducing the risk of further transmission to domestic animals and humans. One hopes that the public education effort will improve vaccination compliance by animal owners. The origin of the equine case is not stated. It could be from the bite of infected dogs or from being fed upon by vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) infected with rabies virus in this tropical area.
