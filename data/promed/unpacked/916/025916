Several cases of whooping cough were detected in Washington County, Indiana earlier this week. The health department says 3 people, 2 juveniles and an adult, are being treated with antimicrobials for the disease. Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, can cause coughing fits which can lead to ongoing breathing issues and in some cases can also lead to pneumonia and seizures. Generally, it is milder in children and adults. However, health leaders say it can be very dangerous for infants.

"It can easily spread," says Peggy Scott with the Washington County Health Department, "You need to protect those who can't get their vaccine or are too young to complete their vaccine."

Of the 3 cases in Washington County, 2 were students in school. One of those students is in elementary school in the Salem Community School District. Letters went home with parents of students in the district warning them that another student had tested positive.

Health officials today [6 Jan 2015] said Walla Walla County is experiencing a greatly increased number of cases of pertussis, best known as whooping cough. "We're seeing pertussis in high school students. We've had a 5-month-old infant diagnosed, but we're now receiving a number of reports in adolescents," he said. "And that's particularly worrisome."

Today's pertussis immunization was developed to be safe for infants "but the immunity is not particularly long-lived," Crowder said. "We're trying to find a better vaccine for adolescents and adults."

Between January and November 2014, Alaska had 130 reported cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, according to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. September 2014 had the highest number of incidences, 38, followed by October 2014, with 22.

While a significant drop from the 356 cases reported in 2012, it was still significantly more than the 26 reported in 2011. Epidemiologist Louisa Castrodale said the large number of reported cases is likely a reflection of a growing baseline and increased screening.

Of the 130 cases reported, 92 were from Interior Alaska. Castrodale said the large percentage of pertussis from the Interior is likely due to increased screening after a confirmed case.

The number of whooping cough, or pertussis, cases reported in the California epidemic in 2014 has eclipsed 10 000, and the counting is still ongoing. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reports the preliminary numbers to be 10 831 cases with onset in 2014.

Los Angeles and San Diego have seen the most cases with nearly 2000 cases a piece reported.

In June 2014, health authorities declared pertussis and epidemic in the state. The last epidemic in California occurred in 2010 when the state experienced 9159 cases, the most in 6 decades; however, the overall incidence of pertussis has increased since the 1990s. In fact, pertussis incidence is higher than was reported in 2010 with a state rate of 28.35 cases per 100 000 population. Approximately 3.5 percent of all cases required hospitalization, with a quarter of them requiring intensive care treatment. 2 pediatric deaths were reported in 2014.

One reason for the increase is the use of acellular pertussis vaccines, which cause fewer reactions than the whole-cell vaccines that preceded them, but do not protect as long. Young infants are at greatest risk of hospitalization and death from pertussis, therefore pregnant women are encouraged to receive pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during the 3rd trimester of every pregnancy. Pertussis antibodies are transferred from vaccinated mothers to their infants and will help protect them until they are old enough to be vaccinated.

[5] California (Santa Barbara County) infant fatality
Date: Wed 14 Jan 2015

http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/01/14/santa-barbara-county-infant-dies-from-whooping-cough/


A newborn baby has died from whooping cough in Southern California, the 4th death since the beginning of 2014 as the state deals with an epidemic. The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department announced the death Tue 13 Jan 2015. It says the baby was 25 days old, caught the bacterial infection last year [2014] and died this month [January 2015].

The state Department of Public Health says 3 other infants died in 2014, including 2 who caught the illness in 2013. State health officials have recorded 10 831 cases that were contracted in 2014. It's the worst epidemic to hit the state in 7 decades. Authorities attribute the increase to better detection and to the use of new vaccines that have fewer side effects but also don't protect as long.

[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A recent publication confirms that safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
