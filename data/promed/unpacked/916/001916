[Soldiers working at Butembo airport who become infected could easily spread the virus to many individuals passing through for flights, to pick up or drop off passengers, to deliver goods. It might be a good practice to check temperatures of airport personnel every day when they arrive for work, and perhaps this is already being done. Although it would take extra effort, the consequences of having an infectious worker in a major transit center could be great.

We have been lucky with 2 threatening situations recently: this one with the soldiers, and the other being the patient who was cleared after being tested for the Ebola virus at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, PA (USA) on 6 Feb 2019. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 6 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 791, of which 737 are confirmed and 54 probable.
- In total, there were 492 deaths (438 confirmed and 54 probable) and 267 people recovered.
- 189 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Butembo and 1 in Kyondo.
- 4 new deaths of confirmed cases: 2 community deaths, including 1 in Butembo and 1 in Kyondo, and 2 deaths at Katwa ETC.

News of the response
Women's safety during the response
---------------------------------------
- The Ministry of Health is challenged by the circulation of messages on social networks alleging that women have been victims of sexual advances in exchange for work in the response to Ebola. Although local women's NGOs have already denounced some of these messages as rumors aimed at tarnishing the image of women working in the response, the Ministry of Health cannot ignore these allegations and takes them very seriously. Thus, the Ministry of Health asks people who have been victims or witnesses of such incidents to report them confidentially through the free numbers of the civil protection of North Kivu.
- The Ministry of Health recalls that all services related to the response to the Ebola outbreak (vaccination, treatment at the Ebola treatment center, psychological monitoring, dignified and secure burial, etc.) are fully free. Anyone who offers such services for payment in kind or in cash must be reported.
- In addition, recruitment procedures in the response respond to selection criteria based on professional competence and experience. Only a limited number of Ebola counterparts, identifiable through their official badge, have the capacity to recruit new people to the response. Thus, for safety reasons, it is recommended that women always ask the person claiming to be a recruiter to have an official badge confirming his or her position in the response, do not accept appointments outside the coordination offices of the response, and report any inappropriate behavior.

Vaccination
------------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 75 526 people have been vaccinated.

And this: Today staff at @MSF's #Ebola treatment center at Butembo began enrolling patients there in the clinical trial of experimental Ebola treatments. So MSF has officially joined the trial.

Two more health workers have been infected with #Ebola. This week's @WHO Disease Outbreak News puts the number now at 67; @WHOAFRO reported 65 earlier this week. (The DON says +5 because it's up 5 from last week.) The most recent death toll I saw was 22.]

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues with relatively high numbers of cases reported in recent weeks (see Fig. 1 at the source URL), and some encouraging signs.

As of 5 Feb 2019, 789 EVD cases (735 confirmed and 54 probable) have been reported, including 488 deaths (overall case fatality rate, 62%). Thus far, 267 people have been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 58% (454 of 788) were female and 30% (232 of 786) were less than 18 years of age, including 116 children under 5 years. In addition, 5 new health worker infections were reported in Katwa (4) and Kalunguta (1); overall, 67 health workers have been affected to date.

Figure 1 [at the source URL] shows confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 5 Feb 2019 (n = 789).

- Thu 31 Jan 2019. Women journalists
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, online trans., abridged, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5373

In Butembo, women journalists pledge to accompany Ebola response teams. Women gathered in the Congolese Union of Media Women made this commitment at the end of their meeting around the theme "The role of the female journalist in the fight against the Ebola virus disease." This is the theme that has nourished the UCOFEM-Butembo exchange, this Thu 31 Jan 2019.

Some recommendations have been made. Among other things, to increase the number of laboratories for a quick service when collecting samples, to consolidate the communication commission, to create transit centers because the patients are frustrated at Ebola treatment centers.

[This is the 1st time I have read that patients are frustrated at the treatment centers; I assume by the wait. The idea of transit centers might work well if rapid testing for Ebola virus could be done there. - Mod.LK
