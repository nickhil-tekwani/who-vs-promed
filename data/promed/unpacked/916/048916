China confirms 2nd human bird flu fatality since February [2009]
----------------------------------------------------------------
H5N1 bird flu claimed its 2nd human fatality in China this month [July
2009] when the Ministry of Health confirmed the death of a Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region man on Thursday [?9 Jul 2009]. The
41-year-old man in Nanning City developed fever and headache symptoms
on 12 Feb 2009 and died at 5 a.m. on 20 Feb 2009 after all rescue
measures proved ineffectual. Tests of the man were H5N1 positive, said
China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

On 18 Feb 2009, the Health Ministry confirmed a 22-year-old man in the
central Hunan Province had tested positive for H5N1. He had died on 24
Jan 2009.
