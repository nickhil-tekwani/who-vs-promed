68 new cases of cholera were reported in Limpopo yesterday [18 Jan
2009]. This brings to 2348 the total number of cases throughout South
Africa that have been reported since the outbreak of the disease in
November 2008.

Department of Health and Social Development spokesman Phuti Seloba
said that they were concerned at the rate at which the disease was
spreading in the province.

Cholera was 1st diagnosed when Zimbabwean victims of the water-borne
disease crossed the border to seek treatment.

Seloba said they were continuing with the campaign to educate
communities to ensure that people know what measures to take to deal
with the disease.
