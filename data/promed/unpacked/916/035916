"Isolation of Brucella species from cetaceans, seals and an otter"
G. Foster, K.L. Jahans, R.J. Reid, H.M. Ross
ABSTRACT
Brucella organisms which differed from the recognised species of the genus,
were isolated from nine seals, eight cetaceans and one otter. A method is
described for the isolation of Brucella species from sea mammals and the
first isolations of Brucella species are recorded from an Atlantic
white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), two striped dolphins (Stenella
coeruleoalba), a hooded seal (Cystophora cristata), a grey seal (Halichoerus
grypus) and a European otter (Lutra lutra). There were differences in the
culture media required for the primary isolation of the organisms and in
their dependency on carbon dioxide. Subcutaneous lesions, when present,
always yielded a confluent growth. The organisms were isolated from seven
of 14 spleen samples and also from the mammary glands, uterus, testes and
blood and the mandibular, gastric, iliac, sub-lumbar and colorectal lymph
nodes.
