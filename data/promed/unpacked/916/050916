In August 2016, _Plum pox virus_ (_Potyvirus_, PPV - EPPO A2 List) was found for the 1st time in the Republic of Korea. The presence of PPV-D has been confirmed in a peach tree (_Prunus persica_). Eradication measures have immediately been taken. The infected tree has been destroyed and a national survey will be carried out.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas, but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species. Strain PPV-D mentioned above infects peach, plum, and apricot.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools), and grafting, as well as by infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. For some PPV strains, resistant cultivars are available in several types of stone fruits. Specific molecular tests have been developed to distinguish viral strains.
