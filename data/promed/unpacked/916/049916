[1] Cholera - Chad (CDC Travel Advisory)
Date: Fri 20 Oct 2017

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice today, [Fri 20 Oct 2017], for the central African country of Chad because of a cholera outbreak that started in mid-August 2017. The Ministry of Health of Chad has reported a cholera outbreak in Koukou and Goz Beida Districts in Sila Region and Am Timan District in Salamat Region in the southeast of the country.

Since the onset of the outbreak on [Mon 14 Aug 2017], a total of 445 cases including 56 deaths (case fatality rate 12.6 percent) were reported, as of [Mon 25 Sep 2017]. Of 7 specimens collected from Koukou Health District in Sila Region and cultured at the national laboratory, 6 were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa. Testing of environmental samples also detected _Vibrio_ and _Trichomonas_ species in 6 water samples collected from Marena, a remote village within Koukou Health District.

Because it is spread through contaminated food and water, cholera is easily prevented by sticking to safe eating and drinking habits and regularly washing hands.

[Chad is a country in central Africa. The areas involved are close to Sudan where "acute watery diarrhea" has been quite active and can be found on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad.

As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are non-virulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Lusaka)
Date: Thu 19 Oct 2017

The cholera cases in Lusaka have reached 111 despite the rainy season not having taken off. The Ministry of Local Government event banned the sale of ready to eat foodstuffs on the streets of Lusaka to curb cholera cases but the trend has continued rising.
Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary Kennedy Malama said that his office is working hard to arrest the trend. Cholera cases hit the upper mark during the rainy season but this year [2017] have come early.

Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated. It is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio cholerae_.

About 56 children have died in the ongoing cholera and measles outbreak in Borno and Kano states. While cholera is said to have killed 50 in Borno, measles is said to have claimed 6 lives in Kano.

Residents in the affected communities and stakeholders in the sector are thus calling on the state governments to quickly arrest the spread of the diseases.

Residents in Kiru Local Government Area of Kano State on [Mon 16 Oct 2017] said that 17 children had died of measles and whooping cough in their communities.
