Russia: outbreak of hepatitis A in the Kaliningrad Region
---------------------------------------------------------
Since [the beginning of] Jan 2005, about 30 people (both adults and
children) have fallen ill with hepatitis A in the city of Sovetsk in the
Kaliningrad region . Epidemiologists say the route of infection is contact
transmission. The outbreak is a consequence of non-observance of elementary
rules of hygiene. Most contracted infection by consumption of dirty
vegetables and fruit. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis A have been
admitted daily to the City Infectious Diseases Hospital.
Hospital wards are overflowing and some departments have been rearranged in
order to accommodate patients with hepatitis A infection.

[The Kaliningrad region is the most western region of Russia, along the
Baltic Sea coast between Poland and Lithuania, completely separated from
other territories of Russia and closer to several Western European
countries. The region has 955 000 inhabitants. It was reported by the same
source on 7 Dec 2004 that hepatitis A morbidity in the Kaliningrad region
during 2004 was 200 cases per 100 000 inhabitants
<http://kaliningrad.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=3D5837>. The level of hepatitis A
infection in the region is 14 times higher than the average for Russia. -

An outbreak in the Kaliningrad region in November 2004 was attributed
indirectly to defects in the water supply rather than contaminated produce.
