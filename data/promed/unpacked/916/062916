A small outbreak of _Salmonella_ cases linked to frozen cooked shrimp begat a nationwide recall of 8 brands, including name brand Chicken of the Sea and the house brands of Whole Foods Market, Safeway, Meijer, and Hannaford. All the recalled shrimp comes from manufacturer Avanti Frozen Foods of India and were distributed from December [2020] to February [2021]. Of the 6 people sickened with salmonellosis, the CDC safety alert says 4 live in Nevada and 2 live in Arizona.

The FDA said it found _Salmonella_ in a January 2021 import sample from Avanti. That shipment was destroyed in March [2021], but illnesses started showing up in April [2021] that appeared to be related to the _Salmonella- found in Avanti's shrimp 3 months earlier.

"As of Friday [25 Jun 2021], there are 6 clinical isolates from ill people that are genetic matches to the _Salmonella_ collected from the import sample," the FDA said. "Five of the 6 ill people were interviewed to determine the foods they ate before becoming sick, and all 5 ill people report eating shrimp."

That shrimp is past expiration and no longer on shelves. Here are the frozen, cooked, peeled, and deveined shrimp that are still within expiration and being recalled. If you have them, either toss them out or return them to the store for a full refund:

- 365 (Whole Foods store brand), tail on -- 2-pound pouch; code Nos. 91AS/29HN/212B and 91AS/30HN/213; expiration dates 4/29/2022 and 4/30/2022.

- Chicken of the Sea, tail on -- 16-ounce tray; code Nos. 91AS/02UN/216 and 91AS/03UN/217; expiration dates 5/1/2022 and 5/2/2022.

- Open Acres, tail on -- 1-pound pouch; code No. 02572 0307 11 and 02572 0308 11; expiration dates 11/2/2022 and 11/3/2022.
- Waterfront Bistro (Safeway house brand), tail on -- 16-ounce tray; code Nos. 20305 and 20306; expiration dates 10/30/2022 and 10/31/2022.

By the CDC's count, salmonellosis strikes 1.35 million Americans each year, hospitalizes about 26 500 and kills 420. Most at risk for the worst effects are senior citizens, children under 5, and those with damaged immune systems. Most people get fever, vomiting, stomach aches, and diarrhea for 4-7 days.

[A recall of the frozen cooked shrimp has been announced. As the product involves cooked shrimp, the contamination likely occurred in the processing of the shrimp after cooking, or the cooking process was faulty. Shrimp are not usual carriers for _Salmonella_ but can more commonly carry _Vibrio_ species that can cause gastroenteritis.

Previously, recalls have been announced for shrimp due to contamination with _Salmonella_, but most of them were not associated with human infections. In 2016, however, the Maricopa (AZ) County Department of Public Health [Salmonellosis, st Javiana - USA: (AZ) susp. frozen shrimp 20161019.4570858] released a report on their investigation into a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Javiana outbreak that sickened at least 50 people in July and August 2016. There were 40 confirmed cases and 10 probable cases. A total of 33 (66%) of the cases reported eating at one restaurant. As many as 40 other restaurants or fast-food establishments were reportedly patronized by patients. Up to 3 had more than one person reporting eating there within the week before illness onset with 2 cases each. Although all the human cases were serotype Javiana, the frozen unopened box of U10 shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Weltevreden, and the 5 re-packaged shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Javiana. The 5 prepped/re-packaged shrimp all match the outbreak PFGE pattern of _S._ Javiana. - Mod.LL
