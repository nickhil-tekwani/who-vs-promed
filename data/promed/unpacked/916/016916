Initial tests on a south Boise [Ada County] cat have come back as positive for the plague, said Central District Health Department [CDHD] officials.

"The cat is being treated and is recovering," said CDHD spokeswoman Christine Myron. The cat lived within the known area of impact in the desert south of Boise.

"Previously, 2 Elmore County cats contracted plague and died. We want to remind people to take steps to keep themselves and animals safe," Myron said.

[2] Elmore County: domestic cats, ground squirrels

To date, plague has been found in dead ground squirrels and was confirmed in the deaths of 2 pet cats who resided in Elmore County.

Most recently, initial test results show that an Ada County cat has plague. However, the cat is being treated and is recovering. More details on these cases can be found among News Releases, located under the Resources section of this page [see source URL above].

Public health officials are asking area residents and public to take precautions if they live or recreate in any area with known ground squirrels, even if they are outside the known area of impact.

Ground squirrels typically hibernate in early July, at which time the threat of plague will significantly decrease. It is important to note that 3 squirrels or fox squirrels, which often live in residential areas, are not of concern.

[It is great news to hear this cat is being successfully treated. This is a great success story.

Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.

Plague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.
