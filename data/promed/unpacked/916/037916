[It's difficult to find a "good news" sighting in this week's update when there are 2 countries demonstrating WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) activity and 6 countries demonstrating cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) activity (1 country with cVDPV1, and all 6 countries with cVDPV2 activity. The good news is that no new countries have been added to the cVDPV outbreak list. Returning to the situation of the countries with current cVDPV circulation, given the delayed reporting, with the exception of Pakistan (where 2 cases with dates of onset in 2020 have been confirmed; see below), confirmed cases continue to have dates of onset in 2019. The current tally of cases for 2019 includes 163 WPV1-associated cases (a 4.9-fold increase in cases over 2018), and 259 cVDPV-associated cases (a 2.5-fold increase in cases over 2018). The reality is that for the past several years, more cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) were associated with cVDPVs than with the WPVs. Eradication at this point will require interruption of transmission of the WPV1 AND interruption of transmission of all cVDPVs, a significant challenge that hasn't been the forefront of public discussions.

As with prior posts, here are some useful map links:
For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

Below are links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 24 months. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Pakistan (Sindh): 2nd case of 2020
Date: Thu 23 Jan 2020

https://www.dawn.com/news/1529924/polio-case-reported-in-tando-allahyar


This year's [2020] 2nd polio case in the country was reported by the health authorities in Sindh on Wednesday [22 Jan 2020].

According to the emergency operation centre (EOC) (for eradication of polio) in Sindh, a 7-month-old girl, daughter of a labourer, residing in the union council of Chambar, district Tando Allahyar, was diagnosed with polio, which affected her right lower limb. Her family's claim that the girl had been vaccinated thrice against polio would be investigated, they said.

A spokesperson of the Sindh EOC said a long gap in door-to-door campaigns last year [2019] had created a large pool of vulnerable children.

However, he pointed out, the national and provincial health authorities were striving to reverse this trend and eliminate polio. The 1st step was last month's [December 2019] successful national immunisation day, and now areas with recent detection were being targeted in a special response round that started [13 Jan 2020]. These efforts would be followed up by 2 national immunisation days in February and April [2020].

"The current risk to our children is very real, and while it is our job to deliver these vaccines at the doorstep, caregivers must also step up and protect their children through vaccinations. The national and Sindh EOC urge parents to ensure immunisation of their children, both in routine as well as the special campaigns planned by the programme, over the next few months," says a press release.

The country's 1st polio case of 2020 has recently surfaced from Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Sindh emergency operations centre [EOC] for polio confirmed on Friday [24 Jan 2020] 2 new polio cases in the province, which took the tally to 27.

A 96-month-old [8-year-old] boy from Kambar tested positive for the poliovirus, according to a statement issued by the EOC. The child had no routine immunisation, but parents claimed he had had 7 doses of the polio vaccine. The EOC said the child had already died (not from polio), and the polio case was established through contact sample.

The 2nd polio case was reported in Dadu. A 24-month-old boy in UC Drigh Bala tested positive for the virus after weakness in facial muscles. According to parents, the child had been administered more than 7 doses of the polio vaccine. The EOC said an investigation regarding vaccination status of both the children was underway.

Apart from the above 2 cases, a 42-month-old boy also tested positive for the virus in Sujawal, the EOC stated further. The boy received more than 7 doses of the polio vaccine, his parents claimed.

The total number of polio cases across the country has reached 139, the EOC added.

Another case of polio has popped up in the Sindh province as this time the virus is detected in an over 3-year-old child in the Sujawal area of the province, ARY News reported. The case was detected in a 3.5-year-old child in village Yousuf Jatt of Union Council Kothi in Sujawal.

It is not the 1st time a polio case has been detected from the Sujawal district, as up till now 5 cases have been reported during the last 4 years from the district.

According to reports up till [9 Jan 2020], 6 more polio cases surfaced in the country, including 2 in Sindh confirmed by the province's emergency operation centre (EOC).

The 1st case in Sindh, a 3-year-child, was reported in Union Council Laloo Raunk of Qambar district, sources at the Ministry of National Health said. Another case in the province, a 12-year-old boy, was infected by poliovirus in Union Council Sehwan of district Jamshoro.

Moreover, 2 little girls were infected by poliovirus in Punjab's Dera Ghazi Khan district. The cases of the girls, aged 6 months and one year, were confirmed by the concerned authorities.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services Dr Zafar Mirza has ruled out the impression created by a section of media while reporting of new polio cases that any new polio-related travel restrictions had been imposed on Pakistan. In his statement, Dr Zafar Mirza said the WHO Emergency Committee recommendations were 1st made in May 2014 and had since then been periodically reviewed and extended for all the countries infected by poliovirus. He said Pakistan implemented the same immediately as a responsible member of the international community and has been doing so since then.

[A good map of Pakistan showing districts and provinces can be found at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf.

The 3.5-year-old child mentioned in the above media report ([5]) may well be the 42-month-old child referred to in the prior section ([3], the 3rd case found positive for the poliovirus.

While it is challenging to try to piece together the media reports, it appears as though there are 2 newly confirmed cases with dates of onset in 2019 (see section [3] above, 1 newly confirmed case with date of onset in 2020 (see [1] above), and another case/fatality most likely with date of onset in 2019, as the case was retrospectively confirmed through a positive contact.

At the time of writing of this report, the End Polio Pakistan webpage has not as yet been updated to reflect these 4 cases (see https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces).

As transmission of the WPV1 continues in Pakistan, there is an excellent piece in the Correspondence section of Lancet Global Health that addresses a significant problem in the polio eradication efforts in Pakistan (and perhaps applicable elsewhere).

Asghar JR. Why is polio still here? A perspective from Pakistan. The Lancet Global Health. 2020; 8(2): PE 177-178. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30524-8.

Dr. Rana Jawad Asghar is the former CDC resident advisor to the Pakistan FELTP (Field Epidemiology and Laboratory training program) and has a very interesting perspective on why polio hasn't been eradicated, a salient point (that has been discussed in hushed circles). The full letter is available at https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30524-8/fulltext. Following is an excerpt:

"....one of the key issues, which is crucial in the success or failure of the programme but is not openly talked about; the polio eradication programme is considered a foreign programme in some areas of Pakistan as local leaders are not seen leading it. In their absence, foreign technical staff are the ones seen by communities. Further, when one ventures beyond the streets and inside the polio programme offices, they find international technical staff developing strategies and supervising implementation.

"Polio emergency control centre coordinators are usually the only governmental staff at the centres. Other technical leaders come from different donor agencies. A coordinator could be leading, but major strategic direction still comes from the headquarters of lead technical agencies, in different countries, though with some local input. There should be a good balance of local and international technical leaders in a working environment as complex as Pakistan, especially in a situation in which the programme gains have reversed in a major way. Local experts understand local issues and can come up with local solutions. For example, when the International Stop Transmission of Polio programme experts were unable to work because of security reasons in some of the most high-risk areas for polio transmission in Pakistan, a new programme was developed, National Stop the Transmission of Polio by the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program. Although the names are similar, they are different in their design and implementation. Finding local public health officials from high-risk areas and providing them with epidemiological training resulted in both local acceptance and the technological skills to succeed in areas like North and South Waziristan. To achieve success, we need real partnerships in which local input is used to shape the work plan and strategies in a meaningful way. In its 2018 report, the independent monitoring board for polio eradication recognised a heavy top-down approach and inflexibility in accepting local feedback and encouraged polio leadership staff to accept local feedback for strategy development.

"What we need in Pakistan is to accept that polio eradication is not solely the domain of international agencies; the government of Pakistan should also take ownership. Real ownership comes with local funding, local strategy development, and political leadership at the forefront. . . ."
