Russia: tickborne encephalitis outbreak in Republic of Altai
------------------------------------------------------------
The Republic of Altai, with its 203 000 inhabitants, is one of the most
favorable places for tickborne diseases in Russia. In the past 2 weeks (2nd
and 3rd weeks of June 2004), the number of people bitten by ticks has
increased almost 50 per cent from 515 to 732, 154 of whom are children.
The total number of patients admitted to hospital has risen to 103, which
is higher than the comparable number for the corresponding period of 2003,
according to ITAR-TASS. The head of the Epidemiological Surveillance
Center, Valentina Mednikova, stated that 45 residents of the Altai Republic
have been diagnosed with tickborne encephalitis, 53 with tickborne typhus
(rickettsiosis), and 5 with tickborne borreliosis [Lyme disease].
