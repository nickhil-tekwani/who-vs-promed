99/077 Tomato yellow leaf curl virus found on tomatoes in north Florida and
south Georgia (US)
*******************************
This is the first report of TYLCV in north Florida and in Georgia.
*******************************
In summer 1997, tomato yellow leaf curl geminivirus (TYLCV - EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was first reported in USA, in south Florida (see EPPO RS
97/169).
During October 1998, symptoms characteristic of TYLCV were observed in
tomato fields in Gadsen County (north Florida) and in Decatur Country
(south Georgia). Observed symptoms
included plant stunting, reduction in leaf size, yellow leaf margins and
mottling. TYLCV was specifically identified in symptomatic tomato samples.
Whiteflies were collected from the same fields in Georgia and Florida, and
were identified as _Bemisia
tabaci_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), but the biotype was not established.

[TYLCV was first described in Israel in 1964 where it continues to be a
limiting factor in tomato production. Its appearance in 1992 in the
Dominican Republic appears to be linked to an unwitting introduction of
virus-infected tomato seedlings from Israel by a tomato producer, and is
the only known example of a geminivirus introduced into the New World from
the Old World.
The genome of the Caribbean isolate appears to be identical to the isolate
in Israel. High populations of a new biotype of _Bemisia tabaci_ (biotype
B), present in the Dominican Republic since 1987, facilitated efficient
transmission of the virus to tomato and other plants.
The disease is an emerging one in the United States, having been detected
in Florida in 1997 and in southern Georgia in 1998. An increased geographic
distribution of the disease can be expected, especially in the United
States, depending upon the availability of solanaceous plants capable of
sustaining vector reproduction, feeding, and virus replication - Mod.DH]
