[This confirms the suspicion included in post 20100330.1003. The above
notification includes a map, demonstrating the adjacency of the
current event to the Tulcea region within the Danube delta in Romania,
where 2 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in backyard poultry have, so far, been
notified to the OIE, namely on 16 and 30 Mar 2010.

These 2 new outbreaks occurred in the same region, the Danube Delta,
where the 1st HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Romania started in October 2005
and was resolved in April 2006. For a summary of the 2005/6 epizootic
and a map showing all foci, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5189>.
For a preliminary summary of the current outbreak in the same region,
including a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9047>.

The recurrence of an H5N1 outbreak in the Romanian Danube delta, one
of the world's prominent flyway routes/stations of migratory birds,
after the absence of reported outbreaks in domestic European poultry
since the end of 2007 has revived the discussion on the role migrating
birds may play in the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1. This lively
discussion is being handled under a separate heading in ProMED-mail
thread "Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds."

During 2006, dead common buzzards were found to be H5N1-infected in
Denmark, Sweden and Germany. A considerable effort was invested in the
study of the Danish scenario. The 1st H5N1 case in Denmark was
detected on 14 Mar 2006 in a common buzzard found in the southern part
of Sjaelland. Subsequently, HPAI A H5N1 was found in 43 wild birds
through passive surveillance in various locations in Denmark, mainly
areas bordering the Baltic Sea along the eastern migratory flyways.
Two months later, on 18 May 2006, a single outbreak was discovered in
a domestic backyard poultry holding in Funen county, an area where
avian influenza A H5N1 had previously been detected in wild birds.
This H5N1 outbreak has remained the only one in domestic poultry in
Denmark till now; see 20060616.1675 and
