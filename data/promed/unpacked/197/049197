Veterinarians with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have
joined the search to identify the mysterious virus that has
quarantined 86 horses at the Free-N-Bold Farm and caused the
death of a girl's beloved showhorse.
Kiev, a Holsteiner mare whose 15-year-old owner rode to 5
championships at horse shows this year, was put down Friday
because of complications from the virus that has plagued dozens
of horses at the West Dundee barn, said Jane Fitzgerald, barn
manager. Kiev's was the first virus-related death.
As federal veterinarians combed through inconclusive lab results
that came in Monday, they learned that 2 more horses had
acquired symptoms of the virus, swollen legs, on 10 Aug 1999.
The USDA got involved with the case after concerns arose that the
virus was a foreign disease known as African Horse Sickness
(AHS), a potentially fatal insect-borne disease not endemic to the
United States, said Gifford Jacobsen, USDA veterinarian-in-
charge of Illinois.
Blood samples were taken to the USDA's Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory, a highly specialized and biologically-secure
lab near Long Island, N.Y.
Jacobsen said the foreign disease, AHS, was ruled out. Other
blood samples returned Monday from a USDA lab in Ames, Iowa,
were inconclusive for several common horse illnesses that the
federal veterinarians were checking. "None of the results are really
striking," Jacobsen said. "At this point we don't have anything clear
cut."
The lab was measuring and identifying antibodies for equine viral
arteritis, equine infectious anemia and 4 types of equine influenza.
The USDA took equine nasal swabs and whole blood samples to
be tested for virus and bacteria cultures. Those results have not
been returned.
Local veterinarians have been puzzled since late last month about
what is ailing the horses and causing high fevers and swollen legs.
About 15 of the horses came down with the more serious
symptoms. A majority of the remaining horses showed less serious
signs of the illness, Fitzgerald said.
Four of the sick horses, including Kiev, developed laminitis, [a
condition in one or more of the hooves a sometimes fatal illness,
which caused the death of Triple Crown winner Secretariat.
Veterinarians involved in the situation say they are not concerned
the illness will spread to other animals or humans because such
diseases are usually specific to the species.
Owners have been treating their horses with oral or intravenous
doses of tranquilizers, painkillers, blood thinners, anti-inflammatory
drugs and immunization boosters and many of the animals have
responded well.
"We are not as concerned now because whatever it was seems to
have cycled and stopped," Jacobsen said. "According to all the
information we have, it hasn't spread out of the area."
