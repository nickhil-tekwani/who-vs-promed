The CDC today (see: http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-states.html) reported that enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been confirmed in 277 patients in 39 states and the District of Columbia, up 57 cases and 8 states in the past 2 days. In addition, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) confirmed its 1st 2 EV-D68 cases in 2 children from Hillsborough County, the agency said today [25 Sep 2014] in a news release. New Hampshire was not included today in the CDC's list of 39 states.

The virus, which was fairly rare in the United States until now, causes cold-like symptoms but can lead to serious breathing difficulty, especially in children who have asthma, the CDC said. Infants, children, and teenagers are most at risk for symptomatic infections. The CDC 1st highlighted the outbreak on 8 Sep 2014 after investigating clusters of hospitalized children in Chicago and Kansas City, Missouri. Many state health departments this year [2014] have reported increases in severe respiratory disease in children, the CDC said. "This increase could be caused by many different viruses that are common during this time of year," the agency said. "EV-D68 appears to be the predominant type of enterovirus this year and may be contributing to the increases in severe respiratory illnesses."

[The number of cases of human enterovirus D68 continues to increase throughout the United States and Canada while remaining a comparatively benign condition confined to babies and infants. Nonetheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] on Friday [26 Sep 2014] sent doctors an alert about some polio-like cases and reported that enterovirus 68 had been detected in 4 out of 8 sick children who had undergone a specific medical procedure. The status of these children remains to be clarified [See: the ProMED-mail post archived as: Polio-like illness - USA (02): (CO) enterovirus 68 susp, alert, RFI 20140927.2809908.
