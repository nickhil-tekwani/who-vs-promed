Man's best friend has been causing an outbreak of disease in Bauang, La
Union [province], prompting officials to join hands in vaccinating all dogs
in the town and neighboring areas due to an upsurge in rabies cases.
Provincial agriculturist Avelino Lomboy said the Bauang officials declared
the town under a state of calamity after 95 people were reported to be
infected [exposed to? - Mod.TY] with rabies. Since January this year
[2007], 3 people have died [of rabies].
The highest number of cases came from the villages of Central West and
Parian Weste, Lomboy told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by telephone on
Sunday [16 Sep 2007].
The provincial government vaccinated 450 dogs in the town, while the Bauang
government was ready to buy more anti-rabies vaccines, he said. "We are
undertaking massive anti-rabies vaccination, with personnel going around
the villages giving dogs the needed shot," he said. Lomboy said the
provincial government asked the national government for more anti-rabies
vaccines so they could undertake a province-wide vaccination. He said there
was no record of the number of rabid dogs because they were more focused on
affected people.
Bauang has an ordinance prohibiting stray dogs. The penalty is P 1000
[about USD 22] for every unconfined dog. "But the local government is
having a difficult time in implementing it," Lomboy said.
In Bulacan, officials in Bustos town have been calling for the mandatory
vaccination of pet dogs there to prevent rabies infections. Mayor Carlito
Reyes said the provincial board was seriously considering the town's
proposal to have all dogs vaccinated. Since the town started implementing
an anti-rabies program, some families have refused to have their pet dogs
vaccinated, claiming that their pets became weak due to the effects of the
medicines, he said.
A man died recently of rabies infection, and 40 people were infected
[exposed? - Mod.TY] with rabies in Bustos.
Through a provincial board resolution, the Bustos local government placed
Barangay (village) Liciada under a state of calamity to facilitate the
immediate release of funds for vaccination and medical needs of the
residents who were infected with rabies.

[Where figures are given above for people "infected" with rabies, surely
the term exposed or treated post-exposure should have been used. If these
people had rabies, they would have died, and the mortality numbers would
have been much higher than those indicated in this article.
Clearly, an effective public education campaign is needed urgently to
inform the public about the dangers that rabies poses for humans in this
apparent canine rabies epidemic to get good cooperation. Vaccination of
dogs against rabies in this situation should not be voluntary and should be
continuous, not short-term.
It is tragic to see human and canine deaths occur when effective measures
for prevention through dog vaccination and human post-exposure treatment
are available.
