INFECTIOUS DISEASE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM: SURVEY OF NEEDS
--------------------------------------------------------
A working group of investigators at five U.S Federal agencies, including NASA
(Goddard Space Flight Center), the U.S. Army (Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research), the U.S. Navy (Navy Medical Research Institute), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(Center of Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Epidemiology) as well as the
University of Michigan and John Hopkins University are pursuing a protoype
Early Warning System for arthropod-borne infectious diseases. Our goal is to
make various kinds of data available electronically for purposes of analysis
and prediction, in a timely and easy-to-access manner.
The prototype disease is dengue fever. Once this prototype is developed,
with the assistance of the epidemiological research community we plan to
expand the system into other infectious diseases that may have a strong
environmental component. Eventually, the system will evolve into an
interactive site on the World Wide Web. Both system access and data access
are expected to be provided at no charge.
Once operational, it should be useful to anyone seeking climate, land cover,
demographic, or disease data for purposes of research, policy development,
and public health intervention.
We would like 5 minutes of your time to help determine how this system should
be developed. By simply going to our web site, and clicking on the answers
to 15 simple questions, you will help us determine what data needs you have,
and how we can best serve those needs.
The site can be accessed through the your web server at:
http://eostest2.gsfc.nasa.gov/IDP/form.html
Note that the CAPITALIZED letters (IDP) must be typed as CAPITALS.
Thank you for your participation.

[I accessed the system and answered the questions in fewer than 5 minutes. I
hope the on-screen printing will be more clear in subsequent versions (or I
need to change the prescription for my glasses). Do future plans include
surveillance for plant diseases? -- Mod CHC]
