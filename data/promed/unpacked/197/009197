The majority of the Pacific Islands countries and territories (PICTs) have
confirmed that dengue 2 virus was responsible for the outbreak they had to
face as from 1996.
For the DEN 2 virus circulating in some of the PICTs, phylogenetic analysis
was performed, confirming by the similarity of the viral strains the way
DEN 2 virus spread around the Pacific. As a matter of fact, the
Tahitian, Cook Islands, New Caledonian, and Samoan viral strains showed
very great similarity between each other and are very close to the DEN 2
virus responsible for the 1992-1993 epidemic in far north Queensland. It is
likely the epidemic spread from French Polynesia to New Caledonia, Cook
Islands, and, later, to Samoa and Fiji and other countries and territories.
If possible we would like to update the our knowledge about what happened
in the following places (as from 1996).
* Was the dengue virus introduction in Marshall Islands around July 1998
finally confirmed ?
* Was there any typing done for the dengue virus from Kiribati, the
Northern Mariana Islands (and maybe the Marshalls) ?
* Was there any nucleotides sequencing done for the DEN-2 virus from Fiji,
Tonga, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Wallis & Futuna (and maybe the Northern Mariana
Islands and the Marshalls)?
