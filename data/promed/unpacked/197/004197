The Wholesome Soy listeriosis outbreak has ended after sickening 5 people in Michigan and Illinois, killing 2 of them. [See prior ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - USA (03): (IL, MI) fatal, sprouts, recall 20141109.2941351.]

The Chicago [Illinois]-based company is longer producing sprouts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]'s final report on the outbreak, issued today [27 Jan 2015]. Calls to the company were not answered.

Health officials used whole genome sequencing (WGS) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to link sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy to 4 cases of listeriosis in Illinois and 1 case in Michigan. All 5 case patients in this outbreak were hospitalized. During interviews, 2 of the surviving patients reported eating bean sprouts before they became ill.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected the Wholesome Soy Products Chicago facility in August and October [2014] and found unsanitary conditions, many of which were present during both inspections.

Listeriosis poses a special risk for children, seniors, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems. The CDC recommends that these groups never eat raw sprouts. Among pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and newborns with listeriosis.

Symptoms of listeriosis can take up to 70 days after exposure to develop and include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, headache, stiff neck and muscle aches. Treatment almost always requires hospitalization.

This investigation is closed. _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection (listeriosis) is an important cause of illness in the United States. More information about listeriosis, and steps people can take to reduce their risk of infection, can be found on the CDC Listeria Web Page [http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/].

Highlights
----------
On 7 Nov 2014, Wholesome Soy Products Inc. of Chicago, Illinois, agreed to close their facility and to cease production and distribution of sprouts. The facility is no longer in production.

Sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products Inc. are likely no longer available for purchase or consumption given the 5-day shelf life reported by the facility.

On 28 Aug 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. conducted a voluntary recall of mung bean sprouts due to possible _Listeria monocytogenes_ contamination after FDA isolated the pathogen from samples as a result of a routine assignment.

During FDA inspections of the Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. facility in August and October 2014, investigators observed unsanitary conditions, many of which were present during both inspections. Whole genome sequences of the _Listeria_ strains isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. and environmental isolates collected at the production facility were found to be highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 5 people who became ill from June through August 2014. These 5 ill people were reported from 2 states: Illinois (4) and Michigan (1). All ill people were hospitalized. 2 deaths were reported.
The 2 people interviewed reported eating bean sprouts.

Although limited information is available about the specific sprout products that ill people consumed, the whole genome sequencing findings, together with the sprout consumption history of 2 patients and inspection findings at the firm, suggest that these illnesses could be related to products from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc.

CDC recommends that consumers, restaurants, and other retailers always follow food safety practices to avoid illness from contaminated sprouts. Make sure that children, older adults, pregnant women, and persons with weakened immune systems avoid eating raw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts). Cook sprouts thoroughly to reduce the risk of illness. Cooking sprouts thoroughly kills any harmful bacteria.

_Listeria_ is still an important cause of human illness in the United States. More information about _Listeria_ and steps people can take to reduce their risk of infection can be found on the CDC Listeria Web Page.

[ProMED-mail previously reported on an outbreak of listeriosis in 2014 related to consumption of contaminated sprouts (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - USA (03): (IL, MI) fatal, sprouts, recall 20141109.2941351).

The CDC now reports that whole-genome sequences of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from 5 ill people were found to be highly related to sequences of the _Listeria_ strain isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. of Chicago, Illinois. These ill people have been reported from 2 states: Illinois (4) and Michigan. They became ill from June through August 2014. On 7 Nov 2014, Wholesome Soy Products agreed to close their facility and to cease production and distribution of sprouts. No new cases of listeriosis caused by similar strains apparently have occurred since August 2014, and the CDC has closed its investigation. - Mod.ML
