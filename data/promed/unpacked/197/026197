Q fever confirmed in Idaho livestock
------------------------------------
A release from Governor Otter's office says that the State Department of Agriculture [ISDA] is investigating a confirmed case of Q fever in an Idaho goat herd. The herd has been quarantined.

Q fever has been known to cause stillbirths in livestock, most often in goats, sheep and cattle.

Symptoms typically include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

The disease can be contagious to humans and most often is passed through contact with birthing fluids of affected animals or through inhalation.

The ISDA encourages all livestock owners and handlers to be aware of the signs of illness and contact their veterinarian if animals display signs of Q fever.

Back in November [2011], we told you about the head girl's basketball coach in Dietrich who contracted the disease. He is still recovering.

[The causative bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_, is fairly ubiquitous. Most animals, including humans are susceptible to the effects of the bacterium. Cattle, sheep, and goats can harbor the bacterium. Caretakers of the animals are most often exposed during the birthing process. People are exposed to the bacterium via dust particles.

_C. burnetii_ is increasingly recognized as an important cause of caprine abortion, especially in the western USA. Occasional outbreaks also occur in sheep. Late-term abortions, stillbirths, and weak lambs are the common presentations. Up to 50 percent of the flock may be involved. The placenta is covered by gray-brown exudate and the intercotyledonary areas are thickened. Microscopically, there is a necrotizing vasculitis in the placenta, and many chorionic epithelial cells are distended by small, coccobacillary organisms less than 1 mm in diameter. Infection involves only the placenta; without it, the diagnosis usually cannot be made. Diagnosis is by identification of _C. burnetii_ by immunologic staining methods or by isolation. _Coxiella_ is zoonotic, causing Q fever in humans.

People most at risk may be veterinarians, producers, milkers, and those in the slaughter facilities as the bacteria may be aerosolized at various times in the course of each individual's work. Animals may be infected, but with mild signs that may be missed by the caretakers -- or there may not be any clinical signs.

Respiratory protection for these individuals as well as strict code of hygiene is important in preventing the disease.

In humans, the acute symptoms caused by infection with _C. burnetii_ usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half the humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html).

The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever. However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person:
- high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F)
- severe headache
- general malaise
- myalgia
- chills and/or sweats
- non-productive cough
- nausea
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- abdominal pain
- chest pain

Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue), and central nervous system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate (that is, the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is low, at less than 2 percent of hospitalized patients. Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of illness for acute Q fever.
