INFECTION CONTROL: MRSA (4)
===========================
In support of Dr. Barrett's earlier posting, I agree that enormous effort is
devoted to control of antibiotic-resistant microoganisms in healthcare
facilities, while largely ignoring the larger "eco-epidemiologic" picture of
misuse of anti-infectives by humans combined with provision of same to
animals and the as yet [un]discovered dynamics of such emergence throughout
the world. At the 500-bed community, teaching hospital located in S.E.
Michigan, USA with which I am affiliated the frequency of MRSA [Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus] has remained steady at 20% since 1987
through 1995 (the latter representing the year I came to this facility; the
previous five years I was an infection control professional at two other
teaching hospitals). The literature supports other previous statements that
virulence of MRSA is equivalent to MSSA.
Additionally, MRSA and VRE [Vancomycin resistant enterococci] are not
particularly resistant to antiseptics or germicides. Lastly, despite several
months of extraordinary efforts to control VRE at an academic medical center
in Minnesota, including liberal use of contact precautions, this organism
remained at an endemic level (see Wells, Clin Infect Dis, October 1995). The
results of this investigation suggests that while hospitals may serve to
propagate such resistant microoganisms, it is more likely that successful
long-term prevention of antibiotic resistance lies in assuring appropriate
use of antibiotics among the communities which healthcare facilities serve
rather than a "search and destroy" methodology of identified microoganisms.
I agree some balance is needed along with a critical appraisal of the
evidence upon which precautions for antibiotic-resistant microoganisms is
founded.
I echo previous comments on the importance and value of ProMed. It
demonstrates the power of global communication of ideas and will continue to
further our understanding of emerging diseases. It is an excellent resource
and I personally have gained during my subscription. There are several
surveys of antibiotic resistance ongoing here in the U.S., e.g. SCOPE project
under the direction of Dr. Richard Wenzel, the National Nosocomial Infections
Surveillance (NNIS) system by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention,
and several state health departments (directors of some subscribe to
ProMed), that would offer a broader picture of the extent of this problem.
Periodic updates of the results of these as well as similar projects
worldwide would be of value and interest.
While the number of infection control professionals who elect to self-
identify may be small I sense that our numbers are growing exponentially.
While non-academic, healthcare facilities have been slow to offer Internet
access I believe many have found personal avenues via commercial internet
service providers. Therefore actual numbers of ICPs subscribing to ProMed
(along with internet access) may in reality be much larger than initially
believed. ProMed has been and will continue to be promoted to the members of
the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology,
Inc.(APIC) via their newsletter, APIC News and scientific journal, the
American Journal of Infection Control.
Finally, APIC has launched their own WWW site; the URL is:
http://www.apic.org. This site also includes a discussion forum with indexed
"discussion threads" for review and participation as well as other
information.
Congratulations to the developers of ProMed and keep up the excellent work.
