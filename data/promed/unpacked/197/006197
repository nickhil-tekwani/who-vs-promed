At least 2 persons tested positive along with 15 others falling ill due to Japanese encephalitis within the district of Jorhat, said Dr. Pawan Chandra Saikia, the chief medical officer of Jorhat, on Tuesday [12 May 2020]. A total of 15 persons have been admitted to the Jorhat Medical College and Hospital (JMCH) since Sunday [10 May 2020]. Moreover, a team of doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, and MPWs [multi-purpose health workers] have been working on a war footing while anti-JE measures are at its peak following fogging and spraying of DDT, along with a sanitization process and even distribution of medicinal mosquito nets that will take place from Wednesday [13 May 2020], Dr. Pawan Chandra Saikia said.

[The Japanese encephalitis (JE) season is again beginning in Assam state. The above report does not indicate if the 2 cases were laboratory confirmed or if the other suspected JE cases were being tested. Although mosquito control is mentioned in the above report as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. The only feasible steps the communities could take are elimination of _Culex_ mosquito breeding sites within the community and avoidance of mosquito bites. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY
