[1] Long COVID
[A]

Lingering symptoms from the coronavirus may turn out to be one of the largest mass disabling events in modern history.

Both of us developed COVID-19 last March [2020] in New York. We didn't know each other at the time, but we had much in common: We didn't imagine our symptoms would last for more than a couple of weeks. We were young and otherwise healthy, and were told we should recover easily.

But after Fiona's shortness of breath subsided and she was discharged from the hospital, she developed new symptoms ranging from gastrointestinal problems to rashes and hives to migraines. A few weeks later, Hannah began experiencing fevers, headaches, memory lapses, and a debilitating brain fog that made her unable to work.

By [2 Apr 2021], 2 truths had become evident: We were not getting better, and we were not alone in our experience of lingering symptoms.

We met online after Hannah read Fiona's account of long-term symptoms, and in the past year, we have become self-educated experts on "long COVID," the term patients prefer for long-term symptoms related to COVID-19. Not all of our doctors believed us, but together with thousands of other people we met online, who were all experiencing similar symptoms, we researched our conditions, lobbied for treatment, and formed a support group.

Researchers have now established that long COVID is a debilitating condition with full-body symptoms that can range from months long fevers to respiratory problems. The National Institutes of Health recently announced an initiative to study it. Many sufferers are unable to return to work or care for themselves or their loved ones and will likely require long-term medical attention.

Yet, a year later, we still struggle to be taken seriously by friends, family members, clinicians, and policymakers. People are sympathetic, yet few think long COVID can happen to them, or that it will affect their post-pandemic life. But the long COVID is not a footnote to the pandemic or a curious human-interest story. It is America's next big health crisis, and we should prepare for it now.

The misconceptions around long COVID are due in part to the mistaken belief that it is rare. But it's not. Approximately 30 percent of COVID patients in a new but small study from the University of Washington reported that symptoms persisted months after their infection. If confirmed on a bigger scale, this suggests that long COVID could be one of the largest mass disabling events in modern history.

There could be millions of Americans experiencing long COVID, and many may need health care and workplace accommodations. Patients report long waiting lists at the few medical centers with programs to specifically treat people with long COVID.

Long COVID is one of the most devastating outcomes of the pandemic, and will likely put a strain on our society and economy for years to come. There is little to indicate that global health systems are prepared for it. In response to this lack of recognition, long COVID patient advocacy is emerging as a health movement that will be increasingly hard for governments to ignore.

As the world moves toward what many are hoping will be a final phase of the pandemic, governments and policymakers must begin to deal with long COVID. And when we talk about vaccine efficacy or when to reopen schools and businesses, we should also consider the possibility that the health crisis may not end when infections decline. For example, while the approved vaccines are remarkably effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19, they may not prevent mild or asymptomatic infections that could subsequently develop into long COVID.

Predictions about the pandemic's resolution must account for the burden that long COVID could place on our healthcare and disability benefits systems. We need healthcare workers to be trained in long COVID as a possible outcome of coronavirus infection, and for disability policies to be updated to account for it.

In a non-peer-reviewed online survey conducted by our Patient-Led Research Collaborative of 3762 long COVID patients in 56 countries, respondents said they continued to experience an average of 14 symptoms after 6 months [see [B] below].

88 percent of people reported cognitive issues like memory loss that in many cases impaired their ability to work, have conversations with others, maintain medication schedules or drive. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of these symptoms and their impact across age groups.

Other data suggest that around 1 in 4 people ages 25-69 remain symptomatic 5 weeks after testing positive for the virus, according to the Office for National Statistics in Britain. 31 percent of non-hospitalized people reported being dependent on others for care about 3 months after infection, according to a Dutch and Belgian study.

Tracking long COVID in a more comprehensive way is vital to understand the full impact of COVID-19, and for governments to make decisions about funding research into long-term symptoms. Illnesses and conditions that are thought to be "rare" are often not researched as thoroughly.

We've seen this before with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Because ME/CFS, as it is also called, is difficult to diagnose, many patients have gone uncounted, and research into treatments and cures remains underfunded compared to other illnesses. As a result, clinicians tend to be undereducated and patients are less likely to receive adequate care and government support. There's a risk of repeating this cycle with people with long COVID.

Some government groups seem to be listening. Thanks in large part to the efforts of patient advocacy, Congress recently allocated USD 1.15 billion for the National Institutes of Health to support research into long COVID. This includes efforts to collect blood, tissue, and other samples from patients and to create a comprehensive symptom list, and is an important step in the right direction. The findings, however, won't be available fast enough to influence reopening policies or to meet existing patients' urgent needs.

The pandemic has exposed many cracks in our health and belief systems, and some of these issues are not new. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities have long experienced doubt from clinicians and difficulty getting benefits and economic support. Patients with "mysterious illnesses" from fibromyalgia to AIDS have had to fight for recognition and research money.

As the world enters the next stage of the pandemic, there's an opportunity to think differently about new or mysterious-seeming illnesses and to do better not just for future waves of long COVID patients, but for all chronically ill and disabled people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Objective
To characterize the symptom profile and time course in patients with long COVID, along with the impact on daily life, work, and return to baseline health.

Design
International web-based survey of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020.

Setting
Survey distribution via online COVID-19 support groups and social media

Participants
3762 respondents from 56 countries completed the survey. 1166 (33.7%) were 40--49 years old, 937 (27.1%) were 50-59 years old, and 905 (26.1%) were 30--39 years old. 2961 (78.9%) were women, 718 (19.1%) were men, and 63 (1.7%) were nonbinary. 8.4% reported being hospitalized. 27% reported receiving a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 96% reported symptoms beyond 90 days.

Results
Prevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over 7 months. Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7%, 74.9% to 80.3%), post-exertional malaise (72.2%, 69.3% to 75.0%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4%, 52.4% to 58.8%). These 3 symptoms were also the 3 most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 85.9% (84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3% (20.5% to 24.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.

Conclusions
Patients with long COVID report prolonged multisystem involvement and significant disability. Most had not returned to previous levels of work by 6 months. Many patients are not recovered by 7 months, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.

[Besides being reminiscent of chronic fatigue syndrome, this also brings to mind chronic Lyme disease which is difficult to diagnose and often, looked at with skepticism by those who have not experienced it. There are some promising data that vaccination may curtail long COVID in a small proportion of individuals. See ProMED COVID-19 update (98): transmission, long COVID, vaccine reactions, WHO, global 20210315.8247668. This should be evaluated carefully. - Mod.LK]

[2] Variant updates
[A] Vaccine 'escape' variants
Date: Wed 17 Mar 2021
Source: Reuters [abridged, edited]
https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-science-idINKBN2B92U7


Antibodies induced by the Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE vaccines are dramatically less effective at neutralizing some of the most worrying coronavirus variants, a new study suggests. Researchers obtained blood samples from 99 individuals who had received one or 2 doses of either vaccine and tested their vaccine-induced antibodies against virus replicas engineered to mimic 10 globally circulating variants. 5 of the 10 variants were "highly resistant to neutralization," even when volunteers had received both doses of the vaccines, the researchers reported on Friday [12 Mar 2021] in Cell [see reference below]. All 5 highly resistant variants had mutations in the spike on the virus surface -- known as K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y -- that characterize a variant rampant in South Africa and 2 variants spreading rapidly in Brazil. In keeping with previous studies, the proportion of neutralizing antibodies dropped 5- to 6-fold against the variants discovered in Brazil. Against the variant discovered in South Africa, neutralization fell 20- to 44-fold. A variant circulating now in New York has the E484K mutation. "While studies of the New York variant are ongoing, our findings suggest that similar variants harboring E484K may be harder for vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize," said study leader Alejandro Balazs of Harvard University and the Massachusetts General Hospital. "Despite our results," he added, "it's important to consider that vaccines raise other kinds of immune responses which could protect against developing severe disease."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies.
To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or 2 doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.
5 of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization.
Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses.
While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic."

[B] Infectivity of P.1 variant
Date: Wed 17 Mar 2021
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-science-idINKBN2B92U7/


Between November [2020] and January [2021] in Manaus, Brazil, the frequency of COVID-19 cases involving the P.1 coronavirus variant increased from non-existent to 73%, and the number of infections there quadrupled compared to what the city experienced in the 1st wave of the pandemic, according to a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The greater infectiousness of the P.1 variant likely contributed to that, the report suggests. Based on national health surveillance data, the authors estimate that the P.1 variant is roughly 2.5 times more transmissible than previous variants circulating in Manaus. The spread of P.1 occurred despite the fact that 68% of the city's population had already been infected by the original strain of the coronavirus, the researchers noted. In their analysis, the risk of reinfection with P.1 was low. The ability of the variant to cause severe disease, or its pathogenicity, is still unclear. "The P.1 variant has already been detected in at least 25 countries," the authors said. "This calls for urgent ... studies of the P.1 variant, since greater transmissibility and pathogenicity can drive even well-prepared health systems to collapse." (<bit.ly/38MGykw>)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The variant of concern (VOC) P.1 emerged in the Amazonas state (Brazil) and was sequenced for the first time on 6-Jan-2021 by the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

It contains a constellation of mutations, ten of them in the spike protein.
Consequences of these mutations at the populational level have been little studied so far.

From December-2020 to February-2021, Manaus was devastated by four times more cases compared to the previous peak (April 2020). Here, data from the national health surveillance of hospitalized individuals and frequency of the P.1 variant were analysed using a model-based approach to estimate P.1 parameters of transmissibility and reinfection by maximum likelihood.

Sensitivity analysis was performed changing pathogenicity and the period analysed (including/excluding the health system collapse period).

The new variant transmissibility was found to be about 2.5 times higher (Confidence Interval (95%CI): 2.3-2.8) compared to the previous variant in Manaus. A low probability of reinfection by the new variant (6.4%, 95% CI: 5.7-7.1%).) was estimated, even under initial high prevalence (68%, 95% CI: 63-74%), by the time P.1 emerged.

Consequences of a higher transmissibility were already observed with VOC B.1.1.7 in the UK and Europe. Urgent measures must be taken to control the spread of P.1.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing pandemic disease. In the current review, we describe SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses in acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients. We also discuss the relationships between COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses and summarize recent reports regarding SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals. These T cells may be cross-reactive cells primed by previous infection with human common-cold coronaviruses. Finally, we outline SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in the context of vaccination. A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses is needed to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics.

[From the article above:
"Patients with COVID-19 tend to have lymphopenia that preferentially affects T-cell populations, and T-cell lymphopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Early studies reported activation and exhaustion phenotypes for T cells in patients with COVID-19 and relationships between the T cell phenotype and disease severity. However, those studies examined pan-CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell populations without information on Ag specificity."

In this study, authors reported "SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in up to 50% and 20% of unexposed individuals, respectively, suggesting that these responses may result from previous infection by cross-reactive common-cold coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63."

"This response primarily targeted the C-terminal part of S, which has a similarity with the S protein of common cold coronavirus (CCCoV)."

"Since December 2020, COVID-19 prophylactic vaccines have been approved and started to be administered to high-risk populations. Although various vaccine platforms have been used, including mRNA, viral vectors, and recombinant proteins, vaccinations have been shown to successfully elicit neutralizing Abs, as well as SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses."

The authors conclude, "in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the roles of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protective immunity are not as well clarified as the roles of neutralizing Abs. In addition, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells needs to be investigated further. Whether pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells elicited by CCCoVs are beneficial or harmful to hosts remains to be elucidated. Immunological research of these questions will help us end the current COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for the next pandemic by developing effective prophylactics and therapeutics and establishing proper epidemiological strategies." - Mod.UBA]

As COVID-19 transmission escalates, healthcare experts urged the government to take stringent measures immediately to rein in the surge before it goes out of control.

The country witnessed at least 2187 new cases yesterday [18 Mar 2021] -- the highest for a single day in the last 100 days.

The country witnessed 2202 cases on [8 Dec 2020], according to the data from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

"We are frightened and frustrated seeing the people's reckless behaviour. I think it is high time to send a strict message to the people that the situation is grave. If needed, the government should go for lockdown and cancel all public examinations," Prof Md Sayedur Rahman, chairman of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University's (BSMMU's) pharmacology department, told The Daily Star yesterday [18 Mar 2021].

He also warned that if the transmission was not contained right now, it would go beyond control.

There has been a sharp rise of new COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the second week of March [2021], with healthcare officials and experts blaming it on people's reluctance to follow health safety guidelines.

The new cases recorded yesterday [18 Mar 2021] were against 21 212 tests, which meant that the positivity rate was 10.45 percent -- almost 3 points up from the previous day's 7.68 percent.

The last time the country recorded a higher positivity rate was on [13 Dec 2020], 10.63 percent of samples tested positive for coronavirus.

Prof Rahman stressed on increasing the daily testing capacity. "Unless we increase the number of tests to 1 or 2 lakh [100 000-200 000], we will never know the level of transmission. With inadequate tests, a lockdown or any other measures will hardly work," said Rahman, adding that testing helps mitigation efforts as it equips investigators with the requisite knowledge to examine the characteristics, prevalence, and spread of any disease.

According to the DGHS, RT-PCR labs across the country have the capacity to test around 50 000 samples every day.

The rise of infections has also coincided with a decline in number of people getting vaccinated. A total of 107 433 people were vaccinated yesterday [18 Mar 2021], raising the total number of people vaccinated to 4 687 824.

During the 1st and 2nd weeks of the countrywide vaccination campaign that started on [7 Feb 2021], an average of 1.5 lakh [150 000] people took the vaccines daily.

Amid the growing alarm, Health Minister Zahid Maleque yesterday [18 Mar 2021] urged people to maintain health safety guidelines.

Fearing the fresh surge of transmission, likely linked to the 2 highly transmissible strains of the virus [first detected] in the UK and South Africa, the DGHS has recently given a 12-point suggestion to the government, including a complete lockdown.

The health minister, however, said all the government agencies will take collaboratively decide on the lockdown. "While we want [that] the economy of the country remains stable, we also want [that] the transmission does not rise... But we [health ministry] cannot decide on lockdown. All the government agencies will decide collaboratively on it," said Zahid Maleque.

He said lockdown would be the last resort for the government if people continue to defy health guidelines.

"In the beginning, we knew nothing about coronavirus. Now we know how to fight it, but we are not maintaining the health safety guidelines... If health safety guidelines are maintained, there will be no need for lockdown. We have suggested, now the government [high-ups] will decide," the minister said.

About mass gatherings in social events, the minister said, "At least 20 lakh [2 million] people visited Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, and Rangamati in the last 15 days. Nobody wore masks. [People] are participating in marriage ceremony without wearing masks."

He also urged people to be patient. "It is not the right time for going on tours. Be patient [for] a bit more. If [you] stay alive, [you] will be able to go on tours."

Meanwhile, Bangladesh Police yesterday [18 Mar 2021] said they will intensify efforts to ensure people are maintaining health guidelines.

"We are witnessing a sudden rise of coronavirus infections in the month of March [2021] again. Already around 16 000 people got infected in the month at an average of 1000 daily, whereas the figure was only 11 061 in February [2021]," said Benazir Ahmed, Inspector General of Police (IGP), yesterday [18 Mar 2021].

Due to the sudden rise of COVID-19, police will undertake a nationwide special awareness programme from [21 Mar 2021] so that every people in the country take preventive steps, said the police chief.

Police will continue the awareness with the slogan "habit of wearing mask, COVID-free Bangladesh."

The IGP disclosed the steps taken by police to prevent the ongoing surge of coronavirus while addressing reporters at Bangladesh Police Auditorium in Rajarbagh.

He said "everyone has to follow strict hygiene rules. Masks should be worn, hands should be washed repeatedly with soap. Hand sanitisers should be kept if necessary."

Replying to a query about forcing people to wear masks, the police chief said, "We do not want to say that right now. We want to inspire people to wear masks with motivation and awareness.

"Moreover, why should we need to be encouraged to wear a mask? I hope people will wear masks for themselves and their families out of a sense of responsibility," he said.

Community police and beat police will work to create awareness and free masks will be provided if needed, said the IGP.

Asked about police allowing big political events and gatherings, the IGP said the issue of permission depends on the situation. "We have to strictly follow hygiene rules at every event even if given permission," he said.

Regarding the restrictions in kitchen markets, the police chief said it will depend on the situation and everything will be implemented in phases as required by circumstances.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/107-new-cases-of-covid-19-registered-on-thursday-tally-shifts-to-275625

While the current year's [2021] highest number of COVID-19 cases in a single day was reported on [Thu 18 Mar 2021], the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on the pandemic expressed concern on disregard for standard operating procedures (SOPs) and warned of closing businesses and imposing restrictions on economic and social activities if the trend continued.

Also on the day [18 Mar 2021], the vaccine was administered to Prime Minister Imran Khan, Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood, and former special assistant to the PM on health Dr Zafar Mirza.

On the other hand, Director General of National Health Services (NHS) Dr Rana Safdar revealed that around 1000 people had complained about a minor reaction to the vaccine across Pakistan.

After vaccination, Prime Minister Khan appealed to the masses to strictly adhere to the SOPs. He said that the vaccination campaign was going on across the country and all frontline healthcare workers and people above the age of 60 were being vaccinated.

Shafqat Mahmood reached Polyclinic to get the jab. Dr Mirza, who had played a major role in preparing the strategy to deal with COVID-19 in the country, reached Federal General Hospital for vaccination.

During a meeting of the NCOC, chaired by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar, a briefing was given on the implementation of various health guidelines already issued to the federating units.

"NCOC was apprised that implementation on those guidelines needs a comprehensive review. NCOC showed serious concern on rising disease trend and mortality rate. The forum was briefed that a sharp rising trend in disease is visible and positivity (rate) has crossed 7.5 percent. Almost all major cities have crossed 5% positivity (rate). Provincial Administrations have been asked to take immediate actions for strict implementation of SOPs," an official statement stated.

"Serious concern was shown on the general disregard of SOPs by masses. Mass violations of SOPs and disrespect of orders including not wearing of a mask, disregard of social distancing are widely reported. An appeal was made to citizen(s) to once again display a good example of social behavior and follow the SOPs in letter and spirit. Otherwise strict measures will have to be taken which may result in the closure of business and restrictions on economic and social activities. It was also decided that COVID-19 vaccination centers across the country will remain closed on Sundays and national holidays," the statement concluded.

Later Mr Umar said in a tweet. "Sharp spike in COVID positivity. Hospital daily admissions & people in critical care rising fast. If sop compliance does not improve, we will be forced to place stronger restrictions on activities. Please be very careful. The new strain spreads faster and is more deadly.

NHS DG Dr Safdar, while talking to Dawn, said that the monitoring system of the NCOC had so far recorded over 1000 reports of reaction to the vaccine but all were of minor nature, and the vaccinated persons fully recovered.

"We have put in place an efficient adverse effect following immunisation system to monitor any untoward effect among vaccinated individuals. Reported symptoms are of a very minor nature like irritation at the injection site, headache, mild fever, etc. We urge all eligible elderly populations to get themselves registered and vaccinated," he said.

According to the data shared by the NCOC, as many as 3495 cases and 61 deaths were reported in a single day on [Thu 18 Mar 2021]. Earlier 3795 cases were reported on [6 Dec] 2020.

While 272 ventilators were occupied in Pakistan, Islamabad's 46%, Multan's 41%, Lahore's 37%, and Bahawalpur's 27% vents were in use. The data of oxygenated beds showed that Gujarat's 67%, Peshawar's 51%, Islamabad's 43%, and Multan's 31% beds were in use.

The number of active cases, which was 16 000 in January [2021], has surged to 24 592 as of [18 Mar 2021] and 2472 patients have been admitted to hospitals.

Meanwhile, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services Faisal Sultan said that the government had reversed its decision to allow uncapped prices for COVID-19 vaccines imported by private firms, a move that coincided with the arrival of the 1st shipment of privately imported Russian Sputnik V shots, adds Reuters.

Pakistan last month [February 2021] allowed private firms to import coronavirus vaccines and agreed to exempt them from price caps.

"Now, however, there is a formula, already in vogue, to determine maximum price," Mr Sultan told Reuters. "So yes, there is a price cap that DRAP (Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan) will recommend and get approval for."

An official with M/s AGP Ltd, the company that imported the Sputnik shots, said the first shipment of 50 000 doses arrived on [Wed 17 Mar 2021] night and it would be made available to people as soon as the government agreed on a price. Russian Direct Investment Fund, responsible for marketing the Sputnik V vaccine abroad, confirmed that a batch had been delivered to Pakistan.

China is awaiting clearance from Sri Lanka to gift 600 000 coronavirus vaccines, a diplomat said.

The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) is yet to approve the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine.

Sri Lanka's Ambassador to China, Dr Palitha Kohona told Daily Mirror that the Embassy has had talks with 2 major vaccine manufacturers in China.

"Both have been very receptive to our request to make the Chinese vaccines available to Sri Lanka," Dr Kohona said.

He said that eventually the Chinese Government offered 300 000 vaccines as a gift to Sri Lanka.

Dr Palitha Kohona said that China has now offered another 300 000 vaccines to Sri Lanka.

The diplomat said that China's offer has been conveyed to the Sri Lankan authorities in Colombo.

He said that now it is in the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities to register the vaccine for emergency use.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 19 Mar 2021 at 06:26 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 11 514 331 / 159 405 / 115
Pakistan: 619 259 / 13 757 / 61
Bangladesh: 564 939 / 8624 / 52
Nepal: 27 56 25 / 3015 / 102
Sri Lanka: 89 024 / 537 / 25
Afghanistan: 56 069 / 2462 / 62
Maldives: 22 147 / 64 / 117
Bhutan: 868 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 19 061, 555, and 2035 cases were detected in Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, indicating a significant increase of cases in Pakistan over the last 7 days, but a continuation of the declining trend in Nepal and Sri Lanka, compared with the data from the previous week.

The surge of daily case positivity against the total number of samples tested in Bangladesh was continuing over the last 7 days, and it was even more than 10% yesterday (18 Mar 2021), the highest positivity over the last 2.5 months.

The average daily cases over the last 7 days in India were 29 355 against 19 298, recorded in the preceding 7 days. India recorded 39 726 new cases in the last 24 hours alone, suggesting an alarming spread of the virus across several states.

Based on the continuation of a sharp increase of daily new cases in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the 3 most populous countries in South Asia, over the last 2 weeks or so, the beginning of a new wave of the disease is being suspected in these 3 countries. Surprisingly, this has started after the winter and at the beginning of the summer season. What exactly has triggered this new wave is difficult to understand after a significant dropping in the number of new cases at the end of the winter season. However, there is suspicion that the spread of variant N501Y.V1, B.1.1.7 lineage, also known as VOC-202012/0, first detected in the UK, could have a contributory role in such a surge. Increasing public activities, movement, and gathering without following health-safety guidelines, including wearing a face mask, could also favor the spread of the virus at a faster rate.
