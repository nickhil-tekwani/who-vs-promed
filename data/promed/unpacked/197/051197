Gold Coast doctors say a lack of immunisation boosters could be behind an outbreak of mumps in the city. The extremely contagious disease has struck many adults on the coast and anyone with symptoms is warned to have minimal contact with others. Symptoms include swollen and painful glands, fatigue, and fever.

Gold Coast Medical Association president Dr Peter McLaren said it was rare to see mumps in adults. "It is usually something contracted as a child and can be quite harmful to adults, especially males," he said. "Adult men can experience painful swelling in their groin region and this can cause fertility problems." Dr McLaren said an increasing lack of faith in immunisation meant diseases were spread more easily. "When someone is immunised it is much harder for them to contract a disease," he said. "Many of the adults with mumps may have been immunised but the immunity lessens after so many years. Booster shots can be given but it is up to the individual."

Those diagnosed with mumps will not show symptoms until about a week after contracting the virus. They are advised to stay away from non-infected people for 5 to 9 days after swelling begins. In rare cases, no symptoms are apparent and a blood test is needed for diagnosis. Anyone with swelling around the jawline, neck, and behind the ears is encouraged to see their doctor.

[This report gives no indication of the scale of this outbreak, or any other precise information other than that children appear not to be involved.

Mumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling of salivary glands. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. Mumps infection is most often confused with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck. Lymph node swelling can be differentiated by the well-defined borders of the lymph nodes, their location behind the angle of the jawbone, and lack of the ear protrusion or obscuring of the angle of the jaw, which are characteristics of mumps. In 50-60 per cent of cases of clinical mumps, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis occurs. However, clinical evidence of meningitis or encephalitis appears in less than 10 per cent of patients with mumps. Serious sequelae are rare. For example, deafness after mumps occurs in 0.5 to 5 per 100 000 cases. Death occurs in less than 2 per cent of mumps encephalitis cases.

Orchitis occurs in about 25 per cent of adolescent and adult males with mumps and is rare in prepubescent males. One or both testes may be involved, with lower abdominal pain, fever, and chills, and possibly epididymitis. The involved testis and adjacent skin become swollen and red. Orchitis occurs within one week of parotitis and usually lasts 4 days. Infertility is rare even when both testes are involved. Oophoritis occurs in 5 per cent of post pubertal females with mumps and is characterized by pelvic pain and tenderness. Infertility generally does not occur. Mastitis may also occur. Less common complications of mumps infection include pancreatitis, myocarditis, arthritis, thyroiditis, deafness, and spontaneous abortion (see http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/clinical/qa-physical-complic.html).
