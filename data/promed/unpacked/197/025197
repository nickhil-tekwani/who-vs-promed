Pig disease spreads in Tabuk
----------------------------
Diseases among hogs have spread in this town and the deaths of at
least 300 pigs showed that they were downed by cholera [hog cholera,
aka classical swine fever or CSF] and porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infections, authorities revealed Monday
[30 Aug 2010].

Results of hog blood samples brought last week for laboratory test at
the Philippine Animal Health Center in Manila confirmed the cholera
and PRRS mixed infection among hogs here, said Godofredo Laed of the
Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO).

Laed said the PVO made the move following reports from hog raisers of
widespread cases of severe diarrhea and still births among hogs since
July [2010].

While admitting that the 300 death toll in swine is very high, Laed
said the PVO cannot yet declare a state of an outbreak, "since we
lack further qualifying requirements for such a declaration." Based
on their investigation, Laed said the virus might have originated
from infected pig meats and live hogs brought into the town. He
attributed this to the weakening monitoring of livestock and meat
products coming in to Tabuk after the quarantine post at the entry
point to Tabuk has been pulled out.

Laed characterized the viral strains of hog cholera as that of
excessive diarrhea, while that of PRRS leads to abortion, still
births, mummified fetus and very weak piglets. Laed admitted that it
is very difficult to contain both viral infections which cause sudden
deaths among pigs. "What we can do at least is to prevent the further
spread of the disease," he said.

As a preventive measure, the PVO conducted massive spraying of
disinfectants among infected pig pens. They also called on swine
owners to increase body resistance of their pigs through vitamins and
proper feedings.

Laed appealed to owners of morbid pigs to properly dispose of their
livestock through burning and deep burying. He warned people who dare
butcher infected pigs for human consumption saying they are just
providing possibilities of wider spread of the virus even to other
municipalities of the province. When infected meats enter a house,
you are bringing in the threat to your own pigs and that of your
neighbors, Laed warned.

[The described outbreak has been ongoing in the region since July
2010; see "Hog epidemic raging in Kalinga," published by the Manila
Bulletin Publishing Corporation on 11 Aug 2010, at
<http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/271728/hog-epidemic-raging-kalinga>.

Both OIE-listed diseases CSF and PRRS are reportedly endemic in pigs
in the Philippines.

Mixed infections of both diseases have been reported in recent years
mainly from China; according to the results of one published
surveillance, the total positive rate was 77.42 percent (463/598), in
which CSF positive rate was 63.04 percent (377/598), PRRS positive
rate was 45.82 percent (274/598), and the double infection rate of
PRRSV and CSFV was 31.44 percent (188/598). See: QIU Hui-ling et al
(2009). Epidemiological Investigation of Classical Swine Fever and
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Infection in Six
Regions of Shandong Province. Journal of Anhui Agricultural Sciences 2009-18.

According to the current media report, the diagnosis was based upon
"blood tests;" it would help if the exact test applied were known.
Serological tests would not suffice to determine active infection.

Ebola Reston deserves to be excluded as well. - Mod.AS]
