Headlines
- Health ministers and delegates attending the World Health Assembly this week in Geneva welcomed the new Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023, reiterating the need to fully implement and fund all aspects of the strategy to secure a lasting polio-free world. The 5-year plan spells out the tactics and tools to wipe out the poliovirus from its last remaining reservoirs, including innovative strategies to vaccinate hard-to-reach children and expanded partnerships with the Expanded Programme on Immunization community and health emergencies.
- Taking advantage of the critical mass of global leaders, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative hosted an event for polio eradicators, partners, and stakeholders on 21 May 2019. The event, To Succeed by 2023 - Reaching Every Last Child, celebrated the GPEI's new Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023.
- The GPEI is committed to advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in its efforts to eradicate polio. On 11 May 2019, the GPEI Polio Oversight Board officially endorsed the GPEI Gender Equality Strategy, 2019-2023 with the objective to promote the integration of a gender perspective into different aspects of the GPEI's programming, to support countries in addressing gender-related barriers to polio vaccination to increase coverage and increase women's meaningful participation in the polio programme.

- Somalia has reported a total of 13 cVDPV cases (6 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks.
- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- The Papua New Guinea Polio Outbreak Response Report 2018 is online. The report summarizes the accomplishments of the government of Papua New Guinea, with support from the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary, the government of Australia and New Zealand, and other partners and donors in responding to the polio outbreak.
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Iran
- No further WPV1 has been detected, following reporting last week of detection of WPV1 from an environmental sample. WPV1 had been detected from an environmental sample in Seestan and Balochistan province. The sample was collected on [22 Apr 2019]. The virus was detected in the environmental sample only, and genetic sequencing confirms it is related to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 21 May 2019

[The 2 newly confirmed cases of polio in Pakistan were reported on ProMED earlier (see Poliomyelitis update (36): global, Iran environmental, Pakistan 20190516.6471875). With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, the global tally of WPV1 associated disease since 1 Jan 2019 is now 24.

Unfortunately, the WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan (the former confirming new cases and wide geographic area with positive environmental samples, and the latter with positive environmental sample). And similarly, unfortunate is the continued circulation of the cVDPV in Niger and Nigeria.

[2] Pakistan (KP, KPTD): 2 new cases - End Polio Pakistan
Date: Thu 23 May 2019

NIH confirms 2 new polio cases from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
-------------------------------
National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad on Wednesday [22 May 2019] notified 2 new polio cases each from Tehsil Mir Ali, North Waziristan and Tehsil Paharpur, district DI Khan of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, taking the total count of polio cases to 13 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 19 in Pakistan during 2019 so far.

According to a statement issued here by emergency operations center (EOC) KP, wild poliovirus has been isolated from stool sample of a 17-month-old girl resident of Tarroti, Idak UC Mir Ali-7, Tehsil Mir Ali, North Waziristan and 144-month [12-year-old] girl of UC Dhap Shumali, Tehsil Paharpur, district DI Khan.

By the recollection of the parents, the 17-month-old girl has not received any dose of essential/routine immunization, while the administration of anti-polio vaccine during the campaign is still under investigation.

However, the [12-year-old] girl received only 3 doses of routine/essential immunization (as per recollection of the parents).

Coordinator EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Capt. (R) Kamran Ahmed Afridi said that identification of new cases is a reminder of the fact that poliovirus exists and is in circulation all over the region, putting every child at risk unless properly vaccinated to boost their immunity.

He said that unfortunately, anti-polio propaganda by certain vested elements is the major contributing factor in increasing misconceptions and resistance to vaccination in the community, which is resulting in the hike of polio cases.

Therefore, he appealed to the parents to turn deaf ears to the propaganda and vaccinate their children against polio, protecting them from lifelong disabilities and deaths.

On examination, the tone and reflexes of the 17-month-old girl were found decreased in her right upper and lower limbs, whereas weakness has been found in all 4 limbs and the breathing muscles of the [older] (12-year-old) girl from D I Khan.

Regarding polio in higher-age groups, experts are of the view that poliomyelitis mainly affects young under-immunized children, but it can paralyze persons of any age, including adults, especially in settings where general population immunity is low.

Experts emphasize that when adults are affected, the results are devastating and often have a higher death rate. For example, when wild polio virus re-infected the republic of Congo in 2010-2011, almost 400 adults were paralyzed by polio in less than 6 months. Almost 50% of those affected died within days of contracting the virus.

Polio cases of higher age groups were also reported from Pakistan, and the case from D I Khan is the 2nd higher-aged group polio case reported from the country in 2019 so far.

An immediate meeting has been called upon at EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to analyze the situation and prepare for launching SNID from [17 Jun 2019] in the affected districts.

[These 2 newly confirmed cased were posted on the End Polio - Pakistan website today [Thu 23 May 2019] (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces and http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019). This is now the 3rd case reported from Mir Ali in the past few weeks and the 1st case reported from DI Khan this year (2019). One suspects that the 12-year-old girl, while having a history of routine vaccinations, was probably protected through the years due to the herd immunity effect, but with the increasing numbers of vaccine refusers was no longer protected due to large numbers of susceptibles surrounding her.

ref: Snider CJ, Zaman K, Estivariz CF, et al. Immunogenicity of full and fractional dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine for use in routine immunisation and outbreak response: an open-label, randomised controlled trial. Lancet. 2019. pii: S0140-6736(19)30503-3. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30503-3. [Epub ahead of print]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Intradermal administration of fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine (fIPV) is a dose-sparing alternative to the intramuscular full dose. We aimed to compare the immunogenicity of 2 fIPV doses versus one IPV dose for routine immunisation, and also assessed the immunogenicity of an fIPV booster dose for an outbreak response.

Methods
We did an open-label, randomised, controlled, inequality, non-inferiority trial in 2 clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Healthy infants were randomly assigned at 6 weeks to one of 4 groups: group A received IPV at age 14 weeks and IPV booster at age 22 weeks; group B received IPV at age 14 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks; group C received IPV at age 6 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks; and group D received fIPV at 6 weeks and 14 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks. IPV was administered by needle-syringe as an intramuscular full dose (0.5 mL), and fIPV was administered intradermally (0.1 mL of the IPV formulation was administered using the 0.1 mL HelmJect auto-disable syringe with a Helms intradermal adapter). Both IPV and fIPV were administered on the outer, upper right thigh of infants. The primary outcome was vaccine response to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at age 22 weeks (routine immunisation) and age 26 weeks (outbreak response). Vaccine response was defined as seroconversion from seronegative ([less than] 1:8) at baseline to seropositive ([greater than or equal to] 1:8) or 4-fold increase in reciprocal antibody titres adjusted for maternal antibody decay and was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (infants who received polio vaccines per group assignment and polio antibody titre results to serotypes 1, 2, and 3 at 6, 22, 23, and 26 weeks of age). The non-inferiority margin was 12.5%.

Findings
Between 1 Sep 2016 and 2 May 2017, 1076 participants were randomly assigned and included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 271 in group A, 267 in group B, 268 in group C, and 270 in group D. Vaccine response at 22 weeks to 2 doses of fIPV (group D) was significantly higher (p [less than] 0.0001) than to one dose of IPV (groups A and B) for all 3 poliovirus serotypes: the type 1 response comprised 212 (79% [95% CI 73-83]) versus 305 (57% [53-61]) participants; the type 2 response comprised 173 (64% [58-70]) versus 249 (46% [42-51]) participants; and the type 3 response comprised 196 (73% [67-78]) versus 196 (36% [33-41]) participants. At 26 weeks, the fIPV booster was non-inferior to IPV (group B vs group A) for serotype 1 (-1.12% [90% CI -2.18 to -0.06]), serotype 2 (0.40% [-2.22 to 1.42]), and serotype 3 (1.51% [-3.23 to -0.21]). Of 129 adverse events, 21 were classified as serious including one death; none were attributed to IPV or fIPV.

Interpretation
fIPV appears to be an effective dose-sparing strategy for routine immunisation and outbreak responses.

[In April 2016, there was a worldwide cessation of the use of the trivalent oral poliovirus (tOPV) and a switchover to the use of a bivalent OPV, without the OPV2 virus. Unfortunately, there has been a shortage of the IPV, leaving a number of countries where children were not being protected against any form of the poliovirus type 2 (wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus). In addition, with the planned cessation of OPV as part of the endgame strategy for polio eradication and the current observed shortages of IPV, the demonstrated value of use of fIPV doses will reduce the economic burden of IPV as well will allow for more doses of vaccine being available (the fractional dose is 1/5 of the currently used dose). - Mod.MPP]
