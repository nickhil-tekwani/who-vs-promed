The World Health Organization is scaling up its response to an outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria, which has spread to 17 states and may have infected up to 450 people in less than 5 weeks.

From the onset of the outbreak, WHO Nigeria deployed staff from the national and state levels to support the Government of Nigeria's national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre and state surveillance activities. WHO is helping to coordinate health actors and is joining rapid risk assessment teams travelling to hot spots to investigate the outbreak.

Between 1 Jan and 4 Feb 2018, nearly 450 suspected cases were reported, of which 132 are laboratory confirmed Lassa fever. Of these, 43 deaths were reported, 37 of which were lab confirmed.

The acute viral haemorrhagic fever is endemic in Nigeria but for the current outbreak the hot spots are the southern states of Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi.

"The high number of Lassa fever cases is concerning. We are observing an unusually high number of cases for this time of year." said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative to Nigeria.

Among those infected are 11 health workers, 4 of whom have died. WHO is advising national authorities on strengthening infection, prevention, and control practices in healthcare settings. Healthcare workers caring for Lassa fever patients require extra infection and control measures, including the use of personal protective equipment [PPE] to prevent contact with patients' bodily fluids.

With the increase in the number of cases, WHO initially donated personal protective equipment to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and to the affected states and procured laboratory reagents to support the prompt diagnosis of Lassa fever. WHO is deploying international experts to coordinate the response, strengthen surveillance, provide treatment guidelines, and engage with communities to raise awareness on prevention and treatment.

Lassa fever is endemic to several West African countries. Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have all reported cases in the past month. WHO is working with countries in the region to strengthen coordination and cross-border cooperation.

[The activities for WHO collaboration are essential for surveillance and for treatment of Lassa fever cases. Prevention of infection among healthcare workers is critical to prevent nosocomial transmission. In deciding when to don PPE, the challenge for these workers is to recognize that their patients have Lassa fever early in the infection, when the symptoms are general and typical of many other kinds of infections.

Engaging with communities at risk of infection is also a challenge. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.

No fewer than 40 people who came in contact with a young man who reportedly died of Lassa fever have been placed under intensive medical examinations.

This is even as Osun State Government said despite the incident, there is no outbreak of Lassa fever disease in any part of the state.

The State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Adelani Baderinwa, said in a statement that there is no cause for panic by residents of the state over the alleged spread of the disease in the state. Baderinwa said there has not been any report on the spread of the disease by the medical personnel who are observing these people at the isolated centre.

According to him, "There is no reason for anybody to panic on the report of a suspected Lassa fever case in the state. What was reported is an isolated death case of a young man who came from a neighbouring state. The young man who was suspected of carrying Lassa fever disease from the neighbouring state died at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex [OAUTHC], Ile-Ife.

"As a proactive measure, the medical personnel had to quarantine those who had contact with the strayed deceased for observation. This is a normal medical procedure, and does not mean the quarantined people are possibly carrying Lassa fever disease.

"As at today [13 Feb 2018], there has not been any other confirmed Lassa fever case except that of the young man from a neighbouring state that died at the OAUTHC.

"All necessary steps to prevent the outbreak of this disease or any other one in Osun had been pro actively taken. Filth and dirt's are been regularly taken care of, while medical personnel had been on red alert to ensure any unexpected disease outbreak is contained.

"As far as prevention is concerned, Osun government has been proactive while all curative efforts are already set in place. We urge people to make sure that their environment is clean and keep their foodstuffs away from rodents," [he said].

Meanwhile, medical doctors in the State have visited major markets in Osogbo, Osun State Capital to sensitise traders on Lassa fever. The Chairman of NMA [Nigerian Medical Association] in the state, Dr Tokunbo Olajumoke, led the team of doctors to Akindeko and Olu-Ode markets where they addressed the traders and educated them on the existence of Lassa fever, the symptoms of the disease, and the appropriate steps to take in case such symptoms are noticed. Olajumoke told the traders that the outbreak of Lassa fever in Ondo state was a delicate signal for the people of Osun state and urged the traders to be careful with rats on the raw foodstuff.

"The vector (rats) are very close to the people in the market and when they (rats) touch what they (traders) sell, the buyers who consume the food would be infected. It is very paramount to sensitize the traders on this and that's why we embarked on this awareness tour to major markets in Osogbo [capital of Osun state] and we are talking to the people in the local language and in a manner that they can understand and get the message so that we can prevent Lassa fever rather than waiting to treat people when infected," [he added]. "As you are aware, Lassa fever is already ravaging Ondo state which is very close to Osun."

"We have recorded a death in Osun as a result of Lassa fever at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital in Osun and it was confirmed.

"Also, 40 people are currently quarantined at isolated centers and they are under close examination to determine if they have been infected. We realised that prevention is better than cure and that was why we came out to sensitize traders today," [he continued].

The leader of the market women at Akindeko market, Alhaja Sidikat Abidogun, after listening to the doctors, commended the NMA for the initiative and urged the doctors to intensify the campaign and cover more markets so that the majority of the people would be aware of the scourge.

[The report above does not indicate from which neighboring state the infected young man came. The proactive efforts of the Osun state health authorities are prudent to be able to identify any new cases among the contacts being monitored. These officials are also wisely utilizing the opportunity to educate merchants and traders about Lassa fever and its epidemiology.

Osun state is located in inland southwestern Nigeria. A map of the state and information about it can be accessed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osun_State. - Mod.TY
