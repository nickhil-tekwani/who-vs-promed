[In the previous ProMED-mail post [Avian influenza, human (84): China H7N9 132nd case 20130529.1744319] the Xinhua News Agency report identified the 132nd and most recent confirmed case to be only the 2nd case in Beijing. Dr Dudley points out that this case is in fact the 3rd case in Beijing (as was in fact correctly recorded earlier in item [4] of ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (47): China H7N9 update 20130415.1647864). - Mod.CP]

The 2nd case was a 4 year old boy who lived near the Beijing index case. This 2nd confirmed case isn't included in the running "official" WHO/China CDC tallies because it was an asymptomatic case, and as such excluded because the official case definition requires ILI presentation.

Local health authorities traced the boy's case to the village he lives in. The father of the 1st person infected in Beijing, the 7 year old girl, sold poultry to villagers. Authorities took throat swabs from 24 people with high risk of getting the virus, and the city's CDC found the virus in the boy's specimen.

A family that lives across the street from the boy's house bought chicken from the father of the 7 year old girl, but health authorities failed to find the cause of the 4 year old's infection because the chicken had already been eaten, he added.

Details of this 2nd case are described in detail in the following report from the People's Daily of 16 Apr 2013 at http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/8209048.html

4 year old boy's case suggests virus immunity
---------------------------------------------
A 4 year old boy in Beijing confirmed as an H7N9 flu virus carrier who has not yet shown symptoms may be an indication that some people are immune to the disease, a health official has said. The Beijing Municipal Health Bureau said in a statement on Monday [15 Apr 2013] that the boy tested positive for the H7N9 flu virus at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency suspected his case might have been caused by chicken that was resold by the family of a 7 year old girl who became Beijing's 1st H7N9 case on Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

The boy, who is being monitored at Beijing Ditan Hospital, has not shown any symptoms of the virus, a possible indicator of immunity, said Zhong Dongbo, deputy chief of the municipal health bureau. "If we can find a large number of carriers of the virus who show no symptoms, that means an immunity barrier could exist among human beings and the virus could disappear eventually," Zhong told a news conference. Because many cases of infection in East China have been severe, the diagnosis of the boy who has shown no symptoms indicates that the H7N9 virus can also lead to mild or even no symptoms. Confirmation of the boy as a virus carrier also further corroborated the source of the infection as poultry, he said.

Local health authorities traced the boy's case to the village he lives in. The father of the 1st person infected in Beijing, the 7 year old girl, sold poultry to villagers. Authorities took throat swabs from 24 people with a high risk of getting the virus, and the city's CDC found the virus in the boy's specimen. A family that lives across the street from the boy's house bought chicken from the father of the 7 year old girl, but health authorities failed to find the cause of the 4 year old's infection because the chicken had already been eaten, he added.

Despite the health bureau's report, Jiang Rongmeng, chief physician at the Infection Center of Ditan Hospital, believes it is premature to call the boy a virus carrier. "When people infected have a strong immunity, they will naturally recover. The other possibility is an apparent infection like hepatitis B," he said. "We need to further observe this flu virus to see how it will develop inside humans."

The boy's case was discovered as disease control and prevention authorities in Chaoyang district stepped up efforts to monitor a group of high risk from the H7N9 virus, which is mainly poultry industry workers. As in the girl's case, the parents of the boy trade poultry in Naidong village, Cuigezhuang township in Chaoyang district. The boy's parents and his elder sister are also under medical observation at hospitals, and the other people who were given tests were under watch in the village. The discovery of an H7N9 case has shocked Naidong village, as authorities stepped up disinfections and checks for poultry products.

A village official named Zhang estimated that more than 2000 migrant workers are living in rented houses in the village, in addition to the 400 households. At the village's entrance, security guards were inspecting all vehicles and pedestrians in and out of the village on Monday afternoon [15 Apr 2013] for poultry products. Inside the gatehouse were dozens of bags of refrigerated chicken that had been confiscated from villagers. The village committee broadcast over loudspeakers that villagers should report to authorities any cases of fever. Poultry products, including pickled and pot-stewed duck and chicken, have been banned from the market.
