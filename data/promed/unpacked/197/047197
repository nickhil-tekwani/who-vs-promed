An Asian elephant at the Oregon Zoo has tested positive for tuberculosis, officials said [Thu 20 Apr 2017], less than 3 months after beloved elephant Packy was euthanized due to a drug-resistant form of the disease.

Preliminary test results for Sung-Surin, a 34-year-old pachyderm, came back positive on [Wed 19 Apr 2017] and veterinarians at the zoo quarantined the female elephant from the rest of the herd and were preparing to begin administering antibiotics. Sung-Surin is Thai for "sunshine" and she is often referred to simply as Shine.

"Getting these kinds of results early is critical for effective treatment," Tim Storms, the zoo's lead veterinarian, said in a statement. "Shine has not shown any signs of illness, and with the proper medical care we're optimistic that she never will. Our elephant-care team has great relationships with her, and that should be very helpful throughout the treatment process." It will take another 2 to 3 weeks to confirm the preliminary results, Storms said, but officials are taking every precaution.

Storms also said having another elephant come down with the disease, so shortly after Packy's death was more than disconcerting. Packy was one of the oldest captive pachyderms in North America at the time of his death at age 54, and one of the oldest anywhere on the planet. In 2013, he was 1st diagnosed with tuberculosis, which ultimately claimed his life. "It's heartbreaking to be in this situation again. She's an important member of the family here," he said. "There's definite concern over the recurrence especially after we thought we were in good shape."

Storms added that he felt the zoo had been "over the top" in safety protocols and precautions recommended by experts and put in place to protect the animals. It was too early to tell where the source of Shine's tuberculosis, but the zoo would nonetheless be reviewing their practices to see what else can be done to keep the elephants safe.

Elephants at the zoo are routinely tested for tuberculosis, Storms said, and public health authorities were notified immediately of the positive result [Wed 19 Apr 2017]. Safety protocols were swiftly put into place, officials said, to minimize risk to both animals and zoo goers. "We have a long history of working collaboratively with zoo leadership with the safety of people and animals as the top priorities," Jennifer Vines, deputy health officer for Multnomah County, said in a statement.

The zoo itself has a history of dealing with tuberculosis in its elephant herd. In recent years, the zoo successfully treated 2 of its elephants, Rama and Tusko. The zoo had less success with its elder elephant statesman, Packy, who developed a drug-resistant form of the disease. At 54, Packy's age, his unpredictable hormonal cycle and reluctance to take oral medication contributed to the decision to euthanize the zoo's most popular animal in early February [2017]. That decision was not without controversy, though, as some zookeepers publicly questioned the timing of his death. Oregon Zoo staff disagreed on timing of Packy's death. While everyone agreed the 54-year-old elephant would have to be put down, some out the zoo thought it happened sooner than it needed to.

None of the other elephants at the zoo have tested positive for the disease, the zoo said, and Shine herself has shown no signs. She'll be kept away from the herd during the initial phase of her treatment.

[Packy was indeed a sad situation. We are hopeful Shine can be successfully treated, especially since it is early in the disease process. This article states that, ""We have a long history of working collaboratively with zoo leadership with the safety of people and animals as the top priorities," Jennifer Vines, deputy health officer for Multnomah County, said in a statement." A number of articles echo this statement. ProMED-mail has posted several of these, which also provide excellent history of the situation.

Briefly: TB isn't a disease that's typically transmitted from animals to humans. It usually happens the other way. Humans are the natural habitat for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. When animals become infected, it's called "reverse zoonosis". Cows, pigs, birds, meerkats, mongooses, and monkeys have all succumbed to the human bacterium. While a related bacterial species, _Mycobacteria bovis_, has been transmitted from cows to humans, usually by unpasteurized milk, elephants stand alone as the only recently documented cases of zoonotic transmission of _M. tuberculosis_.

Extracted from "Guidelines for the control of tuberculosis in elephants, 2008" (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/elephant/elephant_tb.pdf):

In mammals, the term "tuberculosis" is used to define disease caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (M. tb) complex organisms. The M. tb complex includes, _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, _M. africanum_, _M. microti_, _M. canetti_, _M. caprae_, and _M. pinnipedii_. A vaccine strain derived from _M. bovis_ (BCG) is sometimes included as a separate member of this complex.

The term "mycobacteriosis" refers to infection with any mycobacteria but is generally used to define disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). "Atypical mycobacteria" or "mycobacteria other than TB" (MOTT) are other terms used to describe this group. Most NTM are saprophytes found in soil or water but they may occasionally cause disease in humans and animals, including elephants.

_M. tuberculosis_ is the predominant disease-causing agent in elephants although cases caused by _M. bovis_ have occurred. _Mycobacterium szulgai_, an uncommon NTM species, was associated with fatal disease in two African elephants (Lacasse 2007) and _Mycobacterium elephantis_, a rapidly growing mycobacterium, was isolated from a lung abscess of an elephant that died of chronic respiratory disease (Shojaei 2000). _Mycobacterium avium_ is commonly isolated from elephants (Payeur 2002), but to date has not been associated with clinical disease.

To adequately address the concerns of TB in the general elephant population, all captive elephants should be tested annually by culture (truck washes, usually triple sample method) and by blood with the Elephant TB STAT-PAK® Assay. Samples for cultures should be collected by or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Collection of blood must be done in the presence of a licensed veterinarian and the ElephantTBSTAT-PAK® test must be performed as licensed.

Triple sample method: A method of culture collection whereby 3 samples are obtained on separate days. Trunk wash: A procedure used in elephants to obtain a sputum sample using one of the approved methods. Elephants must be trained to allow for a trunk wash-- pushing saline into the trunk and then sucking it back out-- rather like a sinus wash in people but is apparently more distasteful to the elephant. Trunk washes for culture are one of the first steps as it is relatively easy and non-invasive and is generally sent for culture.

Effective prophylactic therapy is defined as the administration of a specific number of doses of two anti-TB drugs within a specified time. It must be demonstrated that adequate anti-TB drug levels are achieved in the blood of the elephant under treatment. Acceptable anti-tuberculosis drugs include isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (ETH), or a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin, moxofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or enrofloxacin. Isoniazid is recommended as one of the two drugs if a known exposure case isolate is INH sensitive.

Prophylactic therapy is for 9 months can be administered using either of the following schedules:

Prophylactic Treatment Schedule 1 (preferred): Administer 2 anti-TB drugs daily for 9 months (270 total doses). The first 60 doses should be administered within a period of 90 days (i.e. no more than 30 days of "refused medication" should occur. It must be demonstrated that the elephant received 270 total doses at a dosage level sufficient to achieve adequate drug serum levels.

Prophylactic Treatment Schedule 2: Administer the 2 anti-TB drugs daily for two months (as above, the first 60 doses should be administered within a period of 90 days). Adequate levels of both drugs must be demonstrated in two serum samples collected approximately two weeks apart. Serum samples should be collected as soon as the elephant is accepting medication reliably. If acceptable levels (see below) are not achieved, the dosage should be adjusted and serum levels tested again (two samples collected approximately 2 weeks apart). It must be demonstrated that the elephant received the first 60 doses at a dosage level sufficient to achieve adequate drug serum levels. Once this has been demonstrated, administer the two drugs every other day but at twice the previous dosage level for an additional 9 months (105 total doses of every other day dosing plus the initial 60 doses for a total of 165 doses). It is not necessary to repeat serum drug levels when changing to the every other day schedule.

What caused Packy's infection? _Mycobacterium bovis_ or _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_? Was it genotyped and if so, was it genetically related to the strains causing the prior TB elephant infections at the Oregon zoo or to an isolate from a human source? Was Shine's infection a latent TB that was identified by TB skin or blood test (an IGRA or interferon-gamma release assay), or was the infection culture-positive? If culture-positive, was the isolate genotyped and if so, was the isolate genetically related to the strain causing Packy's illness? Knowing the answers will help delineate transmission pathways.

What antibiotics is Packy's strain resistant to? Are the vets assuming that the strain causing Shine's infection is similarly antibiotic-resistant? If so, how are they treating Shine? ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
