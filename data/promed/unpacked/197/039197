More than 11 000 villagers in Kampung Baru Sungai
Nipah, Kampung Sawah and Bukit Pelanduk will be
evacuated to enable the mass killing of pigs in the three
villages. The decision to evacuate villagers was taken
by the Cabinet task force on JE which held its first
meeting yesterday.
Three more people died yesterday while 17 other
suspected Japanese Encephalitis victims were
hospitalised as a second wave of panic hit Bukit
Pelandok following a rumour that the JE virus had gone
airborne.
More than 30 residents fled their homes in Bukit
Pelandok near Port Dickson after hearing rumours
spread by two foreign television crew members that the
disease affecting the area was an air-borne form of
Japanese Encephalitis.
The Veterinary Services Department was taken to task
yesterday for allowing the clubbing to death of infected
pigs.
Some 100 non-governmental organisations yesterday
took up the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) issue, saying the
Government should speed up actions to check the
outbreak.
The Penang Health Department will start vaccinating
children aged 15 years and below against the Japanese
Encephalitis (JE) virus beginning tomorrow.
Pigs infected by the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) must be
put down immediately, said the Chinese business
community. Leaders of various Chinese business
associations, including those involved in the pig-rearing
industry, said the Government should commence the
culling exercise immediately to curb the epidemic.

[It is highly irresponsible to go around telling people that JE virus
has "gone airborne." JE is mosquito-borne. As for Hendra virus, all
the evidence points to it being spread in urine, & perhaps by
exposure to infected blood (pig farmers, slaughterhouse workers)
