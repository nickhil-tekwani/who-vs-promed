Ebola Situation Report - 23 Sep 2015
---------------------------------
Summary
---------
There were 2 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 20 Sep [2015], both of which were in Guinea. Case incidence has remained below 10 cases per week since the end of July this year [2015]. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. Improvements to rapid and accurate case investigation and contact tracing, rapid isolation and treatment, and effective engagement with affected communities have all played a crucial part in reducing case incidence to its current low level. A refined phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola will build on these existing measures to drive case incidence to zero and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced surveillance capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, improved testing and counseling capacity as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors, and the increased use of innovative technologies -- from vaccines to rapid diagnostic tests -- are central to the phase-3 response framework. Accordingly, an increased emphasis will be placed on the monitoring and evaluation of these additional phase-3 measures in the coming weeks.

After recording 14 consecutive days with zero confirmed cases, 2 new confirmed cases were reported from Guinea during the week ending 20 Sep [2015]: a 10-year-old girl who died after moving from the Ratoma area of Conakry to Forecariah, and a 24-year-old woman who was identified as EVD-positive in the Dixinn area of Conakry. Neither case was a registered contact, although both cases have a strong epidemiological link to a probable case thought to have died from EVD at the end of August [2015], Investigations incorporating genetic sequencing of Ebola virus from both confirmed cases suggest they are part of the Ratoma chain of transmission, the only chain of transmission known to be currently active (past 21 days) in Guinea.

No new confirmed cases were reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 20 Sep [2015]. Over 700 contacts have been identified in association with the previous week's reported case from Bombali: a 16-year-old girl identified as EVD-positive after post-mortem testing. Investigations into the origin of her infection have not yet concluded, but preliminary findings suggest that a survivor may have been the source.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. A total of 719 samples were tested by 8 operational laboratories in Guinea in the week to 20 Sep [2015]. Analyses of the geographical distribution of samples collected indicate that 21 of 34 Guinean prefectures did not collect any samples from either live or dead suspected cases of EVD over the 1-week period. Over the same period, 1887 samples were collected from 100 per cent (14 of 14) of districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories. In Liberia, 1435 samples were collected from 100 per cent (15 of 15) of counties in the week to 20 Sep [2015], although the capacity of the country's 3 operational laboratories is not currently sufficient to rapidly test all samples. Surveillance in the 3 countries will be enhanced in line with the phase-3 response framework.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak, there have been a total of 28 295 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 20 Sep [2015], with 11 295 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). Two new cases, both from Guinea, were reported in the week to 20 Sep [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 years of age are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone. Adults aged 45 years and above are approximately 5 times more likely to be affected in Guinea, and approximately 4 times more likely in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 20 Sep [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[3] Ebola survivors suffer complications
Date: Wed 23 Sep 2015
Source: The New Dawn [edited]
http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/news/8487-ebola-survivors-suffer-complications


More than a year after the Ebola outbreak that left about 4000 Liberians dead, survivors here are said to be experiencing a series of health complications, including severe body pains, visual problems, impotency, miscarriage and still birth, among others.

Some 3000 Ebola survivors, including women and children, have been documented across the country since the disease was defeated last year [2014]. The Principal Investigator for the Ebola Natural History Study at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Masoka Fallah, said that due to health complications, some survivors have begun to lose their jobs.

Briefing reporters on Tue 22 Sep 2015 at the Ministry of Information on Capitol Hill, he said that to establish a trend of these health problems survivors are faced with, an historical study was launched on 17 Jun 2015 at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Monrovia.

The study is being conducted by the Liberia-United States Joint Clinical Research Partnership or PREVAIL. Dr. Fallah added that through an appeal by former Health Minister Dr. Walter Gwenigale, the National Institute of Health has been helping the Liberian government in conducting the study, which will last for 5 years to establish causes for the complications and find solutions.

He said the Ministry of Health will have to survey the entire population to find out whether these sicknesses are common among Liberians, including close contacts or relatives of Ebola survivors. Therefore, a month ago, the ministry brought an eye specialist to examine eyes of survivors, targeting about 1500 of them.

Dr. Fallah disclosed that a total of 743 persons have enrolled in the study, among them 415 females and 328 males with 663 survivors. The Principal Investigator said the Health Ministry is working along with the Ebola Survivors Network to engage in social mobilization to encourage more survivors into the study, while stressing: "We need to attack the problems the survivors are faced with before it becomes serious problem."

For her part, the director for operation at the National Institute of Health based in the United States, Dr. Laura McNay, described the 1-year partnership with the Ministry of Health as great, adding that they were able to train many Liberians in clinical research. The World Health Organization has declared Liberia Ebola-free and formally certificated the country twice.

[A 16-year-old girl from Connecticut (USA) has won the Google Science Fair with her fast and cheap test that doesn't require refrigeration (as do current tests) and could potentially detect the Ebola virus in under 30 minutes. She wrote in her project description "Current Ebola detection methods are complex, expensive, require unbroken refrigeration from manufacture to use and up to 12 hours from testing to confirmed diagnosis." The [test] provides rapid, inexpensive, and accurate detection of Ebola viral antigens based on color change within 30 minutes in individuals prior to their becoming symptomatic and infectious." The test has proven to be able to detect a protein from the Ebola virus. As winner of the Science Fair, she was awarded USD 50 000 in scholarship funding by Google.]
