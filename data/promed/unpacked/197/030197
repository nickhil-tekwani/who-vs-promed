Government Starts Yellow Fever Vaccination
---------------------
THE Government has begun a massive vaccination against yellow fever on the
borders with Sudan, following an outbreak of the epidemic in Southern
Sudan, writes Vision Reporter.
The Director General of Health Services, Prof. Francis Omaswa, yesterday
said the vaccination started a month ago using a local stock of vaccines.
"About a month ago we received reports of an Ebola outbreak in Southern
Sudan but on diagnosis, we discovered it was yellow fever.
"We are now vaccinating in areas along the common border," said Omaswa at
the opening of the ministerial conference. Meanwhile, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) has said it is sourcing funds to avail more yellow fever
vaccines to Uganda. WHO representative in Uganda Dr. Oladapo Walker refuted
claims that the UN agency had denied Uganda vaccines, awaiting an outbreak
first.
"WHO is fully committed to providing every single vial of yellow fever
vaccine to the border districts. We have completed the paper work and funds
are being sourced," he said.
A WHO official on Tuesday told the conference that the International
Coordinating Group, responsible for the procurement of vaccines at
subsidised rates, had refused to release the yellow fever vaccines to Kenya
and Uganda, saying there was no outbreak in the 2countries bordering Sudan.
WHO officials disclosed that there was acute shortage of the vaccine
throughout the world.
They said only 6 million doses were currently available globally and their
disbursement was restricted to epidemic situations.
WHO representative in Kenya Dr. Peter Eriki said the vaccines were very
expensive on the open market for many developing countries.

[Kayunga district is approximately 75 kilometers to the Northeast of
Kampala, bordering the Victoria Nile river and distant from the Sudan
border where the most recent yellow fever activity has been reported (see
ProMED-mail postings below on yellow fever in Uganda. A good map of Uganda
is available at:
<http://www.reliefweb.int/w/map.nsf/0/BFFF0FA67A1CDD7985256CDB005A04CC?Opendocument>)
While Uganda is in the yellow fever endemic belt of Africa, this is the
first report of yellow fever from Uganda carried on ProMED-mail. More
information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
