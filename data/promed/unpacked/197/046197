The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of Taiwan confirmed on Fri 15
Apr 2011 the 1st imported case of cholera of 2011 and advised the
public to take extra precautions when traveling to Southeast Asian
countries with a high prevalence of the disease.

A 29 year old resident of southern Taiwan was suspected of having
contracted cholera after experiencing painless diarrhea and vomiting
upon her return from a 4 day trip to Sabah, Malaysia. The health
authorities said grilled fish and shrimp she ate on a local beach
could have been the cause of transmission. She sought medical help on
1 Apr 2011, a day after her return, and was confirmed to be suffering
from cholera on 12 Apr 2011, according to the CDC.

The patient recovered, said CDC director-general Chou Jih-haw, who
added that her travel companions and 2 relatives living with her did
not present any symptoms.

in those with adequate sanitary systems, the risk of secondary cases
is minimal. Cases are occurring in the Malay state of Sabah as posted

[5] Cholera - Myanmar (Shan): reported

Cholera has broken out in quake-hit areas in Shan state, Myanmar's
north east, affecting 96 people, according to a local weekly on Tue 5
Apr 2011. Of them, 48 people were in serious condition due to
consumption of unclean drinking water and unhygienic toilet systems in
the region, the Messenger News said.

Due to a recent deadly earthquake that hit Myanmar's north east,
water supply pipes were destroyed, and water in the lake was
contaminated with waste emitting bad smells. Myanmar authorities are
carrying out relief work in the quake-hit areas, while the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is providing water purifying tablets
and toilet pipes.

A 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted Loimwe, 56 km south east of
Kengtung in north eastern Myanmar on the evening of 24 Mar 2011,
killing 73 people and injuring 125 others, according to official
estimation.

[6] Cholera - Myanmar (Shan): denied

The UN has said that reports circulating of cholera among victims of
last month's [March 2011] earthquake in Shan state are "absolutely
untrue," although the area has been hit by less severe illnesses.

The Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency claimed that 96 cases of the
contagious illness, 48 of which were serious, had been diagnosed in
the eastern Burmese state, where a 6.8 magnitude quake struck on 24
Mar 2011. It was quoting the Burmese domestic Messenger News journal.

The UN's spokesperson in Burma, Aye Win, told DVB, however, that he
was there at the weekend and no cases had been found, although local
groups had reported "sporadic cases of gastrointestinal diseases and
48 cases of diarrhea." He added that it was "regrettable" that the
false information had been repeated in other news reports, including
the UN's own ReliefWeb service.

[7] Cholera - Philippines (Palawan province)
Date: Thu 14 Apr 2011

An outbreak of cholera has killed 19 members of a remote
cave-dwelling Philippine tribe and sickened more than 400 others, the
government said on Thu 14 Apr 2011.

Poor hygiene and the isolation of the Palawanon tribe had made
treatment of the disease difficult, with doctors initially making a
wrong diagnosis of diarrhea, the health department said. The
government agency dispatched a medical team to the island of Palawan
last week to check the outbreak and concluded cholera was to blame,
said Manuel Mapue, the head of the mission.

"The whole area has no potable water system, and there are no
toilets. Being indigenous tribes, these people just defecate
anywhere," he told AFP. He said samples from the rivers used by the
tribe for drinking water showed they were contaminated with feces.

Previous news reports said as many as 30 people had died of the
illness, but a check found only 19 fatalities, said Mr Mapue.
