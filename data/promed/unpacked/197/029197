45 days after rabies attack, teen survives
----------------------------------------------
Only 6 such cases in India and 1st with chance of complete recovery.

A 13-year-old girl from Thane [Maharashtra], has been successfully treated for rabies a full month after she was exposed to the virus. While 5 cases of patients infected with the disease surviving its effects have been reported in India in the past 2 years, the teenager is the only one to mount a complete recovery, showing no signs of neurological damage after she received treatment.

According to Dr S Madhusudhana, a professor in the department of neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, and World Health Organisation (WHO) expert on rabies, the 5 other patients continue to display effects of the disease despite being rid of the virus. "They are all confined to the bed and suffering from neurological problems like paralysis and shock," he told Mumbai Mirror. He was consulted by doctors attending to [the girl] before her course began.

The girl from Thane, however, beat the odds. 20 days after she contracted rabies, and underwent an experimental regimen known to have limited efficacy, the girl was moved to a normal ward on [16 Dec 2014].

Post-treatment investigation suggested 70 percent reduction in rabies antibodies. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan conducted at Jupiter Hospital on [20 Dec 2014] revealed that the virus, which is neurotropic -- it penetrates the central nervous system and eventually makes its way to the brain -- had left no lasting neurological damage on [the girl], barring a minor problem with her vision. There is no other disorder that we detected," said the radiologist, Dr Amit Gaikwad, who performed the scan.

Case history
------------
On [28 Nov 2014], the Class 7 student at Thane Municipal School, collapsed in a fit of seizure. She was ferried to Sai Dham Nursing Home nearby, but doctors there were unable to detect the cause of her convulsions; [the girl] couldn't confirm if she had been bitten by a diseased animal. "She was breathless, hydrophobic, and behaving abnormally (hyperactive traits that are typical of furious rabies, which is caused by the virus replicating in the patient's limbic system, situated on either side of the thalamus, in the brain)," recounted her mother. "The doctors at the private clinic told us her chances of survival were limited. We immediately shifted her to the hospital in Kalwa [in northern Thane]."

Dr Shushil Sakhare and Dr Gyaneshwar Sonawane, residents at Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, which is affiliated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, were on duty when [the 13-year-old] was wheeled in. The 2 initially suspected she suffered from calcium deficiency and admitted her into the ICU and started her on a course of intravenous calcium.

A little while later, Dr Deepa Banjan, the senior physician from the department of medicine at the hospital, examined her and concluded that she had contracted rabies. "She wasn't eating anything; as soon as she had a sip of water, she began to hiccup; she was racked by violent spasms; she seemed terribly confused and she couldn't move certain parts of her body," Dr Banjan told Mumbai Mirror.

While every sign indicated rabies, the doctors were mystified as to the vector that infected the girl with the virus. "In my professional life of 20 years, I have encountered several rabies cases, but not one in which the patient or the people who brought the patient in had no clue how the disease had been transmitted," she said.

To confirm their clinical diagnosis, the doctors at the college reached out to one of the country's preeminent experts on viruses that affect the nervous system, Dr S Madhusudhana. "We sent them blood samples, cerebrospinal fluid, nuchal biopsy (scrapings of skin from the nape of the neck); and saliva," Dr Banjan said. To assist NIMHANS's investigation, the doctors from Thane included a video clip of [the girl's] behaviour. In his reply to her questions, Dr Madhusudhana said in an email, "We saw the video clips and [are] convinced that it is hydrophobia [rabies]."

Although they had little to work with, by a process of elimination and with advice from several experts, the team in Thane settled on a procedure known to virologists as Milwaukee protocol (MP), which was first attempted at a hospital in Wisconsin in 2004. It involved plunging [the patient] into an artificial, drug-induced coma and administering antiviral drugs, thereby creating a tourniquet of sorts -- protecting the brain from the invading virus while facilitating the production of antibodies to combat rabies; classic or encephalitic forms of the disease cause death when the virus attacks the brain.

"After we received the family's consent, we decided to begin MP," Dr Banjan said. "We sedated the patient and administered benzodiazepine (a psychoactive drug used to treat muscle spasms, seizures, and agitation) and ketamine (a pain killer); only the dosage was 15 times what we would give patients exhibiting these sorts of symptoms." This induced the therapeutic coma.

A week after she slipped into the coma, doctors administered ribavirin, an antiviral drug. "Progress was very slow," Dr Banjan admitted. "We supplemented this course with Ayurvedic [Hindu traditional medicine] extracts."

During this phase of her treatment, Dr Pradip Verma and Dr Rukmini Majunath, specialists in critical care, monitored her condition -- they were joined by a 4th member of the team Dr Kaivalya Gaikwad, a physician. "We didn't have to provide her ventilator support once during the therapy stage even though she was conscious but unresponsive during her time in the ICU," said Dr Verma.

According to Dr Madhusudhana, none of the 5 other survivors -- one each from Goa, Chandimandir Cantonment in Haryana, and Lucknow, and 2 from Mumbai -- received MP.

On [Wed 7 Jan 2015], before Mumbai Mirror visited [the girl] and her family in Thane, she was examined by the team. "She is absolutely fine now. We will repeat the MRI every 3 months to monitor the functioning of her brain," said Dr C Maitra, dean of the hospital.

Back home, [the girl] was her normal, teenage self -- eager to get back her school and friends. "For 20 days she was on intravenous fluid and though she felt thirsty, she couldn't stand the sight of water," her mother, said. "Now, she is eating. She is drinking water. And she is not scared."

[Though samples were taken and submitted for laboratory analysis, the results are not presented. Final diagnosis was based just on clinical signs. While the signs described are suggestive, virus recovery would be persuasive. This girl, either way, was very lucky to have survived and to have been under the care of her doctors. Treatment after signs have appeared is usually too late and death follows.

This report quotes 5 other recoveries in the past 2 years in India; see paragraph 2 above, 2nd sentence. But an earlier report has only 2 recoveries in India; see ProMED-mail post 20140915.2774778. Members should remember that the annual number of human rabies in India is in the hundreds, not single digits, and not all will be reliably diagnosed. But either way, this is a very interesting and encouraging report.
