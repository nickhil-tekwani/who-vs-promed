In a study of non-human primates infected with the influenza virus that
killed 50 million people in 1918, an international team of scientists has
found a critical clue to how the virus killed so quickly and efficiently.
Writing this week [Thu 18 Jan 2007] in the journal Nature, a team led by
University of Wisconsin-Madison virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka reveals how
the 1918 virus -- modern history's most savage influenza strain --
unleashed an immune response that destroys the lungs in a matter of days,
leading to death.
The finding is important because it provides insight into how the virus
that swept the world in the closing days of World War I was so efficiently
deadly, claiming many of its victims in the prime of life. The work
suggests that it may be possible in future outbreaks of highly pathogenic
flu to stem the tide of death through early intervention.
The study "proves the 1918 virus was indeed different from all of the other
flu viruses we know of," says Kawaoka, a professor in the UW-Madison School
of Veterinary Medicine and at the University of Tokyo. The new study,
conducted at the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, utilized the 1918 flu virus, which has
been reconstructed by researchers using genes obtained from the tissues of
victims of the great pandemic in a reverse genetics process that enables
scientists to make fully functioning viruses. [See: Nature 2005; 437: 794-5
(6 Oct) / doi: 10.1038/437794a

Mod CP.] "In 1918, the existence of viruses had barely been recognized. In
fact, the influenza virus wasn't identified until 1933. Thanks to recent
technological advancements, we are now able to study this virus and how it
wreaked havoc around the globe," explains Darwyn Kobasa, research scientist
with the Public Health Agency of Canada and lead author of the new study.
"This research provides an important piece in the puzzle of the 1918 virus,
helping us to better understand influenza viruses and their potential to
cause pandemics."
By infecting monkeys with the virus, the team was able to show that the
1918 virus prompted a deadly respiratory infection that echoed historical
accounts of how the disease claimed its victims. Importantly, the new work
shows that infection with the virus prompted an immune response that seems
to derail the body's typical reaction to viral infection and instead
unleashes an attack by the immune system on the lungs. As immune cells
attack the respiratory system, the lungs fill with fluid and victims, in
essence, drown.
The mechanisms that contribute to the lethality of the virus were uncovered
by University of Washington researchers using functional genomics, a
technique in which researchers analyze the gene functions and interactions.
Learning more about the virulence mechanisms of the 1918 flu virus may help
researchers understand how to keep the virus from causing such a severe
immune response.
"This study in macaques, combined with our earlier research showing the
host response in mice infected with the 1918 flu, suggests that the host
immune response is out of control in animals infected with the virus," says
Michael G Katze, professor of microbiology at the University of Washington
in Seattle, who led the functional genomics portion of the new study and
led the previous mouse-based study. "Our analysis revealed potential
mechanisms of virulence, which we hope will help us develop novel antiviral
strategies to both outwit the virus and moderate the host immune response."
The same excessive immune reaction is characteristic of the deadly
complications of H5N1 avian influenza, the strain of bird flu present in
Asia and which has claimed nearly 150 human lives, but has not yet shown a
capacity to spread easily among people. "What we see with the 1918 virus in
infected monkeys is also what we see with H5N1 viruses," Kawaoka says,
suggesting that the ability to modulate immune response may be a shared
feature of the most virulent influenza viruses.
In the new study, conducted in a high-level biosafety laboratory (BSL 4) at
the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, 7
primates were infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus. Clinical signs of
disease were apparent within 24 hours of infection, and within 8 days,
euthanization was necessary. The rapid course of the disease mirrors how
quickly the disease ran its course in its human victims in 1918. Upon
infection, the virus grew rapidly in the infected animals, suggesting the
agent somehow sets the stage for virulent infection. "Somehow, early in
infection, this virus does something to the host that allows it to grow
really well," says Kawaoka. "But we don't know what that is."
Knowing that the virus does something early in infection to trigger such a
devastating immune response may provide biomedical researchers with clues
about how to intervene and stop or mitigate the virus' potentially lethal
effects, Kawaoka says. "Things may be happening at an early time point (in
infection), but we may be able to step in and stop that reaction."
In addition to Kawaoka, authors of the new Nature paper include Darwyn
Kobasa, Steven M Jones, Hideki Ebihara, Friederike Feldman, Judie B
Alimonti, Lisa Fernando, Yan Li, and Heinz Feldman of Canada's National
Microbiology Laboratory; Kyoko Shinya of Japan's Tottori University; John C
Kash and Michael G Katze of the University of Washington; John Copps of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency's National Centre for Foreign Animal
Disease; and Yasuko Hatta, Jin Hyun Kim, Peter Halfmann, and Masato Hatta
of UW-Madison.
The new study was supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the
Japanese Ministries of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology,
and private grants to Kawaoka.
