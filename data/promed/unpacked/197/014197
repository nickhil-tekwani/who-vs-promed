Health authorities in Honduras are reporting a surge in the parasitic disease, leishmaniasis, seen primarily in Cortes department, according to a La Tribuna report (computer translated). The Health Ministry says more than 200 cases of leishmaniasis disease have been reported in 7 municipalities in the country including San Pedro, Sula, Choloma, Puerto Cortes, Omoa, Santa Cruz de Yojoa, Villanueva and Concepcion del Norte in Santa Barbara.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of the female sandfly. There are different forms of leishmaniasis.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects the skin and mucous membranes. Skin sores usually start at the site of the sandfly bite. In a few people, sores may develop on mucous membranes. Systemic, or visceral, leishmaniasis affects the entire body. This form occurs 2-8 months after a person is bitten by the sandfly. Most people do not remember having a skin sore. This form can lead to deadly complications. The parasites damage the immune system by decreasing the numbers of disease-fighting cells.

[Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), have been reported. CL occurs especially along the Caribbean coast, but cases have been reported in the El Paraiso department, in the central south-eastern region of Honduras, and also in the north (Alvar J, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 7(5): e35671. Annex 42 Honduras).

About 1500 cases of CL (_Leishmania infantum_) are notified annually, with an incidence of 0.5 per 10 000 inhabitants, although there is considerable underreporting. The main reservoir is dogs.

VL has been present since 1974 and a total of 300 cases have been notified. The incidence is 0.03 per 10 000 inhabitants. The most important focus of VL is in southern Honduras, in the departments of Choluteca, Valle and El Paraiso, and is restricted to the arid hills close to the Pacific, overlapping with atypical CL (Ponce C, et al. Leishmania donovani chagasi: new clinical variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Honduras. Lancet 1991;337:67-70). - Mod.EP
