Described by scientists as the biggest disease epidemic ever observed in wild marine animals, Sea star Wasting Syndrome has killed millions of starfish along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska over the past 6 years. Affecting 20 species, the disease causes the sea stars' limbs to fall off before their bodies disintegrate into liquid.

The epidemic is understood to be naturally occurring, but a new scientific study of data provided by scuba divers has indicated that climate change appears to have weakened the starfish, making them more susceptible to the disease.

The researchers, from universities in North America and elsewhere, focused on the hard-hit common sunflower seastar (_Pycnopodia helianthoides_), which has now been eradicated across most of its range.

The researchers found that divers were less likely to see living sea stars in nearshore waters when water temperatures were abnormally high. Determining why warm waters should have this effect was outside the scope of the study but they speculated that elevated temperatures affected the sea stars' simple immune systems.

The survey also confirmed that the mass die-off of starfish was having a domino effect on oceanic eco-systems. Without starfish to prey on them, kelp-eating sea urchins were proliferating - and eating their way unchecked through the kelp-forest habitats on which many other species depend.

[The article referred to can be accessed at http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau7042.abstract. They found that the timing of peak declines in nearshore waters coincided with anomalously warm sea surface temperatures.

Mass mortalities of echinoids (sea stars) as a result of disease have been widely reported from all over the world. Wasting disease has been observed in sea stars in the west coast of USA periodically during warm-water years since it was 1st recognized in 1978 and was especially prevalent during the 1982-1984 El Niño. The episodes that have been occurring since 2013 have spread throughout the west coast of North America, from Baja California to Alaska. There is no association with El Niño.

A few years ago, a densovirus was found associated with the syndrome, but as the pathogen appears to be part of the natural sea star parasite community, it is important to determine why it is causing mass mortalities. It is clear that it is not merely acting as a natural mechanism of population control, as death rates are unprecedented. The hypothesis that seems to have more support is that physiological condition of sea stars deteriorated due to anthropogenic stressors and therefore they became more susceptible to normally tolerated pathogens. This new evidence points to climate change. Stressors such as a warmer sea surface may disrupt host-pathogen relationships. When the stress-host-parasite equilibrium is broken, the tolerance and resistance to parasites is reduced and hosts become increasingly deteriorated. Both exposure to transmissible diseases and host susceptibility to infection increase, resulting in a vicious circle (for a review on the subject see <www.dx.doi.org/10.14409/favecv.v14i1/2.5160>).
