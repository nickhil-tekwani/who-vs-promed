SALT LAKE CITY -- Federal officials trying to stop the spread of equine
infectious anemia virus (EIA) infections decided Monday to hold a foal and
its mother for observation after tests showed the colt may be infected. If
additional tests are positive, the animal would be the first known case of
EIA found in a herd of wild horses roaming the remote canyons and mesas of
eastern Utah. The horse also would have to be destroyed.
The animals under observation were captured as part of a mass roundup of as
many as 500 horses when an outbreak of the disease was reported on the
adjacent Ute Indian Reservation earlier this year.
State wildlife officials and the federal Bureau of Land Management have
tested 171 horses, whose results were negative. Authorities were set to
move the roundup to an area where it is more likely they may find infected
horses.
Officials released 108 horses back into the wild on Saturday. But after a
test on the foal came back ambiguous, the young animal was held, along with
its mother and another companion mare and foal, until further tests are
completed.
"This [test positive foal could complicate things," said Glenn Foreman, a
burro and wild horse information officer with the BLM. "What it could mean
is that we will have to come back to this area and resume testing."
The virus is transmitted by bloodsucking insects. Roughly one-third of
infected animals die and the others become carriers. While the normal
incidence of infection is far below 1 percent, Ute officials reported 14
percent of horses on the adjacent preservation had tested positive for the
disease.
Animals rights activists have opposed the helicopter roundup during the
foaling season, when the young animals and mares are susceptible to stress.
Two horses have died from injuries suffered during the roundup. The agency
responded by scaling it back only to areas where there is a high
probability of finding the disease. Any horses testing positive would be
killed.
