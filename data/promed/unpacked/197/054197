The Mesa County Health Department is warning the public that a rabbit has tested positive for tularemia.

Authorities say the bacterial infection, also known as 'rabbit fever', was detected in an animal found on the east side of the Colorado National Monument.

The health department has received reports of multiple rabbits dying in the area; officials are warning outdoor enthusiasts, gardeners, and pet owners to avoid contact with wildlife.

Health experts say the disease is spread most often through bites from fleas and ticks. Since animals can pass the condition on to people, officials are urging pet owners to check their 4-legged friends for the bugs.

Symptoms can include a high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The illness can range from mild to life-threatening, but experts say it is treatable with antibiotics.
