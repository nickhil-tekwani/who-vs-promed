Bird flu spreads from Western Siberia to South Urals
--------------------------------------------------
About 113 000 birds have died as a result of bird flu spreading in Russia,
the Agriculture Ministry said Wednesday [17 Aug 2005].
The ministry's press release cites specific figures in 6 regions of Western
Siberia and South Urals hit by the disease.
"According to the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Supervision, some 11 100 birds have died in the region's 13 districts," the
press release said.
Lab tests confirmed the disease in 6 populated areas of the Altai
territory, and the disease is suspected to have spread to another 12
populated areas in the region.
The veterinary service said the bird flu hit 6 areas in the Tyumen region,
killing 18 100 birds.
In the Omsk region, the disease was discovered in 6 populated areas, where
some 6000 birds have been killed. Over 5000 birds were killed in the Kurgan
region, with the disease confirmed in 6 settlements and suspected in 12
others. In the Chelyabinsk region, 2 populated areas have been hit by the
bird flu and nearly 500 birds killed.
The veterinary service said bird flu had been confirmed in 15 settlements
in the Novosibirsk region, with another 25 suspected. "Some 70 000 birds
have been killed in 10 areas," the press release said.
The veterinary service said bird flu had been confirmed in Russia's 35
populated areas, with another 69 suspected.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza reported to be spreading into western Russia
--------------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) seems to have spread westward in
Russian bird populations. Authorities are reporting new outbreaks of
infections in birds at 15 poultry farms around the city of Chelyabinsk,
immediately east of the Ural mountains [1]. Preliminary results of
polymerase chain reaction testing have indicated that this is type A/H5N1,
which has also recently caused outbreaks in birds in South-East and Central
Asia, and Siberia [2].
These preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by an international
reference laboratory. Russian authorities are reported to be monitoring the
human situation by daily home visits in the affected villages.
An avian influenza outbreak caused by another HPAI virus type, A/H7N7,
occurred in 2003 in the Netherlands, with 89 PCR-confirmed human cases in
people who had close contact with infected poultry or with poultry workers
[3,4,5]. The A/H7N7 virus is considerably less pathogenic for humans than
A/H5N1. Because of the threat of spread of the A/H5N1 virus by wild birds
on their east-west migrating routes to the Netherlands [6], on 16 August,
the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality advised
commercial poultry farmers to keep poultry indoors at least until the
beginning of 2006 [7]. This measure is designed to prevent contact between
farmed birds and migratory birds which could be carrying A/H5N1.
Although EU Member States are strengthening their preparedness for a
potential human influenza pandemic, preparedness for outbreaks on poultry
farms also needs to be improved. Plans should include measures to protect
individuals involved in the direct management of any HPAI outbreaks and
minimise the risk for viral reassortment in humans and other animals [8],
drawing on the experiences of controlling the Asian outbreaks by the Food
and Agriculture Organization
<http://www.fao.int>),
Organisation Mondiale de la Sante Animale (OIE,
<http://www.oie.int>)
and the World Health Organization
(<http://www.who.int>) [9,10].
Effective preparedness and timely control of such outbreaks relies on a
close collaboration between public health and veterinary sectors. Some
European countries have or are developing integrated plans for the event of
A/H5N1 occurring in EU poultry flocks.
