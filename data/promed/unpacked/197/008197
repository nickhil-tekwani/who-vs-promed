Ecuador reported its 1st case of human transmission of bird flu in a 9-year-old girl, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday [10 Jan 2023], marking a rare case of human infection a month after the country declared an animal health emergency.

Human illness from bird flu infections have ranged from no symptoms to mild illness to severe disease resulting in death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advised that spread between humans is very rare.

Bird flu wiped out tens of millions of birds last year [2022] across the United States, which reported a 1st human case last April [2022]. Many of the birds were slaughtered to stop the disease from spreading.

Ecuador's Health Ministry said humans and animals in the area where the child was infected in the central province of Bolivar were being closely monitored for transmission.

It did not report on the girl's condition.

"It is presumed that the infection occurred through direct contact with birds that carried the virus," the ministry added. "So far, no other cases have been reported in humans."

Ecuador declared an animal health emergency in late November [2022] and an epidemiological alert in December [2022] after an outbreak had been detected in the provinces of Cotopaxi and Bolivar, where thousands of birds were slaughtered to contain the disease.

The government assured that the consumption of eggs and chicken meat does not represent a risk to human health. It recommended strengthening "biosecurity" measures and seeking medical help in case of symptoms related to influenza.

[Thanks to Mahmoud for providing the government's Twitter link (https://twitter.com/Salud_Ec/status/1613011405543702530) which notes it is an H5 variant. It is most likely H5N1 given the ongoing HPAI H5N1 outbreaks across much of the globe, and multiple current outbreaks/first reports in the Americas. As ProMED reported on 5 Jan 2023 (20230106.8707652), HPAI H5N1 cases in wild or backyard birds were documented in multiple Central and South American countries, likely coinciding with the arrival of migratory birds for the winter from Canada and the northern US. With HPAI H5N1 having passed through millions of birds globally, one has to wonder at what point enough mutations will accumulate to enable more routine transmission to and among humans. - Mod.JH

In a post from earlier today, ProMED reported that avian influenza (presumably HPAI H5N1) has been detected in a backyard premise in Bolivar, the province where the above human case occured. The first time that Ecuador reported HPAI H5 avian influenza in poultry was in November 2022 at a poultry farm in Cotopaxi province. These two reports are included below under See Also. -Mod.LXL
