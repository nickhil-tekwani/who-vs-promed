The CMI Description #286 for _Puccinia pittieriana_ indicates that this is
a pathogen of potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) and tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_), plus some wild _Solanum_ spp. including _S. demissum_ (used
for breeding pest/disease resistant and cold tolerant potatoes). The
pathogen is restricted to Mexico, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,
Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela (Bolivia has been taken off this list from
the CMI Distribution Map of Plant Diseases No. 113, Ed 3, 1994 to comply
with this recent announcement). The rust is microcyclic. The disease is
apparently not a major impediment to modern potato production; most of the
literature on this disease is quite old. The lack of suitable overseasoning
hosts is thought to be the reason potato rust is not more widespread in
other potato-growing areas of the world.

[Most fungal rust species have several spore forms which appear in a
definite progression. According to the CMI description of _P.
pittieriana_, teliospores and basidiospores are the only spore forms known,
hence this fungus is microcyclic (short cycle). Eight other microcyclic
rusts infect Solanum species around the world. Thanks to Timothy Schubert
of the Plant Industry Division, Florida Department of Agriculture, for
providing a succinct summary of the information about the pathogen and the
disease. - Mod.DH
