Re: ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - Canada: (ON) fatal 20150123.3112589
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fact that blastomycosis is not a notifiable disease in Canada has always puzzled me. As my colleagues Dr Shaun Morris, Dr Susan Richardson, and others demonstrated previously, Northwestern Ontario is a North American hotspot for blasto (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373107/).

It is actually quite difficult to get estimates of blasto incidence in Ontario in the absence of a surveillance program: for many in Northwestern Ontario, the closest tertiary care medical centre is across the provincial border in Winnipeg, Manitoba. As healthcare is a provincial responsibility in Canada, integration of healthcare and lab data for blasto would require cross-jurisdictional cooperation and would be challenging without some kind of regulatory mandate.

The notion that the disease is not notifiable because it isn't communicable doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. We have many examples of excellent surveillance systems for chronic diseases, and risk factors for disease, in both Canada and the US. The importance of surveillance relates to the notion that we have to understand the magnitude and nature of a problem in order to mitigate or solve it, not simply whether a given disease is communicable. In fact, blasto risk in Canada may be quite dynamic (we don't know). Climate change, and warming, which is occurring more rapidly in the Canadian north than elsewhere in the country, have long been noted as factors that could increase blastomycosis risk (sporulation is apparently increased in warmer, wetter weather) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2263103/). Canada should consider adding blastomycosis to its list of nationally notifiable diseases.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fisman for his comments.

In Canada (http://dsol-smed.phac-aspc.gc.ca/dsol-smed/ndis/list-eng.php), as in the US (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/conditionlist.aspx?type=0&yr=2013), blastomycosis is not a nationally notifiable disease, which impedes our fuller understanding of the epidemiology of this disease. However, in Manitoba, blastomycosis has been reportable to since 2006 for surveillance purposes only (http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/protocol/blastomycosis.pdf), but in Ontario, blastomycosis was removed from the list of reportable diseases in 1989 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373107/#R31).

In the US, each state has laws that require certain diseases, considered by the state to be of public health importance, to be reported at the state level when identified by a healthcare provider, hospital, or laboratory, for disease control and prevention purposes. The list of reportable diseases varies among states and over time. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) also designate certain diseases as nationally notifiable (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6153a1.htm). However, a disease might be on the national list but not on a particular state's list and diseases may be on the state's list and not on the national list. The list of nationally notifiable diseases varies over time. It is voluntary for states to provide notifications to CDC when an instance of a disease occurs that meets the national case definition. Nationally notifiable diseases data are used to monitor disease trends, identify populations or geographic areas at high risk, formulate and assess prevention and control strategies, and formulate public health policies.

Although blastomycosis is not nationally notifiable in the US, it is reportable, for example, in Illinois (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863359/ and http://www.lchd.us/reportable_diseases.htm), Michigan (https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/Blastomycosis_Michigan_Case_Def_2012_388267_7.pdf), Louisiana (http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-CH/infectious-epi/EpiManual/BlastomycosisManual.pdf), and Mississippi (http://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,194.html), and it was designated a reportable condition in Wisconsin in 1984 following 2 large outbreaks (Centers for Disease Control: Blastomycosis -- Wisconsin, 1986-1995. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1996; 45(28): 601-3, http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4528.pdf; and Wisconsin Department of Health Services, https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/diseasereporting.htm). - Mod.ML
