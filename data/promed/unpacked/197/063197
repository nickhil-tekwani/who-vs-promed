The outbreak of chikungunya, viral fever, and dengue fever on several
islands in Laamu Atoll has been described as an "epidemic" by the deputy
director of L Gan Hospital. Ali Nasir said the outbreak began around a
month ago [December 2008] on Isdhoo-Kalaidhoo before spreading to several
other islands including Fonadhoo and Gaadhoo. He said although the problem
was an annual occurrence, "this year is worse than before" as "more than
1000 people have been affected."

Nasir explained the situation could be described as an epidemic as 10
people were being diagnosed with one of the 3 diseases on a daily basis,
although very few had contracted dengue.

But 2 employees at the health centre at Isdhoo-Kalaidhoo have said the
figure was closer to around 25 to 30 a day. Dr Kiran Singh, an Indian
doctor at the health centre, has said although he would not refer to the
situation as an epidemic, the number was steadily increasing. "In total
there are 25 people coming from morning to evening."

A community worker at the health centre, Adam Moosa, blamed the outbreak on
mosquitoes. He said the problem had begun over a month ago but had
deteriorated and there were currently, "30 people coming daily." But, he
said, only up to 6 people could be admitted at any one time because of the
number of beds at the health centre.

Mohamed Latheef, an Isdhoo Island office employee, said the lack of
resources was making it difficult to deal with the problem effectively. "We
need materials and equipment," he said. "Medicine is also a problem and
there is not enough staff."

According to Nasir, the hospital is taking preventative measures to see to
the outbreak. "Every day we are sending teams to the islands to spray
mosquito areas and along with that we are cleaning islands with the help of
people."

[It is not possible to determine from this report how many of the febrile
cases are due to chikungunya or dengue virus infections or to viral fever,
the etiology of which is not defined. There is no indication that
laboratory diagnosis of any of these cases has been made. In 2006 there was
a major chikungunya outbreak in the Maldives (ProMED-mail archive no.
20061224.3598). There was a single chikungunya case imported into Singapore
from the Maldives in September 2008, and a 1 Jun 2008 report of both
chikungunya and dengue virus outbreaks occurring on the Maldives
(ProMED-mail archive no. 20080618.1901), so it is certainly possible that
both of these viruses are being transmitted on the island chain currently.
ProMED-mail requests additional information about the diagnoses of these
cases as it becomes available.
