The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced 11 Aug [2021] that white-tailed deer at captive cervid facilities in Sauk and Taylor counties tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

It's the 1st finding of the fatal deer disease in Taylor County. By state law, deer baiting and feeding in the county will be prohibited beginning Wednesday [1 Sep 2021], according to the Department of Natural Resources.

The CWD-positive animals were a 6-year-old doe in Taylor County and a 9-year-old buck in Sauk County. The names and locations of the deer farms were not released by DATCP, per agency policy.

There is no connection between the 2 locations, according to DATCP.

The test results were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

The Taylor County farm has 227 whitetails in a 22-acre, double-fenced enclosure and the Sauk County farm has 2 deer in a 1-acre pen surrounded by a single fence; both properties have been placed under quarantine, meaning no live animals or whole carcasses are permitted to leave the property.

The herds will remain under quarantine while an epidemiological investigation is conducted by DATCP and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) veterinarians and staff.

Officials did not say whether they would pursue depopulation of the CWD-positive facilities. Wisconsin has had 29 CWD-positive captive deer facilities since 2001; 19 have been depopulated.

The recent announcement marks the 1st finding of CWD in Taylor County. Sauk County had its 1st CWD detections in captive deer in 2003 and wild deer in 2002.

CWD is a fatal, neurological disease of deer, elk and moose caused by a prion, a misshapen, infectious protein. Testing for CWD is typically only performed after the animal's death.

The disease has not been shown to cause illness in humans but health experts advise against eating meat from a CWD-positive animal.

DATCP regulates deer farms in Wisconsin for registration, record keeping, disease testing, movement, and permit requirements.

With the recent finding of CWD at a deer farm within its borders, Taylor County is now classified as a CWD-affected county.

State law requires the DNR enact a ban on feeding and baiting deer in counties or portions of counties within a 10-mile [16 km] radius of a farm-raised or free-roaming domestic or wild animal that tests positive for CWD or tuberculosis.

The 3-year prohibition on baiting and feeding deer in Taylor County begins Wednesday [1 Sep 2021], according to the DNR. Sauk County was already under a similar ban.

Green Lake County CWD meeting
-----------------------------
The DNR and the Green Lake County Deer Advisory Council (CDAC) will hold a public meeting Tuesday [31 Aug 2021] on the status of chronic wasting disease (CWD) and a response plan for sampling wild deer in Green Lake County.

The meeting will take place at 6 p.m. Tuesday [31 Aug 2021] at the American Legion Post 306, 518 Water Street, Green Lake.

In June [2021] a 2-year-old buck in Brooklyn Township tested positive for CWD. It was the county's first CWD-positive deer.

To better understand the frequency and distribution of the disease in Green Lake County, the DNR will be sampling additional deer in the area. At Tuesday's [31 Aug 2021] meeting CDAC members, DNR staff and the public will discuss options to monitor the disease.

DNR staff will be on-site to provide information about the results of recent local CWD testing efforts and discuss sampling goals for the coming season. A public comment period will allow time during the meeting for anyone who would like to provide comments to the DNR and CDAC.

[Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environment contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)."
