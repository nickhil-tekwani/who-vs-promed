A shelter for people with disabilities in Holon has come under scrutiny after 3 of its residents died one after the other within the last couple of days, apparently as a result of food poisoning. A special team sent to the Beit Dafna shelter by the Health Ministry found severe deficiencies in its kitchen, according to reports [Mon 2 May 2022], and has instructed the staff to shut down the kitchen completely until the investigation is completed.

A few residents began feeling ill during the night between [Sat 30 Apr 2022] and [Sun 1 May 2022], with some suffering from diarrhea. One of them, who had suffered from an underlying medical condition, lost consciousness while being examined by the facility's medical staff. Paramedics who were rushed to the scene attempted to resuscitate her, but efforts failed and she was pronounced dead on [Sun 1 May 2022].

A total of 3 other residents were rushed to the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, 2 of whom, who had also suffered from underlying medical conditions, died on [Mon 2 May 2022] morning. The 3rd resident is currently hospitalized in critical condition. Later on [Mon 2 May 2022], reports indicated that 2 other residents of the shelter were admitted to the hospital and were presenting similar symptoms.

[While residents developed diarrhea, there is little description of the illnesses further to assess if the morbidity and mortality here are related to severe dehydration from a diarrheal illness, sepsis from infection such as salmonellosis, or a chemical toxin in the food or even botulism. ProMED awaits more information about this outbreak.

Holon is a city on the central coastal strip of Israel, south of Tel Aviv. It is in the Tel Aviv district and is part of the metropolitan Gush Dan area. - Mod.LL
