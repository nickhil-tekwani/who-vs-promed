Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 25 Apr 2016
------------------------------------
On [10 Apr 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Bahrain notified WHO of a fatal case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This is the 1st case reported in Bahrain.

Details of the case
A 61-year-old Saudi male was admitted on [29 Mar 2016] to a health care facility in Bahrain for an unrelated medical condition. He was screened for MERS-CoV, a routine procedure for those coming from Saudi Arabia, and tested negative for the infection. On [4 Apr 2016], and while hospitalized, he developed symptoms. On [9 Apr 2016], the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient had comorbidities. He owned a dromedary barn in Saudi Arabia and had a history of frequent contact with them and consumption of their raw milk. He had no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. On [12 Apr 2016], he was transferred to a hospital in Dammam city, Saudi Arabia but passed away on the same day.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been notified. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case. The Ministry of Agriculture was notified, and investigation of dromedaries is also ongoing.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1725 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 624 related deaths.

[The 1st confirmed case in Bahrain with history of camel exposure in Saudi Arabia was originally reported on ProMED-mail on 10 Apr 2016 (see MERS-CoV (51): Bahrain ex Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20160410.4150710) as an alert posted by the Bahrain Ministry of Public Health on Instagram, an excellent example of transparency and use of social media to disseminate important public health information. It is now 16 days since identification of the MERS-CoV infection in this patient, and to date, there have been no secondary cases reported from Bahrain.

The case was reported by Bahrain and died the same day as transfer to Saudi Arabia, hence it appears as though the case has not been reported a 2nd time by Saudi Arabia.

In the 2 days since the last ProMED-mail update on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, there have not been new cases or new outcomes on previously confirmed cases reported by the Saudi MOH, in keeping with the trend for decreased transmission during the month of April 2016.
