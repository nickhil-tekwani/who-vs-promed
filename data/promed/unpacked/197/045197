Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Tomamae-Town1; On [2 Jan 2022], a weakened _Haliaeetus albicilla_ (white-tailed eagle) was collected and tested against avian influenza virus. On [7 Jan 2022] National Institute for Environmental Studies conducted RT-PCR. On [22 Jan 2022], Hokkaido University conducted gene sequencing and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1. Nemuro-City1; on [20 Jan 2022], five dead _Corvus macrorhynchos_ (jungle crow) were collected and tested against avian influenza virus. On [26 and 27 Jan 2022], Hokkaido University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing respectively, and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1. Nemuro-City2. On [23 Jan 2022], 10 dead _C. macrorhynchos_ (jungle crow) were collected and tested against avian influenza virus. On [28 Jan 2022], Hokkaido University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing, and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: screening
Wild control measures applied: screening, disinfection

[Birds of prey and crows have been often reported dead or diseased due to HPAI viruses. Virus transmission between prey and predators and scavengers has been shown for HPAI virus (H5N1), with reported deaths in crows, birds of prey, and even mammals (carnivores). However, transmission of avian influenza viruses has not been sustained within predator and scavenger populations, suggesting that these represent a dead-end hosts. - Mod.PMB
