[in Hebrew, trans. & summ. Mod.AS, edited]


On Sun 10 Jul 2011, a suspicion of FMD was reported from beef cattle
grazing about 2 km north of Moshav Dalton, Upper Galilee (Regional
Council Merom Hagalil). This refers to 2 herds grazing adjacent to
each other, one counting 143 dams, the other 83 dams. Oral lesions
were discovered in about 20 of the adult animals in both herds.

>From samples, sent to the Department of virology at the Kimron
Veterinary Institute [KVI], Beit-Dagan, FMD virus has been isolated
today [13 Jul 2011]; serotyping is not yet accomplished.

A zone with a radius of 10 km [6 miles] around the outbreak [within
Israel's territory] has been declared infected (a map is included).

All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats, issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10-km zone are
void.

In entrances to the quarantined farms, disinfection drive-through
pools for vehicle wheels should be activated.

[The circular includes additional information and guidelines such as
surveillance activities, revaccinations, special arrangements for
slaughter within the region, etc. - Mod.AS]

[The outbreak in Dalton (comprising 2 grazing beef-cattle herds from
the same village) has become Israel's 17th outbreak since the start of
the FMDV-O epizootic in March 2011. A map showing the 1st outbreak
(which started 1 Mar 2011) is available in OIE's WAHID interactive map
at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345.
15 additional outbreaks are shown in the map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529,
including 2 outbreaks recently added in follow-up report No 5
(available, with map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10779).

Information on the vaccination history of the affected herds and
final serotyping of this outbreak will be useful (it may be
anticipated that the outbreak in Dalton is caused by the same
topotype/strain of FMDV serotype O identified throughout the 2011
epizootic).

FMD is considered to be extensively circulating in Lebanon, Syria and
probably Jordan (see ref. 1). The location of Dalton, 6.5 km south of
the border with Lebanon, can be seen at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Dalton.html; the 2 affected
herds were even closer to the border.

Since all northern frontiers of Israel are double-fenced, physical
contact with Lebanese livestock is highly unlikely; other means of
viral transmission deserve to be investigated, including airborne
spread and the possible role of wild boars as potential virus
disseminators (rather than as reservoirs). Wild boars are abundant in
northern Israel and in adjacent territories (Lebanon, Syria, northern
Jordan). Remarkably, one of the 1st reports on FMD in wild boars in
Israel related to an animal with typical foot lesions, shot in June
1992 very close to the sites of 2011 outbreaks No. 4, 7 and 16 (Senir,
Kefar Szold, Shirion Junction). Most FMD outbreaks in Israel since
1970 started on the northern frontiers and had a seasonal pattern.

Dalton has been found infected by FMDV several times in the past; in
fact, this Moshav (semi-cooperative village) lent its name to the
reference vaccine strain O/Dalton/ISR/2/88, still applied in the
Middle East and beyond. In this context, readers may be interested in
a recent report on the inauguration of a new FMD vaccine production
plant in Iran (ref. 2).
