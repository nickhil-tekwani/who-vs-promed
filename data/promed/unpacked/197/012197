----------------------------------------------------------------------
Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV), collectively called marburgviruses, cause Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) in humans. In July 2007, 4 cases of MHF (1 fatal) occurred in miners at Kitaka Mine in [Kamwenge and Ibanda districts,] southern Uganda. Later, MHF occurred in 2 tourists who visited Python Cave, about 50 km [31 mi] from Kitaka Mine. One of the tourists was from the United States (December 2007) and one was from the Netherlands (July 2008); one case was fatal (1,2,3). The cave and the mine each contained 40 000-100 000 _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ bats (Egyptian fruit bats).

In October 2012, the most recent known marburgvirus outbreak was detected in Ibanda, a town in southwest Uganda. Ibanda is about 20 km [12 mi] from the Kitaka Mine and is the urban center that serves smaller communities in the Kitaka area. This MHF outbreak was the largest in Ugandan history: 15 laboratory-confirmed cases occurred. In November 2012, an ecologic investigation of the greater Ibanda/Kitaka area was initiated. The investigation included interviews with local authorities to locate all known _R. aegyptiacus_ colonies in the area. Although minor colonies of small insectivorous bats were found, the only identifiable colony of _R. aegyptiacus_ bats was found inside the re-opened Kitaka Mine, albeit at much reduced size, perhaps 1-5 per cent of that found before depopulation efforts.

Of the 400 _R. aegyptiacus_ bats collected, 53 (13.3 per cent) were positive for marburgvirus RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (32/233 [13.7 per cent] adults and 21/167 [12.6 per cent] juveniles; marburgvirus was isolated from tissue samples from 9 of the 400 bats. The overall level of active infection was significantly higher than that found in Kitaka Mine during 2007-2008 (5.1 per cent) (Fisher exact test, p less than 0.001) and in other studies in Uganda (Python Cave [2.5 per cent]) and Gabon (4.8 per cent). The reason for the increase is not clear, but it may be related to the effects of the extermination and subsequent repopulation. Increases in disease prevalence in wildlife populations after culling are not unprecedented. We speculate that after the depopulation attempt, a pool of susceptible bats became established over time and was subjected to multiple marburgvirus introductions, as evidenced by the genetic diversity of viruses isolated from the bats. A pool of susceptible bats would have led to higher levels of active infection within the colony, thereby increasing the potential for virus spillover into the human population.

Phylogenetic analysis of viral RNA genome fragment sequences in this study showed high marburgvirus genetic diversity, including the presence of RAVVs and MARVs. Sequences for isolates from 3 bats were nearly identical to those of the MARV isolates obtained from patients in the 2012 Ibanda outbreak, suggesting that bats from Kitaka Mine were a likely source of the virus.

[Marburg hemorrhagic fever was first recognized in 1967, when outbreaks occurred in laboratories in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in the Serbian [then Yugoslavian] capital, Belgrade. Cases were traced to African green monkeys imported for research and polio vaccine production.

In a subsequent study of bats in Uganda, of all the bats sampled in significant numbers, only specimens of the cave-roosting Egyptian fruit bat, or _Rousettus aegyptiacus_, were found to harbor antibodies against both ebolavirus and marburgvirus (see ProMED-mail archive no 20091006.3469).

A study published in July 2009 showed that Marburg virus could be isolated from seemingly healthy Egyptian fruit bats caught in Uganda's Kitaka Cave, where miners infected with the virus in 2007 had worked. There was a substantial number of cases in 2012, with no further reports coming in to ProMED since then, until now. Marburg virus (family _Filoviridae_) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa.
