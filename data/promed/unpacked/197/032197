The fever outbreak in Mumbai is taking ominous proportions, with the
toll of fatalities rising to over 60 since the monsoons began in
Mumbai. What is significant is the rising number of cases of the
deadly disease leptospirosis.
Many people in Mumbai have fallen prey to leptospirosis after wading
through water polluted by animal excreta and garbage. Over 150 people
are suspected to be infected with leptospirosis, and over 40 others
are critically ill.
"I think even general practitioners may be taking it little lightly.
Whenever these cases were brought to civic hospitals, they were in
really bad condition, and it becomes very difficult to deal with such
cases," said Dr. Jairaj Thanekar, former BMC Health Officer.
There are many low lying areas in Mumbai that are densely populated
and prone to flooding. This is precisely the reason that the largest
number of leptospirosis cases are reported from such areas.

[As can be seen from the postings below, leptospirosis has been a
significant problem in India for some time. A water-borne zoonotic
disease in most circumstances, cases of this spirochetal infection
invariably increase with the onset of the monsoon season.
