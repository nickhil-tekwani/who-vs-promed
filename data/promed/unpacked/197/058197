After having the results of the tests [on samples] sent to the laboratory in Valdivia, the Ministry of Health discarded the case as a hantavirus infection.

The individual is a 46-year-old patient from Hornopir√©n who was sent to the Puerto Montt hospital and was later released.

The Health SEREMI [regional ministerial unit], Eugenia Schnacke, stated that materials have been developed for distribution in hospitals as well as [health] posts to adopt protocols when dealing with suspected cases.

The Director of the Reloncavi Health Services, Federico Vanegas, stated that the [health] network functions and they have worked with user committees from rural areas.

To date, the Los Lagos region has had 9 confirmed hantavirus infections, so the authorities called on them to adopt measures issued by the Ministry of Health to avoid [hantavirus] infections.

[Apparently, this is the previously posted case of a suspected hantavirus infection attributed to a rodent bite (see Hantavirus - Americas (27): Chile (LL), susp. Archive Number: 20170422.4988082). Laboratory tests have ruled out a hantavirus infection. Fortunately, the individual is now well enough to have been discharged from the hospital.

Suspecting a hantavirus infection in this case was not unreasonable, since there have been 9 confirmed cases in the Los Lagos region. Andes hantavirus is endemic in this region, as is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
