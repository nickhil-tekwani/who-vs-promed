1st case of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza diagnosed in Indiana backyard poultry flock
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) has been notified by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory that poultry from a backyard (hobby) flock in Whitley County tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza.

Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk; poultry and eggs are safe to eat. The Centers for Disease Control considers the risk of illness to humans to be very low.

BOAH veterinarians collected samples from the flock, after the owner reported several chickens became ill and died. The hobby flock contained 77 birds of various species, including ducks, geese, chickens, and turkeys. In a rapid response effort, all of the birds were removed from the site, to ensure no ongoing risk of disease spread. BOAH is reaching out to poultry owners in the Whitley County area to raise awareness and determine if the disease has spread.

Initial response to this finding has been swift and focused, with coordination among BOAH, USDA, Indiana State Poultry Association, and the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Governor Mike Pence has been fully informed and has directed all relevant agencies to provide a robust response in support of BOAH's efforts. Indiana is a leading poultry-producing state, nationally ranked 1st in the production of ducks, 2nd in egg-type hatch, 3rd in egg layers, and 4th in turkeys.

Reporting
---------
Backyard poultry owners are encouraged to be aware of the signs of avian influenza and report illness and/or death to the USDA Healthy Birds Hotline: 866-536-7593. Callers will be routed to a state or federal veterinarian in Indiana for a case assessment. Dead birds should be double-bagged and refrigerated for possible testing.

Signs include: sudden death without clinical signs; lack of energy or appetite; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling or purple discoloration of head, eyelids, comb, hocks; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea. A great resource for backyard bird health information is online at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Stamping out of this disease is proving a little difficult. And expensive. When a premises is depopulated it must be cleaned thoroughly before it can be repopulated. So how is that done? Insight into the process may be gained from the excerpt below from the Daily Globe http://www.dglobe.com/news/3742026-cleaning-avian-flu-outbreak.

[The cleaning company] enters the scene of an outbreak at the end of the process -- after the birds are put down by a foaming agent, decompose, and are removed. The company typically gets a call from an avian producer a week to 10 days in advance [of when it is needed]. A crew shows up with specialized equipment and goes to work. The barns are big, 400 to 1200 feet [about 122-366 m] long, and typically take a day to clean. As a precaution, crew members put on personal protection equipment, including boots, rain suits, and rubber gloves, but they don't wear respiratory masks since the masks would get wet. [A company owner] said that before his company started doing this kind of work, he checked with local physicians who said that chances of humans contracting the bird flu are low -- no cases have been detected. The personal protection equipment adds another layer of safety.

The crew first applies a high-temperature sanitizing foam, lets it soak for a few minutes, and then it sprays down every nook and cranny in a barn, using water cannons that shoot pressurized water up to 65 feet [about 20 m] into the air. The last step is adding a chemical agent called virucide that destroys any remaining viruses. Later, after a barn dries, a health worker comes in and swabs the surfaces to make sure the building is virus-free. "The whole process can take a few months, from when the growers first discover the problem, to when they can bring the birds back in," said [the company owner]. - Mod.TG]
