[2] Vaccine

France-based Valneva SE today [8 Mar 2022] announced the successful completion of a Phase 3 pivotal trial of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate, VLA1553. The VLA1553-301 trial, which enrolled 4115 adults aged 18 years and above across 44 sites in the U.S., met all primary and 2ary endpoints.

The positive final analysis was confirmed on [8 Mar 2022], included 6-month follow-up data and confirmed the topline results reported in August [2021]. The final analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection, with 98.9% of participants achieving protective levels of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) neutralizing antibodies one month after receiving a single vaccination. And the excellent immunogenicity profile was maintained over time, with 96.3% of participants showing protective CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers 6 months after receiving a single vaccination. VLA1553 was also confirmed to be highly immunogenic in elderly study participants.

The reported seroprotection levels far exceed the 70% threshold (for non-acceptance) based on a surrogate of protection agreed with the U.S. FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. As a result, Valneva now expects to commence the pre-submission process with the FDA in the 2nd quarter of 2022.

Juan Carlos Jaramillo, M.D, Chief Medical Officer of Valneva, commented in a press release, "These final pivotal Phase 3 results confirm the compelling profile of our single-shot vaccine candidate across all age groups. Delivering these Phase 3 results for a chikungunya vaccine candidate means that we are a step closer to addressing a major, growing, and unmet public health threat."

The Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting 1/3 to ¾ of the population in areas where the virus is circulating.

There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available, and, as such, chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.

[In the past decade there have been massive outbreaks of chikungunya virus diseases. Infected individuals often experience persistent joint pain that may last over a year and be disabled. The vaccine will be useful in areas where is chikungunya virus is endemic or where there is a significant risk of outbreaks. One hopes that the cost will not be beyond the reach of individuals or health systems in tropical countries. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging arthropod-borne alphavirus and a serious threat to human health. Therefore, efforts toward elucidating how this virus causes disease and the molecular mechanisms underlying steps of the viral replication cycle are crucial. Using an in vivo transmission system that allows intrahost evolution, we identified an emerging CHIKV variant carrying a mutation in the E1 glycoprotein (V156A) in the serum of mice and saliva of mosquitoes. E1 V156A has since emerged in humans during an outbreak in Brazil, cooccurring with a 2nd mutation, E1 K211T, suggesting an important role for these residues in CHIKV biology. Given the emergence of these variants, we hypothesized that they function to promote CHIKV infectivity and subsequent disease. Here, we show that E1 V156A and E1 K211T modulate virus attachment and fusion and impact binding to heparin, a homolog of heparan sulfate, a key entry factor on host cells. These variants also exhibit differential neutralization by antiglycoprotein monoclonal antibodies, suggesting structural impacts on the particle that may be responsible for altered interactions at the host membrane. Finally, E1 V156A and E1 K211T exhibit increased titers in an adult arthritic mouse model and induce increased foot-swelling at the site of injection. Taken together, this work has revealed new roles for E1 where discrete regions of the glycoprotein are able to modulate cell attachment and swelling within the host.

Importance: Alphaviruses represent a growing threat to human health worldwide. The reemerging alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has rapidly spread to new geographic regions in the last several decades, causing overwhelming outbreaks of disease, yet there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics. The CHIKV glycoproteins are key determinants of CHIKV adaptation and virulence. In this study, we identify and characterize the emerging E1 glycoprotein variants, V156A and K211T, that have since emerged in nature. We demonstrate that E1 V156A and K211T function in virus attachment to cells, a role that until now has only been attributed to specific residues of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. We also demonstrate E1 V156A and K211T increase foot-swelling of the ipsilateral foot in mice infected with these variants. Observing that these variants and other pathogenic variants occur at the E1-E1 interspike interface, we highlight this structurally important region as critical for multiple steps during CHIKV infection. Together, these studies further define the function of E1 in CHIKV infection and can inform the development of therapeutic or preventative strategies.

[This study underlines the importance of understanding the structural mechanisms involved in the steps of infection. It is also clear that virus variants will emerge during outbreaks, as is expected for RNA viruses. That calls for ongoing virus surveillance to determine when and where these variants emerge and their relationship to transmission efficiency, any changes in antigenicity and to pathogenesis. - Mod.TY]
