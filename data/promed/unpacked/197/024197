Oregon: 1st human case of West Nile virus infection confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Oregon State Public Health Laboratory has confirmed the 1st
Oregon [human] case of West Nile virus infection in a Malheur County
resident, officials at the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS)
said today [Fri 10 Sep 2004].
"We are glad to say the individual has fully recovered and is doing
well," said Mel Kohn, M.D., state epidemiologist at DHS. "Last month
[August 2004], West Nile was detected in the bird and horse
populations, so the fact that a person was also infected is not a
surprise. However, this human case demonstrates that it is more
important than ever to protect yourself from mosquito bites," Kohn
said. He lists 5 key actions people should take:
(1) Look around your home and property, and eliminate all sources of standing
water that can support mosquito breeding, for example gutters, birdbaths, and
old tires.
(2) Because mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk, avoid playing or
working outside at these times.
(3) When outdoors, wear long pants, long sleeve shirts, and other protective
clothing.
(4) Wear insect repellant, preferably one that contains DEET. Follow label
directions when using any repellant.
(5) Make sure that doors and windows have tight-fitting screens. Repair or
replace screens that have tears or holes.
Kohn says that, most of the time, people infected with West Nile
virus have no illness, or, only mild symptoms. "About 20 percent of
cases result in a flu-like illness. In one out of 150 cases, however,
the virus can cause inflammation of the brain and result in serious
illness or even death," says Kohn. "We are keeping physicians updated
and reminding them to be vigilant for patients who have symptoms that
could indicate West Nile virus infection, such as fever, muscle
aches, and severe headache," Kohn says.
Since 2002, Oregon physicians have diagnosed several persons with
West Nile virus infection. However, none of them acquired their
infections in Oregon until the case reported today [Fri 10 Sep 2004].
The 1st North American case of West Nile virus infection occurred in
New York in 1999. To date, more than 14 000 human cases of, and 586
deaths from, West Nile virus have been reported in the USA.

[This report records a significant westward extension of human West
Nile virus infection in the USA. Oregon was the last of the
contiguous states (i.e. all states excluding Alaska and Hawaii) to
confirm isolation of West Nile virus. A dead crow found in Vale (also
in Malheur County) was confirmed positive for West Nile virus less
than a month ago (on 15 Aug 2004). Subsequently, other birds, and 4
equines, have been confirmed West Nile virus-positive. This report of
a human case in Oregon confirms that West Nile virus is now endemic
throughout the lower 48 United States of America. - Mod.CP]
