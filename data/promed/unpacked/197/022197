Indonesia: 109th case of avian H5N1 influenza confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
A 12 year old Indonesian boy was confirmed on Thursday [11 Oct 2007] to be
suffering from bird flu, bringing the country's cases of the H5N1 avian
influenza virus [infection] to 109, according to Indonesia's Health
Ministry. The boy, from the Tangerang district in Banten province,
bordering the capital Jakarta, was admitted to hospital on Monday [8 Oct
2007] with bird flu symptoms. He was transferred to Persahabatan Hospital
in Jakarta, which is designated to treat bird flu patients, a day later, a
ministry statement said.
Indonesia has [now] recorded 109 human cases of bird flu and 87 deaths,
both tops in the world. At least 201 people have died of the disease in 11
countries in Asia and Africa, according to World Health Organization
statistics.
The most common way to contact the H5N1 virus is through contact with sick
fowl. Although bird flu remains an animal disease, experts fear the virus
could mutate into a form easily spread among humans, triggering a pandemic
that could kill millions.
