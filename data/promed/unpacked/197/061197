The South Sulawesi administration is taking measures to curb the spread of anthrax in several areas considered highly susceptible to the infectious disease.

"To reduce the spread of anthrax in several areas, we have prepared vaccines and antibiotics," said the administration's acting head of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Agency, Muhammad Kahfil, in Makassar on Monday [10 Feb 2014], as quoted by Antara news agency.

He added that various livestock in Maros regency, South Sulawesi, were reported to be infected with anthrax.

The agency is providing 156 jars of antibiotics, 50 jars of vitamins, and 10 jars of vaccines. "For areas whose livestock have already been infected with anthrax, there should be regular and routine vaccinations to minimize the spread of the virus," said Kahfil. He said in other areas, such as along the borders of Bone and Sinjai regencies, which had significant geographical challenges, there needed to be tight monitoring activities so that breeders would not hastily slaughter their livestock upon discovering symptoms of anthrax. "I've asked people in border areas not to slaughter livestock that are suspected of having contracted anthrax before they are examined and treated," said Kahfil.

He acknowledged that Maros was an anthrax-prone area. In October 2013, there was anthrax outbreak in the regency which resulted in the area being quarantined.

Kahfil said no significant cases were detected in South Sulawesi; however, the administration remained vigilant against the spread of the disease. "Anthrax infections are relatively easy to tackle. The most important thing is that any illnesses among livestock must be quickly detected and reported for proper treatment," he said.

[One of the problems with anthrax is that even if the livestock cases are few, e.g. "not significant," the human proclivity to slaughter and butcher these "few" for human consumption can result in a significant number of human cases and sometimes deaths.

This outbreak appears to be in the regency [county] of Maros. Last May and June [2013], there were at least 2 outbreaks in cattle and another in a horse, which suggest that there were coincident cases in farm livestock in that area of the Takalar regency, and it involved 12 human cases, one of whom died.

Anthrax is common in South Sulawesi, with prior bovine outbreaks in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2012; the full data for 2013 have yet to be revealed. The most recent human cases there, prior to 2013, were in 2009 with 11 cases and in 2010, when there were 5 cases with 3 deaths [see ProMED archives below].
