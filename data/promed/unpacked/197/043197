From: WILLIAM K. REISEN <arbo@lightspeed.net>

There is some question about the role of migratory birds in EEE (Eastern
Equine Encephalitis) virus re-introduction. Studies by Crans et al. in NJ
seem to indicate that relapses among resident birds timed to infect
emerging vector mosquitoes [_Culiseta melanura_ from the overwintering
larval cohort is the key to virus overwintering. Migrants and summer
residents may be important in virus amplification.
The 36 hour period from infection to death seems very fast. Has anyone
attempted isolation from these horse brains? If these horses were not
vaccinated, has serological specimens been tested?
