There are also cases in France. I have informed the French
veterinarians about this new disease in the 1st days of February 2009
in a veterinary journal, "La depeche veterinaire". I have received
some responses [informing] that this disease is also seen in France
in the field.

I have seen a case last week [week of 28 Sep 2009] in my ambulatory
clinic of the veterinary school of Alfort (and we have taken some
samples with the help of the regional laboratory of Ardennes to look
for a potential infectious origin).

If we consider comparative pathology, it is possible that an
immunodepressive virus with medullar aplasia and hemorrhagic syndrome
may be involved, like a circovirus (such as chicken anemia virus or
sometimes porcine circovirus).

[Prof Brugere-Picoux's report on her observations in France is much
appreciated. Results of the laboratory investigations are anticipated
with interest.

It would help to obtain detailed information on the clinical and
pathological findings in the French calves, comparing them with cases
elsewhere, such as, febrile reaction as reported from Germany.

The drafted, partially documented list of European countries/regions
where the preliminarily coined "bleeding calf syndrome" has been
recorded since the beginning of 2009 (or probably earlier?), includes
at this point in time Germany, Scotland, England, Wales, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and France. - Mod.AS]
