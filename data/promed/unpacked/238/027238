Dozens of villagers in Xiantao, Hubei were poisoned by drinking tap water suspected to be contaminated by chemicals from a local company.

More than 20 villagers in Xiantao developed symptoms of poisoning after drinking tap water. The Hubei Provincial Investigation Team conducted an investigation, and the police have detained the relevant personnel.

On 10 Oct 2020, Mr. X, from Xiantao City, Hubei Province, was lying in the ICU ward. He was unconscious and on a ventilator, the 9th day of his coma.

On 1 Oct 2020, more than 20 residents in Pengchang Daling, Magou, and Xiaxin Villages of Xiantao City developed vomiting and other abnormal symptoms after dinner. Barium in the drinking water was suspected due to a chemical leak from a local company.

After the incident, the Xiantao Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government immediately took emergency measures, such as cutting off the water source to the village, emergency treatment of patients, changing the water source overnight, and continuously monitoring water quality to deal with the incident in an orderly manner. As of 10 Oct 2020, all patients had recovered except for 2 hospitalizations.

Mr. X's son said that the 61-year-old Mr. X had finished dinner at 8:30 pm on 1 Oct 2020. At 9 pm, Mr. X began to experience symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. At 11:30 the same night, Mr. X was taken to the hospital. The doctor initially diagnosed acute gastroenteritis and said that he could return home to rest. At 3 am on 2 Oct 2020, he returned home, fell into a coma, and was sent to the hospital again. Xiantao First People's Hospital found that he suffered from food poisoning and hypokalemia [low potassium].

Another local villager, Mr. XX, said that at 9 pm on 1 Oct 2020, he began to vomit and hemorrhage; on 2 Oct 2020, his symptoms eased after treatment; on 4 Oct 2020, his body returned to normal, and he was discharged from the hospital on 6 Oct 2020.

XJ said: "My dad is more ill than others, probably because he drank a big bowl of soup."

There are sick villagers in Pengchang Daling, Magou, and Xiaxin.

It is understood drinking water in the 3 villages is supplied by the same water company. On 2 Oct 2020, the tap water in the 3 villages was stopped; on 4 Oct 2020, the water supply returned to normal.

On 8 Oct 2020, an official, Peng Chang, investigated the poisoning incident. The official concluded that the incident was due to barium poisoning. The investigation team is inspecting the local water pipes. On the evening of 10 Oct 2020, the official replied to reporters that the police had detained relevant personnel to determine whether they were suspected of committing a crime; they would await the results of the investigation to be announced.

The companies involved in this incident have received environmental fines for illegal emissions previously.

According to relevant information, the boss of the company accused of leaking chemical substances said that it was suspected to be the work of a competitor. However, this claim has not been officially confirmed.

[Barium, a metal, is usually found in the form of water insoluble barium sulphate or barium carbonate. Barium sulphate is non-toxic and has been used safely as an X-ray radiocontrast agent for gastrointestinal tract imaging and also used as an additive in well drilling fluids.

The manufactured water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous, and, if ingested or inhaled, can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, hypokalemia, cardiovascular issues and muscle effects. Barium carbonate is acid soluble and can also cause toxicity after ingestion. Long term exposure to soluble barium compounds can lead to adverse renal effects. https://www.drugs.com/condition/barium-poisoning.html. - Mod.TG
