A botulism scare has forced the recall of a local [British Columbia] coffee company's product. Cherry Hill Coffee's N7 Nitro Cold Brew Coffee has been recalled after it was learned that temperature issues during the manufacturing process could have led to a failure to control pathogens, including botulism.

On Wed 20 Mar 2019, Interior Health put out a warning to the public advising anyone who purchased the cold brew coffee from the Kelowna company to not drink it.

"Either throw out the product, or return it to the location you bought it from, with proof of purchase for a full refund," IH said in its statement. "N7 Nitro cans and kegs have been pulled from shelves at retail stores as part of a voluntary recall."

IH says anyone who is feeling unwell after drinking the product should seek medical advice. At this time, no illnesses linked to the product have been reported.

According to Health Canada, symptoms of botulism include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and eventually paralysis that starts in the shoulders and arms. Symptoms of botulism generally begin 12 to 36 hours after ingestion; however, symptoms can begin as soon as 6 hours after exposure or as long as 10 days later.

[Nitro coffee is cold brewed and infused with nitrogen gas. A bonus for consumers is that there's no sugar, milk, or alcohol in nitro coffee, and it contains about 30 percent more caffeine per ounce. It is not stated how much and where the distribution was. A similar recall occurred in 2017 in the USA.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
