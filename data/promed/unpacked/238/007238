On Friday [26 Aug 2016], 2 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) were confirmed by the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office. One is a 5-year-old racking horse mare in Barren County and the 2nd a 11-year-old Quarter Horse mare in Hardin County, according to an Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) notice.

Initial onset for both horses was 22 Aug 2016. There is no history of WNV vaccination for either horse. Both horses are alive and improving.

West Nile virus is regularly found in the United States, and birds serve as the primary hosts of the disease. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus from birds and then carry it to horses or people. The virus can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Infected horses may or may not show neurological signs and many recover completely, especially with annual vaccinations.

Vaccines for horses are widely available and have been proven to be effective in preventing infection.

A horse in Redmond has tested positive for West Nile virus, the 1st in Oregon this year [2016] and the 1st in Deschutes County in recent years, health officials said on Friday [26 Aug 2016].

West Nile virus is spread to humans and animals through infected mosquitoes.

Infected horses may display one or more of the following signs: Lack of coordination and stumbling (most commonly described sign), depression or apprehension, anorexia (off feed), weakness of the hind limbs, falling down, inability to rise, flaccid paralysis of the lower lip (droopy lip), muscle twitching, grinding teeth, inability to swallow, head pressing, colicky appearance, aimless wandering, hypersensitivity and excitability, excessive sweating, disorientation, convulsions, and possible total paralysis.

Certain species of mosquitoes carry WNV and acquire the virus when they feed on infected birds. WNV is not spread through casual contact such as touching or kissing a person with the virus. There is a WNV vaccine for horses but not for humans.

The 1st line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases is to avoid mosquitoes. Eliminate mosquito-breeding areas (standing water) around your home such as puddles or containers that hold water. This includes old tires, buckets and cans. Change the water in pet dishes, birdbaths or stock tanks at least once a week. Consider using products sold in garden stores containing larvicidal bacteria to treat ponds or bodies of water that cannot be eliminated to kill mosquito larvae. Inspect all window and door screens at home to make sure they are free of holes.

Stay indoors at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active. When outdoors, wear long sleeve shirts and long pants. Choose and use a repellent that contains one of these active ingredients: DEET, picardin (odorless), oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR-3535.

WNV can be a mild to serious illness and can affect the central nervous system. Symptoms vary and develop between 3 and 14 days after an infected mosquito bites a person. There is no specific treatment for the virus.

Approximately 80 percent of people who are infected with WNV will show no symptoms at all. Up to 20 percent of people infected will display symptoms that can include fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands, and skin rash. Signs can last from a few days up to several weeks.

Less than one percent of people infected with WNV will develop serious illness. This may include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, muscle weakness or paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks; neurological effects may be permanent.

Young children and adults over 50 are at higher risk of getting sick. If you or someone you know is at risk and develops signs, seek medical care.

[West Nile virus became endemic in the United States several years ago. However, people tend to forget to protect their animals and themselves. The virus is often fatal in horses and can be prevented by a simple vaccine.

Clinical symptoms in people are listed above but many are very mild. There is no vaccine for prevention of WNV in humans.
