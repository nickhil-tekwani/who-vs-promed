In addition, the epidemiological data is skewed away from those
individuals that spend a lot of time out of doors i.e. children. If
mosquitos were a carrier of HIV then children would be expected to be a
heavy infected group. In fact the most heavily infected population are
adults for whom the major risk factor is not mosqito bites.

When there are so many legitimate questions to be answered about AIDS, It
amazes me how research money can be wasted on ideas that have never had any
scientific foundation, but because some people get hysterical about AIDS
that money is said to be justified.
