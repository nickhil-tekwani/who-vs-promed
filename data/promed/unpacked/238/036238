Residents of Okakarara [Otjozondjupa Region] have been hit where it
hurts most. They are not allowed to sell their cattle that are their
main source of income because of the current 21-day quarantine on
cattle.

The Ministry of Agriculture effected the quarantine after 2 buffaloes
that tested positive for the contagious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
had to be put down.

"People in the 5 settlements are affected. Their pockets are empty,"
said Okakarara Constituency councillor, Vetaruhe Kandorozu, adding
that there was almost no alternative other than selling chicken and
vegetables -- something the farmers are not "intensive on".

Kandorozu said that farmers typically sell one herd of cattle every
month or so and depend on auctions for finances. This, he said, would
also affect schools as they may not receive fees until the quarantine
has been lifted.

The livestock movement restriction runs until 20 Sep 2011, but it is
not clear what would happen after that. "There is no income now.
Individual businesses are starting to feel the pinch too," added the
councillor.

The Okakarara Trade Fair (OTF), which starts today [7 Sep 2011], is
also expected to take a blow as gate entrance intake may be affected.

Veterinary Services director Dr Cleophas Bamhare said they were doing
surveillance in the area and would reassess the situation after the 21
days lapse.

A man was gored in the stomach by one of the 2 buffaloes, whose blood
samples revealed a positive result for FMD. The buffaloes were spotted
in Ekuenje, some 20 km [12.5 mi] from Okondjatu.

[According to the initial report on the event, on 29 Aug 2011 no
results of the lab tests of the 2 suspected buffaloes were yet
available (see ProMED-mail 20110901.2675). As it appears now, the 2
animals, sighted within the Otjozondjupa region, one of the 8 regions
within the recognised FMD-free zone of Namibia, have eventually been
found infected/positive. Details of the test applied will be helpful.

Animal movement restrictions and surveillance have been implemented in
order to protect Namibia's status as a country maintaining a zone free
of FMD without vaccination. Such status is meant to provide Namibia
the potential of gaining access to a wide range of national and
international markets. The zone includes the regions of Kunene south,
Oshikoto south, Otjozondjupa, Omaheke, Khomas, Erongo, Hardap, and
Karas (see map and additional details at
