Overshadowed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, North Carolina health departments struggle to combat a smaller, yet still deadly outbreak: hepatitis A. According to CDC, an outbreak in North Carolina first reported on 1 Jan 2018, resulting in 855 cases. Nearly 2/3 of those resulted in hospitalizations, with 13 deaths reported.

The viral disease affects the liver and may cause abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, and jaundice, according to the CDC.

Case numbers vary wildly across the state. Cumberland County reported only one case, a rate of 0.3 per 100 000 population. At the other end of the spectrum, Burke County reported 59 cases, a rate of 65.2 cases per 100 000 population. Most cases are in the Piedmont and western part of the state.

While food- and water-related outbreaks can and do occur, in [this USA multistate outbreak], individuals transmit most cases to one another [related to poor hygiene].

In Catawba County, 67 reported cases have occurred since the outbreak started, a rate of 42 per 100 000 population.

"Cases of hepatitis A are not unique to Catawba County, and there is an uptick both nationwide and statewide in hepatitis A cases," said Emily Killian, community engagement specialist for Catawba County Public Health. "Statewide, this broad uptick has been associated with person-to-person transmission, especially among 3 groups at increased risk: people who use drugs; people who are experiencing homelessness; and men who have sex with men," she said. "In Catawba County, people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs are at the highest risk and account for the majority of our cases. However, these are not the only individuals who have been affected."

Some counties saw numbers climb in 2020 and 2021. "Since COVID, Burke County has seen an increase in drug use, as well," said Ashley Jarrett, a communicable disease nurse at the Burke County Health Department. Jarrett cited a possible "correlation between the 2, but we just noticed that trend."

In Catawba, just more than half of the 67 cases reported since April 2018 occurred last year [2020] alone. "Catawba County experienced a dramatic increase in cases in 2020," Killian said. "In 2018 and 2019, we received one report of acute hepatitis A each year; in 2020, we received 34 reports."

Gaston County also saw a spike, with 33 reported cases in the county from 2018-2020. As of 9 Jun [2021], Gaston had a total of 78 cases (a rate of 34.7 per 100 000) since 2018, according to state data. "We've really never seen anything like this," Ellen Wright, communicable disease supervisor for the Gaston County Health Department, said in a press release from the county in May [2021]. "The case numbers are the highest we've seen and continue to climb. While our homeless population, incarcerated individuals, and those using drugs are the most impacted right now, it only takes one person working in a restaurant or other public-facing industry to cause a large-scale community outbreak. We have to do everything we can to get high-risk individuals vaccinated so we can prevent the spread."

In Caldwell County, there had been another 4 cases as of 1 Jul [2021], bringing the numbers to 42 since 1 Apr 2018, according to Anna Martin, public health director for the Caldwell County Health Department. The county rate was at least 46 per 100 000 population.

"The majority of our hepatitis cases involve individuals involved in substance abuse, specifically methamphetamines," Martin said. "We find that many of our positive cases are hesitant to discuss circumstances of exposure and potential contacts to this illness, which delays or prevents vaccine prophylaxis."

The problem isn't just limited to North Carolina. As of Friday [2 Jul 2021], 26 states are experiencing outbreaks, according to the CDC. Another 9 had a "declared end" to the outbreak; reported end dates ranged from 11 Apr 2018 [California, where one of the 1st clusters occurred in the San Diego area - Mod. LL], through as recently as 1 Feb [2021] [Colorado - Mod.LL].

Individuals who fall into high-risk groups for the disease can often receive free vaccinations. "The state has allocated free hep A vaccinations," Jarrett said. "It is one vaccine that provides 95% protection against hepatitis A virus for those who have not already contracted the hepatitis A virus and meet either drug use (can be either injection or noninjection), is experiencing forms of homelessness or unstable living situation, men who have sex with men, or they're in a contact with a confirmed hep A exposure."

Jarrett said she has noticed what seems to be a hesitancy from some individuals to approach health-care providers with problems. Health department officials have to meet possible patients where they are, she said. With vaccines now widely available for COVID-19, Jarrett hopes Burke can focus more on hepatitis A. "COVID took a lot of our resources for a long time," Jarrett said. "Unfortunately, we did not have a tremendous amount of manpower to address vaccinating heavily in the community. We still offered (it to) anyone who wanted to come in and get vaccinated."

While the reported rate of infection climbed in North Carolina, it is impossible to know how many cases of hepatitis A are never reported. "Most of the hepatitis A cases I have investigated complain of nausea, vomiting, and severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain," said Martin, the public health director in Caldwell. While some individuals may need hospitalization, she said, most recover at home, making tracking the virus more difficult.

Since the symptoms can be similar to those of many other illnesses, Jarrett said, some may not seek treatment if they confuse their illness a stomach bug.

For those who are at risk, prevention is key. While the vaccine offers strong protection, outreach is one of the key tools in slowing the outbreak, Jarrett said. "I have noticed ... that going out into the community and becoming approachable and showing your face and building rapport with those who are at risk has definitely relieved some of that barrier for them to reach out to us," she said.

[This multistate hepatitis A (HAV) epidemic was well in gear prior to the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and as noted in this post, it is likely that surveillance had fallen off related to lack of resources during the height of the pandemic. The CDC numbers for North Carolina were last reported on 2 Jul 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm), but the report for NC is as of 9 Jun 2021. Prior to the pandemic, affected states were updating numbers weekly. - Mod.LL]

Diners at a North Carolina Waffle House may have a sickening virus that was spread by an employee, health officials warned Friday night [2 Jul 2021]. Anyone who dined at or ordered take-out from the Vinehaven Drive NE Waffle House off Copperfield Boulevard in Concord could have been exposed to hepatitis A, if they visited between 9 p.m. 20 Jun and 7 a.m. 21 Jun [2021], according to a Cabarrus Health Alliance news release. The alliance is the county's health department.

The Waffle House is off Interstate 85 Exit 60.

A person can get hepatitis A by coming into close contact with an infected person or consuming food or drink the person handled, CDC officials said. Ingesting even microscopic amounts of the virus can sicken you with symptoms lasting up to 2 months, the CDC says.

Restaurant employees and others can prevent the disease by "vigorously" washing their hands for at least 20 seconds, health officials said. That includes the back of their hands and wrists, between their fingers, and under their fingernails, officials said.

Any diner who previously had the hepatitis A infection or hepatitis A vaccine "are protected from the virus and do not need to take additional action," according to the Health Alliance. "Most children receive hepatitis A as part of the recommended vaccine series."

[Regarding food handlers and the transmission of HAV, the following is from Hepatitis A - USA (06): CDC, role of food handlers, archive no. 20200521.7363544:

Hofmeister MG, Foster MA, Montgomery MP, Gupta N: Notes from the Field: Assessing the Role of Food Handlers in Hepatitis A Virus Transmission, Multiple States, 2016-2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 636-637. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6920a4.

"The USA is experiencing person-to-person outbreaks of hepatitis A in unprecedented numbers during the vaccine era (1). As of May 2020, 33 states had reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 32 500 cases, 19 800 (61%) hospitalizations, and 320 deaths since 2016 (1). These infections are spreading primarily through close contact among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness, as well as among men who have sex with men (MSM) (2).

During these outbreaks, hepatitis A infections occurring among food handlers have raised public alarm and resulted in calls for vaccinating all food handlers, often prompting health departments to divert limited resources away from populations at risk. However, the risk for secondary transmission from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons is not well understood. To characterize this risk, a novel, structured survey was developed and conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 9.5.13; Vanderbilt University); among 30 state health departments reporting person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 29 states responded (3,4).

26 states (89.7%) submitted complete information regarding secondary transmission events associated with food handlers (Table; See original URL for Table. - Mod.LL). Among 22 825 hepatitis A outbreak cases reported from these 26 states during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 871 (3.8%) were among food handlers; 587 (67.4%) hepatitis A-infected food handlers reported one or more risk factors (i.e., drug use, unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, or incarceration) during the 15-50 days before symptom onset. Associated with these 871 hepatitis A-infected food handlers were 8 (0.9%) secondary transmission events (Table), which resulted in 57 secondary cases.

Of 29 states, 18 (62.1%) submitted complete information for public health response activities related to hepatitis A-infected food handlers. Among 275 cases in food handlers from these 18 states, 271 (98.5%) investigations and 63 (22.9%) public notifications took place.

Ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks have been prolonged and costly to control (5). These study findings indicate that the risk for secondary infection from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons in these outbreaks is low (less than 1.0%). Therefore, public health efforts to preemptively vaccinate all food handlers would be ineffective at mitigating the current risk for person-to-person outbreaks. To optimize resources, health departments should assess the risk for secondary transmission of hepatitis A from infected food handlers on a case-by-case basis and prioritize vaccination efforts in situations where secondary transmission risk is deemed high (6).

Approximately 2/3 of the hepatitis A-infected food handlers in this survey reported risk factors commonly associated with the current person-to-person outbreaks. This underscores the importance of vaccination strategies targeting the populations at highest risk (i.e., persons who use drugs, persons experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, and persons who are or were recently incarcerated) as the cornerstone of an effective public health response.

The data provided information to support not routinely immunizing food handlers against HAV. While focusing on high-risk groups for HAV is certainly more cost effective, those groups are difficult to access for HAV immunization. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, essentially any day, one could google "hepatitis A" and find several reports of HAV infection in a food handler. - Mod.LL
