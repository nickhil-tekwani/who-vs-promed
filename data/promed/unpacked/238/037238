As of 8 Feb 2009, the Ministry of Health of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
has reported 1364 suspected cases of meningococcal disease including 108
deaths (case fatality rate: 7.9 per cent) in 19 out of 35 states and Abuja.
So far 30 local government areas (LGA) in 8 states have crossed the alert
or the epidemic threshold. In the last week, 11 LGAs crossed the epidemic
threshold, and 600 suspected cases including 40 deaths were reported across
the country.

Cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected from Jigawa state have tested
positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A by latex test. The
International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic
Meningitis Control has approved the release of 268 750 doses of
polysaccharide vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in two affected LGAs
in Jigawa state.

WHO is supporting the Federal and National Ministry of Health in the
submission of additional requests to the ICG to secure vaccine for the
remaining affected areas. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to
strengthen epidemiological and laboratory surveillance and data management.

[Meningococcal meningitis occurs sporadically or as epidemics in
sub-Saharan Africa, which is known as the "Meningitis Belt," an area that
stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and
that includes Nigeria (<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>).

Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in this region of
Africa each year during the dry season, between December and June, and
every 6-12 years a large outbreak occurs
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>). Serogroup A
predominates, but recently, serogroups X and W135 have also been associated
with meningococcal disease in sub-Saharan Africa.

In countries where meningococcal disease is highly endemic, there is a need
to distinguish an emerging epidemic of meningitis from a simple seasonal
rise in incidence, in order to implement control measures. Epidemic
thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic in order to
step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and appropriate case
management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds, see
<http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc>.

Mass immunization campaigns are labor-intensive and costly. The news report
above does not specify the type of meningococcal vaccine that is being
used, but meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young
children, do not protect unvaccinated population groups, and only provide
protection for up to 3 years. As a result, repetitive meningitis outbreak
responses can deplete a country's scarce health care finances with
comparably little impact.

In contrast, the meningococcal conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent
response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide
long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N.
meningitidis_, thus reducing bacterial transmission of this microorganism
(<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>). A
preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly
larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly
recurrences of this disease that causes considerable morbidity and
mortality, especially among children
(<http://www.jidc.org/files/vol02_no05/PDF/jidc-02-335.pdf>).
