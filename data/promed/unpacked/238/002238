Russia has partially banned live animals and meat product imports
from China and Brazil, citing concerns over foot-and-mouth disease,
the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday [17 Sep 2004].
A ministry statement said that Moscow had temporarily restricted
imports and transit of Chinese live animals, and all animal products
not subjected to thermal treatment, from 17 Sep 2004.
"Joint investigations of the foot-and-mouth situation at Chinese
territories bordering Russia, undertaken after repeated requests by
the Russian veterinary service, had failed to provide reliable
information," the statement said.

[Russia's concern about the FMD situation in China is understandable
in view of the outbreak in dairy cattle, caused by FMD virus serotype
O of the pan-Asian group, detected in Amur, 15 km from the Chinese
border, in April 2004.
China's last OIE-reported outbreak of FMD occurred in May 1999. It
was caused by FMD serotype O (most probably of the pan-Asian group).
Totally, 8 outbreaks were officially reported: 5 outbreaks from
Tibet, 2 from Hainan, and one from Fujian. The disease was reported
as absent during 2000 - 2002.
4 monthly reports from China on its FMD situation in 2003 are
available on OIE's Handistatus database, and report absence of the
disease during the months September - December 2004. No information
is available for earlier months, nor for China's FMD situation during
January - August 2004.
ProMED-mail's request for information, following published rumors
about the presence of FMD in Inner Mongolia (China) at the beginning
of 2004, has not received a response. - Mod.AS].
