Cholera has broken out in Zabul, Ghazni, Kandahar; Helmand, Paktika, and Khost provinces, and scores of the residents are infected with the disease. Over a month, a number of Afghan citizens have been infected with cholera in some provinces of Afghanistan. Unfortunately, some of them have lost their lives due to a lack of access to health centers.

In a conversation with The Kabul Times, they said that the Ministry of Public Health is obliged to pay serious attention to the patients and instruct the related provincial health centers to treat the patients. The patients suffering from severe diarrhea increasing in the country while our people are living in hunger and hot season, the majority of these families living under tents and they haven't access to clean water and healthy food, and this disease is increasing in the eastern and south eastern provinces of the country. Meanwhile, a number of hospitalized patients say that economic challenges are the reason behind the increase of the disease.

The doctors of Antani Hospital in Kabul say as the weather is warming up and floods are flowing in some provinces of the country, the number of patients suffering from severe diarrhea has increased in this hospital. They called the reason for the increase of the disease lack of access to hygienic water and healthy food and add that more than a hundred patients visit this hospital every day. Faridullah Omari, a specialist trainer at Antani Hospital in Kabul, said: "Every day, about 100 to 130 people come to our hospital with diarrhea, and this number is increasing."

Date: Fri 15 Jul 2022

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1270609.shtml


Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province reported on Thu 14 Jul 2022 that 4 seafood samples tested positive for the O139 type of bacteria that cause cholera. Officials say this is unrelated to the previously confirmed case found at Wuhan University [see report above]. Personnel and the environment involved with the positive samples have not shown abnormalities after examination, authorities said.

The 4 turtle samples contaminated with the virus were found on Wed, 13 Jul 2022, during a daily health inspection work at the Baishazhou Market in Wuhan, local authorities said in a notice issued the next day. An emergency response was immediately launched to conduct an epidemiological survey, environmental sampling, and disinfection. The shop selling the products has been temporarily shut down for 3 days, and the contaminated products have been properly disposed of. Persons in contact with the samples all returned negative results for cholera bacterium.

Personnel and environment involved with the positive samples have not shown abnormalities after examination, authorities said, and they have reminded other destinations outside of Wuhan that received relevant products of the same batch.

There exist some risks of the cholera bacteria in these products infecting humans, experts noted but said there is no need to panic. "Cholera is an infection of the digestive tract. So as long as people eat cooked products, there would be no risk of infection," Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Fri, 15 Jul 2022. Even if people are infected with cholera, China has long been capable of treating the disease with drugs and other medical facilities, Yang said. The incident has not been found to have involved people and is unrelated to the confirmed case of cholera discovered at Wuhan University on 9 Jul 2022. The patient showed symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by fever and quickly recovered after effective diagnosis and treatment. No other cases were reported.

Cholera in China has been under control since 2000 and only sporadic cases have been reported in recent years. China can provide advanced medical treatment and efficacious medicines against the disease, thus it is less likely to see a cholera outbreak nowadays, experts said, noting that there is no need to panic.

An official said on Tue, 19 Jul 2022 that 7 people have died of cholera and about 100 others have been affected by the water-borne disease in Kashipur block in Odisha's Rayagada district. This was revealed by Rayagada district collector Swadha Dev Singh based on a report of the ICMR's Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar.

"Though initially, we were suspecting it to be diarrhea, later it came to the fore that people might have been infected to cholera also. They collapsed because they could not get the proper medical attention at the due time," Singh told PTI over the phone. She said that the administration is focusing on the early identification of cases based on the symptoms so that they can be provided medical attention immediately.

Official sources said that 3 out of the 9 samples of rectal swabs of patients in the district were found to have presence of the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium. _V. cholerae_ was found in the feces of 3 patients from Dudukabahal village, one of the several affected villages in the block. The bacteria have also been found in the water used by the villagers.

Rayagada's chief district medical officer (CDMO) Dr Lalmohan Routray also confirmed that the disease was spreading from contaminated water. director, public health, Niranjan Mishra said that the government has taken several measures to check the spread of cholera by opening two temporary medical camps in affected areas of Kashipur block. The medical teams rushed and people are going door to door to find out whether anyone has any symptoms. Mishra also said while 7 people have so far died, about 100 others are infected by the water borne disease.

As there is a rise in cholera cases in Rayagada, the district administrations of neighboring Koraput and Kalahandi have also been put on alert and do an immediate intervention if anyone shows symptoms. Many people were under treatment at the Community Health Centre at Kashipur, Primary Health Centre in Tikiri, District Headquarters Hospital at Rayagada, Aditya Birla Medical, and Utkal Hospital in Ushapada. One patient is undergoing treatment at the SLN Medical College & Hospital in Koraput.

Cholera has been confirmed in 27 people in Kathmandu so far, according to the Ministry of Health and Population. Cholera was first reported on 16 Jun 2022 in Kathmandu. 2 members of the same family living in Bagbazar of Kathmandu were confirmed to have cholera. Another case was also reported in Sanepa of Lalitpur the next day. Likewise, the 4th case was seen in Dilli Bazaar on 19 Jun 2022. 3 people are currently undergoing treatment at the hospital.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Population has directed all the hospitals in the country to observe necessary precautions and be in a state of readiness as the monsoon is already active. Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari, chief of the Health Emergency and Disaster Management Unit instructed the same as contaminated drinking water along with monsoon-triggered calamities had added challenges to sanitation
spurring chances of spread of contagious infections such as cholera.

The hospitals have been asked to keep vigilance for disaster and epidemic response efforts and to keep workers in a ready state, manage beds in hospitals as per the need, and put in place necessary medical equipment.

[9] Cholera - South Sudan: (Unity)
Date: Mon 18 Jul 2022

https://cityreviewss.com/15-new-cases-of-cholera-reported-in-bentiu/


The national ministry of health and the WHO have confirmed 15 new cases of cholera at a Bentiu-based Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp. The report brings the total number of infections to 255 since the outbreak of the disease in May 2022. According to the weekly statistics released by the ministry of health and the World Health Organization, the confirmed cases were from week 27 [week of 4 Jul 2022].

"Of the 15 cases, 14 were reported from Bentiu IDP camp and 1 from Bentiu town in Rubkona County 11 (73.4%) of the cases were females, while their male counterparts accounted for 4 (26.6%)," notes a report seen by The City Review during the weekend [16-17 Jul 2022]. "7 (46.6%) of the new cases reported were previously vaccinated, and 8 (53.3%) were not vaccinated."

The health officials stated that the common present signs and symptoms included watery diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. "14 cases had mild dehydration, and 1 had severe dehydration. "The most affected age groups were 0-4 years with 6 (40%) and 20-49 years with 5 (33.3%)."

On 15 Jun 2022, the ministry of health and its partners launched an oral cholera vaccination campaign in Juba County, Central Equatoria State, and other states across the country. The campaign was part of a response strategy to prevent a cholera outbreak in the designated hot spot area. According to the reports, 398 516 (63%) individuals were vaccinated in Juba during the 1st round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign. "In Leer, 64033 (85%) were vaccinated during the 1st round, while 35 375 (47%) were vaccinated during the second round of the campaign," the report reads.

But the situation update as of the time shows the current transmission remains sporadic, but the risk of transmission to at-risk counties remains high due to population movements, the presence of IDPs, persistent flooding, and low access to safe water and hygiene and sanitation facilities.

Health officials also say that there is inadequate funding to implement all planned activities. The report also highlighted challenges such as the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) not receiving results of the 15 suspected _V. cholerae_ isolates referred for sequencing to the Pasteur Institute-Paris, France. "Delay in receiving cholera outbreak data from the subnational level-line lists not received from some facilities; inadequate access to improved sanitation facilities that are below the sphere standards in all the sectors of Bentiu IDP camp and Rubkona town IDPs."

The inadequate safe and clean water supply poses risk for surface water consumption within the camp and for sub-optimal community engagement and risk communication in affected and high-risk populations on cholera prevention and control. The ministry of health strongly advised the public to take all precautionary measures to avoid community transmission.

The state commissioner for health, Aminu Tsanyawa, confirmed the cases at a news conference in Kano on Tue, 19 Jul 2022. Mr Tsanyawa said 5 deaths were recorded, while 184 of the cases were treated and the patients fully recovered. He noted that there had been a decline in cases of the outbreak as against in 2021 when the state recorded 12 116 cases with 329 deaths. According to him, cholera outbreaks are seasonal. Cholera is a bacterial infection in humans caused by _Vibrio cholerae_.

The commissioner further said that the risk factors for cholera transmission were poor personal and environmental hygiene. Other risk factors, he said, included food and water contamination, poor waste disposal, and open defecation. He, however, cautioned residents on effective handwashing, and personal and environmental hygiene to control the situation.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Chapter 9. Cholera, in Chronic Illness and Disability: The Pediatric Gastrointestinal Tract. Edited by Greydanus D E, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
