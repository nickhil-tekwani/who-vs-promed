Canada to enhance BSE feed controls
------------------------------------
The Government of Canada today [Tue 13 Jul 2004] announced that it will
introduce new animal feed restrictions to further strengthen Canada's
safeguards against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The Government
intends to require the removal of bovine specified risk materials (SRM)
from the animal feed chain. SRM are tissues that, in infected cattle,
harbor the BSE agent. These tissues are already removed from all animals
slaughtered for human consumption.
This measure will add an additional level of security to Canada's current
feed ban, which has prohibited feeding cattle with ruminant materials,
including SRM, since 1997. Preventing these potentially infectious
materials from entering the entire feed production chain at the start
diminishes the potential for cross-contamination of ruminant animal feeds
that could occur as feed is produced and distributed, as well as any
inappropriate on-farm use. Based on risk analyses, removing SRM from animal
feed will more quickly reduce the incidence of BSE in North America by
preventing future disease spread.
"Canada had the foresight to implement protections, such as the feed ban,
well before we discovered BSE in this part of the world," said Bob Speller,
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Minister Responsible for the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. "Taking a forward-looking approach to
build on those safeguards will provide the long-term level of animal health
protection needed."
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency will introduce a regulatory proposal to
require the removal and redirection of SRM, and dead and downer cattle,
from all animal feed, including pet food. Given the importance of this
measure, the Government has been carefully considering various options in
consultation with provincial and territorial representatives, stakeholders,
and international counterparts, including officials from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. The Government will continue to consult widely on the
scope, implementation timetable, and other operational details for this
measure as it is further developed.
Following the detection of BSE in North America, the international team of
animal health experts that reviewed the Canadian BSE situation strongly
endorsed removal and redirection of SRM from the animal feed chain. A
similar recommendation was made by the team that reviewed the American BSE
experience.
Feed restrictions are universally recognized as the critical measure to
contain the spread of BSE.
Canadian and American authorities have worked cooperatively over the past
months to develop coherent approaches to address BSE in North America. This
effort reflects the integrated nature of the North American market and the
shared commitment of both countries to implement science-based safeguards
to protect animal health.
Since detecting BSE in North America in 2003, the Government has taken
significant steps to strengthen Canada's BSE safeguards. Canada has
excluded SRM from human food, is enhancing animal identification, and
intensifying BSE surveillance. The addition of new feed controls will
further strengthen the future health of the national herd and complete
Canada's response to the key recommendations of the international team.
"Today's [Tue 13 Jul 2004] announcement complements the substantial
measures we've already taken to protect public health," said Minister of
Health Pierre Pettigrew. "We will continue to work with the international
community to ensure that the most effective safeguards for bovine-derived
products are in place in Canada."

USDA and HHS strengthen safeguards against BSE
-----------------------------------------------
HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman
today [Tue 13 Jul 2004] announced 3 actions being taken to further
strengthen existing safeguards that protect consumers against the agent
that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as "mad cow
disease").
The 3 documents on display today include:
1. A joint USDA Food Safety & Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) notice that asks for public comment on additional preventive actions
that are being considered concerning BSE;
2. An interim final FDA rule that prohibits the use of certain
cattle-derived materials in human food (including dietary supplements) and
cosmetics; and
3. A proposed FDA rule on record-keeping requirements for the interim final
rule relating to this ban.
"Today's [Tue 13 Jul 2004] actions continue our strong commitment to public
health protections against BSE," Secretary Thompson said. "Although our
current rules are strong, when it comes to public health and safety we
cannot be content with the status quo. We must continue to make sure the
public is protected to the greatest extent possible."
"This Administration is committed to science-based measures to enhance and
protect public health," Veneman said. "The advance notice of proposed
rule-making will allow the public the opportunity to provide their input."
"The series of fire walls already in place offer excellent protection
against BSE," said Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,
Dr. Lester M. Crawford. "With these additional measures, we will make a
strong system even stronger by putting into effect the most comprehensive,
science-based improvements possible."
The steps already taken have been effective in protecting the American
consumer from exposure to BSE. Import controls on live cattle, and certain
ruminant products, were put in place more than 15 years ago. In 1997, FDA
finalized its animal feed ban, which has been the critical safeguard to
stop the spread of BSE through the U.S. cattle population by prohibiting
the feeding of most mammalian protein to cattle and other ruminant animals.
USDA implemented additional measures in January [2004] to ensure that
no cattle tissues known to be high-risk for carrying the BSE agent are
included in USDA-regulated products. Finally, as became evident last
December [2003], there is a contingency response plan, developed over the
past several years, that is launched immediately to contain any potential
damage after a BSE positive animal is found.
To allow interested parties and stakeholders the opportunity to comment on
the additional regulatory and policy measures under consideration, USDA's
APHIS and FSIS, along with the FDA, developed an advance notice of proposed
rule-making [ANPRM] that includes several additional actions the federal
government is considering regarding BSE.
The ANPR also provides the public a succinct report on the work of the
international review team (IRT), convened by Secretary Veneman, to review
the U.S. response to the single case of BSE in the United States (in a cow
imported from Canada) [See posting 20040205.0426. - Mod.AS], along with a
summary of the many actions already taken by each agency on BSE.
USDA's FSIS continues to seek and address comments on actions taken in
relation to the BSE mitigation measures put in place in January 2004. FSIS
is also specifically seeking comments on whether a country's BSE status
should be taken into account when determining whether a country's meat
inspection system is equivalent to the U.S. regulations, including the
provisions in the FSIS interim final rules.
USDA's APHIS is specifically seeking comments on the implementation of a
national animal identification system. In April 2004, USDA announced the
availability of USD 18 million in Commodity Credit Corporation funding to
expedite development of a national animal identification system, which is
currently underway. APHIS is inviting comments on when, and under what
circumstances, the program should move from voluntary to mandatory, and,
which species should be covered now and over the long term.
The ANPRM also requests comment on the following measures related to animal
feed, which is regulated by FDA:
1. removing specified risk materials (SRM's) from all animal feed,
including pet food, to control the risks of cross-contamination throughout
feed manufacture, distribution, and on the farm due to mis-feeding;
2. requiring dedicated equipment, or facilities, for handling and storing
feed and ingredients during manufacturing and transportation, to prevent
cross-contamination;
3. prohibiting the use of all mammalian and poultry protein in ruminant
feed to prevent cross-contamination; and
4. prohibiting materials from non-ambulatory disabled cattle and dead stock
from use in all animal feed.
FDA has reached a preliminary conclusion that it should propose to remove
SRM's from all animal feed and is currently working on a proposal to
accomplish this goal. Comments on these issues raised in the ANPRM are due
to FDA next month [August 2004].
FDA today [Tue 13 Jul 2004] also issued an interim final rule that
prohibits the use of cattle-derived materials that can carry the
BSE-infectious agent in human foods, including certain meat-based products
and dietary supplements, and, in cosmetics. These high-risk cattle-derived
materials include SRM's that are known to harbor concentrations of the
infectious agent for BSE, such as the brain, skull, eyes, and spinal cord
of cattle 30 months of age or older, and a portion of the small intestine
and tonsils from all cattle, regardless of their age. Prohibited high-risk
bovine materials also include material from non-ambulatory disabled cattle,
the small intestine of all cattle, material from cattle not inspected and
passed for human consumption, and mechanically separated beef.
This action is consistent with the recent interim final rule issued by USDA
declaring these materials to be inedible (unfit for human food) and
prohibiting their use as human food.
FDA's interim final rule, in conjunction with interim final rules issued by
FSIS in January 2004, will minimize human exposure to materials that
scientific studies have demonstrated are likely to contain the BSE agent
when derived from cattle that are infected with the disease. Consumption of
products contaminated with the agent that causes BSE is the likely cause of
a similar disease in people called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Although FDA's interim final rule has the full force and effect of law and
takes effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, FDA is
also asking for public comment on it.
In conjunction with the publication of the interim final rule, FDA is
also proposing to require that manufacturers and processors of
FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics containing cattle-derived material
maintain records showing that prohibited materials are not used in their
products. FDA is taking this action because records documenting the absence
of such materials are important to ensure compliance with requirements of
the interim final rule.
Publication of this USDA-FDA notice, as well as the 2 FDA documents, is
scheduled for mid-July 2004 in the Federal Register.
Comments should be submitted as directed in the addresses section of each
document. Each document also provides information about how and where
comments received may be viewed.

Cavan-Monaghan: BSE case is a wake-up call
-----------------------------------------------
"A thorough and immediate investigation needs to be launched into the
latest BSE case in County Cavan to investigate how an animal has tested
positive for this disease after the imposition of the ban on meat and bone
meal in 1997," the Labor Party spokesperson on Agriculture and Food Safety,
Deputy Mary Upton has said.
"Consumers have been assured that all animals born after 1997 were free of
BSE, given the feed ban introduced that year. Animals born after 1997
should not have BSE. This is yet another wake-up call to ensure that all
traces of contaminated feed are excluded, and, for us to keep an open mind
on the cause of BSE. We need to remain vigilant and to continue to carry
out research into the disease."
"While I welcome, overall, the drop in BSE numbers, the latest case of BSE
could indicate that the safeguards aimed at ensuring the elimination of BSE
may need [to be] improved. It is clear the strict feed controls are not
foolproof. The Department of Agriculture and Food needs to indicate
immediately what steps it is taking to ensure BSE is eradicated, so that
the concerns of farmers and consumers alike can be addressed."

[Ireland is one of the 5 countries with the highest annual BSE incidence
rates (number of indigenous cases per million bovines aged over 24 months).
The data since 2000, as published by the OIE, are:
Country / 2000 / 2001 / 2002 / 2003
Portugal / 186.95 / 137.88 / 107.80 / 137.19
GB (UK)/ 293.33 / 258.24 / 247.80 / 130.22
Ireland / 38.17 / 61.80 / 88.39 / 57.81
Spain / 0.59 / 24.23 / 37.95 / 46.31
Switzerland / 40.6 / 49.1 / 27.93 / 24.86
According to official Irish statistics, the percentage of cases diagnosed
in animals less than 6 years of age has declined from 40 percent in 2000 to
16 percent in 2001, 2 percent in 2002, and 0 percent in 2003. The current
case in a BAB (born after ban) animal is a matter of concern, but is not
solitary and should not be overly surprising. The final, total, and
effective feed ban ("real ban") in the UK was implemented since July 1996.
However, according to Defra's statistics as of 1 Jun 2004, the number of
confirmed BARB (born after real ban) cases has been the following (year of
birth): 1997: 35; 1998: 19; 1999: 7.
An opinion of EU's Scientific Steering Committee titled "BSE in UK's cattle
born after 31 Jul 1996 [BARBS]", adopted on 11 Apr 2003, can be seen at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out353_en.pdf>.
Table 5 outlines the number of BSE-positive cases recorded between July
2001 and November 2002 in European risk stock born during 1997-1999; in
brackets: rate per 1 million adult cattle:
Spain - 36 (10.6)
France - 16 (1.4)
Germany - 21 (3.3)
Belgium - 7 (4.7)
Netherlands - 7 (4.0)
Italy - 12 (3.6)
Denmark - 2 (2.3)
Ireland - 5 (1.4)
Portugal - 13 (16.9)
UK - 21 (4.2).
Though several hypotheses have been considered, the explanation for the
appearance of BSE in BARB animals is included in the remarkable list of
BSE-related questions which still await satisfactory answers. - Mod.AS].
