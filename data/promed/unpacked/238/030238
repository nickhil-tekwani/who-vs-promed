Babesiosis is caused by a parasite that can be traced before a blood transfusion. So why do 4 in every 1000 donations still contain the potentially deadly [parasite]?

In hospitals across the United States, people are getting sick and even dying from receiving transfusions of blood tainted with a known, epidemic-level parasite, and we're still not testing either the blood supply or prospective donors for it.

Babesiosis has spread like wildfire through parts of the U.S., sickening those in the prime of their lives and sometimes even killing the weak, young, or elderly. Primarily spread by the bite of an infected tick, it's a known hazard -- with symptoms regularly recognized in hot zones such as the Midwest or New England -- and is starting to be mentioned right alongside Lyme's Disease whenever ticks are brought up.

The symptoms read like a laundry list of hellish conditions. Severe anemia. Fever. Chills. Drenching sweat. Nausea. Vomiting. Shock. In extreme cases, even death.

"Extreme fatigue, and then I began running temperatures at night like 101, 102 [Fahrenheit]. And then I would get a night sweat," one 63-year-old babesia victim, who preferred to remain anonymous, told the Daily Beast. After 3 weeks of worsening conditions, the Wisconsin-based farmer brought himself to the emergency room. It wasn't until [after] 21 days, massive doses of multiple antibiotics, and a case of respiratory failure that he finally left the hospital.

"I continued on that medication for about 3 months," he claimed, noting that he was 1 of, if not the, 1st people in his state to contract babesiosis. "You have to continue the drugs. After I contracted it, other people picked it up in the state. And there were some that did not keep on the medication routine, and from what I understand they died because they didn't take those mass doses of antibiotics."

Babesia is currently the number-1 transfusion-transmitted infection in the US, a title it has held for years. And it has claimed at least 10 lives in the process.

The reason so many choose to take a gamble with their patients' well being? Money, of course.

A recent test of 115 000 blood donations from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and parts of New England showed about 460 (or about 4 in 1000) samples indicated babesia contamination. The testing is the [linchpin]. Currently, there is no FDA-approved test for the parasite, though many are in development, meaning that blood collectors depend on a questionnaire to determine the safety of a donor.

The blood that was tested above was done so by tracking the DNA of the parasite.

Unfortunately many people are contaminated with a low level and may not know it, or may have been too recently exposed to be symptomatic, meaning simply asking them if they have or have had the parasite is a waste of time. Thus, the medical industry is sitting on a trove of potentially lethal blood, destined for individuals whose immune systems are likely already compromised by illness or trauma.

There is babesia-free blood available from the American Red Cross, but only hospitals in a couple states are ordering it. The reason so many choose to take a gamble with their patients' well being? Money, of course.

"The problem is most hospitals don't do that because it costs them an additional charge for us to do the testing," Susan Stramer, the American Red Cross' vice president of scientific affairs said in a recent interview. "It really leaves the rest of the patient population vulnerable."

This means that until the FDA mandates testing, or until they can be reimbursed for it from federal agencies, hospitals won't incorporate screening blood for babesiosis as part of what Stramer calls their "standard of care."

With Babesiosis cases multiplying 10-fold in just a few years and showing no signs of slowing down, receiving a blood transfusion becomes an increasingly dangerous gamble. And it's a gamble scientists have been warning us about since at least 2006.

[In a study of 311 blood samples, 10 (3.2 percent) tested positive for Babesia antibody (IgG), which is in the middle of the range for blood donors in the northeastern United States (0.2 percent in areas where babesiosis is not endemic to 7.3 percent in highly disease-endemic areas. When serum samples were IFA-positive, DNA was extracted from the corresponding whole-blood sample at the Yale University School of Public Health laboratory for real-time PCR (Peter Krause, proprietary protocol). _B. microti_ DNA was not detected in any of the 10 antibody-positive serum specimens. The study estimates at most 0.86 cases of Babesia per 100 000 population, which is far below the estimated incidence of 4 cases per 1000 blood donors in this report (Robert P. Smith, Jr. et al. Human Babesiosis, Maine, USA, 1995-2011. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014; 20:1727-30).

A recent study calculated the cost of introducing screening donor blood for Babesia in the United States, and concluded that "the proportion of donor-seronegative parasitemia, transmissibility, and clinical outcomes resulting from TTB are uncertain" (Goodell AJ et al. Costs, consequences, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for Babesia microti donor screening of the US blood supply. Transfusion. 2014;54:2245-57).

Screening methods need to be thoroughly validated before usage. The threshold below which the microorganism is not detected need to be determined and the false-positive rates should also be known with great certainty.

In conclusion, the incidence reported here of 4 per 1000 blood donors is out of range compared to other studies. Most probably the result reflects technical problems with the test, resulting in false positives. The results should be confirmed in an independent laboratory with expertise in analysis used for screening purposes. - Mod.EP]
