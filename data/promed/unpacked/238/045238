A 13-year-old Siberian boy has been hospitalized after catching a
plague-infected ground squirrel and bringing it home, Russia's top
sanitary official said on Thursday.

The boy, living in a remote shepherds' community in south Siberia's
Tuva Republic, brought the rodent home in his hat. His grandfather
immediately killed the animal, and called a doctor.

The teenager "came into immediate contact with a long-tailed ground
squirrel [Spermophilus undulatus_] infected with the plague. His
state of health is satisfactory. He is undergoing prophylactic
treatment," Gennady Onishchenko told RIA Novosti.

The area has been thoroughly disinfected, and medics from the
regional plague prevention center are carrying out anti-epidemic
measures in the area.

Plague, caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacterium, can be transmitted
from rodents to humans via fleas. Bubonic plague is now extremely
rare in industrialized countries, and can be treated with antibiotics.

[More than 200 species of mammals can be infected with _Y. pestis_.
Rodents are the reservoir hosts. Many rodents, including ground
squirrels, suffer occasional epidemics or maintain the bacterium in
natural cycles. In many cases, rodents may show mild illness or are
asymptomatic. Probably, the squirrel in the above described case was
killed by the boy's grandfather because of demonstrating suspect
changes or was sick. - Mod.AS

Plague is endemic, not emerging, in the region, but is reported here
because it is listed as a Schedule A potential bioterror agent.
