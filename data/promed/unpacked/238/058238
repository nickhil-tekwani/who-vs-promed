The Eduardo de Menezes Hospital in Belo Horizonte, which specializes in the care of infectious diseases, has [this year] already notified 183 cases of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection. The data are partial and were released by the Minas Gerais [MG] State Department of Health (Secretaria de Estado da Saúde; SES-MG) this March [2022].

For Tatiani Fereguetti, the hospital's care manager, the increase in cases is linked to unprotected sexual intercourse. "We have had an exponential increase in the number of cases and in reinfection rates in the last decade, which probably points to the very low adherence to condom use, especially in oral sexual practices," he said. "It is important to remember that syphilis, in the early stages, is very contagious and can be easily transmitted through sexual contact or even kissing on the mouth."

The numbers released by SES-MG show an upward trend in cases of infection in the last 3 years:

Syphilis cases registered in MG
Year / number of cases
2019 / 15 704
2020 / 12 775
2021 / 15 581
2022 [January] / 381

Also according to the secretariat, Minas Gerais received 382 [381 according to the table above] notifications of syphilis in January this year [2022] alone.

The patient should seek care at health centers. The units are equipped with the quick test, with instant results. The test also detects hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV. Treatment [of syphilis] is with antibiotics.

Syphilis can be divided into 3 stages. Symptoms are varied and may disappear regardless of treatment. Primary syphilis: the 1st manifestations can occur, on average, 3 weeks after sexual contact, with an ulcer or erosion at the site of entry of the bacteria. Secondary syphilis: Signs appear, on average, between 6 weeks and 6 months after infection and last from 4 to 12 weeks. According to the SES-MG, skin eruptions can occur, affecting the body, reaching the feet and hands. And also, fever, malaise, headache, discouragement, and swelling. Tertiary syphilis: it can present its 1st symptoms from 2 to 40 years after infection. The manifestation occurs through inflammation and tissue destruction, which can affect the skin, bones, brain, and heart. This is also the case with neurosyphilis, which compromises the central nervous system and can be observed in the early stages of infection.

Syphilis can also be transmitted from mother to child when the pregnant woman is not treated. It usually occurs through the bloodstream until it reaches the placenta and fetus, or during childbirth, when the baby has direct contact with the genital lesions.

[Minas Gerais is the 2nd-most populous Brazilian state; its capital and largest city is Belo Horizonte, whose metropolitan population of 5.8 million residents is the 3rd largest in Brazil, after Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais). Minas Gerais is in the north of the southeast region of Brazil, bordering on Bahia (north), Goiás (west and northwest), Mato Grosso do Sul (far west), the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (south), and the state of Espírito Santo (east). A map showing the location of Minas Gerais can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+Minas+Gerais,+Brazil.

The data for the years 2019-2021 and Jan 2022 fail to indicate an increase in cases in Minas Gerais, but a recent study of congenital syphilis in Minas Gerais found that the average percentage annual increase between 2009 and 2019 was 36.7% for gestational syphilis incidence rates and 32.8% for congenital syphilis incidence rates (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644777/). Another study from the Brazilian Ministry of Health selected 100 municipalities that had reported 57.7% of syphilis cases and that contained about 1/3 of the Brazilian population. It found that in this group of cities, significant growth in numbers of cases occurred in all municipalities in all regions of Brazil between 2007 and 2017 for syphilis in pregnancy, congenital syphilis, and "acquired" syphilis, especially in the south (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231029).

The increasing incidence of syphilis reported in the literature follows similar trends in many other regions of the world (see also's below). The news report above, however, fails to say what stages of syphilis are being reported, although I assume most of the cases are primary and secondary syphilis, the most contagious stages of syphilis; the age and sex distribution of cases, sexual orientation of cases, and the proportion of congenital and gestational syphilis are not given, and the news report gives no data that substantiate their impression of "an exponential increase in the number of cases" or the reasons for this purported increase. More information concerning this increasing incidence in Minas Gerais would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
