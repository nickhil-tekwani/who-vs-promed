Link proposed between autism and thiomersal-containing vaccines
-----------------------------------------------
Mercury in vaccines for babies and infants could be the cause of a steep
rise in cases of autism in children around the world, according to a
growing number of scientists. The increase in reports of autism in Britain,
America, and some other countries coincides with a growth in the number of
inoculations given to young children, say the researchers. Many of the
vaccines contain a preservative called thiomersal, which is 49.6% mercury
-- a substance known to have neurotoxic effects, especially in infants,
whose brains are still developing. The symptoms caused resemble those
displayed by autistic children.
Autism is a spectrum of disorders, which range in severity from bizarre,
violent behavior to an inability to communicate or interact socially, along
with repetitive patterns of behavior. Estimates of the prevalence of the
syndrome in Britain range from 10 cases per 10 000 population with
"classic" autism, to 9.1 per 1,000 showing some signs of autistic behavior.
The National Autistic Society estimates that there are about 500 000 people
with autism in Britain, 120 000 of them children. According to one recent
study, there has been a 10-fold increase among children between 1984 and 1994.
The US Institute of Medicine is so concerned that officials have organized
a 2-day meeting in July to discuss the hypothesis that [the thiomersal
content of] vaccines is linked to autism. In general, researchers argue
that the cumulative effects of mercury impair brain development and damage
the child's immune system and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in
hypersensitivity to toxic environmental substances. This build-up could
lead to autism or a form of mercury poisoning -- whose symptoms are
similar. [Some] researchers believe [that] the measles, mumps, and rubella
(MMR) vaccine, usually given at 18 to 24 months, could trigger autism
because the damaged immune system cannot cope with 3 live viruses at once.
[Several comprehensive international studies published in recent months
have failed to detect any relationship between administration of MMR
vaccine and autism in children - Mod.CP]
Only some children exposed to mercury will develop symptoms. Researchers
believe this indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition. This
theory was reinforced by a study published this month which showed that in
99 per cent of autistic children a family of proteins essential for
disposing of mercury and other heavy metals is missing or "disabled". The
proteins, called metallothionein (MT), are the main way in which the body
counters heavy metal. The study, by the Chicago-based Pfeiffer Centre, a
health research institute, found that 499 of 503 autistic patients showed
an MT "dysfunction".
The number of vaccinations given to babies and children in Britain and
America has increased significantly. In the United States the number given
before the age of 2 [years] has risen from 8 in 1980 to 22 now. In Britain
in 1970, most children received diphtheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough,
and BCG for tuberculosis; about half were also immunised against measles.
Rubella was added in 1972, MMR in 1988, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b in
1992, a second dose of MMR in 1996, and meningitis C in 1999. The first
dose of MMR is given at 12 to 15 months and the second at 3 to 5 years. [A
lengthy description of a child reacting adversely immediately after MMR
vaccination has been deleted, since it conflicts with the arguments in the
following paragraph. - Mod.CP]
MMR vaccine does not contain thiomersal, though [some] other childhood
vaccines do. Thiomersal was introduced in the 1930s as a preservative and
went into common use without review by America's Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) because it was assumed to be safe. In America,
researchers [have] found [that] some infants vaccinated using multidose
vials with thiomersal can receive 62.5 micrograms of mercury per visit (100
times more than the intake considered safe for the average 6 month old by
the US Environmental Protection Agency). In June 1999 the FDA discovered
that: "Infants who receive thiomersal-containing vaccine at several visits
may have been exposed to more mercury than recommended by Federal
guidelines." The following month the European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicinal Products (EMEA) issued a statement saying: "Cumulative exposure
to ethylmercury [found in thiomersal] . . . could lead to a potential cause
for concern." In May last year, a scientist from the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) gave a presentation, based on a study of the
Vaccine Safety Datalink Project -- a database of 400 000 children -- with
evidence of harm. Dr Thomas Verstraeten of CDC found the screening analysis
suggests "statistically significant associations" between certain
neurologic developmental disorders -- such as attention deficit disorder,
and speech and language disorders -- and exposure to mercury from
thiomersal-containing vaccines before the age of 6 months. As a result, the
EMEA issued another statement last June, saying: "For vaccination in
infants and toddlers, as a precautionary measure it would be prudent to
promote the general use of vaccines without thiomersal. Moreover, the use
of thiomersal-free vaccines should be recommended for newborns."

[The article is followed by a list of the UK-licensed vaccines which
contain thiomersal. MMR vaccine, for long the target of the "autism lobby",
does not appear in this list, nor for that matter does any other viral
vaccine. Logically, the prior studies ruling out an association between
vaccination and autistic-like syndrome would have ruled out the risks from
this chemical preservative in vaccines. - Mods.CP, MHJ]
