Virus threatens large chunk of Niagara fruit industry
-----------------------------------------------------
ST. CATHARINES - Plum pox potyvirus is threatening to wipe out much of the
tender fruit industry in Niagara. Nine Niagara fruit growers will lose an
orchard and possibly their farms in order to stop the spread of the virus,
which renders certain fruits inedible.
The secretary of Niagara's tender fruit producer's marketing board, Adrian
Huisman, said if drastic action isn't taken now, plum pox disease would
wipe out Niagara's 1.5 million peach, nectarine, plum and apricot trees,
which provides growers with an annual revenue of $40 million.
The virus is spread by aphids and only attacks peach, nectarine, plum and
apricot trees. 30 trees have been found to be infected - mostly in
Niagara-On-The-Lake - but Canadian Food Inspection Agency horticultural
specialist Blake Ferguson said 30 000 fruit trees will be removed and
destroyed, beginning 15 Aug. Most are peach and nectarine trees, victims or
potential victims of plum pox virus which first appeared in Canada in June
after being detected in the United States for the first time last fall.
There's no known treatment, other than destroying infected trees to prevent
the virus from spreading. Canadian agriculture officials are trying to
determine how the virus got into Canada. One possibility is the importation
of 1 100 fruit tree saplings several years ago from nurseries in
Pennsylvania, some of which have since been found to be infected with the
virus. Plum pox has not been detected anywhere else Canada.
The reason for the vast kill relative to the small number of infected trees
is the fear the virus has spread from infected trees to trees nearby. It
takes several years for the virus to become detectable in a tree, so once
established, it becomes hard to destroy as the infection keeps spreading.
Soil from which the trees are removed must remain fallow for three years,
meaning growers won't be able to replace trees with new trees during the
enforced fallow period. No matter what they replant, affected growers will
have to wait years before new trees start producing fruit.
Stone fruit trees in Niagara will have to be sampled for years to ensure
that plum pox has been wiped out completely.

[Unfortunately, eradication of infected sources of the virus is the only
practical way of attempting to manage this disease. Much of the information
on management of plum pox disease is derived from the European literature.
The virus is spread by many insect species, but principally _Brachycaudus
cardui_, _B. helichrysi_, _Myzus persicae_ , and _Phorodon humuli_. A
problem in the eradication of infected trees may be wild species of
_Prunus_ which can be infected as a consequence of aphid transmission of
the virus and thus become sources for additional spread. The relevance of
wild species to perpetuation of the virus in the Niagara region remains to
be determined.
Although nectarines, plums, almonds and peaches are not on the ProMED-Plant
list of 30 major crops, the disease is of such economic importance to
orchardists that it warrants publication.
