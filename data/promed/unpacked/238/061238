At least one in every 25 people living in north Chennai have tested
positive for hepatitis. A random screening of 1297 people in 6
different locations of North Chennai by the Madras Medical College
showed 61 of them positive for hepatitis. While 44 had hepatitis B, 17
were positive for hepatitis C.

Madras Medical College dean Dr S Kanakasabai, who released the results
on Wednesday [26 Jul 2011], said the College organised [an] awareness
and screening programme (using blood samples) [for] the liver diseases
at 6 locations: Harbour, Seven Wells Street, Wall tax Road, Broadway,
Sathya Nagar (War Memorial) and Bharathi Women's College to
commemorate World Hepatitis Day, which falls on Thursday [28 Jul
2011]. The screening was done for people from the lower socio-economic
groups every day for the last one week.

"These patients were apparently healthy. They did not know they were
carriers of the disease," said Dr Kanakasabai. The results shocked not
only the patients but also many doctors in the college. "We did not
expect that more than 4 percent of the people will be tested
positive," he said. Those tested positive will be treated at the
Government General Hospital, which is attached to the college. Their
close relatives will also be screened. The college is also planning to
extend the study across the city.

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most commonly caused by a
viral infection. There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as
types A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis can lead to illness and death. In
particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of
millions of people and together are the most common cause of liver
cirrhosis and cancer.

Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated
food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D -- like HIV -- usually occur as a
result of contact with infected body fluids. Acute infection may occur
with limited or no symptoms or may include symptoms such as jaundice
(yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain.

Surgical gasteroentrologist Dr R Surendran, who works with Stanley
Medical College, says hospital medical records show that nearly 6
percent of the population of north Chennai has hepatitis B and nearly
one percent have hepatitis C. "But we thought our data was skewed
because only people with problems came to our hospital," he said.

[World Hepatitis Day 2011: The World Heath Organization (WHO) is today
[Thu 28 Jul 2011] calling for attention to the global health problem
posed by viral hepatitis. The 1st official WHO-supported World
Hepatitis Day, coordinated by the World Hepatitis Alliance, comes
under the slogan: Hepatitis affects everyone, everywhere. Know it.
Confront it. http://www.worldhepatitisday.info/.

It is emphasised that although some 350 million people worldwide live
with chronic hepatitis B and 170 million people with chronic hepatitis
C, awareness of the disease is low. In Europe, there are an estimated
14 million chronic hepatitis B cases and about 9 million people
infected with hepatitis C (Eurosurveillance editorial team. World
Hepatitis Day 2011. Euro Surveill. 2011;16(30):pii=19926:
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19926).

The 1st official WHO World Hepatitis Day is marked to increase the
awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases that
it causes. It provides an opportunity to focus on specific actions
such as: strengthening prevention, screening and control of viral
hepatitis and its related diseases; increasing hepatitis B vaccine
coverage and integration into national immunization programmes; and
coordinating a global response to hepatitis.

Hepatitis B: 2 billion people (estimated) worldwide have been infected
with the virus. Read the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis B at
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html.
Key facts:
- Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can
cause both acute and chronic disease.
- The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other
body fluids of an infected person, not through casual contact.
- About 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with the virus,
and about 350 million live with chronic infection. An estimated 600
000 persons die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences of
hepatitis B.
- About 25 percent of adults who become chronically infected during
childhood later die from liver cancer or cirrhosis (scarring of the
liver) caused by the chronic infection.
- The hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.
- Hepatitis B virus is an important occupational hazard for health
workers.
- Hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine.

Hepatitis C: 130 million people at least are chronically infected with
hepatitis C virus. Read the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis C at
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html.
Key facts:
- Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus
(HCV).
- HCV infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic illness. It
can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a
serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the
liver and liver cancer.
- HCV is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected
person.
- About 130-170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis
C virus, and more than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related
liver diseases each year.
- HCV infection is curable using increasingly effective antivirals.
- Despite ongoing research, there is currently no vaccine to prevent
hepatitis C virus infection.

The data from North Chennai provide a snap-shot of the reality of the
situation and justify the need for the World Hepatitis Day to
highlight the gravity of the situation. At present, only hepatitis A
and hepatitis B virus infections can be controlled by vaccination.

Chennai (formerly known as Madras), is the capital city of the Indian
state of Tamil Nadu, located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of
Bengal. Chennai is the 4rth most populous metropolitan area and the
5th most populous city in India. A map of the city of Chennai can be
