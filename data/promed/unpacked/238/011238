Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H5N8 in wild birds and domestic poultry in Germany
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in tufted ducks found dead in the North and South of Germany in early November 2016.

Molecular analyses identified the virus as a member of the group B of H5N8 viruses (Gochang-like) of the Southeast Asian goose/Guangdong lineage, which is different from the H5N8 viruses observed in winter 2014/2015 in the North of Germany. The outbreak is ongoing and numerous dead wild birds (initially mainly diving duck species), positive for HPAIV H5N8, were found at these locations, with new cases now being seen in an increasing number of the German Federal States. The spectrum of affected species is currently also widening and includes buzzards, swans, grebes, gulls and, occasionally, crows. Furthermore, outbreaks in several small mixed poultry farms and one large chicken holding with more than 30 000 animals were reported following the detection of HPAIV H5N8 in wild bird populations in these areas. All outbreaks in poultry were controlled by strict culling measures.

A map showing locations of outbreaks in wild and domestic birds can be found at https://www.fli.de/en/news/animal-disease-situation/avian-influenza-hpaiv/karten-zur-klassischen-gefluegelpest/.

Based on sequence information and phylogenetic analyses of the full-length HA and NA gene segments, H5N8 viruses described in the Russian-Mongolian border region in spring and summer 2016, and in Poland in November 2016 were identified as the closest relatives.

Currently, full-genome sequencing, virus isolation procedures and in vivo studies are in progress.

[We are grateful to the FLI team for this firsthand information, adding evidence and suggested chronology to earlier observations on the origin of the pathogen.

The included map shows the locations, throughout Germany but mainly on the extreme north and extreme south, where the infected birds have been detected. It is rather striking to note the intensity of the spread and of the effort in studying it: the numerous infected wild birds and the (4) outbreaks on poultry farms have been detected during just 2 days, 16 and 17 Nov 2016! This may mean that similar dissemination rate of the virus may be expected in other European countries. - Mod.AS
