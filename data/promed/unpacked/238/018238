[According to the OIE Situation Report on avian influenza (latest update: 18 Sep 2017), the Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 continued to be reported from few countries of Asia and Africa in poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections. All cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact of wild birds with poultry http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_18September2017.pdf. - Mod.CRD
