A mysterious disease began spreading in Eluru in Andhra Pradesh has claimed one life while over 400 people have fallen sick. Doctors are yet to establish as to what caused the disease of people suddenly falling unconscious after suffering from symptoms like fits [convulsions] and nausea.

The outbreak started in the 1 Town area of Eluru in Godavari district. People affected by the mysterious illness complained of 3 to 5 minutes of epileptic fits without repetition, forgetfulness, anxiety, vomiting, headache, and back pain.

Most of the victims were in the 20-30 year age-group while there were about 45 children below the age of 12 years.

Here's what we know about the mystery disease spreading in Eluru.

There is a suspicion anti-mosquito fogging may have caused the disease, but nothing has been confirmed officially yet. Doctors are conducting blood tests and CT (brain) scans along with cerebral spinal fluid tests, which have so far turned up normal making the disease a mystery.

Though initially it was suspected that water contamination could have been the cause of the disease outbreak, sample tests ruled it out. Officials are now collecting vegetable samples from 20 affected places for testing.

"We are collecting vegetable samples from top 20 places. Cases are being reported in the entire Municipal Corporation area," Himanshu Shukla, West Godavari Joint District Collector told IANS [Indo-Asian News Service].

Central team to take stock
--------------------------
Special teams of doctors have been rushed to Eluru to treat the victims while a house-to-house survey has been undertaken to identify prospective patients.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday [7 Dec 2020] visited the Government General Hospital and interacted with those afflicted by the mysterious disease even as the number of patients rose.

Deputy Chief Minister (Health) AKK Srinivas (Nani), who represents Eluru, said tests established water contamination was not the cause of the unknown disease. Nani visited the hospital again on Sunday [6 Dec 2020] and reviewed the situation and said there was no need to panic. "Most of the victims have recovered and others are stable. We have readied 50 beds in the GGH [Government General Hospital] in Vijayawada to shift patients, if required. Our medical teams are attending to every patient," the Deputy Chief Minister said.

Meanwhile, a central team comprising Dr. Jamshed Nayar, Associate Professor (Emergency Medicine) at AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences], New Delhi; Dr. Avinash Deoshtawar, virologist at NIV [National Institute of Virology], Pune; and Dr. Sanket Kulkarni, Deputy Director at National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, will reach Eluru Tuesday [8 Dec 2020] and try to find out the root causes for the illness.

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/hyderabad/andhra-pradesh-eluru-mysterious-disease-aiims-report-lead-nickel-heavy-metals-7096843/


A preliminary report of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, has found traces of heavy metals lead and nickel in at least 10 blood samples collected from patients from different places in Eluru town in West Godavari District in Andhra Pradesh. The AIIMS team conducted the blood tests after at least 550 people fell sick in Eluru town since Saturday evening [5 Dec 2020] due to an undiagnosed illness. The results indicate lead and nickel content in drinking water or/and milk as the possible reason behind people falling ill. [This is confusing. The blood tests indicate possible lead and nickel. A blood test cannot tell the source of the metals. So how did they jump to water and/or milk? There is no indication the water has been tested nor is there indication any milk source has been tested. - Mod.TG]

Superintendent of Eluru Government Hospital Dr. AV Mohan told The Indian Express: "The sample size we sent on an urgent basis to AIIMS was small, but their report indicates presence of heavy metals like lead and nickel in the blood samples of patients. We have sent more samples and their reports are awaited."

Dr. Mohan said of the 550 people who were admitted, only 84 remain in hospitals now and they would also be discharged soon.

The mysterious disease having claimed one life and led to the hospitalisation of more than 500 people with complaints of epilepsy, convulsions, seizures, and giddiness in Andhra Pradesh's coastal town of Eluru was a case of "neurotoxicity" caused by heavy metals like lead and nickel, a preliminary study by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalagiri has found.

The AIIMS authorities submitted a preliminary report to the state medical and health department on Monday night [7 Dec 2020]. The authorities have called for some more tests to corroborate the report.

"We have tentatively identified the primary cause of this strange phenomenon, but it is not yet clear what its source is and how and why it has happened. For instance, the chemicals were found in the bodies of the patients but not in either water or any other food substance," state health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar, who has been monitoring the situation in Eluru, told Hindustan Times. [Please note, this article says the source of the lead and nickel has not been found and this is in contrast to the article in [2], above. It appears here, the water and even some food has been tested for these metals. Without testing the substances (water, milk, food) the presence of these metals can neither be confirmed nor denied. - Mod.TG]

A 3-member expert team from the Centre led by AIIMS emergency healthcare head Dr. Jamshed Nair, National Institute of Virology expert Dr. Avinash Devashtawar and NDCC deputy director Dr. Sanketh Kulakarni is expected to reach Eluru in the evening to assess the situation.

"We are hoping to get a clear picture of the situation in a day or 2 as experts are probing all angles to find out the root cause of the disease," Bhaskar said.

He clarified the mysterious disease was neither a bacterial or viral infection nor a contagious disease. "It is a sudden onset of symptoms of convulsions and epilepsy which could be treated symptomatically," he said.

Officials of sanitation wing, food safety division, and drinking water supply department of Eluru municipality have been collecting samples from various localities like South Street, North Street, West Street, Arundhatipet and Ashok Nagar areas to find out whether they have any contamination.

There is panic in these localities which lack basic sanitation facilities -- the narrow lanes are stinking with open drains and garbage dumps, but people are hardly bothered about the conditions.

"Every house has a drinking water connection, but you can notice drinking water pipelines are passing through sewerage lines. There is no elected body for municipality and so, no official pays any attention to these problems," said Chode Venkata Ratnam, former deputy mayor of Eluru municipal corporation.

[SR] (18) from South Street, who had undergone treatment in the government hospital for 2 days, said he did not know what happened to him all of a sudden. "I was playing with my friends in my backyard when I suddenly collapsed and developed fits. I never had this problem before," he said.

A 20-year old woman [SL], who was rushed to the government hospital on Tuesday morning [8 Dec 2020] from the same South Street, was also very healthy until she developed these strange symptoms. "This happened despite taking all precautions," her mother said.

Another victim [RK] (25), a physically challenged man, returned home after treatment, but the symptoms continue to surface now and then. "He had an epilepsy problem in the past and it has recurred now," his mother [CVLA] said.

The teams of World Health Organisation and AIIMS, Mangalagiri, are also touring the affected areas to get firsthand information about the conditions of the patients.

As on Tuesday afternoon [8 Dec 2020], as many as 505 cases have been reported from different parts of the town. "Of them, 332 were discharged after treatment," hospital authorities said.

[So bacterial and viral conditions have been ruled out. The focus seems to be on some heavy metal contamination, likely lead and nickel. However, water and food do not seem to be the source, according to this article.

While heavy metals may cause neurological signs, at this point in the investigation it is difficult to comment if all the individuals tested had elevated lead and nickel or if other metals are involved. It is also difficult to comment on the possible sources, as some seem to have been ruled out, but testing is ongoing.

Generally, heavy metal toxicity does not strike so many so suddenly unless the level is extremely high, and all are exposed at the same time. So this is still odd. - Mod.TG]
