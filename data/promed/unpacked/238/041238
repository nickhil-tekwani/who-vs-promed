Epidemiological comments: The last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza serotype H7N3 occurred in September 2012 in the northeastern part of the State of Jalisco. Following control and eradication measures, passive and active surveillance was strengthened, and on 3 Jan 2013, SENASICA was informed of an increase in mortality and a decrease of egg production on a commercial layer farm in the State of Aguascalientes. Timely notification from the farmer and surveillance activities allowed immediate depopulation of the 2 affected production units, the reason why both outbreaks identified are closed.

The 1st outbreak had a population of 146 755 birds aged 21-80 weeks, of which 2990 were sick, and 740 were dead. Clinical signs were conjunctivitis, edema, cyanosis and palpebral, comb and chin swelling, as well as opisthotonos and sudden death. Additionally, during post-mortem inspections, hemorrhages were identified in trachea, lungs, and tonsils. Control measures included vaccination of laying and breeding hens within the zone around the outbreaks and the buffer zone and the strengthening of biosecurity and control of poultry goods movements.

The 2nd outbreak was detected during active surveillance conducted in the state of Aguascalientes, and the virus was isolated in another commercial layer farm with a population of 138 000 birds over 81 weeks old, which was also depopulated. In both outbreaks, cleaning and disinfection of facilities and equipment as well as destruction of hen manure have been carried out. After depopulation, sentinel birds will be introduced in order to confirm the absence of infection and viral circulation. Active and passive surveillance continues at the national level. Epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Control measures:
Measures applied:
* Stamping out
* Quarantine
* Movement control inside the country
* Screening
* Zoning
* Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
* Vaccination prohibited
* No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied
* No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Biosecurity Laboratory Level 3, Mexico-United States Commission for the Prevention of Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Diseases of Animals (National laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / 7 Jan 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Logically, this is an offshoot of the previous outbreaks in Jalisco, possibly as a result of live birds from the northeast being marketed in Mexico city.
