The Department of Health is today [Mon 8 May 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Tue 2 May 2006:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 110
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 45
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 155
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 161
(The next table will be published on Mon 5 Jun 2006.)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 3 Apr
2006, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD
remains unchanged. Consequently, the overall total is 155. The number
of vCJD cases still alive remains at 6; therefore, the overall total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains
161.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline (see following report). The number of deaths due
to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005
remains 5. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, and so far 2 in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
---------------------------------------------
As of 2 May 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 121
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 63 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 5 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD. The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 4 months of 2006
are: 33 referrals, 20 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 from familial CJD,
2 from vCJD, one from GSS and none from iatrogenic CJD.

British Medical Journal is reproduced here for the benefit of
interested ProMED-mail readers. - Mod.CP]
Title: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: prion protein genotype
analysis of positive appendix tissue samples from a retrospective
prevalence study
Authors: James W Ironside 1*, Matthew T Bishop 1, Kelly Connolly 1,
Doha Hegazy 2, Suzanne Lowrie 1, Margaret Le Grice 1, Diane L Ritchie
1, Linda McCardle 1, David A Hilton 2 at 1 National Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease Surveillance Unit, School of Molecular and Clinical Medicine,
University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU
2 Department of Histopathology, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth PL6 8DH.
Objective
---------
To perform prion protein gene (PRNP) codon 129 analysis in DNA
extracted from appendix tissue samples that had tested positive for
disease associated prion protein.
Design
------
Reanalysis of positive cases identified in a retrospective anonymised
unlinked prevalence study of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
in the United Kingdom.
Study samples
-------------
3 positive appendix tissue samples out of 12 674 samples of appendix
and tonsil tested for disease associated prion protein. The patients
from whom these samples were obtained were aged 20-29 years at the
time of surgery, which took place in 1996-9. Pathology departments in
2 tertiary centers in England and Scotland participated.
Results
-------
Adequate DNA was available for analysis in 2 of the 3 specimens, both
of which were homozygous for valine at codon 129 in the PRNP.
Conclusions
-----------
This is the 1st indication that the valine homozygous subgroup at
codon 129 in the PRNP is susceptible to vCJD infection. All tested
clinical cases of vCJD have so far occurred in the methionine
homozygous subgroup, and a single case of probable iatrogenic vCJD
infection has been identified in one patient who was a
methionine/valine heterozygote at this genetic locus. People infected
with vCJD with a valine homozygous codon 129 PRNP genotype may have a
prolonged incubation period, during which horizontal spread of the
infection could occur either from blood donations or from
contaminated surgical instruments used on these individuals during
the asymptomatic phase of the illness.

[3] UK: sheep study reexamines the prion hypothesis
Date: Fri 28 Apr 2006
From: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>

Sheep study calls for closer look at prion hypothesis
-----------------------------------------------
Prions may not cause mad cow disease or scrapie, according to a
controversial report
<http://www.nature.com/news/about/aboutus.html#Hopkin>.
The infectious agent behind diseases such as mad cow, scrapie and
variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease may not necessarily be rogue prion
proteins, say British researchers, a suggestion that flies in the
face of current dogma about how these diseases are spread.
Although deformed prions are a characteristic of these diseases, they
may not be the initial infectious agent, says lead researcher Martin
Jeffrey of the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Lasswade near
Edinburgh. The researchers are basing their theory on how these
proteins are absorbed in the sheep gut. Experts contacted by Nature
Medicine declined to comment on the controversial paper.
The scientists inoculated sheep intestines with brain extracts
containing the abnormal form of the prion protein (PrP), the hallmark
of the killer neurodegenerative disease. But when they later examined
the infected sheep, the rogue protein had congregated at entirely
different sites (J. Pathol. 209, 4-14; 2006). "Despite the fact that
the Nobel Prize was awarded for the prion hypothesis, there remains
the possibility that it's not the correct explanation," says Jeffrey.
"There needs to be a more assiduous investigation of the causes of
this group of diseases."
The study also suggests that the mechanism of resistance against
these diseases does not operate at the level of gut absorption, as
some researchers had said. The 50 sheep studied displayed different
levels of resistance to scrapie, but all absorbed the prions equally
readily. Although the study suggests that prion proteins can be
absorbed by the gut, this seems to happen only rarely, at least in
sheep. If the same is true of humans, then scientists may need to
rethink exactly how the consumption of tainted meat leads to disease.
Jeffrey's team predigested a mixture of abnormal PrP and typical
sheep stomach contents. But when they then injected this into the
gut, almost no rogue protein was absorbed, and subsequent testing
found that the mixture contained almost no abnormal PrP. Jeffrey says
that sheep in the field are probably exposed to very little prion
protein in their gut, because their stomachs would dispose of even
the minuscule amounts ingested.
Another possibility is that absorption occurs higher in the gut,
before proteins are digested, perhaps in the mouth, suggests Nicole
Sales, who studies prion disease at the Scripps Research Institute in
Jupiter, Florida. If prions are not the infectious agent, the real
culprit remains a mystery. "This experiment doesn't detect the
infectious agent," says Jeffrey, but suggests that a fragment of the
prion protein, perhaps too small to detect using standard detection
methods, may be the guilty party.
The new discovery does not rule out the possibility that prion
proteins, if absorbed in sufficient amounts, can also cause disease,
Jeffrey says. But he contends that these proteins are not the whole
story. "It's opening up a doorway into another biological paradigm,"
he says.

[4] Various countries: At risk from exported UK blood products
Date: Tue 2 May 2006
From: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>
Source: Guardia Unlimited, (The Guardian online), Tue 2 May 2006 [edited]
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,1765531,00.html>

British Blood Products May Pose vCJD Risk in 14 Countries
-----------------------------------------------
The British government has been forced to warn 14 countries that
patients are in danger of developing the human form of mad cow
disease [vCJD] as a result of contaminated British blood products
sold abroad.
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that
patients in Brazil and Turkey are most at risk from the products,
although it is too early to know how many, if any, foreign patients
may develop the incurable vCJD, as it takes many years to appear. The
Turkish authorities said they had traced patients at risk and were
closely monitoring them, while Brazil would not comment.
The contaminated blood products were exported in the 1990s by the
British government to treat conditions such as hemophilia, severe
burns and immune deficiency. At the time, the government considered
there was no risk.
28 people beyond Britain have already developed vCJD [probably] by
eating cattle meat from Britain infected with BSE. However, the
dangers of another route of transmission are now becoming more
evident. Scientists are worried about a "2nd wave" of casualties
caused by blood donated by people infected but not yet displaying
symptoms of the disease.
The risk of passing on the disease in this way was considered only
theoretical until December 2003, when it emerged that a patient in
Britain had been infected through a blood transfusion, leading to new
safety measures. Another 2 cases have since been identified. Health
authorities then had to reexamine blood products sent abroad by the
state-owned company Bio Products Laboratory (BPL).
The documents show that, following the rethink, the Health Protection
Agency was concerned "about the potential infectivity of blood."
Believing the potential risk of vCJD to be "very uncertain," the
agency advised the Brazilian and Turkish health ministries to take
precautions to reduce the possibility of spreading vCJD, as
"sufficient quantities" of the "at-risk" products had been exported.
These measures included tracking down patients and telling them not
to donate blood, organs or tissues. Patients are also told to inform
doctors and dentists if they need any treatment.
In Britain, up to 6000 people were considered to be at risk. The
problems stem from the way blood products are made, by processing
thousands of separate donations. The concerns arise from just 23
donations made by 9 people who went on to develop vCJD, showing how
minute amounts may be infectious.
The National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant Authority,
which is responsible for BPL, said: "So far, no vCJD cases have been
linked to plasma products ... The use of products derived from
British blood plasma was ended in 1999 as a precautionary safety
measure because of what were then regarded as only theoretical risks.
But cases where patients might have been put at risk before that date
have since come to light, as further cases of vCJD have been
diagnosed in people who were blood donors. Since 2004, no one who
received a blood transfusion after 1980 has been allowed to donate
blood themselves."
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) decided that patients in 6
countries -- Brunei, UAE , India, Jordan, Oman and Singapore -- had
been put in less jeopardy than those in Brazil and Turkey but might
need to take precautions. Less dangerous batches were imported by
Belgium, Morocco and Egypt. France, Holland and Israel were advised
to carry out their own assessments, as manufacture of the blood
products was completed in their countries. The French government
concluded that there was no danger from the products, which were
reexported to 10 unnamed countries.
The Guardian has previously reported that patients worldwide may have
been exposed to vCJD, but the documents detail for the 1st time the
countries, the amounts and the risk assessments. British authorities
cannot say how many patients abroad may now be in danger.
There have been 161 cases of vCJD in Britain. There are 15 cases in
France, 4 in Ireland, 2 in the US, and one each in Canada, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Spain. Some of
these victims are known to have [contracted] vCJD by eating infected
beef in Britain. Most others live in countries that have also had
outbreaks of BSE that may well have originated from Britain.
Graham Steel, whose brother Richard died from vCJD, drew parallels to
the spread of BSE. "[It is] eerily reminiscent of the 1980s when
'theoretically' infectious meat and bone meal was exported by the UK
around Europe and beyond despite the fact that the risks of spreading
diseases were known about in 1972-73. A total recall was deemed too
expensive."
