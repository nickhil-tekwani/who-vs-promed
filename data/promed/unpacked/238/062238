[1] COVI-VAC: human trial
Date: Mon 14 Dec 2020 08:00 ET

http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codagenix-and-serum-institute-of-india-announce-commencement-of-first-in-human-trial-of-covi-vac-a-single-dose-intranasal-live-attenuated-vaccine-for-covid-19-301191756.html/


Codagenix, Inc. and the Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd (SIIPL) today [14 Dec 2020] announced that a phase 1 clinical trial of COVI-VAC received regulatory approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and has commenced in London, UK. COVI-VAC is a single-dose intranasal, live attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that was shown to be safe and efficacious in preclinical animal studies. COVI-VAC was developed with Codagenix's Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) platform that uses synthetic biology to re-code the genes of viruses into safe and stable vaccines. COVI-VAC is designed to deliver a safe, live attenuated version of SARS-CoV-2 that may induce a more robust immune response and long-lasting cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to other vaccines against the virus.

COVI-VAC has the potential to address several key logistical challenges to immunization against SARS-CoV-2 at a global scale. As a single-dose, intranasally-delivered vaccine, COVI-VAC will not require a needle and syringe, nor ultra-low temperature freezers. COVI-VAC can be manufactured at large scale and supports ease of administration in a mass vaccination campaign.

The Phase 1 trial of COVI-VAC is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of COVI-VAC administered by nose drops. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate immunogenicity, or the vaccine's ability to provoke an immune response, measured as neutralizing antibody, mucosal IgA and cellular immune responses. The trial will be conducted by hVIVO in London, UK, a subsidiary of Open Orphan. Patient recruitment has begun and dosing of the first trial participants will commence in the first week of January 2021.

"We at SIIPL are pleased with the MHRA approval for initiating the first-in-human clinical trial for the novel intranasal product against COVID-19, developed by Codagenix in collaboration with SIIPL. The product is promising with many unique features and will make our fight against the virus stronger, and therefore, this news is surely welcoming," said Dr Rajeev Dhere, Executive Director of SIIPL.

"While other vaccine candidates have received approval, and others may soon follow, we believe that there are still clear challenges in actually rolling out these vaccines and supplying the global community," commented J Robert Coleman, PhD, CEO of Codagenix. "The potential of COVI-VAC to meet the global demand as a single-dose, needle-free vaccine that needs only a standard freezer or fridge cannot be overstated."

Codagenix CSO, Steffen Mueller, PhD, added, "COVI-VAC is ideally suited for mass production using technologies already in place at global manufacturing facilities, including those of our partner, the Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world by doses sold. Our ability to get this vaccine into a clinical trial six months after recovery of the vaccine strain is further testament to the speed and agility of the Codagenix SAVE attenuation platform."

With the phase 1 trial now initiated, Codagenix and Serum Institute of India expect to begin advanced clinical testing in mid-2021.

Dr Coleman concluded, "Recent weeks have seen researchers reach incredible milestones but given the scale and global breadth of the pandemic, we believe that multiple vaccines will be needed to ensure equitable access."

Live attenuated vaccine (LAV). A vaccine prepared from living micro-organisms (viruses, bacteria currently available) that have been weakened under laboratory conditions and have been available since the1950s. LAV vaccines will replicate in a vaccinated individual and produce an immune response but usually cause mild or no disease. Most commonly used for organisms (such as bacteria, viruses) and their biological products (such as toxins). Because these vaccines introduce actual live pathogens into the body, it is an excellent simulation for the immune system. So live attenuated vaccines can result in lifelong immunity with just one or 2 doses.

Currently there are many live attenuated vaccines available and in use specifically for viruses these include oral polio vaccine (OPV), rotavirus, measles, mumps, yellow fever, and influenza.

However, since LAVs contain living organisms, there is a degree of unpredictability raising some safety and stability concerns such as
- Attenuated pathogens have the very rare potential to revert to a pathogenic form and cause disease in vaccinees or their contacts. Examples include disease-causing vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) associated with oral polio vaccine (OPV).
- Functional immune systems in health individuals can eliminate attenuated pathogens in their immune response. But individuals with compromised immune systems, such as HIV-infected patients may not be able to respond adequately to the attenuated antigens.
- Sustained infection, for example tuberculosis (BCG) vaccination can result in local lymphadenitis or a disseminated infection.
- If the vaccine is grown in a contaminated tissue culture it can be contaminated by other viruses (such as retro viruses with measles vaccine).
- As a precaution, LAVs tend not to be administered during pregnancy. However, the actual potential for fetal damage remains theoretical. For example, numerous studies have demonstrated that accidental rubella vaccination during pregnancy did not result in an increased risk of birth defects.
- LAVs can have increased potential for immunization errors:
-- some LAVs come in lyophilized (powder) form. They must be reconstituted with a specific diluent before administration, which carries the potential for programmatic errors if the wrong diluent or a drug is used.
-- many LAVs require strict attention to the cold chain for the vaccine to be active and are subject to programme failure when this is not adhered to.

Keeping all the scientific background in mind and the new technological advances for genome manipulation, the option of developing and deploying a LAV against SARS-CoV2 is certainly desirable.

According to the Codagenix sources, "CDX-005(COVI-VAC) was engineered using our proprietary codon deoptimization software platform, which allowed us to recode the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by inserting hundreds of mutations. These mutations result in a live-attenuated vaccine that is non-pathogenic yet has the potential to stimulate a robust T cell and antibody immune response that mimics that of the wild-type virus. Our live-attenuated vaccine approach is in sharp contrast to many of the more common COVID-19 immunization strategies currently undergoing human testing, such as mRNA or virus-like-particle candidates, which only target the spike protein, or the adenovirus vectored approaches that could cause off-target effects. Moreover, CDX-005 is delivered intranasally rather than via an injection, which allows for more efficient, patient-friendly administration." (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serum-institute-of-india-initiates-manufacturing-of-codagenixs-intranasal-live-attenuated-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-301135221.html)

The relative effectiveness of this LAV versus other vaccine candidates in development will be borne out in the coming months and years. The doses required to fulfil the global vaccination strategy requirement is certainly a formidable challenge. - Mod.UBA]

Summary
-------
Background
Decisions about the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design.

Methods
Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382.

Findings
Between [26 Apr and 1 Nov 2020], results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between [26 Apr and 28 Jun 2020], from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the 1st wave ([26 April to 28 Jun 2020]), but not in the 2nd wave (from the end of August to [1 Nov 2020]). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the 2nd wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than 6 times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time.

Interpretation
Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the 1st wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the 1st part of the 2nd wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to [1 Nov 2020]), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

[3] Pulmonary fungal infections in patients with COVID-19

Investigators in Spain and the United States have added 20 new case reports to mounting evidence that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are vulnerable to developing pulmonary aspergillosis. Authors of the case series noted that increased physician awareness in recent years of an association between severe influenza and the fungal infection may have led to more rapid recognition of coronavirus disease-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA).

The new cases of CAPA were identified at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain between March and June [2020]. Older age, hypertension, and pulmonary disease were common among these patients. Systemic or inhaled steroids, often to manage COVID-19-related inflammation, were the most common immunosuppressive agents associated with CAPA. All but 2 of the 20 patients were treated with intravenous antifungal drugs. 3 of the patients died.

In their review of the medical literature, the authors found studies suggesting that CAPA affects about 20% to 30% of severely ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Although some studies indicate that antifungal agents may help improve outcomes, the authors noted that larger studies are needed.

Diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis can be challenging because the fungal species that cause it also harmlessly inhabit the airways. But if primary pulmonary immunity is impaired, spores can grow and cause inflammation in the airways or spread into the lungs. And despite growing awareness of severe influenza's association with aspergillosis, authors of the case series noted that outside of Europe, many clinicians may not recognize the link.

[People with severe COVID-19, such as those in an intensive care unit (ICU), are particularly vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections. The most common fungal infections in patients with COVID-19 include aspergillosis or invasive candidiasis (Hoenigl M. Invasive fungal disease complicating COVID-19: when it rains it pours. Clin Infect Dis. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1342]. These fungal co-infections are reported with increasing frequency and can be associated with severe illness and death (Koehler P, Cornely OA, Boettiger BW, et al. COVID‐19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis. Mycoses. 2020; Mycoses. 2020 Jun;63(6):528-534. doi: 10.1111/myc.13096. Epub 2020 May 15. PMID: 32339350; PMCID: PMC7267243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7267243/).

Several recent reports describe COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and available information indicates that CAPA usually occurs in patients with severe COVID-19 (such as patients on ventilators in ICUs); it can be difficult to diagnose because patients often have non-specific symptoms, and testing typically requires a specimen from deep in the lungs; and it can cause severe illness and death (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/covid-fungal.html).

Clinicians should consider the possibility of aspergillosis in patients with severe COVID-19 who have worsening respiratory function or sepsis, even if they do not have classical risk factors for aspergillosis. Testing for CAPA usually involves obtaining specimens from patients' lower respiratory tract, which are tested for Aspergillus galactomannan antigen and fungal culture. Awareness of the possibility of fungal co-infection can help to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment in order to help prevent severe illness and death from these infections. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 16 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC16_1608209149.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 45.5% of daily case numbers and 29.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 30.9 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Chile, Panama, and Puerto Rico. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Costa Rica.

- The European region reported 40.6% of daily case numbers and 57.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 22.6 million. Countries not reporting cases today (16 Dec 2020) include Israel, and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, Germany, UK, Italy, Poland, and Ukraine. There are 22 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.4% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.56 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now around 7500, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, and the UAE. Libya and Egypt reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 2.1% of daily case numbers and 2.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.65 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting just over 7500 new cases, followed by Algeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Namibia, Reunion, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Cameroon, and Zimbabwe. 18 countries and territories in the region did not report cases for the last 24 hours, among which are Madagascar, DR Congo, and Botswana.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.04% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.97 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, China, and Guam.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.5 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, South Korea continues with high daily reports again reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. South Africa reported over 7500 new cases and cases in Iran increased again. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.
