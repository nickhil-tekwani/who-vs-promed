The number of reported cases of food poisoning from the Street Spice Food Festival in Newcastle has risen, as environmental health officers say the source of the outbreak may never be found.

The number of cases now stands at 382, with 14 of the samples submitted testing positive for salmonella. The latest figures, released on 11 Mar 2013, are up from 300 cases and 8 testing positive for the organism on 8 Mar 2013. The findings were released by the outbreak control team, made up of officers from Newcastle City Council Environmental Health and the Health Protection Agency.

The outbreak control team is still talking to businesses and food suppliers to try to identify the source of the outbreak. In a joint statement, the multi-agency group said: "Although we now know it is highly likely that this outbreak of illness has been caused by salmonella, we do not yet know the source of the infection.

"We are therefore continuing our investigation, but it is possible that the exact source may never be identified. The results of further tests are expected towards the end of the week."

An estimated 12 000 people from across the north east attended the event in Newcastle's Times Square between 28 Feb 2013 and 2 Mar 2013.

[The number of cases in this outbreak has continued to grow and likely will expand further. With a food festival like this one, it should not be difficult to identify potential vehicles since the attendees likely had a variety of foods to choose from. - Mod.LL
