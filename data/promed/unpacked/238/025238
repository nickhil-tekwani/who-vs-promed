The use of local dairy that is unfit for consumption by some people in the Ashram neighborhood in Al-Na'ma (Nema) city [Hodh Ech Chargui region] today, [Thu 23 Sep 2021 ], led to illness in 43 people, including children. Those affected by this cluster have arrived at the Al-Na'ma clinic, and according to official and health authorities, their condition is stable.

In a statement to the Mauritanian News Agency, the attending general physician at the regional Al-Na'ma clinic, Mr Youssef Ould Bob Al-Sharif, said that at about 11 a.m. this Thursday [23 Sep 2021], the Al-Na'ma clinic received 3 cases coming from the Ashram neighborhood in the city of Al-Na'ma. He added that the common symptoms among these people are abdominal pain and headache, and about an hour later, the number began to increase from the various neighborhoods of the city, which generated some fears among the health authorities. The source clarified that, after using treatment, the patients gradually began to recover.

After investigations with the affected persons and inquiring about the reasons, the concerned parties reported that they had eaten spoiled local dairy, which was distributed in good faith to them. Those affected by this poisoning added that one of the people distributed large quantities of cow's milk to some of the population before ensuring its safety in the laboratory, and it was the reason behind this cluster.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this post.

It is alleged that the source of the outbreak is "spoiled" cow's milk. It is not reported if the milk was pasteurized or not. Other than abdominal pain and headache, no other symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea are mentioned which could help to suggest a possible etiology as could the incubation period between ingestion and 1st symptoms. - Mod.LL

Any additional information about the cause of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.JH
