Undiagnosed deaths of many cattle with clinical signs of ulceration at foot and mouth regions together with diarrhea have been reported from Kutkai township and around, eastern Shan State, Myanmar within this week.

About 80 cattle have died since 2 Sep 2016, villagers say. The affected villages, where the cattle disease outbreak was recorded, are Naungvat, Nantyein, Naunghan, Lonelan, Naungsai, Lonewai, Mangpai and Htwaesan. Naungvat village is 3 miles from Kutkai and the rest are 16 miles away from Kutkai.

Currently, cattle trade in these villages is declining because of the disease outbreak. The people earn their living by cultivating rice and corn as well as livestock production in the northern Shan State and Kutkai township.

[Kutkai is situated in eastern-central Myanmar and about 24 km [15 miles] north of Lashio. It lies at an altitude of 4800 feet. To the east of Kutkai is the Nam Ting River and the Salween River. Kutkai Township is a township of Muse District in the Shan State of eastern Myanmar near the Myanmar-China border. The principal town is Kutkai.

The newswire provides no information on postmortem findings, age of affected cattle, control measures and laboratory diagnostic results. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources on the cause of cattle deaths in Kutkai township.

A map of Kutkai can be seen at http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kutkai/kutkai/. Maps of Myanmar can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/myanmar_map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4623427,148. - Mod.TTM

When a fatal cattle disease manifests buccal ulcerations combined with diarrhea, rinderpest and bovine virus diarrhea (BVD) deserve to be included in the differential diagnosis list and excluded as soon as possible. The mentioned podal lesions add foot and mouth disease (FMD) to the list. - Mod.AS]
