----------------------------------------------------------
I received a clarification from an Australian colleague (Dr Mark Veitch, of the Department of Health and Human Services in Hobart, Tasmania) regarding the migratory behaviour of black kites. There are many black kite species that are resident and spend all year in Australia. Therefore, there is nothing "disconcerting" about finding them at this time of the year.
