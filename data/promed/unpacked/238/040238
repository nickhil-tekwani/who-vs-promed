Since the initial outbreak on 16 Oct 2006, in which a massive 54 834
birds were considered susceptible, Newcastle disease (NCD) has struck
time and time again.
Counting from the beginning of 2007 there have already been a further
6 outbreaks. Although these most recent outbreaks have been confined
to small villages, [NCD] has rampaged all over eastern Romania,
practically traveling from the northern tip to the south, threatening
to spill across neighboring borders, especially those of Moldova.
With an apparent mortality rate of 65.5 percent in these areas, it is
vital that the authorities eradicate this problem quickly. Recent
control measures have [been] applied in accordance to the Council
Directive. Vaccinations have been permitted, the [infected premises]
has been disinfected, and movement inside the country is being
controlled. But there are still further measures to be applied. The
authorities will now [look to] the control of wildlife reservoirs,
fearing migration in and out may result in further spread.

[The described situation seems to be indicative of the following 4
points: the wide circulation of the virus; its high pathogenicity; a
deficient vaccination performance, particularly in small holdings;
and deficient biosecurity measures in such holdings.
Romania's last follow-up report on the NCD situation was submitted to
the OIE on 6 Mar 2007, describing 6 outbreaks, spread over 6
different districts of the country, which have been discovered since
the previous follow-up report of 6 Dec 2006. For the current report,
which includes a map, see
