[What is there to say that is different from previous posts? Both cVDPVs and WPV1 are still in fairly widespread distribution. The WPV1's are widespread in Pakistan and in Afghanistan to a lesser extent. The global tally is officially now at 125, the highest since 2014 (see http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/weekly-polio-analyses-wpv-20191218.pdf). The cVDPVs continue mounting with the global tally for 2019 now at 241 with Angola having 82 cases, and DR Congo 61 cases leading the countries, but still active this year in 18 countries. The highest tally of cases since before 2015 (see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] nOPV2 nearing release - The Scientist

New oral polio vaccine to bypass key clinical trials
Health officials are rushing a genetically engineered product into the field to counter uncontained outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To stem a growing polio crisis, health officials are accelerating the development of a new oral vaccine with plans for emergency approval and deployment in regions with active polio transmission as early as June 2020. The new vaccine, called nOPV2, might conclusively end the outbreaks, caused by the live virus in the vaccine reverting to a virulent form. But expedited approval means skipping the real-world testing of large clinical trials.

Instead, key questions about the vaccine's effectiveness will be answered in the field.

"The nOPV strains have been tested in a small number of volunteers and we do not see reversion to neurovirulence," says Vincent Racaniello, a virologist at Columbia University, "but when they are used for mass immunization of millions of individuals, rare events can become evident."

Because of the compressed approval and deployment timeline, nOPV2 may be used in millions of kids beginning in mid-2020.

Oral polio vaccine strains, originally developed by Albert Sabin in the 1950s, can in rare instances revert to virulence, spread, and paralyze children just like polio itself, a phenomenon first recognized in 2000. Because the Sabin vaccine had successfully eradicated wild type 2 poliovirus in 2015, health officials across the world quit administering it the following year [2016]. However, herd immunity had not been achieved before the cessation of the type 2 vaccine, which gave an opportunity for un-immunized people to later become infected by the virus that had begun reverting to virulence in people who had gotten the vaccine. With successive transmission through the unvaccinated, the vaccine strain can regain the virulence of wild polio.

Nowadays, cases of polio caused by vaccine-derived strains outnumber those caused by the wild virus -- and they continue to spread unchecked, most recently from the Philippines to Malaysia. Vaccine-derived polio threatens as many as 210 million children globally, according to the World Health Organization. Using the reversion-prone Sabin type 2 vaccine to fight outbreaks caused more new outbreaks than it stopped, a virologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Science earlier this year [2019].

Locking the gates to polio reversion
------------------------------------
nOPV2, the new type 2 oral polio vaccine, has been genetically engineered to avoid the pitfalls of Sabin's vaccine. The project is funded by the Gates Foundation and coordinated by PATH, a nonprofit developer of public health innovations, with scientific work taking place at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in the UK, the University of California, San Francisco, the CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration.

Poliovirus "evolves readily to any situation it finds," says Andrew Macadam, a principal scientist at NIBSC and a designer of nOPV2. As RNA viruses, polio and polio vaccine strains evolve using mutation and recombination. Polio "has a polymerase that is not very accurate," says Macadam, so mutations occur frequently during replication. More importantly for rapid adaptation, recombination allows the virus to incorporate RNA strands from other C type enteroviruses in human hosts that enable gains in virulence. These partners include all the Sabin strains and Coxsackievirus, for example.

Two recombination events would be required to overcome nOPV2's genetically engineered safeguards, making reversion to virulence less likely to occur.

nOPV2 obstructs some key genetic routes to pathogenicity, believed to be controlled by "gatekeeper" mutations. In particular, a single point mutation at nucleotide 481 increases neurovirulence and actually occurs in most people soon after immunization. The pivotal change at 481 makes a return to virulence possible, according to Macadam. "The gatekeeper idea," he explains, "is that it needs to revert at 481 before it can do anything else and then you can incorporate these other mutations" that cause the vaccine to become pathogenic.

So nOPV2 developers modified 18 nucleotides near 481 in the poliovirus genome so that the well-known single substitution no longer opens the gate to virulence. This safeguard, in turn, is protected from wholesale replacement via recombination by relocating a gene necessary for replication to another part of the genome so that if the modifications near 481 are lost through recombination, the gene needed for replication will also be lost. As a result, reversion "requires 2 recombination events instead of one," according to Macadam, one being the acquisition of a second copy of the replication gene and the other being the loss of the 481-related modifications. "Therefore, it's less likely," says Macadam.

In addition, Macadam's team outfitted nOPV2 with a higher-fidelity polymerase that introduces fewer errors during replication while another gene received alterations to decrease the virus's propensity for recombination.

The risk of polio recombination
-------------------------------
Testing so far validates the new design. A small, Phase 1 clinical trial in Belgium of 30 adults found nOPV2 completely stable against the main gatekeeper mutation about three weeks after vaccination. Ordinarily, 481 mutates within 6 days. Macadam and colleagues have also carried out as-yet-unpublished studies in cell culture that demonstrate genetic stability.

Macadam nevertheless says it's "debatable" how much nOPV2's design will reduce recombination. Specifically, he is concerned about the recombination risks posed by the Sabin 1 and 3 strains. Before administration of the type 2 vaccine strain was halted in 2016, all 3 strains were co-administered in a single drop. Macadam cautions against co-administration of nOPV2 with Sabin 1 and 3. "I just wouldn't see the logic in doing that," he says. Recombination with the Sabin strains could set nOPV2 on the path to virulence. Co-administration could "jeopardize the safety of what you're trying to do," says Macadam.

However, delivering vaccines in separate campaigns creates significant operational constraints. "This conundrum is real, and is already being seen," says WHO spokesperson, Oliver Rosenbauer. In parts of Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, some vaccination campaigns are conducted with Sabin 1 and 3, others with solely with Sabin 2. "So that needs to be logistically managed appropriately."

Also, the continually broadening scope of type 2 vaccine-derived outbreaks might necessitate co-administration at continent scale. Rather than tightly circumscribed use of nOPV2 in response to isolated outbreaks, says Temitope Faleye, there needs to "one, very well-coordinated immunization campaign that cuts across the whole of sub-Saharan Africa." Faleye is a researcher at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. "You immunize as many children as possible to ensure that you don't have pockets of people" who can start vaccine viruses back on the path to renewed virulence, which happened before and led to the current outbreaks.

Even if nOPV2 is kept away from Sabin 1 and 3, they are not the only available recombination partners. "The real concern out here is these species C [enteroviruses] that are circulating," according to Faleye. "By default," he says, "most of the children have enteroviruses in them" in Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the world's outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio are occurring. They are known to fuel reversion of the Sabin vaccine strains. Faleye's research has found instances of vaccine-derived poliovirus arising from two independent recombination events with enteroviruses. "It is a phenomenon that has been documented."

Faleye says he still expects nOPV2 to revert less frequently than the Sabin 2 strain.

He describes nOPV2 as "beautiful, plausible, and theoretically based on solid science." But, he says, "anybody in the field knows that with the current design, you don't have control of viral recombination."

The real test of nOPV2
----------------------
Racaniello, who wasn't involved in the development of the vaccine, agrees that nOPV2 is "probably going to be better," but with a caveat. "There is nothing like the selection force of millions of human guts." Increased fitness and virulence overlap, so adaptations for surviving the brutish competition in the gut also increase virulence in the spinal cord, where polio causes damage. And because of the compressed approval and deployment timeline, nOPV2 may be used in millions of kids beginning in mid-2020, before a Phase 2 trial in Bangladesh, which will pit the vaccine against real-world conditions such as co-infections with other enteroviruses, could finish.

A completed Phase 2 trial in Panama sheds little light on recombination with enteroviruses. "Species C enterovirus prevalence was not an endpoint" in the Panama trial, says PATH's John Konz, who leads the nOPV2 project. "We might get some sense of levels from next-generation sequencing of virus in stool samples, but those results are not yet available." In addition, according to Macadam, "the actual analysis pipeline won't be as extensive as it might be if we had unlimited resources."

Racaniello commends nOPV2, which "was made using all the fundamental results that we and others have developed over the years." But he questions how airtight nOPV2's architecture is against reversion. The gatekeepers are essential for efficient replication, according to Racaniello, "but there are likely many others" beyond the few that have been identified. nOPV2 defends against just one of those.

Another question looms over nOPV2's deployment: will the vaccine actually protect against polio? Clinical trials so far have measured the type 2-specific serum neutralizing antibodies elicited by nOPV2. Protection is believed to result when titres reach certain thresholds. "Can we measure antibody responses in animal models and in limited clinical tests and say, 'This should be OK in people?'" asks Racaniello. "I think that's what WHO, CDC, and [the] Gates [Foundation], and everyone else is hoping," he says, naming some of the key partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which decides and implements the vaccine strategy for polio eradication. "That should be enough . . . but there's nothing like putting it in people to really find out."

At PATH, "we don't see any unique risks for nOPV2 over the current vaccine," says Konz. The relative paucity of clinical data is offset by the knowledge from decades of using the Sabin 2 strain from which nOPV2 is derived. "In the end," he says, "it's a relative benefit-risk decision that the WHO, policymakers, and national authorities will have to make."

While the polio eradication effort is betting nOPV2 will be a silver bullet, "nothing is off the table," according to WHO's Rosenbauer, "and everything is being explored," including even a possible return to the old vaccine with the three original Sabin strains.

[Reading this article has me very cautious about the early release of the nOPV2. It doesn't mention the size of the study population. The one paper I was able to find on the early studies on this vaccine mentions a cohort of 30 individuals with previous history of IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) vaccination. A very small study size when compared with the millions of children who will be vaccinated with this vaccine. I am also reminded of the observation that OPV was in use for 20+ years before cVDPVs were recognized (field trials in the early 60s). One thought is what happens to the nOPV2 after multiple passages through unvaccinated/susceptible individuals in areas with pockets of susceptibles?

Abstract
--------
"Background. Use of oral live-attenuated polio vaccines (OPV), and injected inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) has almost achieved global eradication of wild polioviruses. To address the goals of achieving and maintaining global eradication and minimising the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-derived polioviruses, we tested novel monovalent oral type-2 poliovirus (OPV2) vaccine candidates that are genetically more stable than existing OPVs, with a lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence. Our study represents the 1st in-human testing of these 2 novel OPV2 candidates. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines, the presence and extent of faecal shedding, and the neurovirulence of shed virus.

"Methods. In this double-blind, single-centre phase 1 trial, we isolated participants in a purpose-built containment facility at the University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium), to minimise the risk of environmental release of the novel OPV2 candidates. Participants, who were recruited by local advertising, were adults (aged 18-50 years) in good health who had previously been vaccinated with IPV, and who would not have any contact with immunosuppressed or unvaccinated people for the duration of faecal shedding at the end of the study. The 1st participant randomly chose an envelope containing the name of a vaccine candidate, and this determined their allocation; the next 14 participants to be enrolled in the study were sequentially allocated to this group and received the same vaccine. The subsequent 15 participants enrolled after this group were allocated to receive the other vaccine. Participants and the study staff were masked to vaccine groups until the end of the study period. Participants each received a single dose of one vaccine candidate (candidate 1, S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3; or candidate 2, S2/S15domV/CpG40), and they were monitored for adverse events, immune responses, and faecal shedding of the vaccine virus for 28 days. Shed virus isolates were tested for the genetic stability of attenuation. The primary outcomes were the incidence and type of serious and severe adverse events, the proportion of participants showing viral shedding in their stools, the time to cessation of viral shedding, the cell culture infective dose of shed virus in virus-positive stools, and a combined index of the prevalence, duration, and quantity of viral shedding in all participants. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2017-000908-21 and http://clinicaltrials.gov/, number NCT03430349 [http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03430349].

"Findings. Between [22 May and 22 Aug 2017], 48 volunteers were screened, of whom 15 (31%) volunteers were excluded for reasons relating to the inclusion or exclusion criteria, 3 (6%) volunteers were not treated because of restrictions to the number of participants in each group, and 30 (63%) volunteers were sequentially allocated to groups (15 participants per group). Both novel OPV2 candidates were immunogenic and increased the median blood titre of serum neutralising antibodies; all participants were seroprotected after vaccination. Both candidates had acceptable tolerability, and no serious adverse events occurred during the study. However, severe events were reported in 6 (40%) participants receiving candidate 1 (8 events) and 9 (60%) participants receiving candidate 2 (12 events); most of these events were increased blood creatinine phosphokinase but were not accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccine virus was detected in the stools of 15 (100%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 1 and 13 (87%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 2. Vaccine poliovirus shedding stopped at a median of 23 days (IQR 15-36) after candidate 1 administration and 12 days (1-23) after candidate 2 administration. Total shedding, described by the estimated median shedding index (50% cell culture infective dose/g), was observed to be greater with candidate 1 than candidate 2 across all participants (2·8 [95% CI 1·8-3·5] vs 1·0 [0·7-1·6]). Reversion to neurovirulence, assessed as paralysis of transgenic mice, was low in isolates from those vaccinated with both candidates, and sequencing of shed virus indicated that there was no loss of attenuation in domain V of the 5'-untranslated region, the primary site of reversion in Sabin OPV.

"Interpretation. We found that the novel OPV2 candidates were safe and immunogenic in IPV-immunised adults, and our data support the further development of these vaccines to potentially be used for maintaining global eradication of neurovirulent type-2 polioviruses.

At least 4 new polio cases have been reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on [Thu 19 Dec 2019], taking the tally of such cases across the province to 79 this year, ARY News reported.

According to the Health officials, 3 polio cases were reported from Lakki Marwat and 1 in Tank districts of KP.

Earlier on [19 Dec 2019], 2 more polio cases had been reported in Balochistan, taking the tally of such cases across the country to 106 this year [2019]. [see 20191219.6848225 for details on the Balochistan cases - Mod.MPP]

According to the Health Ministry, the polio cases had been reported from the Mastung district and Dera Murad Jamali area of Balochistan. The authorities had said a 16-month-old boy from Dera Murad Jamali and a 14-year-month old baby boy from Mastung had been diagnosed with the crippling disease, adding that the minor was not vaccinated against the virus.

This was the 9th polio case which had been reported from Balochistan province during the ongoing year [2019].

[4] Pakistan: Balochistan 2 cases, Sindh 1 case - media report
Date: Thu 19 Dec 2019

Three new polio cases have recently surfaced in Pakistan taking the national tally to 111. 2 of them were reported in Balochistan and 1 in Sindh.

If cases of vaccine-derived polio are also included, the number has reached 123.

Balochistan's new cases were a 16-month-old boy from Nasirabad's Dera Murad Jamali area and a 14-month-old girl from Mastung. This brought the total number of cases in the province to 9. The victims' immunisation status was not available immediately.

Meanwhile, the Emergency Operation Centre [EOC] for polio in Sindh confirmed the 17th polio case of the province [Wed 18 Dec 2019]. The victim was a 72-month-old boy from UC Manik Laghari in Badin. Officials said he tested positive for the poliovirus after complaints of weakness in his right arm. According to parents, the child had received 7 campaign and 3 routine doses. The EOC has urged parents to get their children under 5 years vaccinated.

Currently, a nationwide polio campaign is underway which will last until [22 Dec 2019]. Some polio team members have even taken the drops themselves to convince refusing parents. Rehan Baloch, the Sindh EOC coordinator, himself took the polio vaccine on [Wed 18 Dec 2019] to convince community members in Karachi's Mohammad Khan Colony, Ittehad Town, and Baldia Town.

A Polio Tahafuz Helpline 1166 has also been launched to assist the reporting of children who were missed out during the campaign.

[Adding the 7 newly confirmed cases in the past 2 days, including the 4 cases from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2 cases from Balochistan, and 1 case from Sindh, the total number of WPV1 associated cases reported by Pakistan with dates of onset since 1 Jan 2019 becomes 111. According to the End Polio Pakistan website, all cases have been confirmed and the total is now 111.
< https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces>.

It's becoming more and more difficult to reconcile the media reports and the official tally, but if the current official total of WPV1 cases reported to WHO in the past week is 101 with the inclusion of media reported cases, the global tally will climb to 135 if all cases are included in the next update.

Clearly, there is widespread circulation and transmission of the WPV1 in Pakistan that has not as yet been interrupted.
