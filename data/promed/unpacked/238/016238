An unusual outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection in Christchurch
has health officials frantically trying to find its source. 3 new
cases on Tuesday takes the total in the city to 10. There are
normally only 2-3 cases of the viral illness each year in Canterbury
and less than 100 nationwide. Health officials suspect raw foods
could be the cause of the outbreak.
Since Christmas 10 people have been diagnosed with hepatitis A virus
infection, and Health Official Dr Mel Briesman says its a big
concern: "...Because it suggests that some food or some food premises
have a problem and it may be a continuing problem," he says. Water
contamination, restaurants and cafes are all being ruled as unlikely
sources because too many different areas of the city are involved.
"The victims would also be able to say 'yes we ate at this particular
premises,' and that hasn't happened," says Briesman. So authorities
are left with the scenario that they are dealing with the
contamination of a single food source.
Briesman says it means the possibility of further exposure. "For
example if it turned out to be a fruit that gets frozen, that could
be in continued supply for some time." And the summer lifestyle
doesn't help either says Briesman. "People eat out more and meet
with friends more often than they would; all of these confuse the
picture and make it more difficult to find the source."
Hepatitis A is contracted from bowel to mouth. Symptoms include
fever, nausea and abdominal discomfort. At its worst in can cause
serious liver illness. 2 of those infected were admitted to hospital,
however most of the cases so far are being described as mild to
moderate. Doctors have been alerted and the public warned to stick to
strict hygiene around food as the search for a source continues.

7 cases of hepatitis A have been notified to the Medical Officer of
Health since Christmas 2005. Although there are associations between
some of these cases, there is as yet no indication of a common
source. None of these cases have travelled overseas. Investigations
are continuing to try and establish if there is any common food
source. Close contacts of these cases are being followed up and may
be offered preventive injections of gamma globulin if the exposure
has been recent. 3 earlier cases notified in December [2005] belonged
to a family who are believed to have acquired the disease during a
trip to the Pacific. Since 2001, there have been only 2-3 cases
notified each year.
Hepatitis A is a viral disease that affects the liver. It is spread
either by contamination of food or directly from person to person
because of poor hygiene, particularly failure of hand washing. Early
symptoms include generally feeling unwell, abdominal discomfort,
nausea and fever. Jaundice develops in the later stages of the
disease. General practitioners (GPs) have been advised of the
outbreak and requested to consider the diagnosis in patients with
suggestive symptoms. Persons who are showing possible signs of the
disease are advised to consult their own GP.
"The Canterbury DHB (District Health Board) views this outbreak as a
serious public health issue and cannot stress enough the importance
of hand washing after going to the toilet and before handling food",
said Dr Mel Brieseman, Medical Officer of Health from Community &
Public Health, a division of the CDHB. "Workers and employers in the
food industry are also reminded not to work with food, when they are
suffering from any form of stomach upset", he said.
A preventive vaccination is also available for persons who are likely
to be at high risk such as those travelling to high-risk countries,
but a cost is involved.

[A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in New Zealand was associated
with employment in the fruit-picking industry. Environmental
contamination of a working environment is another factor which should
be considered. - Mod.CP]
