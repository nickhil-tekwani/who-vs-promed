The Ministry of Health in Alagoas state has reported 11 confirmed cases of measles since May this year in 2 municipalities.

According to the G1 report, the cases are reported from the cities of Capela (10) and Maceio (1). The patients were treated on an outpatient basis, without the need for hospitalization.

Alagoas went 19 years without a case of the disease; however, measles returned to circulation in 2019. In 2020, 3 cases were confirmed in Alagoas.

According to the Ministry of Health, the virus is in circulation in 6 states in the country: Alagoas, Para, Sao Paulo, Amapa, Ceara, and Rio de Janeiro.

Measles is highly contagious, causes fever, malaise, body aches, red spots on the skin, and can even kill. The only effective form of prevention is a vaccine.

The [measles] virus spreads much farther than 2 meters [6.5 ft] in the air and since it is a respiratory virus, it can enter the body more easily. It usually enters through the conjunctiva of the eyes and the respiratory tract.

No measles cases have been reported in Paraguay since 1998, and Paraguay is one of the few countries in the region that has not reported a case in more than 20 years. However, this abstinence from measles could be shattered by reporting the 1st case at San Pablo Hospital in Asuncion.

According to the hospital's director, Dr Vicente Acuna, it is a suspicious and isolated case. All investigations are currently underway to confirm or clarify whether it is the first case in 23 years.

At the country level, no measles cases have been reported in Paraguay since 1998 and it is one of the few countries in the region that has not reported cases in more than 20 years. But this absence of measles cases can be interrupted since a 1st case could be present at the San Pablo Hospital in Asuncion.

According to the director of the hospital, Dr Vicente Acuna, it is a suspicious and isolated case, and at the moment all studies are being carried out to confirm whether it is the 1st case after 23 years.

"It is a totally isolated and suspicious case, it is not confirmed. There is no need for alarm, but it should attract the attention of all health personnel," pointed out the professional to 780 AM.

He assured that at the moment the pertinent studies are being carried out on the patient who is hospitalized within the healthcare center. "Studies are being done until confirmation is obtained. As a hospital, what we do is report the appearance of a suspicious case ", he remarked.

He recalled that measles is spread from person to person, especially among young people and children, so it is extremely important that the vaccination schedule is complete. "Rash, fever, general malaise, and decay are some of the symptoms," he explained.

More contagious than COVID-19
-----------------------------
For his part, the epidemiologist Tomas Mateo Balmelli said that the measles virus is much more contagious than the coronavirus. "Measles is much more contagious than other respiratory viruses, even more than SARS, and social isolation is more difficult," he pointed to Universo 970 AM [radio].

He assured that the virus spreads farther than 2 meters [6.5 ft] by aerosol in the environment and that as it is a respiratory virus it is easier for it to enter the body. He indicated that it generally enters through the ocular conjunctiva and through the respiratory tract.

"This is not uncommon because many mothers stopped taking their children to complete vaccination schedules during quarantine," he said.

He warned that the measles outbreak may not only affect children, as many believe, as it can also develop in older adults. "The incubation period for measles is 15 to 21 days, before the onset of symptoms," he said.

According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, since 1998 Paraguay has not registered measles cases, but the risk of introduction of the virus to the country remains latent due to the cases reported in the region, so it is important that susceptible people are vaccinated.

Paraguay has not registered measles cases for more than 20 years, but now a laboratory in the United States is expected to confirm whether the case of the girl admitted to the San Pablo Hospital in Asunci√≥n is positive, according to a Paraguay media report.

Public Health sent the samples to the United States to sequence the virus and confirm whether it was due to person-to-person transmission or a reaction to the vaccine.

The news did set off the alarms about a possible measles situation. The director of Health Surveillance, Guillermo Sequera, said that if measles was confirmed, it could have happened because the little girl was immunized a few days ago. "A girl of 1 year and 1 month had symptoms very similar to measles. It was good the doctor detected and reported the event. From that, we did a raking of where is the possible case that infected the baby. The relatives had a travel history, but it was after the girl's symptoms began," he said.

Measles was confirmed positive in a private laboratory in Paraguay; however, the Ministry of Health sent the samples 14 days ago to the United States to confirm if it is the attenuated virus of the vaccine on which the results are still awaited. Sequera reported that he was found positive for measles in the test carried out in the country.

"It is rare, but it usually happens because she had been vaccinated 7 days before against measles. It could be measles but from the vaccine. It is a milder measles. To confirm we sent to the United States 2 weeks ago for them to sequence and tell us if it is measles from the vaccine or wild measles.

On Sunday [5 Sep 2021], the Ministry of Health issued an advisory on making sure your family is vaccinated against measles.

The measles vaccine is given to all children at 12 months of age and at 4 years of age. Children over 4 years of age who still do not have the required scheme, should go to the nearest vaccination center. They must also have the dose of protection, health workers and those who work in tourism and transport, as well as those who will travel to risk areas.

2 doses of the vaccine guarantee protection against this contagious disease. The vaccine is safe, effective, and free, and it is available in vaccination centers of the Ministry of Health.
