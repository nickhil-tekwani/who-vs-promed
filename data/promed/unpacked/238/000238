Mown grass, which is fed to pigs in Latvia, is thought to be the source of the recent outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in a backyard pig operation.

The National Pig Association states that the clue is that there were dark stains on the grass, and it is assumed these came from ASF-positive wild boar.

Following this finding, Latvia has now banned the feeding of mown grass to pigs.

[Since the start of ASF in Latvia, reportedly a year ago (25 Jun 2014), 323 outbreaks have been notified to the OIE (in 42 reports). The vast majority of the cases involved wild boars. The most recent follow-up report, submitted 18 Jun 2015, included information about 21 outbreaks of which 20 were in wild boars and 1 in swine held on a small farm (in Dubnas parish, Daugavpils county); this farm is addressed in the above media item, suspected to be infected by means of the mown grass. In case the suspicion is definitely confirmed, the restrictions applied in Latvia upon the feeding of domestic swine with mown grass may become exemplary for other ASF-affected European countries.

All reports submitted to the OIE as of 18 Jun 2015 and a map showing the respective locations of the 323 oputbreaks are accessible at
