Pet owners in Hampshire have been put on alert as a deadly disease
kills off hundreds of wild rabbits. Residents report that a once
thriving population of bunnies at Dibden Bay has been reduced to just
a few animals.

An outbreak of the highly contagious disease myxomatosis, which can
only be caught by rabbits, is the probable cause of the deaths. The
infection often leads to acute conjunctivitis, which makes the
animals go blind. Rabbits who have caught the disease will usually
stop eating and die within a fortnight.

Vet Bob Russell, who owns The Pet Healthcare Centre in nearby Hythe,
admitted he'd had to put down a pet rabbit because it had the
disease. He said: "Things are pretty bad at the moment. We do get
outbreaks of myxomatosis every year, but it just tends to be
different places that are affected at different times. With domestic
rabbits, once they've got it, their chances of survival are very slim."

Mr Russell has urged pet owners to get their rabbit vaccinated.
