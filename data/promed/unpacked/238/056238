Concerning the natural reservoir of Nipah virus. Local researchers appear
to concentrate entirely on facts that are known about Hendra virus,
although the biological properties (host range, transmission, disease,
etc.) of Nipah virus seem to be rather different from Hendra virus and
similar to Menangle virus (isolated in 1997 in New South Wales, Australia,
where it caused an epidemic in pigs and influenza-like illness in two humans).
Only recently we have isolated and characterized a novel paramyxovirus from
an apparently healthy tree shrew (_Tupaia belangeri_) that had been
captured in 1978 in the area around Bangkok [Thailand. The nucleotide
sequences of the N and P/C/V genes of this Tupaia paramyxovirus (TPMV) are
now available (GenBank Accession No. AF079780) and the results will appear
in one of the next issues of the journal Virology. Highest amino-acid
sequence homologies were found between TPMV and Hendra virus. As there are
a lot of tree shrews in the geographic area where Nipah virus was detected
I would suggest to regard these animals as a potential natural reservoir.

[This is an interesting suggestion. Note, however, that Menangle virus has
a clearly different nucleotide sequence from Hendra & Nipah viruses. - Mod.JW
