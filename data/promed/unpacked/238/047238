About 4000 hectares [about 9884 acres] of banana orchards in Jalgaon district have been damaged due to the viral disease cucumber mosaic (CMV). The State Agriculture Department has reported the outbreak on newly planted plants. Bananas planted in July and August are most affected. Vegetables planted as intercrops spread the virus widely.

A banana grower said that banana gardens in some areas have been completely destroyed and that the outbreak has been observed in more areas than reported by the Agriculture Department. Due to continuous harvesting of the same crop and neglect to destroy any virus infected plants because of the large area affected, there has been more damage in 2022 than in previous years. The production of exportable bananas will decrease drastically.

[_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV; type member of genus _Cucumovirus_) is found worldwide affecting a large number of hosts, including many crops. It exists in numerous strains, some with associated satellite RNAs (see link below), which may vary in their host range, symptoms, and means of transmission. In most hosts, it produces a systemic infection affecting newly formed tissues. In banana, symptoms may include mosaic, stripes, chlorosis, necrosis on leaves; stunting of plants; and mottling and distortion of fruits.

CMV can be transmitted by more than 60 species of aphids. It can also be spread with infected plant material and very effectively by mechanical means (for example, on infected agricultural tools). Seed transmission to varying degrees has also been reported in some host species, including some weeds. Volunteer crop plants, alternative crops used in rotation or as underplanted cover crops (as mentioned above), as well as weeds, serve as virus reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, since aphid vectors and virus reservoirs are widespread. Use of certified virus free planting material is essential. Control of weeds surrounding cropped fields has shown some success. Host resistance is available in some crops but may only be effective against some of the virus strains.

CMV is widespread in a range of crops in India (including Maharashtra; see ProMED post 20210705.8495612).
