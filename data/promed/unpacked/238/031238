Woman suspected of dying from bird flu tests negative
-----------------------------------------------------
A woman suspected of dying from avian influenza at a hospital in
southern Bac Lieu Province last Friday [20 Mar 2009] -- as reported
previously in 'Avian influenza, human (56): Viet Nam (DT) NOT, (ST)
susp. 20090321.1128' -- has tested negative for the virus, the Bac
Lieu Preventative Health Center said Monday [23 Mar 2009]. The
center's director Nguyen Thanh Tung said tests had confirmed that the
patient from the Mekong Delta province of Soc Trang had not
contracted the H5N1 virus.

The patient was admitted to the hospital last Monday [16 Mar 2009]
with symptoms similar to those of bird flu including headache,
fatigue, and respiratory distress. A person familiar with the matter
said the woman had eaten sick ducks about a month ago [February 2009].

[The lapse of time between potential exposure of the patient to avian
influenza virus infection was in any case inconsistent with the
preliminary diagnosis of avian influenza virus infection.
Furthermore, avian influenza virus infection cannot be contracted by
consumption of diseased fowl as stated in the report above, although
infection could have been contracted by contact with diseased fowl.

The southern province of Soc Trang can be located on the map of the
provinces of Viet Nam at
