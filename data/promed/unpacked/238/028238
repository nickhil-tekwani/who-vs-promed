I would like to comment that usually fireworks would begin not before
midnight in order to signal the beginning of the new year and its celebrations.

If initial reports arrived at about 11:30 p.m. on 31 Dec 2010, as
mentioned, then fireworks are less likely to be involved in this case.

Also, while blunt-force trauma may be the direct cause of death, it
is not necessarily the underlying cause, and there should be further
investigation to rule out various etiologies, unless this has already
been done and not yet reported to the public.

Could the evidence of trauma have been from the hard landing on the
ground rather than from an in-flight collision? It seems to me that
this is a non-answer to what happened and only a cause of death
stemming from a trauma of unknown origin.

[In many US locations, Independence Day is celebrated long before
midnight. However, in the case of the New Year's celebration,
fireworks in the US and many other locations do not begin until
midnight, and reports of the birds' demise began before the midnight
hour. It is unlikely that fireworks were the cause of the birds
flying into things. Otherwise, we would have them at every
celebration in which fireworks are used, and that is not the case.

Both of these statements echo this moderator's belief that blunt
force trauma from falling to the ground may be the direct cause of
death but not the underlying cause.


Storms vs. fireworks, perhaps something stunned the birds causing
them to fall. Regrettably, the necropsy report may be all we have to
go on, but it is far from answering the questions. - Mod.TG]
