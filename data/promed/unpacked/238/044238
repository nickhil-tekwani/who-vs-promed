The state veterinary service in Azerbaijan denies any bird die-off in
Geychay rayon, despite complaints of local villagers. The villagers in
Bigir complain about widespread domestic bird die-off. The locals say
that the mortality has been ongoing for a week, affecting most farms.
An interviewed person confirmed that he had lost 25-30 hens and
chickens. Samples had been taken for testing, results received saying
"a viral infection against which there is no vaccine". The villagers
were not instructed to avoid using sick chickens' meat.

A representative of the state veterinary services claimed the
villagers' complaints were groundless. He argued that at the most few
("1-2") chickens died due to seasonal factors. He said that the 4th
surveillance for bird flu was launched on 28 Mar 2011. Samples will be
collected in many places. There is also a hotline for the reporting of
suspected cases.

ground, including clinical, epidemiological and pathological findings,
would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
