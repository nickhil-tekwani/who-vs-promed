The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the [Hong Kong] Department of Health today (31 Jul 2013) appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) after investigating into HFMD outbreaks at 2 summer camps which were respectively held in Stanley and Sai Kung by the same organisation and affecting a total of 38 residents and 2 members of staff.

The 1st outbreak at a camp site in Stanley involved 23 residents, comprising 19 boys and 4 girls aged from 11 to 18, who have developed fever, oral ulcers, and rash and vesicles on their hands or feet since 18 Jul 2013. The other outbreak at a camp site in Sai Kung affected 21 residents and 2 members of staff, comprising 18 males and 5 females aged from 12 to 33, who have developed fever, oral ulcers, and rash and vesicles on their hands or feet since 23 Jul 2013.

Preliminary investigations by the CHP revealed that 6 of the affected residents, 5 boys and one girl aged from 13 to 18, had attended both camps. The camp in Stanley started on 17 Jul 2013 and ended on 20 Jul 2013, while that in Sai Kung was held from 22 to 26 Jul 2013. All affected residents and staff sought medical consultation; 2 of them were hospitalised for management, of whom one has been discharged. All affected persons are currently in stable condition. Officers of the CHP have provided health advice to the staff. Residents and staff of both camps have been put under medical surveillance.

HFMD is a common disease in children and is usually caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses and enterovirus 71 (EV71). To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:
- Maintain good air circulation;
- Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
- Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
- Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;
- Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; and
- Avoid going to overcrowded places.

More information on HFMD and EV71 can be obtained from the CHP's website: http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/16354.html.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) usually affects infants and children, and is quite common. It is moderately contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or feces of an infected person. It typically occurs in small epidemics in nursery schools or kindergartens, usually during the summer and autumn months. The usual incubation period is 3-7 days. It is less common in adults. ProMED-mail does not normally report outbreaks of HFMD on account of their ubiquity. Outbreaks of HFMD are associated with a variety of enteroviruses, the most severe outbreaks being associated with coxsackievirus A6 infection or human enterovirus 71. The latter has been associated with more sever forms of HFMD and is most common in some Asian countries. Enterovirus 71-associated disease is sufficiently common and serious as to focus research on vaccine development.

The identity of the agent responsible for the 2 outbreaks in Hong Kong has not been determined, but may be the same agent in view of the intermingling of participants. It seems likely lapses in hygiene associated with camping may have been responsible for the outbreak. - Mod.CP
