Paris - The highest security laboratory in Europe, one of only four in the
world equipped to stalk the most deadly germs known to man, was inaugurated
by President Jacques Chirac in Lyon yesterday, writes Lara Marlowe.
The Jean Merieux P4 Laboratory is headed by a British scientist, Ms Susan
Fisher-Hoch, a specialist in the African Ebola and Lassa viruses. The 'p'
in P4 stands for pathogen; 4 is the highest level, ascribed only to the
most dangerous diseases for which there is no cure. Scientists classify
salmonella and the bacteria that cause legionnaire's disease as P2. The HIV
virus that causes Aids is P3. P4 germs include two 'new viruses' that
appeared in Africa in this decade [actually in the 1960s &1970s - Mod.JW]:
Ebola is transmitted by poor hygiene in hospitals and leads to massive
haemorrhaging. Lassa, which also causes bleeding, is transmitted when
rodents come into contact with human food. It has already killed 15,000
people.
Elaborate measures are necessary to protect researchers studying these
diseases, and to ensure that the germs do not escape to the outside
environment. The Jean Merieux laboratory is built on six earthquake-proof
pillars, straddling another laboratory on the banks of the Rhone River. Its
outer shell is made of bazooka-proof glass. The second layer of the
laboratory is armoured steel.
The viruses are stored in casks of liquid nitrogen, and the innermost
chamber of the lab is slightly depressurised so that in the event of a
leak, air flows into it.
