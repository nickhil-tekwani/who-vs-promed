Now that COVID-19 cases have started showing a downward trend, 3 cholera cases from 3 areas [have] put the Health Department on its toes. The positive cases include 2 infants. Teams of the Health Department are visiting the 3 areas, doing a house-to-house survey, creating awareness and distributing ORS packets. The health officials have confirmed the 3 cases Sunday [25 Jul 2021]. Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea. It can lead to dehydration. It is caused by eating contaminated food or drinking water.

The source of drinking water in the area is an MC tap. A 2-year-old had consumed food from outside a day before symptoms showed up. Five water samples and 3 stool samples have been collected from the area Sunday [25 Jul 2021]. The child, who was admitted to the DMCH, was discharged subsequently. In Adarsh Colony, a 21-year-old youth was found suffering from cholera. He resides in a migrants' vehra where 8 families stay. Five water samples and 2 stool samples were collected from the area on Sunday.

One case was reported from Ambedkar Nagar, where a one-year-old child was found infected with the disease. "The department is taking every necessary precautionary step. The hanging drop test of these 3 patients has come positive while the culture report is pending. No suspected patient was found in these areas. All 3 areas are located far off and are individual cases, so the possibility of outbreak is less, but still health teams are visiting these areas and creating awareness among people regarding water-borne diseases. Pamphlets, chlorine tablets and ORS packets are also being distributed in these areas," said Civil Surgeon Kiran Gill.

Four persons, including a 3-year-old girl, died and 25 others were admitted to hospitals due to diarrhea at Anugonda village in Kodumur mandal on Monday [26 Jul 2021]. They reportedly fell ill due to consumption of contaminated water. According to villagers, the protected water supplied to them from River Handri got contaminated 2 days before. Several people developed vomiting and diarrhea after consuming the water. Having learned about it, medical teams, led by DMHO Rama Giddaiah, rushed to the village and set up camps to treat the affected people.

Kodumur tahsildar Uma Maheswari and MPDO Manjula Vani visited the village to oversee relief operations. The affected people were admitted to Kodumur and Kurnool government hospitals. The DMHO said the drinking water samples were collected and sent for analysis. Confirming the death of 4 persons, he said the cause is yet to be ascertained. "The situation is now under control," the DMHO said. The panchayat authorities cleaned drains in the village. They also inspected the water pipelines.

According to unconfirmed reports, similar incidents took place at Vempenta in Atmakur mandal and at Yerradoddi in Krishnagiri the week previously, leading to the deaths of 5.
