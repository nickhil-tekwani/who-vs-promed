LASSA FEVER, UPDATE - SIERRA LEONE (2)
======================================
Update from MERLIN, a British medical agency in Sierra Leone.
Medical Co-ordinator Dr. Rob Bennett has filed the following information from
Freetown, Sierra Leone:
"This looks like the most severe epidemic of Lassa fever in this region to
date. In May the number of cases jumped from 3 or 4 cases a week to 15 or 20.
Efforts to contain the epidemic have been hampered by the war, which
destroyed medical services. Despite the current ceasefire, there is still
looting in the villages which hampers our ability to find and treat patients.
There is a lot we do not yet know about Lassa fever. Treatment is with
Ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, but it is only at the trial stage, and the
main clinical trials near Kenema were stopped by the war."
Background
Out of 167 patients identified in Kenema district since January 1996, 65 have
died. No one knows how many more are suffering in the interior of Sierra
Leone, where populations have been cut off by guerrilla warfare.
The epidemic centres on Kenema, a district packed with thousands of people
who have fled from the recent civil war in Sierra Leone. Conditions in
Kenema are ideal for the spread of Lassa fever - unclean water, unhygienic
food storage, overcrowding and multiplying populations of rats. The virus is
spread in rats' urine and excreta when they contaminate human food and water
supplies. The current outbreak follows an increase in the number of rats
locally.
The international medical team assisting Sierra Leone health officials
comprises: MERLIN (Medical Emergency Relief International), World Health
Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control.
Medical staff from MERLIN have helped local health officials to set up an
isolation unit in Kenema Hospital for Lassa fever patients, with adequate
beds, water and sanitation. Supplies of Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, have
been donated by CDC. MERLIN is assisting the hospital in sourcing other
medical supplies for the unit, including antibiotics, oral rehydration salts
and intravenous liquids.
Meanwhile, medical teams are visiting outlying villages around Kenema to
educate villagers about the dangers of Lassa fever and how to avoid them
through hygienic food and water storage, and control of rats.
The Sierra Leone government is co-ordinating with foreign agencies to provide
health care and other basic services for displaced people across the country.
It has developed considerable experience with Lassa fever, which is endemic
at a lower level throughout West Africa.
Lassa fever kills from shock and haemorrhaging of the internal organs,
especially the brain, kidneys and throat. Its early symptoms are easily
mistaken for influenza. It can kill an adult within 10 days. It is one of a
group of haemorraghic fevers which includes ebola, dengue and yellow fever,
some of Africa's most feared diseases.
