Case count update
-----------------
A total of 22 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis have been reported. 20 ill persons have been reported from 13 states. The 5 new cases are from: Alabama (1), California (1), Illinois (1), New York (1), and South Carolina (1). Additionally, 2 ill persons have been reported from Canada.

Among persons for whom information is available, illnesses began between October 2011 and 11 May 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year old to 82 years old and the median age is 46.5 years. 68 percent of patients are female. Among the 17 patients with available information, 6 (35 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 11 May 2012 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
On 2 Apr 2012, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development detected salmonellae in an unopened bag of Diamond Naturals Lamb Meal & Rice dry dog food, which had been collected 14 Mar 2012, during routine retail testing of dry pet food. Public health investigators used PulseNet to identify recent cases of human illness with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from _S._ Infantis, which was isolated from the unopened bag of dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 7 of 10 (70 percent) ill persons interviewed reported contact with a dog in the week before becoming ill. Of 5 ill persons who could recall the type of dog food with which they had contact, 4 (80 percent) identified dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods that may have been produced at a single facility in South Carolina.

As part of this outbreak investigation, Ohio public health and agriculture officials collected and tested dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods. The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Infantis was isolated from an opened bag of Diamond Brand Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Adult Light Formula dry dog food collected from the home of an ill person, and an unopened bag of the product collected from a retail store. A sample of Diamond Puppy Formula dry dog food collected by FDA during an inspection at the South Carolina production facility has also yielded salmonellae.
