India: Encephalitis Death Toll in Andhra Pradesh Rise to 140
------------------------------------------------------------
A mosquito-borne encephalitis has killed 5 more children in a southern
Indian state, taking the death toll to 140, officials said on Mon 21 Jul
2003. At least 257 other children have been affected across Andhra Pradesh
state over the past 8 weeks, Health Minister K. Sivaprasada Rao said in the
state capital, Hyderabad.
5 more deaths were reported Sunday, state health official Dr. P Laxmi
Raqjyam said. But Rao said the situation was now under control and the
number of cases was declining. The children have been killed in a rare
summertime outbreak of viral meningo-encephalitis, health officials said.
Most of the victims were poor, malnourished children from rural areas who
may have succumbed because of a sudden change in weather from intense
summer heat to monsoon rains. Many children might also have died because
they could not be taken to health centers in time, experts said.
Officials are worried that the disease may spread during an upcoming Hindu
religious gathering for the Godavari Pushkaram festival. Millions of people
are expected to assemble along rivers in the state considered holy by
Hindus. During the 30 Jul to 10 Aug 2003 pilgrimage, observed once in 12
years, devotees will take baths in 7 districts of the state. Rao said the
government was taking steps so that diseases like encephalitis do not
spread during the festival.
Health officials say 2 federal laboratories in New Delhi and the western
city of Pune have tested the virus and found no link to West Nile virus.
The disease [Japanese encephalitis?] hits India every year, but usually in
the drier months of October to December, and it usually causes fewer
deaths. According to the World Health Organization, encephalitis is endemic
to Asia and around 50 000 cases are recorded every year.
The last big encephalitis outbreak in Andhra Pradesh was in 1999, when 965
cases were reported, with 200 deaths. Throughout Asia last year there were
50 000 cases and 10 000 deaths. No treatment is available for
meningo-encephalitis, but doctors can treat the symptoms. There also are
vaccines, and the usual action is to vaccinate a population once there has
been an outbreak.

[This outbreak is now also affecting the neighboring state of Maharashtra.
The etiologic agent of this meningo-encephalitis is presumed to be Japanese
encephalitis virus, but this is not stated precisely. An unequivocal
diagnosis is still awaited. - Mod.CP]
