The latest on a chemical leak in a north suburban Chicago, Illinois, community that caused 37 people to be hospitalized (all times local, CDT):

6:27 a.m.
Authorities are urging residents in a suburban Chicago community to stay indoors with their windows closed following a chemical spill that resulted in a toxic gas cloud. The Lake County Sheriff's Office reported the hazardous material spill just before 5 a.m. Thursday [25 Apr 2019] in Beach Park, saying the spill has created "a dangerous chemical cloud" in a 1-mile radius of Green Bay Road and 29th Street in the north suburban community.

The sheriff's department says the spill appears to be anhydrous ammonia.

Residents are being urged to stay inside with their windows closed while hazardous materials crews respond to the spill. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas causing breathing difficulties, burns, blisters and can be fatal in high concentrations.

9:20 a.m.
Authorities say an anhydrous ammonia leak in north suburban Chicago has been contained. Lake Forest Fire Chief Mike Gallo says a tractor was towing 2 separate 2-ton containers of the chemical farmers use for soil early Thursday [25 Apr 2019]. Gallo says the leaking tank is now empty.

No information has been provided about how the leak occurred. Initial reports said the tractor was involved in a crash but authorities now say it doesn't appear there was a collision. Authorities are waiting for the chemical plume to dissipate. Gallo says the weather is good in the area and that's helping.

9:35 a.m.
Authorities say the leak happened at about 4:30 a.m. Thursday [25 Apr 2019], causing toxic plumes of the chemical to be released in the air over Beach Park, about 40 miles (65 km) north of downtown Chicago.

Authorities initially asked any residents within a 1-mile radius of the leak to close their windows and remain indoors. Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli says that the shelter-in-place order is being lifted at 10 a.m.

[This situation progressed with increasing numbers of individuals affected until the last update at 11:15 a.m. CDT. - Mod.TG]

11:15 a.m.
Authorities say 37 people have been hospitalized due to an ammonia leak in a Chicago suburb. Lake County Sheriff's spokesman Christopher Covelli says 3 law enforcement officers are among those taken to hospitals after the leak in Beach Park early Thursday [25 Apr 2019], and they are in good condition.

Covelli says several other people are in serious but stable condition. Authorities say most of those injured suffered breathing problems.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas causing breathing difficulties, burns, blisters and is fatal if inhaled in high concentrations.

Residents within a 1-mile radius of the leak were initially told to close their windows and remain indoors, but the order was lifted a few hours later. Schools in the area are closed.

["Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is an efficient and widely used source of nitrogen fertilizer. It is relatively easy to apply and is readily available to producers.

"However, if not handled properly, NH3 can be dangerous. Anhydrous means "without water." Because NH3 contains little or no water, it aggressively seeks out moisture, be it from soil or your eyes, throat, lungs or skin. Any anhydrous ammonia contact with our bodies could cause tissue dehydration, caustic burns as well as frostbite.

"When used as an agricultural fertilizer, NH3 is compressed into a liquid. This requires a substantial amount of pressure and specially designed tanks and equipment. If not stored or transported properly, serious injuries are possible." (https://www.mda.state.mn.us/pesticide-fertilizer/anhydrous-ammonia).

These are usually pressurized tanks pulled by a tractor. No information has been provided about how the tank developed a leak. However, it is known in the illicit drug manufacturing practice, individuals will attempt to access these pressurized tanks under the cover of darkness. The tampering with the tank valves may not be evident until the tractor and the tank engage to fertilize the field.

"Ammonia is a colorless highly irritating gas with a sharp suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in water to form ammonium hydroxide solution, which can cause irritation and burns. Ammonia gas is easily compressed and forms a clear, colorless liquid under pressure. It is usually shipped as a compressed liquid in steel cylinders. Ammonia is not highly flammable, but containers of ammonia may explode when exposed to high heat.

"About 80% of the ammonia produced in industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer, as a refrigerant gas, to purify water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, fabrics, pesticides, dyes and other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Cleaning solutions for industrial use contain higher concentrations of ammonia and can quickly cause irritation and burns.

"Most people are exposed to ammonia from breathing its gas or vapors. Since ammonia exists naturally and is also present in cleaning products, exposure may occur from these sources. The widespread use of ammonia on farms and in industrial and commercial locations means that exposure can also occur from an accidental release or from a deliberate terrorist attack.

"Ammonia gas is lighter than air and will rise, so that generally it does not settle in low-lying areas. However, in the presence of moisture, ammonia can form vapors that are heavier than air. These vapors can spread along the ground or other low-lying areas.

"When ammonia enters the body as a result of breathing, swallowing or skin contact, it reacts with water to produce ammonium hydroxide. This chemical is very corrosive and damages cells in the body on contact.

"Ammonia is corrosive. The severity of health effects depends on the route of exposure, the dose and the duration of exposure. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in air causes immediate burning of the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract and can result in blindness, lung damage or death. Inhalation of lower concentrations can cause coughing, and nose and throat irritation.

"Swallowing ammonia can cause burns to the mouth, throat and stomach. Skin or eye contact with concentrated ammonia can also cause irritation and burns.

"If you have been exposed to a large release of ammonia such as from a tanker truck rollover or from a leaking tanker rail car, take the following steps:

- Quickly move away from the area where you think you were exposed. If the release was indoors, go outside.
-- If you are near a release of ammonia, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to "shelter in place." To "shelter in place" means to remain indoors to avoid being exposed to the chemical. While indoors, shut and lock all doors and windows; turn off air conditioners, fans and heaters; and close fireplace dampers.
- Quickly remove any clothing that may have ammonia on it. If possible, clothing that is normally removed over the head (like t-shirts and sweaters) should be cut off the body to prevent additional contact with the agent.
-- Place your clothing inside a plastic bag and seal the bag tightly.
-- Do not handle the plastic bag, and wait for instructions on proper disposal.
-- Disposing of your clothing in a sealed bag helps protect you and other people from any additional exposure.
-- Store the bagged clothing in a secure location away from people, especially children.
- Quickly wash any ammonia from your skin with large amounts of soap and water, and flush your eyes with large amounts of water.
-- Remove and dispose of contact lenses.
-- Wash eyeglasses with soap and water before wearing.
-- Do not use bleach to remove ammonia from your skin.
- If needed, seek medical attention right away.

"To reduce the effects from exposure to ammonia, it is important to wash eyes and skin as quickly as possible with large amounts of water.

"There is no antidote for ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated, and most victims recover. People who experience serious signs and symptoms (such as severe or constant coughing, or burns in the throat) may need hospital care."
