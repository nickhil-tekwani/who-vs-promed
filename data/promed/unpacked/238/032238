After going several weeks without a reported human plague case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), new cases were reported between mid-February and mid-March [2020]. Since the beginning of the year [2020], a total of 20 suspected bubonic plague cases with 7 deaths (case fatality ratio 35%) were notified in 5 health zones: Aungba (4 cases and 2 deaths), Linga (7 cases and 5 deaths), Rethy (6 cases and no deaths), Aru (2 cases and no deaths), and Kambala (1 case and no deaths). From week 1 to 52 of 2019, a total of 48 cases of bubonic plague including 8 deaths have been reported in the country.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits, and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation, and, in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person. _Yersinia pestis_ infection is treatable with antimicrobials if started early enough.

There are 3 forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form. In this form, the bacteria enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. Here the bacteria infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to a week, the person will experience fever, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes.

[The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may produce bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.

CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis include tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.LL
