Maryland: Kidney recipient dies after testing West Nile virus-positive
--------------------------------------------------
A Maryland woman who received a kidney transplant last month died after
testing positive for the West Nile virus, state health officials said. The
source of the infection is unclear, however, because initial tests for the
virus on the organ donor were negative, the state Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene said on Wed 2 Oct 2002.
The woman, aged 55, died Tuesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. The
transplantation took place on 6 Sep 2002, and the woman was discharged from
the hospital on 14 Sep 2002. She was readmitted on 16 Sep 2002. The
department, the American Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are investigating the possibility of transmission through blood
transfusions or from outside exposure.
Georges Benjamin, secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene. said the Red Cross is trying to identify all individuals who may
have donated blood products that the woman received. Benjamin emphasized
that West Nile virus cannot be contracted by donating an organ or blood. But
health officials have confirmed that the virus can apparently be transmitted
through blood transfusions, as well as organ transplants, although the risk
is considered low.

Iowa: First Death from West Nile Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------
A northwest Iowa man became the first Iowan to die from West Nile virus
infection, state public health officials said on 3 Oct 2002. The victim, an
81-year-old retired truck driver of Glidden, died on 1 Oct 2002. Authorities
said that the man probably was infected with the mosquito-borne virus days
or weeks before becoming sick. "He was fairly active and was mowing the yard
within the previous 2 weeks," said Dr. Stephen Gleason, director of the Iowa
Department of Public Health. "It's likely that he contracted it from
mosquitoes while he was doing outside activities." The victim first
experienced weakness and went to see a doctor, officials said. He was
admitted to the hospital the next day, where officials said he became
confused and delirious and may have had a seizure. He slipped into a coma
and died. Tests of his blood and spinal fluid confirmed that he had
contracted West Nile virus.
The death brought the number of known human infections in Iowa to 30. The
virus has been found in humans, horses, or birds in all Iowa counties except
Allamakee. Illinois leads the nation with 614 human cases and 35 deaths.
The virus is still active in mosquitoes in Iowa. The insects are biting
people more in the daytime, rather than at dusk or dawn, because nighttime
cold makes it hard for them to fly. Residents are being warned to check
their door and window screens for holes, because mosquitoes often try to
move inside this time of year. Officials said they expect to see cases of
the virus until about 2 weeks after the first frost.
State Epidemiologist Patricia Quinlisk said the state is considering
large-scale testing this winter to see how many people have been infected
without becoming sick. Most people infected never show symptoms, and most of
the people who become sick don't need hospitalization. But the virus can
cause deadly brain inflammation, especially in the elderly. "There are a lot
of factors that go into whether the patient will survive or not," Gleason
said. "Certainly, advanced age is the highest risk factor for West Nile
virus."

Arizona: 2 New Probable Human West Nile Cases; Both Travel Related
------------------------------------------------
Preliminary results from the Arizona Department of Health Services' State
Health Laboratory indicate probable West Nile virus infections in 2 adult
female Arizona residents after both traveled to states with intense West
Nile activity. Final confirmation of the diagnoses is pending on tests from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Fort Collins,
Colorado.
Both are recovering from the disease and do not pose a health threat to
other Arizona residents. West Nile virus is not spread from one person to
another, but only by
mosquitoes infected with the virus. The Maricopa County resident had
traveled to Missouri and Indiana, while the Pima County resident had
traveled to Michigan, prior to becoming ill. In September 2002, health
officials announced that another Arizona resident had become ill with West
Nile virus after traveling to Ohio. Confirmation of that diagnosis is still
pending CDC tests.
Dr. Victorio Vaz, acting Arizona Department of Health Services' State
Epidemiologist, stressed that the only West Nile cases in Arizona so far are
travel-related. According to Craig Levy, Program Manager of the Health
Department's Vector-Borne Disease Program, the ADHS State Health Laboratory
has tested more than 600 mosquito pools; 1200 blood samples from sentinel
chicken flocks placed strategically across the state; and more than 100
human specimens for West Nile virus. All were negative, except for the 3
imported human cases. A horse from Pima County also tested positive for West
Nile virus in late August 2002. It likely contracted the disease in
Minnesota.

West Nile Virus Latest News - as of Mon 7 Oct Sep 2002
-------------------------------------------------
WNV has been detected in 43 states in the US and 5 provinces in Canada in
2002. On 2 Oct 2002 a raven in Pend Oreille County, Washington was confirmed
with WNV. It is on both sides of the divide in Colorado and has been
confirmed in California and Washington, on the Pacific Coast, and in Nova
Scotia, Canada, on the Atlantic coast. In many states it has been detected
in all, or nearly all, counties.
As of Mon 7 Oct 2002, the CDC reports 2736 probable or confirmed human cases
(146 fatalities) in 34 states. This number is far higher than the prediction
reported in newspapers across the country last month that there would be
1000 human cases this year, based solely on extrapolations from data in
previous years.
Largest numbers of cases are in Illinois (640), Michigan (379), Ohio (313),
Louisiana (293), Mississippi (168), Missouri (137), Indiana (157), and Texas
(101). The 2002 reported case load continues to increase, although it is
difficult to tell whether this is primarily due to the lag time between
disease onset and confirmation, or to new infections. This compares with:
2530 cases (116 fatalities) in 32 states reported on 2 Oct;
2121 cases (95 fatalities) in 32 states reported on 25 Sep;
1963 cases (94 fatalities) in 32 states reported on 23 Sep;
1745 cases (84 fatalities) in 31 states reported on 19 Sep;
1295 cases (54 fatalities) in 30 states reported on 12 Sep;
954 cases (43 fatalities) in 29 states reported on 6 Sep;
737 cases (40 fatalities) in 28 states reported on 4 Sep;
555 cases (28 fatalities) in 26 states reported on 29 Aug;
480 cases (24 fatalities) in 22 states reported on 28 Aug;
425 cases (20 fatalities) in 20 states reported on 27 Aug;
371 cases (16 fatalities) in 20 states reported on 23 Aug;
296 cases (14 fatalities) in 17 states reported on 22 Aug;
210 cases reported on on 21 Aug 1; and
156 cases reported a week earlier, on 14 Aug 2002.
[For more detail, see the maps and state-by-state tallies compiled and
posted by CDC and a graphical presentation of these data at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm>]
The number of equine cases has seen an upsurge, with 9036 cases in 36 states
reported as of Sun 6 Oct 2002 to USDA APHIS by state health officials. WNV
has now been associated with illness and death in several other mammal
species, including squirrel, wolf, and dog in Illinois -- which leads the
country in number of human cases -- and mountain goat and sheep in
Nebraska -- which leads the country in numbers of equine cases. The
University of Minnesota's Raptor Center reports increasing numbers of
raptors picked up sick or dead, infected with WNV but perhaps also with
other confounding diseases.
Health officials have become convinced that WNV can be transmitted via organ
transplant and blood transfusion. However, risks of contracting WNV by these
routes are very small as compared with other risks related to these
treatments. As of Oct 3 2002, evidence is also mounting that WNV can be
transmitted to babies via breast milk: WNV genetic material was transiently
present in the breast milk of a woman with WNV infection and measurable
WNV-specific IgM was detected in her baby. Despite this finding, the risk of
WNV illness in young children is very low; only 4 infants in the US are
known to have become infected with WNV during the 4 years that the virus has
been reported in the US.
