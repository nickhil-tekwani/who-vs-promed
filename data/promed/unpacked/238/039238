8 Are Killed in Train Crash and Gas Leak
------------------------------
At least 8 people died and more than 200 were treated at hospitals after a
42-car freight train crashed into a smaller one early Thursday morning and
leaked chlorine gas in Graniteville, South Carolina, authorities said.
Most of the injured were residents suffering from respiratory difficulty,
said Thom Berry, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Health
and Environmental Control.
Gov. Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency for Aiken County, S.C., and
officials told residents within a mile of the crash site to leave. [The
national news reported the evacuation of 5400 people - Mod.TG]
Area residents went to 2 local schools, where paramedics evaluated them and
sent many to hospitals, where more than 50 were admitted. The authorities
did not immediately release the identities of the dead or the causes of
their deaths.
Susan Terpay, a spokeswoman for Norfolk Southern, which owns both trains,
said that the larger train's engineer was fatally injured in the crash,
which she said occurred at 2:40 a.m. Its conductor was hospitalized, she
said. The cause of the crash was not known. Ms. Terpay said that the larger
train was en route from Macon, Georgia to Columbia, S.C., while the smaller
train was stationary on a rail siding in downtown Graniteville, which is
about 15 miles northeast of Augusta, GA.
Afterward, the 2 locomotives of the larger train and 14 of its cars lay in
a jumble, with 1 car leaking all its chlorine gas, Ms. Terpay said. The
train was also carrying 2 other hazardous chemicals, sodium hydroxide and
cresol, she said.
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived to
investigate, and the Federal Railroad Administration said it was sending a
9-member team to assist the safety board investigators.

[Chlorine gas is moderately soluble in water. It reacts with the moisture
in the respiratory system to result in irritation of the respiratory
system, the eyes, the nose, and almost any other mucus membrane. The
irritation is prolonged in moist conditions. Chlorine may combine with the
water to form hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid, which are intensely
irritating.
Chlorine gas is greenish-yellow and generally heavier than air, so it stays
near the ground; without a wind, or in damp conditions, it is not
immediately dissipated. Chlorine gas toxicity produces acute effects
including inflammation of the conjunctivae, nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea,
and bronchi. Irritation of the airway mucosa causes local edema or swelling
and may be secondary to active arterial and capillary hyperemia. Plasma
exudation causes alveolar edema, resulting in pulmonary congestion, which
may lead to death, particularly in individuals with compromised respiratory
systems.
The eyes may burn and tear and corneal ulcers may occur. Generally the eyes
will heal without many long-lasting sequelae.
Generally the affected individuals have a cough, chest pain, eye pain,
nausea or vomiting, tearing, pain and tightness in the throat, choking and
headache. These must be differentiated from the symptoms of asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intoxication with phosgene, cyanide,
hydrogen sulfide and ammonia.
Although chlorine gas has a detectable odor, our sense of smell does not
tell us when it is above a dangerous level.
Sources of exposure to chlorine include swimming pools, sewer systems,
industrial bleaching and chemical warfare. This is not intended to be a
comprehensive list. Chlorine gas was 1st used by the Germans in 1915 in
World War 1.- Mod.TG]
