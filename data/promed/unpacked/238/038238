Hawaii typically sees 10 mumps cases a year. An outbreak has now sickened 100 times that. The mumps outbreak in Hawaii has hit the 1000 case mark, according to the state Health Department.

Typically, the state sees less than 10 cases a year. In 2017, Hawaii saw more than 760.

The majority of cases were reported on Oahu, with 810 confirmed cases. Hawaii Island saw 134 cases, Kauai saw 49, and Maui has 7 confirmed cases.

This has been the largest outbreak of the disease in the islands in decades. An Oahu charter school even had to start winter break early to prevent the disease from spreading. There also have been 31 reports of complications since the outbreak, including hearing loss. "For now, it's still trickling along," said Dr. Sarah Park, Department of Health.

Park said we're nowhere near ending the outbreak, although it seems the outbreak may at least be slowing down a bit. The outbreak started in March 2017, after the Health Department reported 9 people had the viral infection. The infection is spread through saliva. Park said sharing food, drinks, or other activities that could transmit saliva should be avoided.

The disease is not considered life-threatening, but there can be complications. Symptoms can include fever, headaches, swollen glands under the ear or jaw, and muscle aches.

The state Department of Health said the best way to prevent mumps is to get vaccinated.

[There, unfortunately, have been 31 cases of mumps in Hawaii with complications, including loss of hearing. With the exception of children who have underlying conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, all other children old enough to be vaccinated should be, not only to protect themselves, but also to protect others who cannot be safely vaccinated. With 1000 cases, there must be a low proportion of children vaccinated, especially on Oahu. - Mod.LK

[2] Mexico: Mumps alert

The mumps outbreak currently occurring in our country is still affecting the population. Our (health) institution has taken care of in its different units 54 persons diagnosed with mumps. Five cases of this condition were seen last week, according to a report issued by the General Direction of Epidemiology from the Federal Health Secretary.

The data published in the Health Secretary website indicate that these 54 cases of this vaccine-preventable disease outnumber the 32 cases found during the same time period in 2017, emphasizing that the condition is equally affecting men and women.

In this sense, Mr. Fernando Izquierdo-Aquino, Public Health Sub-Secretary, pointed out that the National Epidemiological Surveillance Council sent a communication to all its facilities, declaring an alert state because of this mumps outbreak occurring since last April [2018], emphasizing that medical units should take special care with these cases.

"We are alert in order to avoid blockade and take care of affected persons who may present with the symptoms; for this reason, the most important aspect is to immediately go to health-care facilities should any upper respiratory symptom occur," he declared. Mr Izquierdo-Aquino also mentioned that the duration of this outbreak is unknown. The occurrence is located in the northern Mexican states, but the other state authorities are in an alert state.

"Mumps is an acute self-limiting condition, as is the case for conjunctivitis, but it is a preventable condition, and our strength lies in our vaccination schedule, in which the triple viral vaccine (MMR: measles, mumps, and rubella) is administered to children less than 5 years of age," he pointed out.

The Mexican National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE, according to its Spanish initials) has identified cases and outbreaks in the country since the last weeks of 2017. The increase in the number of mumps cases is affecting many areas of the country, especially Tamaulipas State in Ciudad Madero and Tampico municipalities; Quintana Roo State, Solidaridad municipality; and Nuevo Leon State, Monterrey municipality.

Up to the 15th epidemiological week for 2018, 2619 mumps cases have been identified in Mexico; the most affected states are as follows: Tamaulipas, 561 cases (21 percent); Nuevo Leon, 302 (12 percent); Quintana Roo, 203 (8 percent); Jalisco, 189 (7 percent), and Chihuahua, 167 (6 percent).

The most affected age groups all over the country are 25-44-year-old adults, with 805 cases (31 percent); followed by the 20-24-year-old group, with 531 cases (20 percent), and 5-9-year-old children, with 388 cases (15 percent).

Gender distribution shows a mild male predominance, with 1450 affected males (55 percent) and 1169 female cases (45 percent).

In this year so far, mumps outbreaks have been identified in Mexico City, Sonora, and Chihuahua. These occurrences have a common feature: they tend to appear in colleges, affecting young people.

[Parotitis is the name given to inflammation and infection of the largest of the salivary glands known as the parotid glands. Inflammation results in swelling of the tissues that surround the salivary glands, redness, and soreness. Salivary glands are responsible for producing saliva in the mouth, which has the important function of cleansing the mouth. Inflammation of the salivary glands reduces their ability to function properly and may lead to infections within the mouth.

Parotitis may result from many causes, including infection, drugs, radiation, and various diseases. Mumps was once the most common viral cause of parotitis, but vaccination has made mumps a rare disease today. Parotitis caused by bacterial infection is somewhat common in the United States (excerpted from https://www.healthgrades.com/conditions/parotitis).

It is not surprising that the outbreaks in Mexico have occurred in colleges affecting young people, as colleges have close living accommodations where infectious diseases easily spread. Furthermore, mumps immunity may be waning by the time an individual reaches college, making him/her susceptible to infection. - Mod.LK
