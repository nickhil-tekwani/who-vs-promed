First report of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus in Louisiana
-------------------------------------------------

Physiology, Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station; JE Boudreaux,
Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service, Louisiana State University
Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge 70803. Plant Dis 2001; 85: 230, published
online as D-2000-1120-02N, 2000. Accepted for publication 6 November 2000.
Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus (Geminiviridae) that
causes a serious disease of tomato throughout the world. In 1997, the
strain from Israel of TYLCV (TYLCV-IS) was found infecting tomatoes in
Florida for the first time in the United States (1). Late [in the spring
of 2000, [about 90% of the tomato plants (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) in a
farm near New Orleans exhibited severe stunting, leaf cupping, and
chlorosis, [features similar to those caused by TYLCV.
Whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B) were present in the field but in
relatively low numbers. The effect on yield reduction varied from
negligible (late infections) to 100% (early infections). Six selected
plants showing symptoms were assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using begomovirus-specific primers. _Capsicum frutescens_ infected with an
isolate of Texas pepper virus from Costa Rica was used as positive control.
DNA was extracted using Plant DNAzol Reagent (GIBCO BRL). PCR was conducted
using degenerate primers AV494/AC1048 that amplify the core coat protein
region of most begomoviruses (2).
PCR yielded a DNA fragment of [about 550 bp, suggesting that a begomovirus
was associated with the disease. The amplified DNA of one field isolate was
cloned and the nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. Sequence comparisons
with other begomoviruses in the GenBank Database indicated that the
Louisiana isolate shared 100% nt identity with TYLCV-IS (GenBank Accession
X76319).
Successful transmission (100%) to Bonny Best tomato were obtained with four
groups of 10 whiteflies each (_B. tabaci_ biotype B) that fed on TYLCV-IS
infected tomato plants. Acquisition and transmission feedings were for 2
days. In all cases, the virus was diagnosed by the ability to reproduce
typical TYLCV-like symptoms in tomato and PCR. The virus was also
successfully graft-transmitted to tomato cv. Bonny Best, _Nicotiana
benthamiana_, and tomatillo (_Physalis ixocarpa_) using scions from tomato
plants infected with a whitefly transmitted virus isolate.
This is the first report of TYLCV-IS in Louisiana.

[TYLCV-IS first appeared in the New World sometime in the early 1990s,
probably in the eastern region of the Caribbean and was subsequently
reported in Florida in 1997. In the United States the virus has been
reported in 3 states: Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana. - Mod.DH
