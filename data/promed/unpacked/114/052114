Hunt for Killer Ebola Virus Turns to Dead Apes
---------------------------------------------
Reports of dead gorillas and chimpanzees in a central African forest
are being investigated for links to an outbreak of the deadly Ebola
virus, health authorities in Gabon said Wednesday.
Ebola is thought have killed 10 people in the remote Mekambo district
in the northwest, and one more is seriously ill.
Research Minister Andre-Dieudonne Bere said in an official statement
that the government had been told of "the discovery in the forest of
the corpses of many great apes, gorillas, chimpanzees and so on.''
"The government has sent a team to carry out investigations with the
aim of determining the origin and extent of this epidemic,'' he said.
Dead Ape Links
--------------------
Where the virus hides in the wild before breaking forth to kill humans
and other primates remains a mystery. Searching for the cause of the
first outbreak in 1994, investigators were told of the deaths of many
apes in the forest nearby, but found none. In the 1996 outbreak, 13
people fell ill after butchering a dead chimpanzee they had found.

We have received verbal reports of gorillas, chimpanzees, and duikers
(small
forest antelope) being found dead in the areas of the current Ebola
outbreak in
Gabon. One of our wildlife veterinarians arrived in the area earlier
this week
and has been visiting affected villages along with WHO, CIRMF (Centre
International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville), and ECOFAC (a
European Union funded conservation project) personnel to investigate
the
reports of wildlife mortalities.

[I believe the great apes are capable of catching & killing small
antelope, so this could be the missing link in the infection chain.
Can anyone confirm? - Mod.JW
