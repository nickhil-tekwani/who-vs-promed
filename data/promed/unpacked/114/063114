As of 25 Apr 2013, China's National Health and Family Planning Commission had confirmed a total of 109 cases of H7N9 avian flu. 23 of these cases (about 21 per cent) have been fatal, and there are now signs the virus has infected people living outside mainland China [As of 1 May 2013, mainland China has confirmed 127 human cases, of which 26, or roughly 20.5 per cent, were fatal. - Mod.AS].

While both the spread and the virulence of H7N9 are solidly documented, the exact method of transmission is still somewhat of a mystery. During past outbreaks of avian flu, the virus was being spread from poultry to people; that's why mass culls at chicken and duck farms could effectively nip potential flu epidemics in the bud.

Influenza (of all types) becomes a real danger, however, when the virus mutates to a form easily transmitted between humans without any animal vector. Lately, there are signs this may be happening, and one vector facilitating human-to-human spread of the virus is as unexpected as it is common: poultry feather removal machines.

Poultry feather removal machines are commonly used to pluck freshly slaughtered chickens, ducks and geese at China's urban live poultry markets. To prepare birds for customers, market sellers spin them in machines into which hot water is added. The tubs then spin at high speeds, quickly and efficiently plucking the feathers. But the trouble is that droplets of steam and spray emanating from the machines could carry H7N9 bird flu viruses directly into the lungs of sellers, customers, and anyone else in the area. "If there is a virus, it can be easily inhaled this way," explained Feng Zijian, director of the emergency response center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in a recent briefing with Chinese reporters.

"This is what we suspect to be a major environmental exposure that causes human infections." Once inhaled into the lungs of one human, a simple cough, sneeze or sigh could release the virus into society time and time again, far from the nearest infected chicken.

Large poultry feather removal machines are mainly employed by commercial poultry producers in Western countries, whereas in China, much smaller machines are a common feature at the live poultry markets where the majority of Chinese consumers buy their poultry. Should these machines be positively identified as an influenza transmission vector, the resulting disruption to China's food distribution system would be massive, to say the least.

[If the described (plausible) theory is valid, infection rates among the personnel working with feather removal machines in the affected territories in eastern China should be significantly higher than among other population groups. Is this, indeed, the case? It will also be interesting to note whether the birds treated in the described machines have been tested and found ante-mortem to be infected. - Mod.AS]

Ten years ago, Hong Kong was badly hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome. Residents in Guangzhou had begun rushing to buy vinegar and Chinese medicine to fend off a mysterious form of pneumonia that was sweeping Guangdong province. The SARS virus crossed the border and spread in our community in no time, causing hundreds of deaths. The city's economy also took a bashing and hit rock-bottom.

Today, we are faced with a similarly explosive situation. Shanghai has been hit by what researchers now say is one of the most virulent flu viruses. More cases of H7N9 infections are surfacing almost daily: 127 people are confirmed to have been infected, resulting in 24 deaths. Among those affected, some 40 per cent appear to have had no contact with birds. This raises the possibility of the virus being transmitted between humans.

Is that now the case? A mainland infectious disease expert stated in an overseas medical journal that if 2 genome sequences of the virus have shifted at the same time, the virus will become more infectious. Since the H7N9 virus 1st surfaced, the weather has become warmer. With some birds now migrating northwards, this could lead to more cases in central and northern China.

Already, cases have been found in Fujian and even in Taiwan, where the infected patient was found to have visited southern China. We can no longer dismiss the possibility of human-to-human transmission. The Taiwanese government has stepped up measures and set up an inter-departmental response group in a bid to stop the virus from spreading in the community.

The island has also raised its travel alert to nationals travelling to the mainland and will soon ban the slaughter of poultry. It has stepped up inspections at airports and immigration points.

Hong Kong's efforts pale by comparison. Even after some bird samples taken from a number of wholesale markets for live poultry in Dongguan were confirmed to have the H7 virus (though not the H7N9 one), the relevant authorities were reluctant to do much in response.

And because the Dongguan government didn't immediately cull all chickens, some stalls managed to sell off their stock beforehand, which means infected fowl may have entered the local community or been sold to Hong Kong. About a dozen wholesale markets in Dongguan supply frozen chicken and eggs to Hong Kong and Macau.

This goes to show we cannot dismiss the possibility that the virus has already entered our community.

A number of local infectious disease experts have said they believe the virus could be spreading in neighbouring Guangdong. And they have warned that the current golden week period, when even more mainland tourists arrive here, may facilitate the occurrence of a case surfacing in Hong Kong.

One expert, Dr Ho Pak-leung, microbiologist and associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, says the government should consider banning the sale of live chickens in wet markets.

No one wants to see a repeat of SARS. Hongkongers are strong and resilient. They need to be proactive, be prepared for the worst, and help each other.

[The main reason for posting article [2] above is its inclusion of information ProMED-mail has been requesting since 30 Apr 2013, when we posted the discovery, on 26 Apr 2013, of a single chicken reportedly found H7-positive by a local laboratory among 130 tested chickens on a wholesale market in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. We asked for final results, including confirmation or denial of H7N9 in Guangdong, a province not known earlier as H7N9-infected in humans or animals. [ProMED-mail avoids posting opinions that are overtly critical of government policies and practices and we have therefore edited article [2]. - Mod.SH]

So far, no official information has become available (was this due to China's National Holiday from 29 Apr 2013 to 1 May 2013?). In article [2] the author -- Albert Cheng -- said that the bird samples taken from a number of wholesale markets for live poultry in Dongguan and confirmed to have the H7 virus, "though not the H7N9 one." This news, if confirmed officially, is indeed a relief. - Mod.AS
