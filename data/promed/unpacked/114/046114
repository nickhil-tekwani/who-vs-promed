Thomas Cook (a large travel service) has confirmed 29 cases of "mild illness" [of salmonellosis] reported by guests staying at the Hotel Playa Pesquero in Cuba in the 1st 2 weeks of April 2014.

"This represents just 1.5 percent of the overall hotel population of 1800," the operator said. "The 29 cases were a mixture of Thomas Cook customers and other tour operators; the Thomas Cook customers were offered every assistance by our dedicated resort team. "All were treated on site, with 2 receiving attention at the hotel clinic for dehydration."

The operator disputed allegations made by holiday illness compensation specialists Your Holiday Claims that 80 percent of holidaymakers had fallen ill due to an outbreak of salmonellosis at the hotel. Cook said the cause of the outbreak is under investigation.

Your Holiday Claims alleged that many British holidaymakers had been taken to hospital during their stay. Many were believed to be on saline drips for severe dehydration after being violently ill, the law firm said. Cook responded by saying: "We are aware that a statement was recently issued by a no-win, no-fee lawyer. This repeated as yet unsubstantiated allegations, and we consider this to be deeply irresponsible. We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner."

Cook added that it was working closely with management at the Hotel Playa Pesquero to ensure that internationally recognised Prevention of Spread of Infection (POSI) procedures are in place.

"We will continue to follow the rigorous processes to establish the cause of the illness reported to our staff as this investigation continues," the company said. Cook said that its legal team has yet to receive any correspondence from customers or their legal representatives regarding alleged illness at the hotel.

[The number of cases of gastroenteritis in hotel guests at the Playa Pesquero in Holquin Province on the south central part of the island nation is likely somewhere between the official number of 29 and the numbers reported by the "law" firms drumming up business. - Mod.LL
