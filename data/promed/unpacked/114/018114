Sheep / 5.4 / 3.0 / 54.8 / 4.4

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
By the request of the chief veterinary officer of Georgia, Dr Mikheil Sokhadze, PPR experts visited Georgia in the frame of Crisis Management Center-Animal Health (CMC-AH) Mission with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Experts visited the infected farm, as well as other farms nearby. Together with [the] local veterinary service representatives [they selected] proper samples from clinically infected and clinically non-infected farms. PPR (antibody) competition ELISA as well as PPR antigen capture test kits were provided by [the] PPR experts and selected samples were tested in [the] Laboratory of [the] Ministry of Agriculture [for the purposes] of training/calibration. An animal from 1 farm with clinical signs was positive with PPR (antibody) competition ELISA. Following [the] PPR experts' recommendation, pre-vaccination survey across the country was set up and is ongoing prior to the vaccination. According to the OIE/FAO global strategy as well as expert's recommendation, mass vaccination of susceptible animals started on 12 Feb [2016] aiming at vaccinating 800 000 sheep and goats. To date 320 000 animals have been vaccinated.

Control measures

Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, vaccination in response to the outbreak (s), disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, modified stamping out [see comment].
No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results

Laboratory name and type: Laboratory of Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Sheep / antibody detection ELISA / 09 Feb 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As reported above, modified stamping-out has been applied in Georgia (12 of the 28 remaining infected animals have not been destroyed). This may reflect the fact that because the disease was diagnosed a considerable time after its initial introduction, stamping out is no longer feasible. A similar situation has been observed in many [other] countries -- that is, PPR being identified during an advanced stage of the epizootic. It may thus be assumed that PPR is currently not limited to 2 farms in Georgia. The information in the 2 notified outbreaks that PPR was restricted only to very young lambs is rather unusual. Adult, fully susceptible, unvaccinated sheep are expected to be similarly infected. Clarification or additional data are requested.

According to the findings of the PPR reference laboratory (at Pirbright), the Georgian PPR strain has been genotyped as virus lineage IV. This virus is known to be circulating in South Asia and the Middle East, with Turkey -- Georgia's immediate neighbour -- included. The same lineage IV is also present in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, and is widespread in Egypt. Morocco started implementing a mass vaccination campaign in 2008, and this continued in 2010-2011. The results demonstrated that PPR can be controlled through mass vaccination campaigns.

It will be interesting to obtain the results of PPR surveillance in Georgia's immediate neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both countries share borders with Turkey. Azerbaijan stated, in its most recent available annual OIE report (2014), that PPR was absent in 2014, while its last year of occurrence was "unknown". Armenia, on the other hand, stated in its 2014 annual report that PPR had never occurred there.

PPR continues its spread in Asia (for example, current media report from Humla, Nepal http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-02-20/viral-disease-affecting-goats-and-sheep-spreads-to-humla.html).

The disease is threatening Europe in 3 zones: south east (in addition to Armenia and Azerbaijan, also Georgia's neighbouring republics of the Russian Federation Checheniya, Ingushtiya, Severnaya Osetiya-Alanya and Kabardino-Balkaiskaya; see map at the source URL), south (countries adjacent to western Turkey) as well as south west (countries adjacent to the Maghreb). - Mod.AS
