Iran confirms 2 MERS cases in sisters from Kerman
-------------------------------------------------
Iran's Health Ministry says it has detected 2 confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the country's Kerman Province.

On [Mon 26 May 2014] Mohammad Mahdi Gouya, the director-general of communicable diseases at the Iranian Health Ministry's Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, said 2 sisters from Kerman, in southeast of Iran, had been diagnosed with the severe respiratory disease.

"Four suspected cases of the new coronavirus infection were observed in a family in Kerman Province," said Gouya, adding, "So far, 2 of the cases were confirmed in 2 sisters in Kerman, while one of them is in critical condition and is currently receiving treatment under special circumstances."

MERS first emerged in 2012 and is mostly focused in Saudi Arabia, where it has claimed nearly 180 lives so far, according to health officials in the Persian Gulf kingdom.

Gouya further said Tehran had dispatched trained medical teams to Saudi Arabia, where they closely observe the suspected MERS cases among Iranian Hajj pilgrims, adding that necessary arrangements have also been made for the Iranian pilgrims to undergo medical check-up after they return home.

MERS is a cousin of SARS. The virus, which causes coughing, fever, and pneumonia, does not appear to be as contagious as SARS, which killed some 800 people in a 2003 epidemic.

In addition to Saudi Arabia, which is worst hit by the virus, MERS has been reported in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, Britain and the United States.

Ghazaleh Dashti <sdashti@student.unimelb.edu.au>, an Iranian student in Australia, who provided an excellent translation of a report on the Iranian government news site http://www.behdasht.gov.ir/?siteid=1&fkeyid=&siteid=1&pageid=127&newsview=108713 in Farsi, before the English versions were found by the 2 ladies above.

[The fact that this media report cites the Ministry of Health announcement on the confirmation of 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection in 2 sisters, and another 2 suspected cases, suggests that the infections were confirmed through identification of active viral infection in these 2 individuals. The mention that a team was in Saudi Arabia investigating the health of pilgrims from Iran also suggests that these cases may well have been returning pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, although in the absence of a firm statement to that effect on the part of the MOH reduces this conclusion to speculation. Hence, our request for more information on these cases, including age and travel history during the incubation period for MERS-CoV as well as other potential high risk exposures. At the time of preparation of this update, no further information on these cases was available.

[4] UAE, 0 new cases: media report 27 May 2014

The UAE's Ministry of Health has said that all hospitals in the country are free from MERS coronavirus cases, official state news agency WAM reported.

According to Health Authority-Abu Dhabi (HAAD), all patients who were diagnosed with MERS have cleared the virus. The authority confirmed that there are no positive cases currently in hospitals across Abu Dhabi.

Most of MERS cases in the UAE were found in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, according to official reports.

HAAD also said that it is coordinating with health authorities across the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] to stem the spread of the virus, which has killed 30 percent of those affected.

Saudi Arabia is the worst affected with almost 500 cases and a death toll of 175, has also seen a slowdown in new MERS cases following a sudden outbreak in April and May [2014].

The Kingdom reported no new deaths due to MERS virus and discovered 4 additional cases this week, according to local media.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently said that the disease does not yet constitute a global public health emergency owing to a lack of evidence about sustained human-to-human transmission. But the global health watchdog urged the affected countries to improve infection prevention and control to halt the spread of the disease.

Experts have also blamed the lack of cooperation from health officials in affected countries for fuelling the rise in MERS cases in the region.

MERS is a deadly cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, which emerged in 2002 in China. The virus causes coughing, fever and fatal pneumonia among those affected.

[The total case count in Saudi Arabia is 562 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 180 deaths. The issuance of "zero reporting" confirms that surveillance is ongoing by the MOH, and probably reflects on active reporting for cases. It does appear as though the transmission of the MERS-CoV has slowed down in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

It would be helpful to learn more about the reported confirmed cases in Iran, to see if and when there may have been transmission of the MERS-CoV to these individuals. And if there had been travel, what may have been the high risk activities as well as where in the Arabian Peninsula the transmission occurred.
