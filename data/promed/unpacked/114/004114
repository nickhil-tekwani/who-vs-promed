FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN BOTSWANA
Suspicion
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: September 1980).
Emergency report
Text of a fax received on 6 July 1999 from Dr Motshudi V. Raborokgwe,
Director of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:
Report date: 6 July 1999.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 2 July 1999.
Estimated date of first infection: 11 June 1999.
Outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
Xhara (19 16' 434" S ( 22 18' 964" E) 1 crush
Description of affected population: cattle. The animals were vaccinated two
months ago with trivalent foot and mouth disease vaccine.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species bov
susceptible approx. 2,000
cases 60
deaths 1 calf
destroyed 0
slaughtered 0
One of the affected herds had moved from Samutsuka crush (19 12' 202" S (22
20' 529" E). On arrival, one cow calved and ceased lactation and the calf
died. The farmer then observed oral lesions on the dam and other herd
members. All animals showing lesions are in poor body condition compared to
the healthy ones.
The outbreak involves at least three herds so far. Surveillance by mouth
examination is still being undertaken to find out the extent of the outbreak.
Control measures during reporting period:
- livestock and livestock movement restrictions have been imposed within
zones 2c, 2a, 2b and 2d;
- mobilising of surveillance and vaccinating teams to commence on 7 July.
Note by the OIE Central Bureau:
The suspected outbreak is situated within the Botswana vaccination zone.
Botswana is therefore maintained in the list of OIE Member Countries having
an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 2.1.1 of the International Animal Health Code.
[It is not unusual to find calves dead from acute myocarditis
("tiger-heart") at the very begining of a FMD outbreak. - MHJ]
