The rumours of anthrax cases in Karvetinagaram [Chittoor district, Andra
Pradesh] have created panic among villagers. A total of 7 people who ate
meat of sheep [that] died due to illness were treated in hospital recently.

Joint director of animal husbandry G Somasekharam said 7 sheep died due to
unknown illness. Responding to complaints of a few villagers, who fell ill
after consuming the meat of dead sheep, the Animal Husbandry Department
sent tissues of animals to lab for analysis. "We will take necessary action
after getting the analysis report," he said.

[I had pre-copied this report to colleagues in Tamil Nadu and Andra
Pradesh, but it seems that my email directory for India needs updating. I
have had no replies. So, in hope that this report will result in comments
and clarification, it is being posted.
