[This is the 5th case of avian influenza H5N1 in Mainland China since the beginning of 2015. The 1st case was a 37-year-old female with an onset date of 14 Jan 2015. The 2nd case occurred in Sichuan in a 46-year-old male with onset 18 Feb 2015 and ended in death. The next 3 cases occurred in Yunnan province: Male, 34, onset 13 Mar 2015; male 17, onset 17 Mar 2015; and this current case, a male 6 years old. The 2 previous cases were in Kumming, the capital and largest city (population 3 million) in the province, while this latest case is in Chuxiong, 175 km west. The highest number of cases of H5N1 in China was reported in 2009 (7 cases, 4 deaths).

This case brings the total number of (worldwide) cases in 2015 to 135, according to FluTrackers 2015 Global WHO & Ministries of Health Confirmed H5N1 Human Cases List https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/flutrackers-high-pathogenic-h5n1-h1n08-h5n8-h5n6-h5n3-tracking-outbreaks-spread/720310-flutrackers-2015-global-who-ministries-of-health-confirmed-h5n1-human-cases-list.

A discussion of the genetic changes observed in H5N1 in Egypt in 2015 can be found in the ProMED post 20150402.3274191; however, the virus strain(s) responsible for these 5 cases in China have not been reported.
