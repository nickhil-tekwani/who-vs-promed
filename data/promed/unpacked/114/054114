On behalf of the RITA International Steering Committee and the RITA
XXII Organizing Committee, we are pleased to invite you to the 22nd
International Conference on Rabies in the Americas (RITA) to be held
16-21 Oct 2011 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Since its humble beginnings in 1990, RITA has continued to grow and is
currently the largest and longest running annual conference on rabies
in the world. RITA XX in Quebec, Canada, and most recently RITA XXI in
Guadalajara, Mexico hosted hundreds of delegates from more than 20
countries spread over 5 continents. This conference provides delegates
the opportunity to meet and network with colleagues from around the
world throughout weeklong activities. The RITA XXII Organizing
Committee hopes to meet and excel the quality of the scientific
offerings that has characterized this conference in the past, and not
to disappoint in our offerings of social activities spiced with the
flavors of the Caribbean.

We welcome the opportunity to bring this prestigious international
conference where research scientists, public health experts, wildlife
biologists, rabies program managers, and anyone interested in
advancing knowledge about rabies, have the opportunity to meet,
discuss, and make presentations in this public health problem
affecting animals and humans.

We hope that by hosting RITA XXII we will be able to attract
participants from the Caribbean basin into discussing the intricate
rabies problem facing this region.

Once again on behalf of the RITA XXII Organizing Committee we invite
you to visit us and hope to greet you this October in this beautiful
island of wondrous enchantments.
