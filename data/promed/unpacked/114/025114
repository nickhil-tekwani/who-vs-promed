Swedish authorities said on Friday that tests had confirmed its 1st case of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, from a farm in the
centre of the country.
Cases of BSE, the human form of which has killed around 150 people, still
occur around the world, but it is not as prevalent as in the 1990s.�
"The laboratory in Great Britain confirmed on Friday [3 Mar 2006] that the cow
previously suspected of carrying BSE, or mad cow disease, really did have the
disease," the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) said in a statement.
A preliminary test on Tuesday had indicated the brain wasting disease, which
ravaged European cattle herds, in a 12-year old cow at a farm in Vastmanland
in central Sweden. The farm has been isolated since the case was discovered
and all animals at risk will be destroyed, the SVA said.
"That Sweden should have a case of BSE is regrettable but despite everything,
not unexpected," Leif Denneberg, chief veterinarian at the Swedish Board of
Agriculture said. "The EU...had in its previous risk assessment designated
Sweden as a country where it was unlikely, but not impossible, that BSE might
occur."
Sweden will wait for a decision by the EU before extending its testing regime,
Lena Hult, veterinary inspector at the Board of Agriculture said. "I think
this is an isolated case. We don't expect to find any more in this herd or in
neighbouring herds," she said.
The SVA said it could not rule out that the infected cow might have eaten
contaminated fodder several years ago, before current security measures were
in place. It could have been infected 10 years ago, the SVA said.
"I want to stress that this does not mean an increased danger in eating
Swedish beef," Agriculture Minister Ann-Christin Nykvist said in a
statement. "Sweden has removed all hazardous parts of slaughtered animals
since 1999."
Sweden has tested more than 170 000 animals for mad cow disease since 2001
without finding any cases, confirming that BSE is very rare here, the SVA
said. The European Commission said that it would reconsider in the coming days
Sweden's exemption from BSE testing. Sweden currently has a special
dispensation from EU rules requiring all bovine animals slaughtered for food
to be tested.
"The likelihood is we'll have to take Sweden back in the testing regime," a
spokesman of the EU executive said.�
