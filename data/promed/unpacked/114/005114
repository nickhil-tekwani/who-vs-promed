The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which swept Korea [during 2015] underwent a mutation not found in the strains of MERs samples collected in Saudi Arabia, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Fri [8 Jan 2016].

The mutation may have affected the virulence of the virus as it has shown different patterns of spreading and infection in Korea from those in Saudi Arabia, such as an unusually fast human-to-human transmission.

While investigators suspected a mutation at the time of the epidemic, health authorities denied it.

This is the 1st official confirmation of the mutation.

"Spike glycoprotein genes of the MERs virus strains from South Korea were closely related to those of strains from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. However, the virus strains from South Korea showed strain-specific variations," chief author Kim Dae-won reported in a journal published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier [in January 2016].

Spike glycoprotein, found on the surface of a virus, is believed to play a critical role in virus proliferation in human cells. Researchers of the KCDC analyzed spike glycoprotein genes from samples of 8 patients here and compared them with those obtained in Saudi Arabia.

However, the research team said it cannot conclude that the mutation was responsible for the fast spread of infection, saying it needs more study.

A KCDC official said the center is conducting a separate test on MERS patients. "We're running gene sequencing on 32 patients, including 5 super spreaders. Today's finding is meaningful, but more research is needed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the mutation and its effects on the epidemic."

An anonymous professor at Catholic University lauded the team's findings. "Not fully, but this finding can hint at why the MERS virus spread so fast and killed so many people in Korea."

The virus infected 186 people and killed 36 in the span of 2 months, with another 2 dying later. On 23 Dec 2015, the government officially declared Korea to be free of the deadly respiratory disease.

1 of the 8 samples tested was that of the 1st patient, a 67-year-old man who contracted the virus during his trip to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for 2 weeks during April and May [2015].

He showed symptoms on 11 May [2015], but his case was confirmed to be MERs on 20 May [2015]. In between, he visited several hospitals, infecting his family members, other patients and their families.

Conclusions:
Accurate genome sequencing can identify spatiotemporal patterns that help understand dynamics of rapid spread of MERS-CoV infection. We report S glycoprotein gene sequences of MERS-CoV from 8 patients and a strain cultured in Vero cells. Genetic information obtained is useful for understanding the evolutionary history of MERS-CoV.

On the basis of our phylogenetic analyses, virus sequences of strains isolated in South Korea in 2015 form a unique clade. Genetic variations elucidated in this study show an unreported sequence in the RBD, which suggests that MERS-CoV circulating in South Korea during the outbreak in 2015 has higher genetic variability and mutation rates. However, we cannot conclude that deleterious effects promoting spread of infection will occur because of these mutations. Additional genetic information will resolve precise characteristics of the MERS-CoV obtained during the outbreak in South Korea.

[It is not at all clear that the mutations observed in the MERS viral genome are responsible for the rapid spread of the virus in Korea, but it is important to conduct research to determine whether they allow for more efficient transmission, greater infectiousness, improved ability to evade immune response, or other possible biologic consequences. Certainly environmental factors and behavioral factors must be taken into account, especially considering MERS is an RNA virus which mutates rapidly.
