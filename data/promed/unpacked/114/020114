Biosecurity Queensland says the rest of the country is likely to adopt whatever protocol Queensland devises to manage Australian bat lyssavirus outbreaks in horses.

It's believed 2 horses on a property near Allora in Southern Queensland contracted the bat-borne virus and had to be put down earlier this month [May 2013]. Very small bats, known as microbats, have since been found on the property, and testing has confirmed that the virus in an infected horse was most likely from a species of microbat, not flying foxes.

Queensland's chief biosecurity officer Jim Thompson says that because this is believed to be the 1st time lyssavirus has been found in horses, interstate authorities will pay close attention to Queensland's response. "Whatever protocols we put in place will be national protocols and will only be changed as further information comes to light. This is very similar to how we've worked with Hendra virus over the years. We almost developed the Hendra virus rules and regulations for the country because we've had most of the cases."

Chief veterinarians from across Australia have had a meeting to discuss how to manage the outbreak. As a result, the property will remain under quarantine and vets will continue to work to determine exactly what type of virus this is and whether other animals on the property need to be vaccinated.

"Once we've taken those sorts of actions, we may well be in a position to lift the quarantine, even if the high risk horse remains isolated for a longer period of time for observation."

[Microbats are not necessarily small, as they often range from 4-16 cm (1.6-6.3 inches) in length. They may be insect or fruit bats, and vampire bats are often in this category. The biosecurity folks likely have some sort of provision for observation of bats in the area. [Vampire bats do not occur in Australia].
