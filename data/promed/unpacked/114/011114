Officials from the Kaohsiung City Department of Health warned the
public yesterday [4 Jan 2008] to remain on guard against enterovirus
even during the winter -- a time when the highly contagious virus is
usually less prevalent.
The officials urged the public to improve personal hygiene and wash
their hands often to keep enterovirus away all year round. They made
the call in the wake of a report of a death from [human] enterovirus
type 71 (E71) infection in Kaohsiung on 27 Dec 2007. The case was
confirmed as the 6th E71 infection in Taiwan in 2007, and the only
one resulting in death.
The case involved an 18-month-old boy who came down with a fever,
vomiting and hand-foot-mouth syndrome on 24 Dec 2007 and was
hospitalized on 26 Dec 2007 after developing other symptoms,
including twitching and a rash. The child died the next day of
pulmonary edema and respiratory failure -- complications caused by
the infection, said Chang Hung-tai, emergency room director at
Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital.
The deceased child's 4-year-old older sister also came down with a
fever, vomiting, and hand-foot-mouth syndrome on 26 Dec 2007, Chang
said. After she was hospitalized in intensive care on 27 Dec 2007,
her condition stabilized, he said.
Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can
be serious, especially in infants. An E71 outbreak in 2005 infected
145 children and killed 15.

[The hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) syndrome commonly observed in
infants and young chidden can be caused by several enteric viruses.
Human enterovirus 71 and human coxsackievirus A16 are the most
frequent pathogens. Human enterovirus 71 infections, however, tend to
have more severe outcomes and have been associated with cases of
acute neurologic disease including poliomyelitis-like paralysis,
encephalitis, and aseptic meningitis. hand-foot-mouth disease occurs
worldwide, but causes greatest concern in Southeast Asia and the Far
East. It is unclear whether this is due to the prevalence of more
virulent enteroviruses or to lower standards of hygiene.
(Hand-foot-mouth disease in children is unrelated to the
foot-and-mouth disease of ruminants). The diversity of enteroviruses
associated with hand-foot-mouth disease has precluded the development
of vaccines to control this disease.
