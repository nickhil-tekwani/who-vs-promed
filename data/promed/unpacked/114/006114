Bacteria linked to contaminated peanut butter that has sickened hundreds of
people has been traced to a plant owned by ConAgra Foods Inc., where it was
made, USA health regulators said on Thu 1 Mar 2007. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) said it discovered the salmonella bacteria during an
extensive inspection of the plant in Sylvester, Georgia, where Peter Pan
peanut butter was made. The plant has been closed since 16 Feb 2007.
"The fact that FDA found salmonella in the plant environment further
suggests that the contamination likely took place prior to the product
reaching consumers," the agency said. The bacterium found by the FDA in the
plant matched the outbreak strain from peanut butter samples recovered from
people who fell ill, the FDA said.
The agency also said ConAgra had sent Peter Pan peanut butter to its
Humboldt, Tennessee plant for use in ice cream and related toppings for
such brands as Carvel and Sonic. While those related products have already
been recalled, officials warned consumers they may still have some of the
products in their homes.

[This report documents the "smoking" plant, that the _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Tennessee has been found in the plant that produced the peanut
butter. The posting does not detail what in the plant yielded a positive
culture for the outbreak strain.
ProMED-mail continues to monitor the increasing numbers of cases in the USA
and awaits information regarding cases in other countries to where the
product was exported.
The posting also reports that the outbreak-associated product may have been
used in the production of other products for use in "ice cream and related
toppings." No earlier FDA or CDC reports have clearly mentioned this.

plant in Sylvester can be found at:
