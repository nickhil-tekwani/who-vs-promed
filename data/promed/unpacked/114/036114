Pets travel scheme extended to USA and Canada
---------------------------------------------
The successful PETS Travel Scheme is to be extended to dogs and cats from
the United States and Canada, Animal Health Minister Elliot Morley
announced today.
Starting 11 Dec 2002, people coming to this country from the USA and Canada
will be able to bring their vaccinated pets without having to put them into
six months quarantine. However, until an approved route from North America
is available and official certification agreed, animals will have to go
into short stay quarantine, usually only for 2 to 3 days, whilst the
microchip and paperwork are checked.
Announcing the extension to North America, Elliot Morley said: "I am proud
to be associated with the Pet Travel Scheme. Since we introduced the Scheme
in February 2000 over 75 000 dogs and cats from Europe and rabies-free
islands have used the Scheme to enter the UK without having to go into 6
months quarantine. When we introduced the Scheme we recognised that there
was significant demand from people in the USA and Canada, and indeed UK
travellers, for those 2 countries to be included in the Scheme. We were
cautious about doing so, but did undertake to consider again whether or not
to include these countries in the Scheme. We have now done this. We have
carried out several scientific assessments of the risk of importing rabies
if the Pet Travel Scheme was extended to USA and Canada. Both these
assessments concluded that the risk of importing rabies into the UK by
extending the Pet Travel Scheme to the USA and Canada was low. I know that
some people feel that we have been too cautious in our approach to
including the USA and Canada in our Pet Travel Scheme. But we were not
prepared to take such a significant step until we were sure, on a sound
scientific basis, that there would be no significant increase in the risks
of importing rabies if the Scheme was extended to those countries. We now
have this assurance and I am therefore very pleased to announce that the
Government has decided to extend the Pet Travel Scheme to USA and
Canada. Because of the many close links between our countries many people
in the USA and Canada have the opportunity to come and live and work in the
UK. But some refuse because they cannot bear to be separated from their
cats or dogs for the 6 months they must stay in quarantine. I am delighted
to say that the legislation giving effect to this change has been laid
before Parliament today and will come into force on Wed 11 Dec 2002. From
that date, dogs and cats from the USA and Canada which meet the
requirements of the Pet Travel Scheme will be able to enter the UK without
going into quarantine for 6 months. I would also like to take this
opportunity to stress that all the conditions applying to the Pet Travel
Scheme must be complied with if an animal is to avoid 6 months quarantine.
We have prepared explanatory leaflets for pet owners and US and Canadian
vets. These are available from my Department and are on our Website."
Discussions with airlines for approval of routes into England and with the
authorities in the USA and Canada about appropriate certification to
accompany such animals continue. Until these are in place, qualifying
animals will have to go into quarantine for a few days until it is
confirmed that they do meet fully the requirements of the Pet Travel
Scheme. If they do then they will be released from quarantine as quickly as
possible.
The UK has been free from rabies for many years and wishes to remain so.
The Pet Travel Scheme rules are strictly applied; it is the responsibility
of the pet owner to make sure their animal meets all the conditions of the
Scheme and that the owner has all the documentation to prove this.
Travellers from the USA and Canada must bring their documentation with them.
In the UK and Europe most microchips and scanners comply with ISO
Standards. The USA and Canada have different microchips. Owners of animals
identified with non-ISO microchips may experience some difficulties in
demonstrating that their animal has been microchipped. Such owners are
advised to provide their own scanner.
NOTES TO EDITORS
1. The Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) was launched on 28 Feb 2000. For the first
year it applied only to dogs and cats from Western Europe. On 31 Jan 2001,
it was extended to 28 long haul countries, such as Australia, Japan and New
Zealand. Bahrain was added to the Scheme earlier this year.
2. To date, some 75 000 dogs and cats have entered England under the Scheme
without the need for quarantine. The Scheme operates into England on over
50 sea, air and rail routes from around Europe and the rest of the world.
3. Early next year we expect the European Union to formally adopt a
Regulation covering the animal health requirements applicable to
non-commercial movements of pet animals. That Regulation allows the UK's
Pet Travel Scheme to continue almost unchanged for at least 5 years before
a review of the Community system takes place. That Regulation will lay down
how animals coming into the Community, including the UK, will be treated.
Such decisions will be taken by the Community as a whole and not by
individual member states. In the meantime, the Government will not be
making any significant extensions to the qualifying countries under the Pet
Travel Scheme.
4. The scientific risk assessments on the risk of importing rabies from the
USA and Canada and the report on the risk of other diseases will be
published on the Defra website shortly.

Vets alarmed by quarantine rule change for US pets
--------------------------------------------------
Vets warned yesterday of "serious disease implications" after the
Government said dogs and cats from America and Canada vaccinated against
rabies will soon be allowed into Britain without 6 months' quarantine.
Elliot Morley, the animal health minister, announced that pets with
appropriate documentation (veterinary certificates, microchips, and
last-minute de-worming treatment) can enter Britain starting 11 Dec 2002.

[The new UK step seems a logical step forward and in line with similar
policy in other rabies-free countries -- without "serious disease
implications". The risk assessment that has led to the new decision is not
yet available on Defra's web-site. - Mod.AS]
