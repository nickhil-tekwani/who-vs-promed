[1] Case update
- Sat 3 Nov 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=baaa79a3de

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 2 Nov 2018:
- A total of 293 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 258 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 258 confirmed, 147 died and 81 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 50 suspected cases under investigation.
- 6 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Beni and 3 in Butembo.
- 1 new death confirmed in Butembo.

Remarks
-------
- To avoid that the total number of cases varies (up or down) daily, the suspect cases have been placed in a separate category. Thus, suspect cases with positive laboratory tests will be added to the confirmed category, while negative ones (non-cases) will be removed from the table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation. The investigations will determine if these deaths are related to the epidemic or not.
- A community death is a death in the community, outside of a licensed health center.

News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 25 845 people have been vaccinated, including 13 655 in Beni [North Kivu], 4436 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2062 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1355 in Butembo [North Kivu], 690 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 387 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 178 in Oicha [North Kivu], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], 130 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], and 100 in Mutwanga [North Kivu].

[New cases from Beni and Butembo], health workers to be vaccinated in Uganda
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The new illnesses reported raise the outbreak total to 293 cases, including 258 confirmed and 35 probable infections.]

The number of vaccinated people has reached [25 845], roughly half of them from Beni. Today's [update] said 130 of them are from Vuhovi, a newly affected health zone [in North Kivu].

In neighboring Uganda, a vaccination campaign will begin on 5 Nov 2018 to vaccinate frontline health workers, health officials announced today [2 Nov 2018]. Ainebyoona Emmanuel, public relations officer with Uganda's health ministry, said on Twitter today that the vaccine campaign will focus on high-risk districts and that the country has 2100 doses on hand to vaccinate health workers.

A need to reassess the response approach
----------------------------------------
Two global health experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), based in Washington, DC, said the outbreak response got off to a promising start but complex security issues and a lack of trust threaten to expand the outbreak to the regional and perhaps even global level. The experts include J Stephen Morrison, PhD, senior vice president and director of CSIS' Global Health Policy Center and Judd Devermont, who direct the group's Africa program.

In a report posted in the CSIS website, the 2 said 90 days into the outbreak, there's a need to reassess the approach. They said mobilization by the DRC and international groups has been quick and laudable, and financial support hasn't been a serious constraint. Other positives include the availability of a vaccine and the use of experimental treatments.

Debilitating setbacks amid attacks and mistrust
-----------------------------------------------
However, the attacks, mainly by Allied Democratic Forces [ADF] against the DRC military, have had a "concussive impact" on the response. Morrison and Devermont say there have also been local attacks by eastern Congo's armed, community-based Mai-Mai militias. "As long as ADF and other attacks continue, the response effort will remain vulnerable to debilitating setbacks," they wrote.

The DRC's federal government hasn't gained effective control or legitimacy in the east of the country where the outbreak is occurring, and presidential, regional, and legislative elections slated for 23 Dec 2018 could worsen tensions and raise the odds of bringing the outbreak under control, according to the report.

Government repression and lack of an effective international effort to protect citizens from violent groups have made residents of the outbreak areas suspicious, with some viewing the United Nations security forces as complicit in the massacres and nongovernmental organizations just there to make money, they said.

The 2 also voiced concerns about recent US policy, which has seen personnel shifts that have downgraded global health security at the White House and kept seasoned US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expertise mainly on the sidelines due to security concerns.

Over the last 2 months, debate within the US government hasn't settled on a policy approach, which would include setting security preconditions for redeploying US personnel to the area around Beni, Morrison, and Devermont wrote.

Senior US officials have signaled that stemming the outbreak could take a year or longer and that fears of an expanding outbreak are growing among experts, they said.

New questions and possible ways forward
---------------------------------------
The developments pose new questions, such as whether a different level of security thinking is needed given the active war-zone setting and if the worrying developments matter to the major world powers, given the rise of open skepticism of multilateralism.

According to the authors, plans are reportedly in the works for a high-level mission that might focus talks on the role of United Nations peacekeepers and others.

One option, they said, might be to protect the area against major attacks with the Force Intervention Brigade, part of the UN peacekeeping unit that has had success in the past neutralizing armed groups in the area.

They also suggested expanding deployment and support for DRC public health experts, many of whom were trained by the CDC. Also, they note that a few US steps could help buoy the international response, such as affirming the country's commitment to ending the outbreak, defining how many experts are needed in the outbreak epicenter, and assessing how to keep a small US contingent secure, which could include embedding US security personnel with UN peacekeeping forces.

"Progress along all of these far-flung fronts will be difficult, but practical solutions still lie within reach," Morrison and Devermont wrote.

[It is dismaying to read the prediction that the outbreak is likely to extend into another year. The unrest and community resistance are facilitating the virus' ability to spread. It is difficult to imagine it being able to be contained in the DRC for another year. It only takes a single infected individual to start a new transmission chain that may carry the virus across country borders. For that reason, vaccination of Ugandan health care workers is a good proactive protective measure, as is heightened security in Zambia -- see below.

The spread of Ebola virus in a war zone raises difficult questions regarding multinational efforts to contain a potentially widespread outbreak. Ebola is not the only infectious disease in a dangerous location, thus this dilemma calls for serious discussion. - Mod.LK

Zambia heightens its capacity for preventing and responding to the threat of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Zambia has been classified by the World Health Organisation to be at very high risk of importation of cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) from the ongoing epidemic of the disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to the heightened transmission of the virus in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The WHO Regional Office for Africa is therefore supporting the 10 countries bordering the DRC to heighten vigilance by strengthening capacity for preventing, detecting, investigating and responding quickly to potential Ebola threats. This is in line with the WHO Regional Strategic Plan for EVD operational preparedness and readiness in countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo for June 2018-February 2019.

At the invitation of the Ministry of Health, the WHO Regional Office, and the WHO Country Office Health Emergencies [WHO Health Emergencies Programme/WHE] clusters are supporting the country to train a multi-disciplinary team of trainers of Rapid Response Teams [RRT]. The training which is taking place in Livingstone 29 Oct-2 Nov 2018 is aimed at imparting knowledge and skills necessary to carry out emergency preparedness and response activities for any potential Ebola virus disease outbreak.

The participants who are from the Ministry of Health central level and Lusaka province will provide leadership in EVD preparedness activities including cascading the training to other levels to build country capacity including the community. The RRT training covers eight key areas which include: strengthening the multisectoral coordination; surveillance for early detection; laboratory diagnostic capacity; points of entry; rapid response teams; risk communication & social mobilization and community engagement; case management and infection prevention and control capacities; and operations support and logistics.

Speaking at the opening of the workshop, the Minister of Health, Dr Chitalu Chilufya said that Government considered health as a key investment because a healthy nation was an important prerequisite for the economic development of the country. He stated that government was also committed to enhancing national health security and therefore laid emphasis on building a resilient health system and moving towards universal health coverage through the primary health care approach.

"We cannot achieve universal health coverage without health security" the Minister said. He added that the training of the RRTs in Zambia was a fundamental investment for Zambia and that the country was keen to have the teams deployed to other countries to support response activities. Dr Chitalu recognised the important role that WHO was playing in supporting government to strengthen preparedness and response capacities for EVD and other health emergencies.
