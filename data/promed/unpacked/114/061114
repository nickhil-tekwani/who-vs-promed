[Tire (also called Tirah, Et Tira, Tira) is situated in Israel's Central district ("Mehoz HaMerkaz"), adjacent to the separation ("Green") line between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (West Bank). The location is given in the interactive map at the source URL.

This outbreak has already been reported in posting 20140116.2177975, which included a request for information on the serotyping and genotyping of the causative agent. The serotype is now given as FMDV O. According to the website of the WRLFMD (Pirbright), 6 samples from Israel, for genotyping, have been received there on 24 Jan 2014 (batch no. WRLFMD/2014/00001). They have probably already been sequenced, but the publication of the results are "pending" (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm). The genotyping results may be helpful in assessing the epidemiology of the current epizootic, checking if the January 2014 outbreaks have been caused by the same FMDV strain detected in November 2013, namely topotype ME-SA, genotype PanAsia-2 FAR09. - Mod.AS]
