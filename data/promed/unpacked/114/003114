Seed potato growers will need to start their insecticide applications
earlier and put together more comprehensive programmes to tackle an
increasing threat of virus transmission by aphids, according to leading
Scottish advisor, Stuart Wale of SAC [Scottish Agricultural College]. He
said that some of the non-persistent viruses -- such as _Potato virus A_ --
are appearing early in the season. "We have witnessed an unexpected
increase in virus levels, even before aphids conventionally associated with
virus spread have been caught in monitoring traps."
Dr Wale advised growers that they will have to revise the practice of
waiting for aphid warnings to be issued, or treating when there are signs
of them building up in the crop. "The suggestion is that it is
non-colonising aphids, such as cereal aphids, migrating through the potato
crop that are feeding on plants and transmitting the viruses," he said.
"The changing physiology of virus transmission suggests that growers will
need to start programmes as soon as the crop has emerged this season."
He acknowledged this may mean growers have to spray more often over the
season, but that high grade seed producers have to err on the side of
caution -- especially on varieties susceptible to virus A. "Tolerance of
virus infection in Scottish seed is among the lowest in the world. The
incidences we have seen are extremely low, but do give cause for concern.
Growers must act now, to prevent any escalation."
He believes new insecticides available will allow the more comprehensive
approach without risking resistance development. Dr Wale advocates that
fast aphid knockdown is a key element in preventing virus transmission,
along with the potential of residual activity and repellency to stop aphids
landing and feeding on the crop.

[_Potato virus A_ (PVA, also called potato mild mosaic virus, potato virus
P; genus _Potyvirus_) infects only potatoes. It is one of the most
widespread potato viruses and is found in most potato growing areas. Leaf
symptoms include mild mosaic, slight crinkling, and a rough surface
("rugose") with sunken veins and raised interveinal areas. Affected plants
tend to open up because the stems bend outward, and tuber size may be
decreased. Severity of symptom expression depends on weather conditions,
the potato cultivar, and the strain of PVA. In plants infected with certain
strains of _Potato virus X_ or _Potato virus Y_, co-infection with PVA may
lead to a synergistic (symbiotically enhanced) increase in symptom severity.
PVA is spread in infected plant material (including tubers) and by vector
aphids in a non-persistent manner. While the virus survives only a few
minutes in the aphid, if a virus-carrying aphid probes a potato plant,
infection is instantaneous. Potato tubers are probably the primary
overwintering reservoir of PVA. Disease management of PVA (and other
aphid-transmitted potato viruses) includes the use of disease-free seed
tubers, insecticides for vector control, and resistant varieties.
Additional PVA susceptible varieties exhibiting a hypersensitive response
(necrosis of virus-infected tissue resulting in pathogen elimination) under
field conditions can also be used.
Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato, and a number of them
can be spread by aphids. In addition, since the crop is vegetatively
propagated, many pathogens including viruses such as _Potato leafroll
virus_, _Potato virus X_ and _Potato virus Y_, as well as _Potato spindle
tuber viroid_ are disseminated in tubers. Some viruses, like PVA, may only
have a minor effect on yield if they are the only infecting virus species
and if a crop is newly infected in the field. However, if virus-infected
seed tubers are used, the virus population will gradually build up during
every crop cycle, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic)
virus species and in amounts of infectious units per species. This
invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in
yield. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is
recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production
in many countries worldwide.
