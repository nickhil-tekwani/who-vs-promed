Measles outbreak fears after 4th Sydney case in 3 weeks
-------------------------------------------------------
Measles is one of the world's leading causes of death in children. It is rare in Australia, however. There have been 4 reported cases in Sydney [New South Wales] in the past 3 weeks. The virus is extremely contagious and can be transmitted just by being in the same room as someone who has it.

The 4 cases in Sydney were people who had spent significant time in the metropolitan area and the most recent patient, a male in his 20s, had spent time on public transport in the city's inner-west. He was known to one of the earlier patients and had also visited shops and eateries at Leichardt, Pyrmont and Neutral Bay on 23 and 24 Dec [2016].

"It's one of the most contagious diseases. Fortunately most people are immunised," said NSW Health's acting director of communicable diseases, Dr Sean Tobin. "If you are susceptible -- that is you have not been vaccinated -- the chances are very high that you will become infected. "One case is an outbreak. It's not a virus that normally spreads in our community. It is concerning."

A NSW Health spokesman said the disease could take 2 weeks to incubate and it was "highly possible" there would be more cases. "Given we've got 4 cases in the last 3 weeks it's highly possible there could be more given the mobility of the disease," he said.

Dr Tobin said people who were exposed to the measles patients would likely be showing symptoms of the virus if they had been infected. They include fever, a cough and sore eyes and then a rash breaks out about 3 or 4 days later. "Now is the time those people might be unwell and might not realise they've got measles," Dr Tobin said.

He urged people to get vaccinated against the virus which can have serious complications. "If you develop the symptoms of measles, seek medical advice, but make sure that you call ahead to your doctor or hospital emergency department so that you can be isolated from others to minimise the risk of infection," he said.

"The measles virus is highly contagious and is spread through the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease." There is no specific treatment for measles, which is uncommon in Australia but remains one of the leading causes of death among children overseas.

According to the World Health Organisation, 134 200 people died from the virus last year [2015].

Measles warning for Sydney after infectious passenger arrives
-------------------------------------------------------------
Measles' symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash.

Sydney residents are being urged to watch for symptoms of measles after an infected passenger arrived in the city from a flight from Bali [Indonesia] on New Year's Day [1 Jan 2017]. NSW [New South Wales] Health said the young woman arrived in Sydney on Virgin Australia Airlines flight VA 70 from Denpasar, Bali about 7.40am.

While still infectious, she visited Sutherland Hospital's emergency department on 4 Jan [2017]. There is a chance she may have exposed people to the disease during her stay here, but the case is not linked to the cluster of measles cases in Sydney last month [December 2016]. - ... more

[Because of the highly contagious nature of measles, even though the disease is rare in Australia, introduction from outside the country to unvaccinated individuals always presents a threat. And once in the country, the virus has the potential to spread rapidly. Thus it is important to maintain immunization by vaccination of children with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. See previous posts for discussion of MMR vaccine.

City in Western Romania sees serious measles outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------
The representatives of the Timisoara Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Victor Babes', in Western Romania [Timis County], expect the measles outbreak in that region to get worse. Some 124 children with measles were admitted into the hospital in December [2016], and in the 1st 3 days of the year [2017], another 30 new patients were let in. The youngest is only 6 weeks old, reports local Agerpres. In 2016, the hospital treated 364 measles cases.

The measles vaccine was previously done at the age of 13 months, but the Health Ministry changed the protocol and the vaccine is now carried out at 11 months.

Romania registered an alarming increase in the number of measles cases in 2016 compared to 2015, and several patients died due to this disease. "Compared to 2015, the increase is more than alarming. Last year [2015] there were only 7 confirmed cases of measles and none of them resulted in death," the Ministry of Health representatives said in a Facebook post from September [2016].

The measles outbreak is related to a higher number of parents who have refused to vaccinate their children against this disease in recent years. The Health Ministry started a campaign to promote vaccination at the end of last year [2016].

[As has been stated repeatedly in previous posts, the MMR vaccine is safe and efficacious. It can't be overstated how important it is to vaccinate children to maintain a high level of immunity in the population.

http://www.edhat.com/site/tidbit.cfm?nid=179671


On Thu 29 Dec 2016 a case of measles was confirmed in Santa Barbara [California]. The only exposures the patient had in Santa Barbara took place the evening of Tue 27 Dec 2016 as stated in a prior press release [see http://www.edhat.com/site/tidbit.cfm?nid=179488]. Because of the highly contagious nature of this air-borne virus, and the fact that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine must be given within 72 hours of exposure to prevent disease in vulnerable contacts, public health staff worked quickly.

On Fri 30 Dec [2016] the Public Health Department activated our Department Operations Center (DOC) with more than 20 employees working to identify contacts and administer the MMR vaccine within the 72 hour deadline. A total of 45 contacts to the patient were identified and assessed for their immunization and health status. 10 MMR vaccines were administered at the DOC. One person was placed in quarantine.

Because the incubation period for the measles virus is 21 days, all 45 contacts will continue to be monitored by Disease Control until [17 Jan 2017]. The DOC remains functional until that date and plans are in place should a 2nd measles case develop. "We train for situations like this and move quickly when they happen," said Dr. Charity Dean, Health Officer. "Protecting the vulnerable in our community is top priority."

Measles is a serious disease and can cause encephalitis, pneumonia, and even death. The outcomes are particularly serious for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, it is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected annually. Each year an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 4000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from measles.

[See ProMED-mail post Measles update (01): USA (CA), Sudan (SK) 20170103.4740174, which discusses the spread to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles (California, USA). It only takes one infected individual to come into contact with unvaccinated, non-immune individuals, to start spread of measles virus in a community. This places children, especially those with underlying health conditions, at serious risk.
