Last summer (2018), a Kankakee County resident tested positive for Heartland virus, the 1st case reported in Illinois (see ProMED-mail archive Heartland virus - USA: (IL) 20180922.6045362). In response to this human case, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) collaborated with the Illinois Natural History Survey Medical Entomology Laboratory (INHS MEL) and Kankakee County Health Department to conduct the 1st environmental health investigation to a novel tickborne disease case. Ticks were collected from the area and sent to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for Heartland virus testing. Heartland virus was detected in Lone Star ticks collected from Kankakee County.

"Bites from Ticks can result in multiple types of infections, which can cause serious illness in some people," said IDPH director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. "It is important to take precautions and protect yourself from tick bites by using insect repellent and checking regularly for ticks when in wooded areas or high grass."

Heartland virus was 1st identified in 2009 when 2 Missouri farmers who had been bitten by ticks were admitted to a hospital. Heartland virus is a viral disease that can be spread to people through the bite of an infected Lone Star tick. Reported cases of Heartland virus disease are relatively rare; however, almost all individuals with Heartland virus have been hospitalized. Although most people infected have fully recovered, a few have died. There are no vaccines to prevent Heartland virus infections.

Signs and symptoms of infection are similar to those of other tickborne diseases and can include fever, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and diarrhea. Most people have reported becoming sick about 2 weeks after being bit by a tick. And while there is no treatment, doctors can treat some of the symptoms. If you have been bitten by a tick and think you may have Heartland virus or another tickborne illness, visit a healthcare provider. Other tickborne illnesses Illinois residents have been diagnosed with include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and tularemia. Healthcare providers should consider Heartland virus in patients who have compatible symptoms and are not responding to other treatments.

Ticks are commonly found on the tips of grasses and shrubs. Lone Star ticks are found throughout Illinois. Ticks crawl; they cannot fly or jump. The tick will wait on the grass or shrub for a person or animal to walk by and then quickly climb aboard. Some ticks will attach quickly, and others will wander, looking for places like the ear or other areas where the skin is thinner.

Simple tips to avoid tick bites include the following:
- Wear light-colored, protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, boots or sturdy shoes, and a head covering. Treat clothing with products containing 0.5% permethrin.
- Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE). For assistance selecting the appropriate insect repellent, see EPA's helpful search tool.
- Walk in the center of trails so grass, shrubs, and weeds do not brush against you.
- Check yourself, children, other family members, and pets for ticks every 2-3 hours.
- Remove any tick promptly by grasping it with tweezers, as close to the skin as possible, and gently, but firmly, pulling it straight out. Wash your hands and the tick bite site with soap and water.

Additional information about ticks can be found on the IDPH website. A map of the geographical location of Heartland virus cases is also available on the CDC website.

[The case of Heartland virus infection last year (2018) added Illinois to the list of states where the infection has occurred. Now, infected Lone Star ticks have been found in Illinois. The report does not indicate if the infected ticks were collected in a single or in multiple localities. Finding infected ticks in Illinois is not surprising, as neighboring states of Missouri and Indiana have had cases. People become infected with Heartland virus through the bite of the Lone Star tick [_Amblyomma americanum_]. Patients are most likely to be diagnosed with Heartland virus infections from May to September. Heartland virus causes a flulike illness, including fever, headache, muscle aches, diarrhea, appetite loss, and tiredness. The advice for avoidance of tick bites listed above is prudent, not only to avoid Heartland virus infections but other tickborne pathogens as well.

As noted previously, a variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found signs that Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes, and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 animals were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose. Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18% of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties. These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response.
