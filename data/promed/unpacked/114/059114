[African Horse Sickness can be a devastating disease and it did kill
the horse reported here. If horses are not either properly
vaccinated or previously exposed, mortality can reach 90
percent. There were 51 horses involved in the 2004 outbreak in
Swaziland and over 500 involved in a 2-week period in Kwazulu Natal,
South Africa in April 2005. - Mod.PC]
