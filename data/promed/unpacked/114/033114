["Leishmaniasis is an important complex of protozoal vectorborne diseases that affects both humans and animals. It can be caused by many species of _Leishmania_. A few of these organisms are primarily maintained in humans, but most circulate mainly in animals. Most of the latter organisms are zoonotic. Leishmaniasis is transmitted by sandflies and can be difficult to prevent, and some of the drugs used for treatment have significant side effects or limited availability outside endemic regions.

"In humans, leishmaniasis has 3 general forms -- cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral -- and different species of _Leishmania_ tend to cause each type. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a form that typically remains limited to the skin, can be caused by numerous organisms. A few species of _Leishmania_ regularly affect the mucous membranes, as well as the skin. Both cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis may result in disfigurement, but mucosal involvement is generally more serious. Two organisms, _L. donovani_ and_ L. infantum_, cause most cases of visceral leishmaniasis, the most serious form. Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by damage to the internal organs, and fully symptomatic cases are considered life-threatening.

"Leishmania can also cause skin and mucosal lesions and/or visceral signs in animals. Most species of _Leishmania_ are maintained in wildlife, often without clinical signs, but dogs are an important reservoir host for _L. infantum_. Dogs are also the domesticated animal most often affected by leishmaniasis. Clinical cases in this species can be life-threatening and may be difficult to treat. Cases of leishmaniasis are also seen occasionally in guinea pigs, cats, equids, and captive or free-living wild species. Ruminant livestock are rarely affected". (Source: Spickler AR.
