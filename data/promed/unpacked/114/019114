Ghana's acting Director of medical Services, Albert Asamoah-Baah, has
reported that sporadic outbreaks of bacterial meningitis [presumed to be of
meningococcal etiology -ES are occurring now that hot and dry weather
conditions prevail in northern Ghana. He indicated that, historically,
such outbreaks have been common during such weather patterns, especially in
the northern regions.
This year the disease seems to be reaching farther into southern Ghana with
eight deaths reported in the Aflao area near the Togo border. Last year
there was a serious problem with bacterial meningitis in the northern,
upper eastern, and upper western parts of Ghana resulting in many deaths.
Ministry officials report that medical supplies are adequate. Tourists
visiting Burkina Faso for the African Nations Cup Tournament should
consider vaccination for [meningococcal meningitis and also for yellow fever.
