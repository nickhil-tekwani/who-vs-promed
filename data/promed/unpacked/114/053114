Probe as 1000 fish die in brook
--------------------------------
The cause of the death of nearly 1000 young salmon and trout fry in a
tributary of the River Wye in Powys is being investigated. A 600m
[656-yard] stretch of the Rhyd Hir brook is affected on the outskirts
of Rhayader.

Environment Agency Wales officers have collected samples of the dead
fish and sent them to a laboratory for a post mortem examination.
Water samples have also been taken and sent for analysis. No impact
has been detected on the main river.

A spokesman for the agency said initial survey results suggest the
invertebrate species on which the fish feed have largely been unaffected.

[This is affecting different species in a different river system a
long way from the May die-off of rudd, roach & chub in the river Ely,
in south Wales, reported in the ProMED archive below. We have not yet
heard whether the cause of that was ever identified. - Mod.JW.

Results of the field and laboratory investigations will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
