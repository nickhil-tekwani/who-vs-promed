["Avian infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a respiratory disease caused by Gallid herpesvirus 1, an alphaherpesvirus. It is principally a disease of chickens, although it can also affect pheasants, partridges and peafowl. The clinical signs and observed pathology reactions may vary from extremely severe, with some birds dying from asphyxiation, to very mild, indistinguishable from other mild respiratory diseases of chickens. The principal lesion is tracheitis. In infected birds, the virus can become latent and re-excreted at a later date without clinical signs."

"There is no known risk of human infection with ILTV" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual, Chapter 3.3.3 Avian infectious laryngotracheitis https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf). - Mod.CRD
