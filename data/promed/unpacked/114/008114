Correction: In Italy Healthy Cattle Tested at 24 months, not 30 months
---------------------------------------------------
In the ProMED-mail post entitled "Bovine amyloidotic spongiform
encephalopathy - Italy 20040218.0525", it was stated by the Moderator that
the atypical prion was discovered only because Italy tests all cattle over
30 months old slaughtered for human food.
Italy tests all cattle over 24 months old -- not 30 -- slaughtered for
human food or fallen stock. Italy modified the application of Regulation
(EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May
2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control, and eradication of
certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (amended by Regulation
(EC) No 1248/2001 of 22 Jun 2001), with Law-Decree No. 344 of 4 Sep 2001,
in which the age for testing healthy cattle, including buffalo and bison
slaughtered for human consumption, was lowered to 24 months. Examination of
dead animals not slaughtered for human consumption, having died on the farm
or during transport (fallen-stock), [like examination of] animals subject
to "special emergency slaughtering", was already established at 24 months
by EC Regulation.
