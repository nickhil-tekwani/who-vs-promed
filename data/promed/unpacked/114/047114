There have been 21 deaths in EU/EEA countries reported in the following countries: Italy (15), Greece (5), and Romania (1). From EU-neighbouring countries, Serbia reported 81 cases, of which 6 have died.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, 19 outbreaks among equids and 99 outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries. Outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (16), Hungary (2), and France (1). Outbreaks among birds have been reported by Italy (98) and Germany (1). (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/west-nile-virus-europe-2022-infections-among-humans-and-outbreaks-among-equids-6; updated 26 Aug 2022). - Mod.CRD

The presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Europe was first recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in Southern countries. In general, WNV circulates silently in resident and migratory birds present in Europe, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and some avian hosts over a long period (Gould et al. 2006 EID 12: 549-555). However, there are sporadic outbreaks or isolated cases in native bird species. - Mod.PMB
