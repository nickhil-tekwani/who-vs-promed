Or to immunise them. Rather more certain and practical given the
miniscule bacterial loading required to cause the disease.

This may be a tall order. The result, in any case would inevitably be a
HUGE increase in on-farm antibiotic use, which would have bad knock on
effects. Currently beef cattle probably never get a dose of antibiotic
in their lives. Dairy cows might well average under one in their lives
with the exception of annual dry cow therapy (intra-mammary infusion
when the a lactation ceases). To eradicate a common coliform species
would require this to be massively increased. You would probably end up
with nothing more than an antibiotic resistant strain of EC O157 in any case.

Given the <100 bacteria that are enough to cause infection, these would
have to be literally clinical to have significant effect, although I
agree with the sentiment.
