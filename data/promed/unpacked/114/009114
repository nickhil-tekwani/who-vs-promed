[This is now the 19th consecutive day with no new cases reported from South Korea. As mentioned in yesterday's update (MERS-CoV (93): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150722.3526694), it is tempting to say that once all known contacts have finished their monitoring period without developing symptoms, there are no longer individuals at risk, forgetting the qualifier "all known" contacts. It is possible that some contacts were missed and might still be out there.

As of 12 noon today [22 Jul 2015], there have been a total of:
1051 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
464 deaths,
581 recoveries, and
6 currently active cases.

In the past 24 hours there have been
2 newly confirmed cases,
2 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery

[Reported case fatality rate: 44.1 percent]

Information on newly reported cases:
- A 60-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Rania-Altaif reported to be in stable condition. No history of contact with known cases in either the healthcare environment or the community.

- A 56-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh reported to be in critical condition. No history of contact with known cases in either the healthcare environment or the community.

Information on newly reported fatalities:
- A 69-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Alhafuf (Hufoof) with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [was reported as a newly confirmed case on 15 Jun 2015 at which time was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of initial report, history of possible contact with other case(s) was under review.- Mod.MPP]

- A 67-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [As there were no newly reported cases from Riyadh that were 67-year-old males, it is highly likely that this case was the 76-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh who was initially reported as a laboratory confirmed case on 2 Jul 2015, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At the time of initial report there was no history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or the community. - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly reported recovery:
- A 93-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Al Hafuf (Hufoof) with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [was reported as a newly confirmed case on 16 Jul 2015 at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of initial report there was no history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or the community. - Mod.MPP]

[While this is considered the "low season" for MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia, transmission is continuing although at a reduced rate, albeit today's (22 Jul 2015) report is more active than recent times, with 2 newly confirmed cases and 2 newly reported fatalities. The cumulative total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported since June 2012 is 1051 including 464 deaths. The reported case fatality rate has been hovering at approximately 44 percent.

A map showing the locations of the newly reported cases, deaths, and recovery can be found at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3530233,131.

One of the newly confirmed cases is reported from Rania Altaif (Ranya), which is located in the eastern portion of Makkah province. According to Wikipedia, Ranya is a separate town and approximately 4 hours by car from Taif; nowhere could I find reference to a "Rania Altaif". - Mod.MPP]
