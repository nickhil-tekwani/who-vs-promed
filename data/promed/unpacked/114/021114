[While it is a bit discouraging to see 8 newly confirmed cases, 6 of the 8 were 3rd generation cases with exposures to other cases in the healthcare environment during the latter part of May 2015 before intensive control measures were implemented, one is a 4th generation case with exposure on 5 Jun 2015 and the 8th case is still pending further information. Two of the 8 newly confirmed cases are healthcare workers, one at the Gangdong Kyuna Hee University School of Medicine where case no.76 was presented during hospital Emergency room medical staff discussions, and the other a healthcare worker at the Samsung Hospital. Five of the 8 individuals were exposed at the Samsung hospital.

In total there have now been 8 (4.9 percent) 4th generation cases, 121 (73.8 percent) 3rd generation cases and 31 (19.1 percent) 2nd generation cases (and one case still pending classification).

Situation in Korea
Between [13 and 16 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 28 additional confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) alongside 8 additional deaths.

Additional information on the outbreak in Korea
To date, a total of 154 MERS-CoV cases, including 19 deaths, have been reported. One of the 154 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

The median age of the patients is 56 years old (ranging from 16 to 87 years old). The majority of cases are men (60 percent). 14 cases (9.3 percent) are health care professionals.

The joint Republic of Korea-WHO high level MERS-CoV mission confirmed that the virus is currently clustered around health facilities and found no evidence that it was circulating in the community.

Public health response
The government of the Republic of Korea has intensified cases and contacts management activities. As of [June 2015], 5586 contacts have been identified (5238 are under home monitoring and 348 under facility monitoring). These measures, which will likely reduce the occurrence of new cases in the coming weeks, should be maintained until the outbreak is over.

The government of the Republic of Korea is providing official information about MERS-CoV to both Korean and non-Korean speakers residing in the country. Information is provided through different communication channels, including educational campaigns, hotline telephone numbers, and government websites.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1321 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 466 related deaths.

[As mentioned above, as of today, 16 Jun 2015, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO is now at 1321, with at least 466 related deaths. This does include cases reported from Saudi Arabia reported through 12 Jun 2015, the newly reported case from the UAE [see WHO country specific reports below] and the newly confirmed cases reported by the Korean MOH this evening (GMT-4), hence, there have been an additional 4 cases and 4 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia on the Saudi MOH website and 8 additional cases reported by South Korea.

Of significance in the above report is that there has been no evidence of spread at the community level at present. Hopefully, it will remain this way. In addition, the apparent slowing in numbers of newly confirmed cases gives hope of seeing "a light at the end of the tunnel," as transmission appears to be slowing down. What is impressive is the number of contacts being monitored -- 5586 -- a massive undertaking on the part of the MOH. According to a 16 Jun 2015 press release in the English MOH website, the following measures have been implemented in the 13 hospitals with large numbers of confirmed cases and individuals under quarantine:

"- Strict quarantine is forced on MERS contacts in these hospitals, including a one-room-per-patient rule. Medial staff and caregivers must wear protective gear before entering patient rooms.
- Cohort quarantine is imposed on hospitals with high levels of MERS exposure. The entire ward or floor where a confirmed case occurred is secured to put every individual in that area under group quarantine."

These are measures that should interrupt transmission in the healthcare environment http://english.mw.go.kr/front_eng/al/sal0201vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=1002&MENU_ID=100203&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323476. - Mod.MPP]

[3] South Korea - WHO assessment 15 Jun 2015
Date: 16 Jun 2015
Source: WHO Global Alert and Response, situation assessment [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/situation-assessment/update-15-06-2015/en/


On [13 Jun 2015], WHO and the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Public Health and Welfare presented the results of their joint assessment of the MERS outbreak. The assessment led to a series of recommendations. These include further strengthening of measures to control the current outbreak, such as continuing to strengthen contact tracing and enhanced precautions in hospitals to prevent transmission as well as increased communication with the public and better preparation for future outbreaks.

Current situation
As of [15 Jun 2015], the Republic of Korea has reported 150 laboratory-confirmed cases and 15 deaths. The outbreak, which started with the introduction of MERS-CoV infection into the country by a single infected traveler, was amplified by infection in hospitals and movement of cases within and among hospitals.

The number of new cases occurring each day, which is the most accurate picture of whether the outbreak is slowing down, appears to be declining. This suggests that the containment measures in place are having an effect in reducing new infections. As these containment measures have been recently intensified, it is too early to measure their full impact on the transmission.

An early concern was whether the MERS-CoV virus changed and whether the transmission patterns in Korea were different compared with past outbreaks occurring in the Middle East. Scientists in the Republic of Korea and China have completed full genome sequencing of coronaviruses from the current outbreak. Findings were analyzed by a group of virologists convened by WHO. Preliminary analysis of these findings suggests that the MERS CoV viruses isolated in Korea are similar to those isolated in the Middle East. Furthermore, the joint mission found that the transmission patterns are similar to those seen previously in the Middle East.

Challenges in early diagnosis
MERS CoV is difficult to diagnose, particularly in the early part of an outbreak when awareness is relatively low. The initial, or "index" case, did not report his recent travel history to the Middle East when he 1st sought treatment. MERS was not suspected, and the initial case exposed others for more than a week before he was isolated. Additionally, early symptoms of MERS resemble other influenza-like illnesses, making it difficult to recognize or suspect MERS.

In the early stage of the disease when the upper respiratory tract is infected, the virus may be more difficult to detect. The laboratory diagnosis is more robust with samples taken in the lower respiratory tract usually in the later stage of the disease when the patient is hopitalised. Furthermore, samples taken from the upper respiratory system (e.g., nasal swabs) can sometimes provide negative test results when lower respiratory samples, which are difficult to collect, may be positive.

As noted by the joint mission, Korea follows a policy of retesting symptomatic contacts following initial negative results. As has been seen in this and other outbreaks, lapses in early detection and isolation, and the tendency to refer patients to other facilities for testing or management, can facilitate rapid spread from a single infected person.

MERS CoV spread in Korea
Conditions and cultural traditions specific to Korea have likely also played a role in the outbreak's rapid spread. The accessibility and affordability of health care in Korea encourage "doctor shopping;" patients frequently consult specialists in several facilities before deciding on a 1st-choice facility.

Moreover, it is customary in Korea for many family members and friends to visit loved ones when they are in the emergency room or admitted to hospital. It is also customary for family members to provide almost constant bedside care, often staying in the hospital room overnight, increasing the risk of close exposures in the health care setting.

[Recommendations of joint commission]

- Actions to halt further spread of the virus: These recommendations include early and complete identification and investigation of all contacts; robust quarantine/isolation and monitoring of all contacts and suspected cases; full implementation of infection prevention and control measures; and prevention of travel, especially internationally, of infected persons and contacts. Furthermore, the Mission recommended that selected hospitals should be designated for safe triage and assessment of suspected MERS cases. This will help protect health care workers while also minimizing the potential disruption of regular service delivery due to potential public reticence to seek help in facilities treating MERS patients.

- Regular provision of information to the public: To ensure the public is fully informed of developments in the outbreak, the Mission recommended that regular information should be provided in both Korean and English. This should include information on the evolution of the outbreak as well as measures to be taken or avoided. Channels most likely to be seen by the population, such as television and social media, should be used for maximum reach. Local government must be fully engaged and mobilized in the national fight against this large and complex outbreak.

- Preparation for future outbreaks: The Mission recommended that the Republic of Korea should strengthen the medical facilities needed to deal with serious infectious diseases, including increased numbers of negative-pressure isolation rooms; consider how to reduce the practice of "doctor shopping;" train more infection prevention and control specialists, infectious disease experts, laboratory scientists, epidemiologists, and risk communication experts; and invest in strengthening public health capacities and leadership. This outbreak also provides an opportunity for comprehensive research studies designed to close critical gaps in knowledge such as sero-epidemiological studies.

This Mission was presented with several investigations underway to evaluate transmission of MERS-CoV in health care settings, particularly in 2 of the hospitals associated with the most cases. As this work is still underway, the Mission members were not able to determine what role, if any, environmental contamination, inadequate ventilation, or other factors had in transmission of the virus in this outbreak. There is an urgent need for further investigation into these issues.

Future evolution of the outbreak
All cases detected to date appear to be linked back to the index case who was diagnosed and isolated on 20 May [2015]. To date, spread has largely occurred in the confined setting of health care facilities, with no known spillover into the general population. Korean health officials are actively monitoring a large number of close and casual contacts, and it is possible and even likely that more cases will be reported before this outbreak is over.

In the unlikely event that cases begin increasing at a faster pace, Korea has sufficient capacity to cope, given its high awareness for suspect cases, rapid system in place to quickly isolate suspect cases, an adequate number of isolation beds, stockpiles of personal protective equipment, and testing facilities that extend to the provincial level.

WHO is encouraging Korean officials to reopen schools that were closed due to fears around MERS CoV. Schools have not been linked to transmission of MERS CoV in the Republic of Korea or elsewhere. Reopening, combined with clear messages for the public on why, could start to build confidence and trust with the population in Korea. Regular communications on the evolution of the outbreak will also build confidence both in Korea and internationally.

The mission concluded that while the outbreak that began last month [May 2015] has been large and complex, it is showing a similar epidemiological pattern to previous hospital-associated MERS CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which have been fully controlled by strong basic public health measures such as infection prevention and control and early detection and isolation of cases. However, the size and complexity of the outbreak means it will be a number of weeks before the true impact of the stronger disease control measures will be seen.

All outbreaks are unpredictable. This is especially true for a comparatively new disease like MERS, where so much about its epidemiology, modes of transmission, natural history, and clinical features remains poorly understood.

[Important statements in the above assessment include:
"Preliminary analysis of these findings suggests that the MERS CoV viruses isolated in Korea are similar to those isolated in the Middle East. Furthermore, the joint mission found that the transmission patterns are similar to that seen previously in the Middle East." In one report available on the outbreak of MERS-CoV in Al Hasa in 2013 (the Eastern Province of which Hufoof is the major city), they show there were 5 generations of cases (Assiri A, McGeer A, Perl TM, Price CS, Al Rabeeah AA, Cummings DA, Alabdullatif ZN, Assad M, Almulhim A, Makhdoom H, Madani H, Alhakeem R, Al-Tawfiq JA, Cotten M, Watson SJ, Kellam P, Zumla AI, Memish ZA; KSA MERS-CoV Investigation Team. Hospital outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.N Engl J Med. 2013 Aug 1;369(5):407-16. Epub 19 Jun 2013; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1306742).

"The laboratory diagnosis is more robust, with samples taken in the lower respiratory tract usually in the later stage of the disease when the patient is hopitalised. Furthermore, samples taken from the upper respiratory system (e.g., nasal swabs) can sometimes provide negative test results when lower respiratory samples, which are difficult to collect, may be positive." If the virus is hard to identify in the early stages of disease, is it not logical that the patient is not highly infectious at that time, as they are apparently not shedding high loads of virus?

Reviewing the case definition for suspected cases, one can see where there is room to "miss" an index case, especially if travel histories are not part of routine patient histories, and if the initial clinical presentation involves a milder respiratory event. - Mod.MPP]

Between [9 and 12 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 77-year-old male from Hofuf [Hufoof/Hafuf] city developed symptoms on 26 May [2015]. On 27 May [2015], he was admitted to a hospital that had been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. On that occasion, no laboratory samples were collected for MERS-CoV testing. The patient was treated symptomatically and discharged on 31 May [2015]. On [10 Jun 2015], symptoms reappeared, and he was admitted to a different hospital on the same day [10 Jun 2015]. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [11 Jun 2015]. He passed away on [11 Jun 2014]. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a confirmed case on 12 Jun 2015 and as a fatality at time of initial report on 12 Jun 2015. At time of initial report, the history of contact with a known or suspected case was noted. - Mod.MPP].

2- A 60-year-old female from Hofuf city developed symptoms on [2 Jun 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [8 Jun 2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [9 Jun 2015]. Between [26 May 2015 and 7 Jun 2015], she visited her daughter at a hospital with an ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. The daughter, who had been hospitalized for an unrelated medical condition, has not developed MERS-CoV-related symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward [reported as a newly confirmed case on 10 Jun 2015 and, at the time, was noted to be in stable condition. - Mod.MPP].

3- A 73-year-old male from Turubah city developed symptoms on [23 May 2015] and was admitted to a hospital in Jeddah on [1 Jun 2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [8 Jun 2015]. He has no history of contact with camels; however, the patient has a history of frequent contact with sheep and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU [reported as a newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 9 Jun 2015 and as a fatality on 14 Jun 2015. At time of initial report, denied history of contact with other case(s) - Mod.MPP].

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the deaths of 2 previously reported MERS-CoV cases. The cases were reported in a previous DON on [11 Jun 2015] (case n. 1, 5).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1292 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 458 related deaths.

[Two of the 3 cases reported in the above WHO update most likely were exposed to the MERS-CoV infection by spending time at a hospital with an ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak, for one as a patient, for the other visiting a family member who was a patient. From the report, it is not clear how many hospitals are involved in the outbreak, that is, whether both patients were exposed in the same hospital or perhaps in 2 different hospitals in the city. It would be helpful to receive more information on the epidemiology of the outbreak in Hufoof, numbers of cases, transmission chains, number of hospitals/health facilities involved, community or household transmission, numbers of generations of transmission. The outbreak presumably started with an index case reported on 20 Apr 2015; there have now been 6.5 incubation periods since the index case was reported. Is there evidence of 6 generations of transmission? - Mod.MPP

On [15 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:

A 65-year-old, non-national male from the Eastern region developed symptoms on 31 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on [6 Jun 2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [14 Jun 2015]. He has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1293 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 458 related deaths.

[This is now the 78th case of MERS-CoV infection confirmed and reported by the UAE. The above reports mention that the onset of illness was on 31 May 2015; the patient was admitted to the hospital on 6 Jun 2015 and was MERS-CoV positive on laboratory tests on 14 Jun 2015. It would be interesting to know whether there were multiple samples taken over time for MERS-CoV testing in the healthcare environment and whether only the more recent specimen was positive, or whether there was a delay in suspecting MERS-CoV with resultant delay in testing for the virus. Also, was the patient in a negative pressure room from the time of admission or at a later time? See the comment/query below in section [7].

[7] Emergency room procedures - subscriber comment/query RFI
Date: 16 Jun 2015
From: Jim Gauthier <gauthij2@providencecare.ca> [edited]


Is there any information on the use of masks in Korean emergency rooms, and on subsequent admissions? Post SARS, Ontario uses an acute respiratory infection screening of all hospital admissions or ER patients: if positive for cough and fever, the patient is isolated immediately into Contact and Droplet precautions, and family must follow the precautions (wearing gowns, gloves and surgical masks with eye protection). Further travel questions are also used to rule out MERS-CoV, Ebola, and any novel virus.

With the latest update in Vol. 36 Issue 42 [MERS-CoV (67): South Korea, Saudi Arabia 20150616.3439726], family members are getting infected while visiting, hence the question posed concerning mask use.

[Jim Gauthier's comment/query is spot on target. It's nice to see that Ontario has changed its practices in the healthcare environment as a lesson learned from the SARS outbreak. Febrile respiratory illnesses presenting to the emergency room are treated as highly contagious until proven otherwise, a prudent approach. The experience in South Korea is that almost half of the cases to date have been traced to presence in the emergency room at the same time as an active case of MERS-CoV infection. - Mod.MPP]

A 65-year-old man has died in northern Germany of a lung disease, following an earlier MERS infection, state health officials have said.

"South Korea is to begin trials of an experimental plasma treatment for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). ... The treatment -- which has already proved useful for tackling other deadly diseases, including Ebola -- uses blood from patients who have successfully fought off the same infection." [We await the results of the study. I am not sure one can say definitively that it has been documented to work with other diseases such as Ebola. - Mod.MPP]
