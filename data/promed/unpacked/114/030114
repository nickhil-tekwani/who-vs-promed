France Considers Bonemeal Ban
-----------------------------
As 2 new cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow
disease, have been reported in western France, the French Government is
considering a ban on bonemeal in all animal feed. The new cases were
detected in the Cotes d'Armor region of western Brittany.
The cows were born in September 1995 and November 1994. The herds to which
they belonged were to be slaughtered. The 2 new finds bring to 84 the total
number of BSE cases so far this year, and 164 since statistics were first
recorded in 1991.
As the new cases were announced, the French Government awaits the outcome
of scientific and economic studies before ruling on the use of bonemeal in
all animal feed. The ban at present only applies to cattle feed.
Consumer associations and politicians, including President Jacques Chirac,
have called for the existing ban on the use of animal matter to be extended
to all animal feeds, not just cattle feed. The Government said it was
taking time to study the financial implications of a total ban before
considering the advice of the French food safety agency.

France Prepares for Bonemeal Ban
--------------------------------------------
France is set to ban the use of bone meal and other animal parts in animal
feed amid growing fears over mad cow disease. Agriculture minister Jean
Glavany says the use of such animal feed has caused many problems. He says
banning the animal feed will make life simpler, even if it is not strictly
a question of food safety.
France has been thrown into panic in recent weeks, with some supermarkets
withdrawing their beef stocks after the news that meat from a herd
contaminated with mad cow disease, or BSE, was put on sale in supermarkets.
Some 84 BSE cases have been reported in France so far this year, and 164
since recording began in 1991. Hungary said it is banning French imports of
beef beginning tomorrow, while Russia says it will not accept beef from a
number of high-risk areas in the west of France.

Switzerland Considers Restrictions on Livestock Feed
--------------------------------------------------
Swiss authorities said they are considering banning animal products in all
livestock feed in a bid to stamp out so-called mad cow disease or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The Federal Veterinary Office said it was drawing up proposals as a result
of 2 new confirmed cases of the disease this week among cattle born after
stringent controls were introduced in 1996.
Switzerland became the second country after Britain to report cases of BSE
in the earlier 1990s. The government ordered the slaughter of all affected
herds, including offspring of infected cows, in 1996 and it banned the use
of animal by-products in cattle feed.
Experts were stunned by the new cases, given the precautions taken thus
far. "We're in a quandary and we don't know the way out," said Ulrich Kihm,
director of the veterinary office. "But we don't dare wait for 5 more years
before taking action."
The proposed ban -- which would cover all animal bone meal and most fats in
feed destined for animals -- will now be submitted to the cabinet for
action. Officials estimated the measures would cost 50 to 60 million Swiss
francs ($29 to $34 million US).
France is also studying the prospect of a total ban on animal byproducts in
livestock feed after an upsurge in cases of BSE and a nationwide scare that
infected meat may have been sold by a leading supermarket.

Mad Cow Disease Outbreak Feared in France
-------------------------------------------
The French Health secretary has warned that the country faces an outbreak
of "several dozen cases" of the deadly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(vCJD), the human version of mad cow disease.
Dominique Gillot says there had so far been just 2 confirmed cases of the
human version of the deadly disease.
Mrs Gillot said that the number of people displaying symptoms of the
disease was already on the rise. Alarm about BSE has been spreading in
France since a report that cattle from an infected herd had been
unwittingly bought by supermarkets and 8 tons of the meat had been put on
sale.

French Bone Meal Ban Urged
-----------------------------------------------
French President Jacques Chirac called for an immediate ban on meat and
bone meal (MBM) in animal feed because of fears over mad cow disease
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE). "We must ban animal meal
without any delay, and move towards a systematic tracing program in order
to limit the risks of contamination by BSE," he said on French television.
Feed manufactured from the ground carcasses of animals is regarded as the
most likely vector for BSE. It is banned as cattle feed in France, but
permitted for poultry and pigs.
Alarm about BSE has reached new heights in France in the last 2 weeks,
after it was revealed that cattle from a herd infected with BSE had been
sold to supermarkets.
