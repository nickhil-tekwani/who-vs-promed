Some 118 people have fallen ill, with 60 being admitted to hospital,
after consuming fried silkworm believed to [contain] the toxic
substance histamine. Most of the patients suffered facial swelling,
vomiting, blurred vision, numbness around the mouth, exhaustion, and
skin rash, said the Public Health Ministry's epidemiologist, Anek
Mong-oomklang. He presented the case at a 3-day conference entitled
"Mobilize Epidemiology to Health Policy Development," organised by the
Department of Disease Control. [Date of outbreak not given, possibly
2008. - Mod.JW]

Anek and his team studied the epidemiological effects of food
poisoning by collecting samples of silkworm at the Rong-Klua market,
a hub for insect trade, at the border province of Sa Kaeo.

After hearing that one of the employees of a shop importing insects
from China had fallen ill from eating a fried silkworm, they sent the
insects for laboratory tests and discovered that most of the silkworms
sold in Rong-Klua market [contained] histamines. The level of
histamine found in [a] silkworm was 875 milligrams per kilogram, when,
according to US food regulations, no more than 50 mg/kg of histamine
can be allowed in fish, which is [more] usually found contaminated
[see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.JW]. This is the 1st time that an
insect has been found contaminated by this substance, Anek said.

[Foodborne histamine poisoning usually occurs as scombroid fish
poisoning from the ingestion of histamine produced from histidine in
certain poorly refrigerated fish. Typically, symptoms include facial
flushing, sweating, rash, a burning or peppery taste in the mouth,
diarrhea, hives, and abdominal cramps and usually resolve within
several hours without medical intervention. More severe symptoms
(such as respiratory distress, swelling of the tongue and throat, and
blurred vision) can occur and require medical treatment with
antihistamines.

The mechanism of how these silkworms became virtual histamine 'bombs'
is unclear but a 2006 report from Viet Nam
(<http://www.thanhniennews.com/healthy/?catid=8&newsid=13954>) could
have been the same thing:

"Over 150 people in Viet Nam's Thanh Hoa province came down with
poisoning from silkworms, a popular food in the country, bought at
sidewalk vendors in the past week, a local expert said. Nguyen Dang
Ngoan, director of the provincial Health Prevention Center said the
incidence could be due to chemical preservatives mixed in the
silkworms. Victims manifested headaches, giddiness, blurred vision,
tissue inflammation and vomiting."

Sa Kaeo province is in southeastern Thailand and can be found on a map at

[It is interesting to speculate that silkworm histamine content may be
a protection against predators, just as some butterflies are poisonous
to birds.
