Date of start of the event: 24 Aug 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 16 Sep 2020

Causal agent: rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Singapore
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Aug 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 11 / 10 / 8 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The 11 pet rabbits were from 3 different owners, 2 of whom had reported history of contact with one another. Eight out of 11 rabbits across the 3 households have since died.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 90.91 / 72.73 / 80 / 72.73
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comment: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease was detected in liver samples from pet rabbits that had presented with variable degree of inappetence and significantly elevated liver enzymes prior to death. Testing modalities included histopathology, RT-PCR, and Sanger sequencing. Histopathology of the liver sections revealed moderate-to-severe acute liver necrosis, RT-PCR detected RHD virus, and Sanger sequencing yielded sequence similarity (95%) to RHDV2 sequences in Genbank of a 240bp fragment of VP60. Eight out of 11 rabbits owned by 3 different owners have since died. Two of the owners had reported history of contact.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal and Plant Health Centre (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Rabbits / gene sequencing / 16 Sep 2020 / positive
Rabbits / histopathological examination / 1 Sep 2020 / positive
Rabbits / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 10 Sep 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

RHDV2 was first detected in 2010 in France in wild and farmed rabbits, and then it rapidly spread to Europe and Mediterranean basin, causing significant losses in farmed and wild rabbits in many countries (to date [mid-2015], France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia, and the UK).
