We have conducted population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Calgary (population about 1.3 million), Canada since 1998. We have previously witnessed large-scale serotype-specific IPD outbreaks, as well as the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [PCV] to reduce vaccine serotype IPD at all ages and reduce overall IPD, especially in children. January to March of 2020 began with normal post-PCV incidence rates of IPD, followed by a sharp decline in incidence for quarters 2 and 3 from April to September [2020].

The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for 2020 compared to 2019 incidence in the 1st quarter was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 2.1; p=0.37); for the 2nd quarter the IRR was 0.22 (CI 0.1-0.4); p<0.001). Thus, 2020 started off with normal incidence in the 1st quarter but declined to significantly lower overall incidence in 2020 compared to 2019 for April to September. Incidence increased in the October to December quarter, but not to normal rates. The IRR for October to December 2020 compared to 2019 was 0.6 (CI: 0.3-1.0; p=0.0402).

Incidence in children, which was already much lower in the conjugate vaccine era compared to pre-vaccine days, declined to almost nothing for 2020 and was low for the entire year, with a total of 3 cases occurring in under 18-year-olds. A similar decline was seen in adults as well but it started in the second quarter of the year.

This change in incidence occurred within the context of normal, continued surveillance for pneumococcal disease and normal vaccine uptake within the community. Likely the decline was a result of the combination of decreased transmission due to strict public health restrictions that began in late March 2020 and continued throughout the year. So far, in 2021, the incidence of IPD remains far below the usual rate.

"Abstract
---------
"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, many countries shut down schools and businesses in an effort to slow transmission of the virus. As some businesses reopened, increased public health protocols, mask wearing, hand sanitizer, and personal protective equipment use remained. The shutdown and public health restrictions for person-to-person interaction resulted in a decline of other transmissible diseases as well as Sars-CoV-2. In Calgary, the incidence of invasive disease due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ declined to much lower levels than would be expected in early spring and remained low until December 2020. This decline occurred despite no changes in vaccine use and uptake."

The non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing, working-at-home, face masking, travel restrictions, and mass gathering cancellations, not only prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but likely also have a beneficial effect preventing transmission of other acute respiratory infections caused by influenza A and B viruses, human parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/6/21-0135_article,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa710, https://doi.org/10.1097/INF.0000000000002845, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1328,

As in the Canadian study done in Calgary above, large declines in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease have also been reported in the UK across all age groups following the institution of COVID-19 restrictions (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/5/e65/5983410).

Calgary, with a metropolitan population of about 1.6 million residents in 2021, is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta, about 80 km (50 mi) east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies and about 299 km (186 mi) south of Edmonton, the provincial capital; Calgary is the second-largest in western Canada (after Vancouver) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary).
