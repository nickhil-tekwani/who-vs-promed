Cow with TB found near Steinbach
---------------------------------
A dairy cow infected with bovine tuberculosis has been found in the
Steinbach area -- the 1st report of bovine TB outside the Riding Mountain
National Park area since 1996.
The cow in a dairy herd near Steinbach was flagged in the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency's (CFIA) routine slaughter-inspection program.
The herd has been quarantined. Its 150 animals will be slaughtered to stop
the disease from spreading, but the farmer will be compensated. The CFIA
says pasteurization kills TB-related bacteria in milk.
Except for the Riding Mountain region, Manitoba is currently TB-free. A 2nd
strike could have serious implications for the already-beleaguered cattle
industry.
"It now means that any future findings of the disease outside the Riding
Mountain area will result in Manitoba's TB status being downgraded," says
Maria Koller-Jones, a senior veterinarian with the CFIA.
She says the agency will test herds in the Steinbach area to make sure the
disease hasn't spread, a prospect she thinks is unlikely.
"[The affected cow's] herdmates testing negative at this stage means that
if there's been spread in her new home, it's been very recent and it's not
been at a significant level," says Koller-Jones. "So the risk to those
herds from her presence in that part of the province is quite minimal."
The agency believes the infected cow was one of 25 animals the owner
purchased in 2002 from a dairy herd near the national park. The sale
occurred before the CFIA's strict TB control measures came into effect at
the beginning of 2003.
The CFIA continues to investigate the original herd near the national park.
