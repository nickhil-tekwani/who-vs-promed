The World Health Organization (WHO) said on [30 Mar 2011], 4 new
cases of wild poliovirus type 1 have been reported in Pakistan,
bringing the total for 2011 to 24.

Media reports said the virus had also been discovered in water
samples from 5 cities. "WHO doesn't test drinking water for polio
viruses; however, environmental surveillance has been established in
Peshawar since June 2010 and sewage water samples from 2 sites are
regularly tested by the NIH [National Institute of Health, Pakistan]
polio laboratory," Gul Afridi, WHO Pakistan media and advocacy
officer, said.

"Wild polioviruses have been continuously isolated from these sites,"
Afridi added. The 2 sites are Shaheen Muslim Town near Total Petrol
Pump, and Larama village near Bakhshoo Pull. One sample is tested from
each on a monthly basis.

Until 2007 when 32 cases were detected, Pakistan had appeared to be
winning its battle against polio.

[This newswire reflects the data reported on the polio eradication
website as of 30 Mar 2011. This case count is twice that seen for the
same period in 2010 when there were 12 cases reported. It also
represents an increase in 4 cases since the last ProMED-mail polio
update (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (03): Rep. Congo, Pakistan,
Africa 20110323.0919.)

[2] Nigeria (Kebbi, Jigawa)

4 new cases of the wild polio virus have been recorded in Kebbi and
Jigawa States, in a shocking reversal that underscores the continued
threat posed by the disease in Nigeria.

The new cases bring to 5 the number of cases of the wild poliovirus,
which cripples and even kills children, recorded so far in the country
in 2011.

Nigeria is one of only 4 countries across the world where the wild
poliovirus is still found. The others are Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India.

Reacting to the discovery of the new cases of the wild poliovirus in
the 2 northern states, the executive director of the National Primary
Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Muhammed Ali Pate, said the
affected states are conducting a "mop-up" vaccination campaign with
the support of the NPHCDA and international development partners to
eradicate the virus.

Mr Ali Pate also said that despite Nigeria's progress in polio
eradication, the virus is still a threat to the Nigerian child. He
called for the support of state and local government to ensure that
every single child under 5 years of age receives the polio vaccine.

"Not only must we vaccinate every child, we must also find solutions
to every new polio case. If one child is paralyzed, it means 200 more
children would have the virus," he said. "Therefore in polio
eradication, sensitive surveillance and our collective effort are
critical to fighting the polio virus and finally stopping it."

The emir of Argungu, Muhamadu Samai'la Mera, who is also the deputy
chairman of the northern leaders committee on Health Care Delivery,
noted that the continuous transmission of poliovirus in Nigeria is
because some children still evade healthcare providers during
vaccination campaigns.

He advised his colleagues not to rest on their oars until the country
is certified polio free and pledged that the traditional leaders will
continue to convince their people to participate in the immunization
process.

After a period of suspicion about the efficacy of the polio
vaccination, northern religious and traditional rulers have thrown
themselves into the campaign to ensure widespread immunization of
children. Jigawa State has made a lot of progress against the
poliovirus, and the last time it recorded any case of the virus was in
October 2009.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains one. The most recent case (wild poliovirus type
1 - WPV1), from Kandahar province, had onset of paralysis on [11 Jan
2011] .

- The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were
national immunization days (NIDs) held on [13-15 Mar 2011]. Health
workers will vaccinate children against polio using trivalent oral
polio vaccine (tOPV) and will administer vitamin A during NIDs planned
for [2-4 May 2011].

- The Afghanistan/Pakistan Technical Advisory Group (TAG) met last
week [week of 21 Mar 2011] in Islamabad, Pakistan. The TAG found that
Afghanistan is making great progress, but that several improvements
could be made. The TAG recommended that, in order to reach more
children in the southern region, a flexible approach should be
implemented including the use of the short interval additional dose
(SIAD) strategy, permanent posts at transit points into and out of
inaccessible areas and the tracking and vaccination of all internally
displaced children. Further recommendations included a focus on
reaching migrant, mobile and under-served groups, and on maintaining
routine immunization in polio-free areas.

India
-----
- No new cases were reported in the past week. There has only been
one case reported for 2011 -- a case of WPV1 with onset of paralysis
on [13 Jan 2011], from Howra district, West Bengal. This case is one
of only 3 cases reported in the last 6 months.

- Sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) using bOPV [bi-valent oral
polio vaccine] are currently taking place (27-31 Mar 2011), covering
the majority of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and outbreak areas
of West Bengal. Further SNIDs are planned for April and May [2011].

- Bill Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, made
a high profile visit to India last week [week of 21 Mar 2011]
accompanied by fellow billionaire-philanthropist, Warren Buffet.
During the trip Mr Gates engaged the country's leadership including
prime minister Manmohan Singh and the chief minister of Bihar, and
wrote a letter to the chief minister of West Bengal, calling upon them
all to ensure the nation's dedication to polio eradication, especially
the maintenance of polio funding.

- An acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance review of northern
West Bengal concluded last week [week of 21 Mar 2011]. While no major
deficiencies were identified, it was stressed that surveillance needs
to remain a core function of the NPSP, and government involvement
needs to be increased.

Nigeria
-------
- 3 new cases were reported in the past week (one WPV1 and 2 WPV3),
bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 5. The 2 most recent
cases both had onset of paralysis on [12 Mar 2011] -- a WPV1 from
Aleiro, Kebbi and a WPV3 from Gwandu, Kebbi [see [2] above].

- 11 out of 12 high-risk northern states carried out SIAs using bOPV
from [26-29 Mar 2011]. The round was postponed in Borno so that the
government could distribute long lasting insecticidal mosquito nets
(LLINs). Borno will immunize all children under 5 in the state with an
additional dose of bOPV on [4-8 Apr 2011].

- A Maternity and Neonatal Child Health Week (MNCHW) will be held
from [14-17 May 2011] during which children will be vaccinated using
trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV). A nested mop-up with bOPV in 6
high-risk states will be conducted at the same time as the MNCHW. The
mop-up will ensure that immunization activities in the states of
Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kano, Yobe, and Borno will be held to a higher
standard than normal SIAs with any LGA [local government area] in
these states reporting less than 90 percent coverage of children less
than 5 years of age being re-covered. Provided that there are no
further health worker strikes, the MNCHW in May [2011] will be the 1st
time the states of Taraba, Cross River, and Oyo have held SIAs since
the strikes began in November 2010.

- Nigeria is currently reviewing its surveillance network and taking
a number of important steps to improve its sensitivity. A surveillance
desk review is currently underway which will be followed by a series
of rapid surveillance assessments in high risk areas of the country.
National AFP guidelines and training materials are being reviewed and
updated while refresher training for Disease Surveillance Notification
Officers is planned for late April [2011].

Pakistan
--------
- 4 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), bringing
the total number of cases for 2011 to 24 [see [1] above]. The most
recent case, in Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had onset of
paralysis on [13 Mar 2011] . No WPV3 has been reported in Pakistan
since November 2010.

- NIDs using tOPV took place on [7-9 Mar 2011]. The next SIAs will be
SNIDs on [4-6 Apr 2011] (using bOPV).

- The Afghanistan/Pakistan Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and cross
border meeting was held in Islamabad on [24-25 Mar 2011]. The TAG
expressed concerns about the 33 highest risk districts of Pakistan,
which remain responsible for 80 percent of the country's WPV cases.
The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) was found to be of
particular concern, especially given the frequent population movement
both within FATA and to other areas of Pakistan. Accessibility remains
a problem in parts of FATA; however the fact that cases have been
reported in accessible areas indicates gaps in campaign quality. The
TAG's key recommendations included aggressive response to a) the
current WPV1 outbreak in Central/Southern Sindh, b) any WPV3 anywhere
in the country, and c) any WPV1 outside the persistent transmission
zone. The TAG also strongly urged the new 'prime minister's polio
monitoring cell' to establish and use standard indicators to issue and
share district polio 'report cards' with the prime minister, chief
ministers, and governors.

Angola
------
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 2.

- Angola's revised emergency action plan for polio eradication will
be presented to the meeting of the IMB this week [week of 30 Mar
2011], following the announcement that the country had officially
missed its end-2010 milestone of the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative's Strategic Plan 2010-2012 -- cessation of all polio
outbreaks with onset in 2009.

- Angola will participate in synchronized rounds with Congo, DR
Congo, and Namibia on 28-30 Apr 2011, and with DR Congo, Namibia, and
Zambia on 26-28 May 2011.

Central Asia and Russian Federation
-----------------------------------
- This region has not reported a case of wild poliovirus in more than
6 months. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 29 Sep 2010,
in the Russian Federation.

- Russian Federation: SNIDs covering the northern Caucasus using tOPV
were planned to begin this week [week of 30 Mar 2011].

- Tajikistan has NIDs planned for 18-22 April 2011 using tOPV.

- Turkmenistan: NIDs are planned for 25-28 April 2011 using tOPV.

- Kazakhstan held its last SIAs from 21-27 Feb 2011 (SNIDs using
mOPV1).

- Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are planning NIDs using tOPV for April
2011.

Chad
----
- No cases were reported this week -- therefore the total number of
cases for 2011 remains 16. The most recent case was a WPV1 in Moundou,
Logone Occidental, with onset of paralysis on [20 Feb 2011].

- In Chad, continuation of re-established wild poliovirus type 3
(WPV3) transmission was confirmed by genetic sequencing of WPV3
isolated from a case with onset on 30 Jan 2011 in the east of the
country. This means that the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012 milestone
for cessation of all re-established poliovirus transmission by the end
of 2010 has not been met in Chad. In addition to the re-established
transmission of WPV3, Chad is also affected by a new outbreak of wild
poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) following an importation from Nigeria in
September 2011.

- Alarmed at the ongoing transmission of its re-established WPV3 and
the new WPV1 outbreak since September [2010], the Government of Chad
at the start of 2011 developed an urgent operational plan to address
the situation. The new plan sees resources and support allocated to
identified high-risk areas. In a major shift, district heads will be
personally charged with overseeing implementation of supplementary
immunization activities (SIAs) by their respective provincial
governors. At the national level, monthly implementation reports will
be prepared by the Ministry of Health and shared with the office of
the prime minister. The major elements of the new operational plan
will be presented to the GPEI's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) on
31 Mar-1 Apr 2011.

Congo and Gabon
---------------
- No cases were reported in the past week in Congo. The total number
of cases for 2011 remains one (WPV1 with onset of paralysis 22 Jan
2011).

- Congo will vaccinate children and adults against polio in southern
provinces on [28-30 Apr 2011], as part of a synchronized campaign with
Angola, DR Congo, and Namibia.

- Gabon: the case reported last month [February 2011] -- WPV1
imported from Congo with onset of paralysis on [15 Jan 2011] --
remains the only case to be seen in the country in more than 10
years.

- NIDs using mOPV1 were held in Gabon from [22 Mar 2011].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
----------------------------------
- 4 cases were reported in the past week -- all WPV1 from Kinshasa.
This brings the total number of cases for 2011 to 26. The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on [6 Mar 2011] in the Police district.

- DR Congo is currently considered to be at high risk of missing its
end-2010 milestone (cessation of all re-established poliovirus
transmission): transmission of its re-established WPV1 is known to
have continued into at least November [2010], and 2 cases reported
from the area of re-established transmission in December [2010] are
pending sequencing results. The Government of DR Congo intends to
present their emergency action plan for polio eradication at the
meeting of the IMB this week [31 Mar-1 Apr 2011].

- Of the 11 cases seen in Kinshasa, 9 were young adults aged between
15 and 25. In order to combat this outbreak effectively, the SNIDs
which were held in Kinshasa from [24-27 Mar 2011] were expanded to
cover the entire population. The next round will also target the
entire population of t his city of around 8.4 million people.

- DR Congo will take part in synchronized campaigns with Angola,
Congo, and Namibia on [28-30 Apr 2011], and with Angola, Namibia, and
Zambia on [26-28 May 2011].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No cases have been reported from this group of countries this year
[2011].

- Southern Sudan carried out SIAs from [29 Mar 2011], and northern
Sudan's next round will take place on [2 Apr 2011] (both using tOPV).
These activities will be particularly important, given confirmation of
cases in eastern Chad, close to the border with Sudan.

- The 1st phase of SIAs in Somalia took place from [20 Mar 2011].
While this round aimed to cover as much of the country as possible
with tOPV, it was severely hampered due to security issues and much of
the south and central zones remained inaccessible. The 2nd phase is
planned for [24-27 Apr 2011] (also using tOPV).

- Plans for the synchronized SNIDs along the Uganda/Kenyan border
have been altered. Both countries have now postponed their rounds
until May [2011].

West Africa
-----------
- No new cases have been reported from this group of countries in the
past week. Last week [week of 21 Mar 2011], Niger reported the 1st
case for this group of countries in almost 6 months (WPV3 with onset
of paralysis on [19 Jan 2011] in Birni Nkonni, Tahoua).

- Synchronized campaigns, using a combination of vaccines, were held
across most of west Africa on [25 Mar 2011]. Similar synchronised
multi-country campaigns will also be held on [29 Apr 2011].

[For the global map showing locations on confirmed polio cases as of
30 Mar 2011, see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring.aspx.

According to the most recent available data on the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative (GPEI) website, the total number of confirmed
cases due to infection with WPV as of 30 Mar 2011 is 78, compared with
55 reported during the same time frame during 2010. As seen in the
prior polio update (see archive Poliomyelitis - worldwide (03): Rep.
Congo, Pakistan, Africa 20110323.0919),

- the total number of confirmed cases due to WPV infection in endemic
countries as of 30 Mar 2011 is 31, compared with 40 during the same
time frame in 2010,

- while the total number of confirmed cases due to WPV infection in
non-endemic countries as of 30 Mar 2011 is 47, compared with 15 during
the same time frame in 2010.

These figures represent an increase in confirmed polio cases in
non-endemic countries, while there is a decrease in confirmed cases in
endemic countries. This trend reflects the challenges seen with
importation and continued transmission of the WPV in countries that
had previously interrupted WPV transmission, where there are now
cohorts of susceptibles due to decreased vaccination coverage after
achievement of interruption of WPV transmission. - Mod.MPP]
