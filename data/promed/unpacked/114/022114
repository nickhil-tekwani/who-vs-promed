HUMAN RABIES CASE UNDER INVESTIGATION, ALBANY, 4 Oct 2000
-----------------------------------------------------------
State Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello, M.D., M.P.H., Dr.P.H., said
tests indicate an adult male patient who is hospitalized at Glens Falls
Hospital is infected with the rabies virus.
Dr. Novello said the New York State Department of Health is working closely
with Warren County public health officials, and Glens Falls Hospital in the
disease investigation.
The patient, who is not from the United States, was visiting the Glens
Falls area and was admitted to the hospital late last week when symptoms
became evident. The preliminary clinical diagnosis of rabies was followed
today by test results from the New York State Health Department's Wadsworth
Center's rabies laboratory, where microscopic examination of samples
confirmed rabies infection.
It is not known how the patient contracted the disease, but evidence
indicates he was not infected in this country. The incubation period for
rabies is variable, but can take from two weeks to several months. In rare
instances, incubation periods of over one year have been reported. The
patient only arrived in the United States on September 22, and there is no
evidence he contracted the disease here.
Health officials stress there is no risk to anyone who may have had casual
contact with the patient. Rabies is primarily transmitted through bites,
and only rarely through broken skin or mucous membrane exposure to infected
saliva or spinal fluid. Close contacts, including hospital staff who have
been caring for the patient, will be evaluated to determine if they need
rabies post-exposure treatment.
"There has never been a documented case of human-to-human transmission of
rabies," Dr. Novello said. "However, post-exposure treatment may be
considered for those who had close, personal contact with the patient, such
as care-givers. State Health Department staff will help to assess which
individuals, if any, may be at risk and should be vaccinated."
Human post-exposure treatment consists of a dose of rabies immune globulin,
followed immediately by the first of 5 doses of rabies vaccine. The
remaining doses are given on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 following the initial
injection. Post-exposure treatment is effective if started soon after
exposure and administered according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) protocol.
State health officials have notified the CDC about the case, which will
facilitate investigation of possible exposure to individuals overseas.
Because the patient is not from this country, it may be difficult to
determine how the exposure occurred. Further laboratory tests are underway
to identify the particular strain of rabies virus infecting the patient.
Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system. It is
transmitted from infected animals to humans, and is almost always fatal
once symptoms occur. However, prompt immunization after exposure is an
effective treatment against rabies, preventing the onset of symptoms.
The last human case of rabies in New York State occurred in 1995. The
patient was a 13 year old Connecticut girl who was hospitalized and later
died at Westchester Medical Center. Two years earlier, in 1993, an 11 year
old Sullivan County girl died at Westchester Medical Center after becoming
ill while vacationing with her family in the Adirondacks. Both girls were
infected with a strain of bat rabies. Previous to those cases, there had
not been a human rabies case in New York State in 40 years.
