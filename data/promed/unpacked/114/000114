[Byline: Joel Kaseso]

The provincial minister of health in North Kivu, [Dr Eugene Nzanzu Salita], during a lively press briefing this Monday [22 Feb 2021] in the town of Butembo, announced a 7th positive case for the Ebola virus. This is the daughter of the 2nd case notified in the Biena health zone, in Lubero territory. This new case is being taken care of in the Katwa health zone.

"Since the epidemic was declared in North Kivu, we are currently registering 7 cases of Ebola. The last patient was diagnosed yesterday. She is from Masoya, mainly from Ngubi village. She's the daughter of the 2nd confirmed case we had. So this is a known contact and was on her 12th day of follow-up. Currently, she is receiving care in the CTE (Ebola Treatment Center) in Katwa," Dr Salita explained to 7sur7.cd.

He also affirms that the vaccination against Ebola "for people not yet vaccinated" started on Monday [15 Feb 2021] and will end on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021]."

In addition, the provincial minister of health in North Kivu denied rumors that an Ebola response team in charge of vaccination was attacked in the health zone of Biena (Lubero), last Sunday [21 Feb 2021], by drivers of motorcycle taxis.

"This is false. What is true is that the taxi drivers were in mourning. And you know here with us how we manifest during mourning. They were sympathizing because one of their own had passed away. And after that, we had vaccinated more than 62 people. So, to tell you that we were not attacked," he said.

Since the reappearance of the Ebola virus epidemic in North Kivu, the cumulative number of cases is 7. 4 have died and 3 are being treated in the health zones of Biena (Lubero) and Katwa (Butembo). More than 500 contacts are being followed.

[This latest case (no. 7) is related to the 2nd case, which although extremely unfortunate, is not surprising if proper personal protective procedures were not followed. Vaccination of contacts should help, but case no. 7 was the daughter of an early case and likely was infected prior to being vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

[2] Guinea
- Tue 23 Feb 2020. Launch of vaccination campaign
[Al Jazeera, abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/23/guinea-launches-vaccination-drive-in-ebola-hit-south

Guinea has launched an Ebola vaccination campaign to halt the spread of the deadly disease which hit the country's south this month [February 2021] and has already caused several deaths.

The vaccination drive got under way on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021] in Goueke, in the Nzerekore prefecture where the 1st cases were detected on [14 Feb 2021] the World Health Organization (WHO) said, adding that the launch started with the vaccination of health workers.

"The vaccination uses the 'ring strategy' where all people who have come into contact with a confirmed Ebola patient are given the vaccine, as well as frontline and health workers," the WHO said in a statement on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021].

- Tue 23 Feb 2021. Vaccine reluctance
[Guinee Matin, in French, machine trans., edited]

[Byline: Foromo Gbouo Lamah]

The vaccination campaign against the Ebola hemorrhagic epidemic was launched in the afternoon of Tuesday [23 Feb 2021], in the sub-prefecture of Goueke (Nzerekore), where the disease reappeared recently. And, it is the prefect of Nzerekore who kicked off the work, reports the correspondent of Guineematin.com in the prefecture.

Shortly after the arrival of the 1st doses of Ebola vaccines in Goueke, the authorities launched the vaccination campaign. The ceremony took place in the presence of the Minister of Health, Doctor General Remy Lamah, the chairman of the logistics commission for the response to Ebola, Dr Moussa Konate, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Guinea, Prof Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo, and several local authorities.

To set an example, the prefect of Nzerekore, Saa Yola Tolno, was the first to be vaccinated. He was followed by the sub-prefect of Goueke, Ibrahima Kone, local religious leaders, health workers, and civil society actors from this sub-prefecture.

It should be noted, however, that this 1st day of the anti-Ebola vaccination campaign did not meet with great enthusiasm among the populations concerned. Despite the awareness-raising carried out in the locality, reluctance remains very strong in Goueke.

[It is disappointing that the community is reluctant to get vaccinated and is skeptical of the existence of Ebola. This distrust of governmental policies has built over time and is difficult to change. But one would think they have seen neighbors and friends die from Ebola and others who have been vaccinated be protected. - Mod.LK]

[3] West Africa: vigilance

With the Ebola virus flaring in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a new outbreak in Guinea, Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum is worried.

"This is a great concern for us, especially since the COVID and Ebola crises are occurring" simultaneously, said Muyembe, who manages DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research and is coordinating his country's responses to both infectious diseases.

A renowned expert on the Ebola virus, the 78-year-old microbiologist sees it as a more urgent threat than COVID-19 in his country. Meanwhile, the pandemic's official death toll in Africa has surpassed 100 000.

"Ebola must quickly be contained," said Muyembe, interviewed via Skype from his Kinshasa office last week. "... Then, we will be able to deal much more seriously with COVID-19. So, the priority is first Ebola and then COVID."

Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic disease that can cause severe bleeding and organ failure, resurfaced in the DRC's northeastern province of North Kivu on [7 Feb 2021], with 7 confirmed cases and 4 deaths as of Monday [22 Feb 2021]. A new outbreak in southeast Guinea, announced [14 Feb 2021], has brought 4 confirmed and 4 probable cases, including 5 deaths. It is that country's 1st outbreak since June 2016, when the world's worst one ended after more than 2 years. It killed more than 11 300 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

In past Ebola outbreaks, anywhere from 25% to 90% of infected people died, the World Health Organization reports. By comparison, the overall mortality risk of COVID-19, a respiratory disease, is 1% or less, but rises with age and risk factors, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.

Long experience with Ebola
--------------------------
Muyembe has been studying the Ebola virus ever since he first laid hands on it in 1976. While investigating a mysterious outbreak near the Ebola River in northern DRC, then known as Zaire, he collected blood samples from ailing villagers.

"Back then, we used our bare hands," with no gloves to hold a syringe, he said in an interview for the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in 2018. In retrospect, he called his survival "extraordinary. If I had not washed my hands, I would have died."

That was the 1st known Ebola outbreak. The DRC has experienced at least 11 of them, more than any other country. Outbreaks occur in the Central African nation of 105 million because of people's proximity to wildlife. The Ebola virus is believed to jump from animals, such as bats or monkeys, including when they are consumed as "bush meat."

It spreads among humans through direct contact, including through traditional burial customs that involve handling the body.

Muyembe said the resurgent virus is linked to an outbreak in the conflict-plagued northeastern provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri that was declared over last June [2020] after 22 months. More than 3400 cases were confirmed, with nearly 2300 deaths, making it the world's 2nd-largest outbreak ever.

One of the new DRC fatalities is a North Kivu woman in her 40s whose husband survived a 2020 infection. The virus, which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, has been detected in some survivors' semen and eye fluid. Muyembe said the husband "has tested negative for several months since September [2020]" and "is still negative."

Yet the genetic sequencing done by the institute's lab shows a connection between the virus that killed the woman and the earlier outbreak, the Congolese microbiologist said.

"We are really sure of that," he said. "Which means that the epidemic has developed quietly without us being able to detect it as soon as possible. ... How this outbreak has remained silent for over 6 months is a question mark."

New tools to combat Ebola
-------------------------
Some positive developments in Ebola prevention and treatment emerged, Muyembe noted, citing vaccines and drug therapies.

"We have the tools to vaccinate and to treat the sick. Thus, we break the chain of transmission, and the virus can go back into the forest," he said.

In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ervebo, a one-shot vaccine. Last July [2020], the European Union approved Zabdeno, with a 2-dose regimen.

Gains also have been made in treatment. Late last year [2020], the FDA approved 2 therapies for treating Ebola infections: the antibody cocktail Inmazeb and the human monoclonal antibody Ebanga. The DRC institute worked with the US National Institutes of Health to develop the latter, Muyembe said, noting that his team revisited promising research that Western partners had asked them to set aside more than a decade ago.

The institute has sent some of the treatment to North Kivu, Muyembe said, and "we will also send some shipments to Guinea to treat the sick. This is something we can do in the framework of African solidarity to help our friends in Guinea."

He added that Congolese health experts also would be sent there.

Distribution of the Ebola vaccine is targeted, not widespread, as is planned for COVID-19 vaccines. In part, that is because Ebola spreads through direct contact; COVID can spread from an infected person through droplets that hang in the air and are harder to avoid.

"If you're spending money manufacturing vaccine and getting it into the arms of every person in a given country, that's money that's not being spent on something else that's way more common, like (the) measles vaccine, or even other non-health-related issues," Tiffany Harris, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, told VOA.

Raising awareness
-----------------
Muyembe made a point of getting a shot in front of news cameras as soon as the Ebola vaccine was available. He will do the same with a COVID-19 vaccine, he said, to bolster public awareness and to allay suspicions of a Western ploy to sterilize or otherwise harm Africans.

Misinformation is "amplified here in Africa," Muyembe said. "It is up to us to convey the true messages of peace and security" to get people "to accept the COVID vaccine. But it's not easy."

Health authorities have ramped up public awareness campaigns in Ebola-affected areas, joining much broader COVID-19 awareness campaigns on radio, social media, and other platforms throughout Africa.

"You can end an epidemic, but you cannot end the virus," Muyembe said of Ebola. "... It can come back, so we have to be vigilant."

[It is still not clear how the 1st case, the wife of a survivor, became infected. Her husband remains negative when tested (semen is negative), but the virus genetics have demonstrated it to be an extension of the previous outbreak strain. But the virus has not been spreading rapidly, with mostly known contacts becoming infected. This is hopeful. - Mod.LK
