The two recent human cases; additional information
--------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK, 25 Aug 2000: Five city residents, including 4 from Staten Island
and one from Brooklyn, have been diagnosed with West Nile virus this year,
according to city Health Commissioner Dr. Neil L. Cohen. All are 63 or
older, he said. [Last year, 46 patients in the city required
hospitalization for the virus. Four of them died.
A New York City woman was listed in critical condition today from
complications stemming from the West Nile virus [infection. The
87-year-old Brooklyn woman, now in critical condition, was diagnosed with
the [infection on 15 Aug 2000 after she was hospitalized for an unrelated
ailment. City officials would not identify her or say which hospital she
was in. They said only that she is from the central Brooklyn neighborhood
of Borough Park.
The other patient, an 84-year-old woman from the Staten Island neighborhood
of Shore Acres, was listed in serious condition today, according to the
Health Department.
The city was planning to launch another round of ground spraying, targeting
Woodlawn Cemetery and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and the Greenwood
Cemetery and Prospect Park areas of Brooklyn. The city's southernmost
borough is a maze of lakes, ponds and wetlands, a prime breeding ground for
mosquitoes.

Sentinel chickens, in defence (of)
----------------------------------
TORONTO: They don't look like ordinary Mounties. Up close, they scratch the
dirt and swivel their heads, peck at whatever lies beneath their feet. They
are strategically placed at secret points along the border, watching,
waiting, with no clue what they are waiting for, watching for or guarding
against. They are canaries in the mine. And still they cluck. They are the
Royal Canadian Mounted Birds, an avian army guarding the world's longest
undefended border against a potential invasion from the United States. On
this side of the border, few are laughing, because the threat is real: All
of New York State was recently declared a West Nile virus alert zone.
For strategic reasons, the government has placed 360 birds at 36 sites
along the border. The exact locations of most of the coops--in the
provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec--are top secret.
[They are sited either along migratory bird routes; or are placed in
mosquito-infested areas. If a chicken, tested weekly, has developed an
antibody to West Nile virus, it means the chicken has been exposed and the
virus-carrying mosquitoes are here. However, Harvey Artsob, chief of
zoonotic diseases at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, stated that: "Right now, there is no evidence of West Nile virus
in Canada, Everything has been negative."
[Sentinel chickens are not the only detection method Canada is using. The
other is examining dead birds, [particulalrly dead crows, blue jays and
hawks. Kevin Kain, director of the tropical disease unit at Toronto General
Hospital, suggests that the government needs to look aggressively for dead
wild birds. "We need to be more vigilant, [Canada is a big country" he
said. "One could argue that we should be trapping wild birds in Canada;
certainly if someone sent [health officials a dead crow they'll test it,
but it's a very passive form of surveillance."

[The performance of sentinel chickens in New York State has attracted much
adverse comment and derision. Further north they are still held in more
esteem. -Mod.CP
