Clark County Public Health officials were among the 1st to identify a nationwide salmonellosis outbreak linked to tuna loins and tuna steaks.

Locally, the case began with 5 reports of illness to Clark County Public Health in late August 2017. Since then, the outbreak has grown to 30 cases in 7 states and led to a recall of a California-based company's tuna products.

The outbreak includes 6 confirmed and 2 presumed cases in Clark County, said Dr Alan Melnick, Clark County health officer. The investigation is continuing at the national level by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"The fact that little, old Clark county was able to be one of the 1st people to pick up on this ongoing outbreak really highlights the strengths of this system we've developed," said Madison Riethman, an applied epidemiology fellow at Clark County Public Health, during a county health board meeting Wed 25 Oct 2017.

Local health officials first learned of a possible outbreak on 29 Aug 2017, when local laboratories reported 5 cases of salmonellosis, bacteria that cause illness with symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Typically, the department gets 3 to 8 reports each month, Riethman said. "The fact that we got 5 in 1 day was a big red flag," she said.

But interviews with those sickened didn't reveal any commonalities, Riethman said. They didn't dine at the same places or attend the same event. The 5 cases didn't appear to have any connection, she said. But on 8 Sep 2017, the state public health lab reported that additional testing revealed all 5 people were sickened by salmonella with the same DNA. "They're all the same genetic pattern, which tells us they're all probably from the same place," Riethman said.

Local health officials consulted with the Oregon Health Authority and learned there were an additional 12 people in Oregon who had been sickened by the same strain of salmonella. Interviews by health officials revealed most people sickened had eaten seafood, specifically sushi or some other form of raw fish, prior to falling ill, Riethman said. Health officials in Oregon and Clark County visited all of the restaurants where those people ate -- including 3 Clark County restaurants -- and determined the culprit was likely raw tuna or raw salmon, Riethman said.

By 15 Sep 2017, the case number had grown to 25 and included 3 cases outside of the region: 2 in Hawaii and 1 in New Jersey. Later, lab testing matched cases in Texas, California, and Florida to the regional outbreak. That's when the CDC and FDA joined the investigation. And 2 weeks ago the FDA issued a recall of tuna products from the California importer linked to the outbreak, Riethman said.

Local health officials believe their efforts have curbed the outbreak in Clark county, but they continue to monitor the situation. "We haven't identified any new cases, so we hope we've at least stopped any ongoing exposures," Riethman said.

[ProMED has seen the recall notices from FDA (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm582049.htm). The report did not specifically note human cases and stated that the tuna was distributed in Washington, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, and Texas between 17 Jun 2017 and 13 Oct 2017 through food service operations, retail stores, and restaurants. Since cases have occurred in other states, other distributors are likely involved or the distribution list was not complete.

So far, the serotype of the outbreak strain has not been reported. As can be seen below, a number of serotypes of _Salmonella_ have associated with human outbreaks of salmonellosis including Nchanga, Bareilly, Weltevreden, and Paratyphi B. The Paratyphi organism linked to tuna and other types of seafood is generally the L (+) tartrate + variant of _S._ Paratyphi B was previously referred to as _S._ Java. The classical _S._ Paratyphi B has the tartrate negative phenotype and is generally invasive causing an enteric fever-like illness similar to typhoid fever. Although the tartrate positive variant can be invasive, it generally is less invasive, associated with diarrhea. - Mod.LL
