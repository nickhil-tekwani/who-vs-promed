As the world ramps up its fight against the Zika virus, West Africa is battling to contain a growing outbreak of Lassa fever with 9 people in Benin reported dead. "Right now, there are a total of 20 suspected cases with 9 deaths," government health official Orou Bagou Yorou Chabi said.

The 1st Lassa fever case in the West African country of 10 million people was listed at the Hospital of St Martin de Papane, in Tchaourou, a city 350 km (220 miles) north of Cotonou [Benin's largest city, pop. about 1 million], the United Nations children agency UNICEF said in a statement.

An ongoing epidemic in neighbouring Nigeria has already killed 84 people, out of 168 suspected cases, according to UNICEF.

Stocks of Ribavirin, a drug used to treat the infection, were being shipped to Tchaourou and Cotonou, the UN agency added.

Benin was last hit by a Lassa fever outbreak in October 2014, when 9 people suspected of having the virus died.

Lassa fever belongs to the same family as Marburg and Ebola, 2 deadly viruses that lead to infections with fever, vomiting and, in worse-case scenarios, haemorrhagic bleeding [these viruses are clinically known as hemorrhagic fever viruses but are in very different families. Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses, and Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus].

Its name is from the town of Lassa in northern Nigeria where it was initially identified in 1969.

Endemic to the region, Lassa fever is asymptomatic in 80 percent of cases but for others it can cause internal bleeding, especially when diagnosed late.

The virus is spread through contact with food or household items contaminated with rats' urine or faeces or after coming in direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

[The increase in Lassa fever cases in Benin is of concern. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety.

The circumstances under which the Lassa fever patients in Benin acquired their Lassa fever virus infections are not stated.

This is now the 5th report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin recently; the previous 3 occurred during an outbreak in 2014-2015.

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp). Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the hoime. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
