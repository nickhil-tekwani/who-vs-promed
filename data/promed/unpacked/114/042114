4963 (probable, confirmed and suspected; see Annex 1) cases and 2453 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease as of 13 Sep 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and as of 9 Sep 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Liberia... - more

[This is an increase of 597 cases and 235 deaths in the 6 days since the previous update. They are struggling to find hospital space for an average of 100 new cases a day, with only 40 being vacated daily by death and a smaller number by recovered cases. - Mod.JW]

[2] UN: USD 1 billion needed

More than USD one billion is needed to fight the West Africa Ebola outbreak, a 10-fold increase in the past month, the UN's Ebola coordinator has said. David Nabarro made the announcement as the World Health Organization (WHO) described the health crisis as "unparalleled in modern times."

It has killed 2461 people this year [2014], half of the 4985 infected by the virus, the global health body said. There has been criticism of the slow international response to the epidemic.

[3] UNICEF: call for non-physician/nurse volunteers
Date: 16 Sep 2014

The current crisis in West Africa is the largest EVD outbreak ever reported, with 26 million people, including over 4.5 million children, living in affected areas.

UNICEF is on the ground, working with community and religious leaders, youth organizations and others to fight widespread misconceptions about the disease and improve hygiene practices. UNICEF is also providing water and sanitation services to the affected communities, particularly through the procurement of water, sanitation and hygiene equipment and supplies, as well as appropriate training for the health and medical partners.

As part of our drive to tackle the EVD outbreak in West Africa, UNICEF seeks committed professionals, ready to be deployed immediately to countries in the affected area in the domains of Health and Nutrition, Communication for Development and Water and Sanitation.

Do you have the skills, competency and technical knowledge that we seek? Are you available to be deployed on short notice? UNICEF would like to hear from you. Apply to our vacancies below, and help our response to the Ebola crisis. [Please go to URL above]

[4] Former UNSG Kofi Annan speaks out on EVD
Date: 16 Sep 2014

Former United Nations' (UN) Secretary General, Kofi Annan [of Ghana] has asked other African leaders to pitch in to help the fight against the deadly Ebola virus [disease] which has claimed over [2400] lives.

He has, however, lauded [Ghana's] President John Mahama's contribution to fighting the disease in the affected West African nations. "I know that President Mahama has been in touch with the ECOWAS leaders, and they have discussed it, but I think they could do more," he remarked.

His commendation follows President Mahama's one-day [15 Sep 2014] visit to the 3 Ebola-stricken West African countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. He engaged in further discussions with the Heads of State of the respective countries and also donated some items to help feed persons in treatment centers and others currently in quarantine in isolation centers... - more

[I commented 2 days ago on ProMED that Kofi Annan would make a good international Ebola czar (see the end of ProMED post "Ebola virus disease - West Africa (163): volunteers, Sierra Leone, Liberia," Archive No. 20140914.2772161), so I am happy to see he has now leapt into the fray. - Mod.JW]

[5] USA: more on aid program, official

As the President has stated, the EVD epidemic in West Africa and the humanitarian crisis there is a top national security priority for the United States. In order to contain and combat it, we are partnering with the United Nations and other international partners to help the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal respond just as we fortify our defenses at home. Every outbreak of EVD over the past 40 years has been contained, and we are confident that this one can -- and will be -- as well.

Our strategy is predicated on 4 key goals:
- Controlling the epidemic at its source in West Africa;
- Mitigating 2nd-order impacts, including blunting the economic, social, and political tolls in the region;
- Engaging and coordinating with a broader global audience; and
- Fortifying global health security infrastructure in the region and beyond...
Also:
- U.S. Africa Command will set up a Joint Force Command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia...
- U.S. Africa Command will establish a regional intermediate staging base (ISB)...
- Command engineers will build additional Ebola Treatment Units in affected areas, and the U.S. Government will help recruit and organize medical personnel to staff them.
- Additionally, the Command will establish a site to train up to 500 health care providers per week.
- The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is preparing to deploy 65 Commissioned Corps officers to Liberia to manage and staff a previously announced Department of Defense (DoD) hospital to care for healthcare workers who become ill...
- USAID will airlift 50 000 home health care kits from Denmark to Liberia to be hand-delivered to distant communities by trained youth volunteers...
- More than 100 CDC personnel are on the ground in West Africa...
- In August [2014], USAID deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa... DART will be airlifting 130 000 sets of personal protective equipment ... and generators that will provide electricity to Ebola treatment units...
- DoD plans to send a field-deployable hospital to Liberia and has provided more than 10 000 Ebola test kits to the Liberian Institute of Biological Research and to Sierra Leone's Kenema Government Hospital [We didn't know the FDA had approved the military test kit. - Mod.JW].
- DoD's Cooperative Threat Reduction program is redirecting USD 25 million to provide personal protective equipment and laboratory reagents, support for technical advisors, and other requests...
- Last month [August 2014], USAID airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia... DART airlifted 5000 body bags to step up support for the safe removal and transport of the bodies of Ebola victims and 500 infrared thermometers.. - and much more...

More than 71 metric tons of food have been delivered to the country's various health teams in 8 counties ... for distribution to some 4600 people in holding and isolation centers, the Foreign Ministry says.
