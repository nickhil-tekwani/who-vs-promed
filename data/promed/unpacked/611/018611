A confirmed case of epizootic hemorrhagic disease was discovered in a
white-tailed deer in the Williamsport area in late summer [2011], and
other cases have been reported in the Clear Spring area, according to
a Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) official.

Brian Eyler, deer project leader for the DNR, said he's not concerned
about the disease, which does not affect humans, but the agency will
continue to monitor it. The part of the deer population that isn't
genetically resistant to hemorrhagic disease will bounce back, he
said.

There are cases of the disease every year in Maryland, but in some
years that number rises to about 200, with fewer than 10 cases in a
low year, Eyler said. The number of reported cases this year [2011] is
approaching 100, he said.

More of a concern is chronic wasting disease, a case of which was
confirmed in a white-tailed deer harvested by a hunter in neighboring
Allegany County in November 2010, according to Eyler and the DNR
website.

However, there have been no new cases in Maryland since then, Eyler
said.

Chronic wasting disease is similar to mad cow disease, Eyler said.
There's no indication humans can contract chronic wasting disease, but
research hasn't proven that with 100 percent certainty, he said.

"We recommend that hunters don't consume any kind of a strange or
sick-acting animal," Eyler said.

Archery season for deer began in September 2011, and muzzle-loader
season begins next week [week of 17 Oct 2011]. In general, people
should wear gloves when handling deer or other wildlife, such as
surgical gloves when cleaning game, Eyler said.

Whether it's chronic wasting disease or hemorrhagic disease, DNR
officials want to know if people have seen a sick or strange-acting
deer, Eyler said. Some of the signs for the diseases are similar, with
deer that have contracted either disease experiencing a loss of
coordination, Eyler said.

Deer with chronic wasting disease will get thin and emaciated before
they die, he said. "They literally will waste away," Eyler said.

Deer with hemorrhagic disease often are found near water because the
virus causes a high fever so deer seek to quench their thirst, he
said. They might exhibit tremors and have trouble standing, but would
not have open wounds other than in the mouth, Eyler said.

If a dead deer or a group of dead deer are found, and it appears
suspicious, call DNR officials, Eyler said. If the carcass is fresh, a
sample can be taken for testing.

The Washington County case of hemorrhagic disease that was confirmed
in a lab was reported at the Potomac Fish and Game Club near
Williamsport in late August or early September [2011], Eyler said.

Other cases of hemorrhagic disease have been reported in Frederick
County, Kent County, and Southern Maryland, Eyler said. Hemorrhagic
disease is transmitted by biting midges, a type of gnat.

He encourages anyone who sees a sick or strange-acting deer to call
their local DNR office. In Washington County, call 301-842-0332. For

[The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) belong to the genus
_Orbivirus_, family Reoviridae. Of the 10 serotypes of EHDV known
worldwide, the only 2 serotypes currently endemic in North America are
EHDV-1 and EHDV-2.

The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological
vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North
America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats
and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV. Infected deer can be viremic
for up to 2 months.

The incubation period for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer is
5-10 days.

When a hard freeze arrives, likely the midges will die and the deer
deaths from this disease will stop. - Mod.TG]
