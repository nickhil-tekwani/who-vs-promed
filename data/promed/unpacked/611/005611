Severe pollution of water supplies in Mazar-e Sharif in northern
Afghanistan has brought about an outbreak of dangerous infectious diseases
and the death of residents. International relief organizations confirmed
the outbreak of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera in Mazar-e Sharif and
said on Monday [24th August this week that the water sources of the town
should be purified and (?chlorinated) following the latest fighting there.
Hospitals in Mazar-e Sharif, which in any case were unable to function
properly before the latest fighting, are now completely unable to carry out
any tasks and attempts by international relief organizations to ensure that
the Taleban allowed their activity in the town were fruitless. The
International Red Crescent and Red Cross has managed only on one occasion
to take medicine supplies to the town.
