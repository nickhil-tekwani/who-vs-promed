4 kangaroos at zoo die of parasitic infection
---------------------------------------------
A parasite usually harmless to humans [a debatable statement. - Mod.AS. It
can cause severe disease in the immunocompromised, the fetus and
occasionally in healthy people. - Mod.DK] but deadly to marsupials killed 4
of the Indianapolis Zoo's 9 red kangaroos this month.
Dashi, Lucy, Ballina and Yarra died after coming into contact with a
single-celled parasite called _Toxoplasma gondii_, which most often is
carried in the feces of cats. No cats are kept on zoo grounds, but strays
find a way in.
Another infected kangaroo, Logan, is recovering at the zoo hospital. The
remaining 4 are healthy and on display.
The deaths do not increase the risk that people who visit the zoo will get
the parasite, doctors said. The zoo can't do much to protect the 4 healthy
kangaroos -- Yampi, Sydney, Durango and Lursa -- if the parasite remains in
their exhibit's soil. Doctors say millions of Americans have been exposed
but that the vast majority do not get sick.
"It should not be a problem because it's not transmitted directly from a
kangaroo to a person," said James Howell, veterinary epidemiologist with
the Indiana State Department of Health. The dead kangaroos are cremated.
Red kangaroos are the largest living marsupials. Females average 60 pounds,
while males run about 120, and the animals can reach 5 feet in length. They
feed on grass, plants and, at this zoo, flavored bagels as treats.
Yarra, a 5-year-old, was the first to fall ill at the end of June. She was
moved to a stall in the zoo hospital and given antibiotics but died a few
days later. Zoo workers didn't know what the cause was until tissue samples
were examined in a lab near Seattle.
Losing half of an animal collection is common in disease outbreaks, said
Jeff Proudfoot, the zoo's senior veterinarian. Kangaroos and wallabies are
especially susceptible to the parasite, though nobody knows why. About 10
years ago, wallabies were lost in a disease outbreak at the zoo, and the
West Nile virus killed several lorikeets 2 years ago.
The zoo's most high-profile loss recently was the death of an elephant
calf. Amali, the world's first African elephant conceived through
artificial insemination, died in June 2003.
The zoo has had plans to add 2 kangaroos from Dickerson Park Zoo in
Springfield, Mo., to the collection since before the outbreak.
For many zoo visitors, one kangaroo looks like another. Many passers-by
Thursday stopped only briefly in the heat to look at the kangaroos and emus
that shared an enclosure.
But some who cared for the kangaroos took the deaths hard.
"I had a special attachment to Dashi and Yarra," said keeper Holly Balok.
They basically look like stuffed animals that are alive. They feel as soft
as they look."
Balok was cleaning the wild dog pool at the zoo when another keeper told
her the news about Yarra.
"It was a shock because we weren't sure what was wrong with her and why she
was sick," Balok said. But she knew something was wrong because Yarra
wasn't eating at night.
"Usually they're ravenous when they come in and eat immediately," Balok
said. "When they vary from that routine, a light bulb goes off.
"You just know."

[Outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in wild and captive marsupials, with high
mortality, have been described in scientific literature for several
decades. Affected animals may exhibit diarrhea, respiratory compromise,
lethargy, weight loss, blindness, or neurological deficits.
The susceptibility of Tammar wallabies (_Macropus eugenii_) has been
demonstrated experimentally: 13 animals were dosed orally with 500, 1000,
or 10 000 oocysts of _Toxoplasma gondii_, as part of a vaccination trial.
11 animals died of acute toxoplasmosis 9 to 15 days after challenge. The
lesions were similar in all animals, consisting of foci of necrosis and
inflammation in the intestines, lymphoid tissue, adrenal cortex, heart,
skeletal muscle and brain, and severe generalised pulmonary congestion and
edema. See Reddacliff et al (1993): Pathology of experimentally-induced,
acute toxoplasmosis in macropods; Aust Vet J. 70(1):4-6. - Mod.AS]
