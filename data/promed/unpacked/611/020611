[Unfortunately, this report has not yet included information about
the species involved. Newcastle disease has occurred in poultry,
ducks, and quail in the previous outbreaks referenced below.
It is important to remember laboratory confirmation is the best way
to distinguish avian influenza from Newcastle disease as the clinical
signs are similar enough to make a definitive diagnosis based on
signs, symptoms, and gross necropsy unreliable.
The disease location is in the middle of the large island of Honshu
near the Sea of Japan. It is approximately 300 km. northwest of
Tokyo -- see map at
