--------------------------------------
Accounting for translation problems, and there seem to be more than a few, it is most likely that the 3 locations are one and the same. The "Al-Inam" in the 1st post is a poor transliteration of the Arabic word that denotes livestock. Slaughterhouses are usually located in or near livestock markets.

It is highly unlikely a farm is involved: "farm" is not to be found in the Arabic original for the same story, which can be found here: https://goo.gl/qAlnTY.

Rather than being a new study, it seems to be an outcome of the continued surveillance by the Ministry of Agriculture of the same market where 11 out of 20 camels earlier tested positive. Disposal of dead animals, mentioned twice in the Arabic, is not found in the translation. And nowhere in the Arabic did I find any word that represents "dealers," a subject of an RFI by Mod.AS.

These continuing translation problems, perhaps coupled with ignorance of camel ecology in modern Saudi Arabia, may be feeding the body of wrong information noted recently here by Professor Wernery.

[Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo's observations regarding transliterations from the Arabic language are welcomed and much appreciated. Unfortunately, we have on many occasions to rely upon English sources, such as -- in this case -- the Saudi "Arab News" (via Thomson Reuters Zawya). Authentic Arab sources, translated by professionals, would be preferable and most welcomed.

The said source included the following: "Habed bin Abdulaziz Al-Batshaan, undersecretary for animal resources at the Agriculture Ministry, said preventative measures must continue to be taken by dealers, with mandatory use of gloves and masks." This quote (and indeed "the mandatory use of gloves and masks by dealers," apparently, in the market) were addressed in the commentary, asking whether the described measures are restricted to dealers, to animal markets, and to slaughterhouses only (http://www.promedmail.org/post/3995194). From Dr Shamsudeen's observations, it appears that the said (rather severe) hygiene measures may refer to personnel of the slaughterhouse as well, since "slaughterhouses are usually located in or near livestock markets." Is this indeed the case?

We are always grateful to our readers who alert us to errors, although, of course, we try to keep them to a minimum. First-hand information from experts on the ground familiar with camel ecology in the Middle East, such as Dr Shamsudeen and Prof Wernery, are treasured.

The delay of Dr Shamsudeen's comment, due to technicalities, is regretted but does not affect its importance.

In reference to the MERS-in-camels issue, subscribers may find the following recent publication describing experimental MERS-CoV infection trials in young camels of particular interest. We are grateful to ProMED-mail rapporteur Joseph Dudley for its submission.

"Introduction: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus causing an ongoing outbreak in man, sometimes resulting in severe or even fatal pneumonia. Dromedary camels are suggested to be the reservoir host for MERS-CoV. Infected dromedaries shed the virus predominantly from the nose but show no or only mild disease. To elucidate the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection, we inoculated dromedary camels with MERS-CoV.

"Materials and Methods: Four 6- to 8-month-old dromedaries, serologically negative for MERS-CoV, were inoculated intranasally with MERS-CoV. Collection of swabs and evaluation of clinical signs were performed daily. The dromedaries were killed 4 or 14 days (n = 2 per day) after inoculation. Necropsy examinations were performed and samples of respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues were taken for pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in-situ hybridization (ISH) and virology.

"Results: The dromedaries demonstrated moderate rhinitis with nasal discharge, tracheitis and bronchitis associated with the presence of MERS-CoV by virus titration, intralesional virus antigen by IHC and viral RNA by ISH. High virus titres were excreted from the nose up to 6 days after inoculation. Virus antigen was present in a few cells of lymphoid organs such as pulmonary, tracheal and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils, but not in other respiratory or extra-respiratory tissues.

"Conclusions: Experimental MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries predominantly causes upper respiratory tract disease with no/mild clinical respiratory signs, which corresponds with the role of dromedaries as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. Studies on the vaccination of dromedaries against MERS-CoV are still ongoing." - Mod.AS
