--------------------------------------------------------------------
The ProMED update, which quoted the Global Dispatch, overlooks the 2012 WNV outbreak in Illinois. Among the Great Lakes/North Central states, Illinois has a decade-long history of recurring peaks in West Nile virus cases associated with warm, dry climatic conditions. The CDC list of cases shows that the top 4 states were Texas (33 per cent of 2012 cases in the US), California (8 per cent), Louisiana (6 per cent), and Illinois (5 per cent). Mosquito to bird transmission is often detected throughout most of the state; however, the majority of the human cases are in the greater Chicago area, which encompasses over one-half of the state's population.

[ProMED-mail thanks Richard Lampman for pointing out the recurring public health problems that West Nile virus (WNV) infections pose in Illinois, including in urban/suburban foci of transmission in the Chicago area. In fact, some of the recent field studies showing the role of certain bird species, such as the American robin, in WNV transmission have been done in this area by Goldberg and colleagues. WNV will doubtless continue to cause human and equine infections in Illinois and be influenced by climatic conditions.
