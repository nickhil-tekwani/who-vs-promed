re: Mortality rate: for what it's worth we're getting high local mortality rates in at least 2 other areas (Caen, 11/28) and the ferry crossing (10 and counting of an estimated 25-30). I've been wondering about this fact at odd moments. Perhaps it is related to high local densities in small areas.

[The traditional mortality rate in anthrax outbreaks among wood bison is that more than 83 percent deaths are mature bulls. It is unusual to see a more even distribution. But in these high mortalities it is clear from the numbers that bison cows are dying.

The 2 incidents mentioned by Terry, at Caen and Ferry Crossing, remind of the outbreak at Peace River some 5+ years ago when some 12-16 animals were found dead close together on one meadow. The possible key factor was that the mortality was more evenly distributed between the bulls and the cows instead of being more than 80 percent males. I suspect this is the case at Caen and Ferry Crossing. Could it be that in these localities there were just these breeding mobs as targets for feeding flies and no other distracting animals within a mile or so?

For the moment if we presume that 90 percent of the survivors will have significant antibody titres, which is not unlikely, the single fly bite cannot be lethal, or seldom so. If I were to guess, and I have zero data, I would suspect that to kill a bison necessitates some "5 bites" of contaminated mouthparts; certainly more than one or 2 bites. It cannot be a big number because at maximum distances, such as more than 15 km [9 mi], only single cattle are found dead. And to return to the Caen and Ferry Crossing mortality rates, this hypothesis would say that with a small mob the snacking female flies with contaminated mouthparts are forced to return again and again to the same animal to feed. In a big mob they would be distracted by the large number of available bison to visit and snack on.
