2 people died of anthrax in Russia's Republic of North
Ossetia-Alania, the Emergency Situations Ministry's department in the
Southern Federal District told Itar-Tass on Wed, 8 Nov 2006.
Both cases were reported in Mozdok. The deaths, supposedly caused by
anthrax, were reported on 25 Oct 2006 and 7 Nov 2006. The samples and
test results sent to the Stavropol research institute confirmed the
diagnosis. At present, medical experts are trying to find out the
sources of the deadly disease.

The Mozdok regional government in Russia's North Ossetia region
confirmed Thu, 9 Nov 2006 that 2 women had died of anthrax after
coming into contact with the carcass of a cow, probably brought into
Mozdok from the neighboring Stavropol region.
One of the women who died was engaged in purchasing meat in the
Stavropol region and selling it at the market in the town of Mozdok,
and the regional government said she had brought the infected meat
from Stavropol, but it was impossible to establish at this time where
exactly the woman bought the meat there.
The government also said it was impossible to establish whether the
woman had managed to sell any of the infected meat in Mozdok before
she died. The market in Mozdok has been disinfected and cattle in
the region are being monitored for signs of the disease.

[No information about the clinical course of these 2 fatal cases or
whether any therapeutic intervention was given is in these posts. It
is possible that the form of anthrax was gastrointestinal, which can
be fatal -- often thought to be uniformly fatal -- related to
ingestion of anthrax spores.
Information about GI anthrax can be found at Sirisanthana T, Brown
AE: Anthrax of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Emerg Infect Dis
2002;8:649-51 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol8no7/02-0062.htm>.
The authors stress that the disease is probably greatly
under-reported in rural disease-endemic areas of the world and that
the spectrum of disease, ranging from no symptoms to death, has not
been fully appreciated.
The location of and information about the Russian Republic of North
Ossetia-Alania can be found at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ossetia-Alania>. At its eastern
border is the Stavropol region.
