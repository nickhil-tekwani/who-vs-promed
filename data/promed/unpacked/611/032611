9th case of autochthonous _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria in Greece in 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 27 Sep 2012, The Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) reported one new [_P. vivax_ malaria autochthonous case] in Greece.

The case is located in Abdera city, Xanthi regional unit, part of the region of East Macedonia and Thrace (map 4 [available at the source URL above]). It is the 1st time that this area is reporting a _P. vivax_ malaria case.

On 3 Sep 2012, KEELPNO reported 2 additional cases in 2 areas already affected by _P. vivax_ malaria in 2012 (eWEB no 230 [http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_230_14_08_12.pdf]):
- One case in Evrotas municipality, Laconia regional unit (Peloponnese region).
- One case in Markopoulo Mesogaia municipality, East Attica regional unit (Attica region).

To date, a total of 9 autochthonous cases infected in 2012 have been reported in 3 different regions in Greece:
- 4 in East Attica regional unit. The 1st autochthonous malaria case was reported on 18 Jun 2012 (eWEB no 224 http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_224_04_06_12.pdf
- 4 in Evrotas municipality, Laconia regional unit, Peloponnese region.
- 1 in Xanthi regional unit, East Macedonia and Thrace region.

[The present report brings the number of autochthonous vivax cases up to 9 in 2012. It is urgent to know whether the 2012 cases represent relapses in patients infected in 2011, or whether local transmission is occurring in the area where the patients live.

The new case reported here is the 1st case from the East Macedonia and Thrace Region, but if the case is a relapse of an infection acquired in 2011, it does not represent local transmission.

The temperate variant of _P. vivax_ has an incubation period of 8-9 months. Genotyping can determine if the _P. vivax_ is of the temperate or tropical variant (Miao M et al. BMC Evol Biol. 2012; 12: 22), but this has to our knowledge not been done. Another possibility is a detailed travel history in Greece in 2011 of the 9 patients. If they were close to the 2011 hotspots in that year they may have been infected there, travelled to their present location, and experienced their 1st malaria attack 8-9 months later. - Mod.EP]
