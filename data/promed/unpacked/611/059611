Egyptian toddler contracts bird flu virus
-----------------------------------------
An Egyptian toddler has contracted the highly pathogenic bird flu
virus, the latest in an upswing of cases in the most populous Arab
country, stated news agency MENA said on Friday [3 Apr 2009]. The
case brings to 62 the number of confirmed cases of the H5N1 avian
influenza virus in Egypt, which has been hit harder by bird flu than
any other country outside of Asia and has reported 7 human infections
since 1 Mar 2009.

The 21-month-old boy is from the province of Beheira in northern
Egypt and was in a "good" condition after being treated with the
antiviral drug Tamiflu, MENA reported. The new infection came several
days after a 2-year-old boy from the same province contracted the virus.

MENA did not say how the child contracted the virus, but most
Egyptians who have fallen ill with bird flu are believed to have
contracted the virus from infected household birds. Egypt is one of
the few countries affected by bird flu that does not compensate
farmers when poultry is destroyed, though many experts say this is
the best way to ensure the rapid detection of new outbreaks.

Since 2003 the H5N1 avian influenza virus has infected at least 410
people in 15 countries and killed 254 of them. It has killed or
forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in
Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Some 23 Egyptians have
died after contracting the virus, most after coming into contact with
infected domestic birds in a country where roughly 5 million
households depend on domestically raised poultry as a significant
source of food and income.

[This case is significant in that it is the 2nd young child to have
contracted avian influenza virus infection in Beheira governorate in
the course of a few days. It is assumed that these are independent
events, but that information has not been provided.
