Independent tests carried out in Italy have confirmed the presence for the
1st time of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in poultry from the West
African nation of Togo, officials said.
"The results of the tests from the world reference laboratory in Padua have
come in: it is clearly H5N1," said agriculture minister, Yves Nagou Mado.
Several thousand poultry birds have been found dead in Togo recently, most
of them in the past week on the one farm in Sigbehoue, 45 km (30 mi) east
of the capital Lome.
The agriculture ministry said last week [18-24 Jun 2007], that measures had
been taken to try and contain the possible spread of the virus, notably the
slaughtering and disposal of infected poultry.

Bird flu has spread to another district in Bangladesh forcing health and
veterinary workers to cull 5000 chickens, officials said on Wednesday [27
Jun 2007].
The latest case was reported from a village in Thakurgaon district, 500 km
(310 mi) north west of the capital, Dhaka, said Abdul Motalib, a senior
officer of the fisheries and livestock ministry.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu was 1st detected near the capital Dhaka, in
central Bangladesh, in March [2007], and has since spread to northern
districts. The virus has affected 16 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh, but
there have been no reported cases of human infection.
About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated with
poultry farming.

[3] Czech Republic (Moravia): swan

Public Czech Television (CT) and Aktualne.cz news server reported Wednesday
[27 Jun 2007] that Czech veterinaries revealed another case of bird flu, as
tests confirmed the virus in a swan that died in Lednice, south Moravia.
Further tests have yet to confirm whether the virus is the deadly H5N1
strain, said Jaroslav Salava, who heads the veterinary administration in
south Moravia. He said that the result of the tests would be known on
Thursday [28 Jun 2007], or later.
The Lednice water reservoirs are one of the most risky areas through which
many wild birds move, but from the veterinary point of view it is a rather
good locality, as there are no big bird [poultry] farms around, Salava said.
Turkeys at a farm in Tisova, east Bohemia, tested positive for H5N1 last
week [18-24 Jun 2007] and those who did not die of bird flu had to be
culled. Today [28 Jun 2007], the deadly virus was confirmed at another farm
near Tisova.
In 2006, 14 cases of bird flu were registered in the Czech Republic, all in
swans living in the wild.
