One new case of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria from the Dominican Republic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 18 Feb 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
received reports of 21 cases of malaria in travelers to resort areas of the
Dominican Republic.
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria has been confirmed in 5 patients from the
United States, 6 from Canada, and 10 from European countries, all of whom had
recently traveled to areas of the Dominican Republic where malaria had not
previously been reported. All returned home between 3 Nov 2004 and 10 Jan
2005.
***CDC continues to recommend that all travelers to La Altagracia Province,
including the Punta Cana resort area, should take an antimalarial drug
(prophylaxis). In addition, an antimalarial drug is recommended for travelers
to rural areas throughout the country.***
Chloroquine is the recommended drug for the Dominican Republic. Antimalarial
drugs taken correctly and consistently, along with other measures to prevent
mosquito bites, have been shown to be effective in preventing malaria.
However, CDC has rescinded recommendations for malaria prophylaxis for Duarte
Province because no new cases have been reported from the area in the last 2
months, the epidemiologic investigation by the Ministry of Health of the
Dominican Republic did not reveal any new cases, and their surveillance
system did not detect any cases of malaria in the province in recent years.
The Ministry of Health in the Dominican Republic has implemented malaria
control measures, including intensified surveillance, prompt case management,
and intensive mosquito control activities.
