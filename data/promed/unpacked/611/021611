A major outbreak of lead poisoning in children has been occurring in
Zamfara State, Nigeria since at least March 2010, related to the
processing of lead-rich ore for the extraction of gold.

During March-April 2010, the Zamfara State Ministry of Health was
informed by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) of an increasing number of
childhood deaths and illnesses in villages in the 2 Local Government
Areas (LGAs) of Bukkuyum and Anka. At the request of the Nigerian
Federal Ministry of Health, the United States Centers for Disease
Control (US CDC) deployed a response team to assist in investigating
this outbreak. At the same time, the Blacksmith Institute sent a team
from TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc to conduct an
environmental assessment.

These teams worked with the national and state authorities, MSF, and
the country office of the World Health Organization (WHO). The
investigations confirmed severe lead poisoning in more than 100
children in the villages of Dareta and Yargalma, with a mean blood
lead concentration of 119 g/dL (levels as low as 10 g/dL are
associated with impaired neurological development in young children).
Moreover, lead concentrations in soil of greater than 100 000 ppm
were found in and around habitations in the villages (the limit for
residential areas applied in the USA and France is 400 ppm).

WHO Response:
The Nigerian authorities requested WHO to provide further technical
and financial assistance to contain the current outbreak and prevent
similar outbreaks in the future. WHO deployed a team comprising 3
epidemiologists, a clinical toxicologist, a pediatrician, an
environmental health expert and a laboratory specialist. This team,
working with staff from the State Ministry of Health, confirmed a
high degree of environmental lead contamination from the same cause
in 5 additional villages (Tungar-dadj, Abare, Duza and Sunke (Ank
LGA)).

A random sample of 56 children under 5 years from the villages of
Abare and Tungar-guru revealed that greater than 90 percent had blood
lead concentrations above 45 g/dL (for which chelation therapy is
recommended), and greater than 70 percent had concentrations above 70
g/dL (for which urgent treatment is needed). A high incidence of
convulsions and death in young children has been noted in these
villages, and there is a strong likelihood that this is due to lead
poisoning. An extrapolation from the above figures suggests that
greater than 2000 individuals are in need of chelation therapy in the
5 villages. Data from the State Ministry of Health hospital registry
suggest there are still more villages where lead poisoning may be a
problem.

Situation Update:
MSF is currently providing chelation therapy for around 100 children
in 2 specially established units within the general hospitals of
Bukkuyum and Anka. WHO has been collaborating with MSF and a number
of international clinical toxicologists on the development of
treatment protocols. The WHO team has also helped to set up a
laboratory service for measuring blood lead concentrations in Gusau
and has provided training in surveillance and the management of lead
poisoning.

In order to prevent further deaths and long-term neurological
impairment in affected children, it is essential that the lead
contamination is removed from villages and particularly the domestic
compounds. In addition, it is essential that poisoned children are
identified and given appropriate chelation therapy. For chelation
therapy to be effective, however, children must be removed from
exposure to lead, which means that they cannot return to their homes
after treatment until their environment has been cleaned.

The Blacksmith Institute and TerraGraphics are working with the
Zamfara State authorities to decontaminate the villages of Dareta and
Yargalma. Considerably more resources are needed to decontaminate the
other 5 villages and to identify and treat all of the children as
well as affected adults (in particular pregnant women) in these
villages.

WHO is working with its UN partners to mobilize funds to deal with
this unprecedented environmental emergency.

[Lead is a naturally occurring bluish-gray metal found in small
amounts in the earth's crust. Lead can be found in all parts of our
environment. Much of it comes from human activities including burning
fossil fuels, mining, and manufacturing.

Lead has many different uses. It is used in the production of
batteries, ammunition, metal products (solder and pipes), and devices
to shield X-rays. Because of health concerns, lead from gasoline,
paints and ceramic products, caulking, and pipe solder has been
dramatically reduced in recent years.

There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect
many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can
cause severe emergency symptoms.

However, it is more common for lead poisoning to build up slowly over
time. This occurs from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In
this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low
levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The
health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets
higher.

Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can
affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the
child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most
vulnerable.

Possible complications include: behavior or attention problems,
failure at school, hearing problems, kidney damage, reduced IQ, and
slowed body growth.

The symptoms of lead poisoning may include: abdominal pain and
cramping (usually the 1st sign of a high, toxic dose of lead poison),
aggressive behavior, anemia, constipation, difficulty sleeping,
headaches, irritability, loss of previous developmental skills (in
young children), low appetite and energy, reduced sensations.

Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, staggering walk, muscle
weakness, seizures, or coma.

Adults who have had mildly high lead levels often recover without
problems. In children, even mild lead poisoning can have a permanent
impact on attention and IQ. People with higher lead levels have a
greater risk of long-lasting health problems. They must be followed
carefully.

Their nerves and muscles can be greatly affected and may no longer
function as well as they should. Other body systems may be harmed to
various degrees, such as the kidneys and blood vessels. People who
survive toxic lead levels may have some permanent brain damage.
Children are more vulnerable to serious long-term problems. A
complete recovery from chronic lead poisoning may take months to
years.

The article recommended chelation therapy, a process of binding the
lead so it can be removed from the body. Clelators for lead include
calcium-disodium EDTA, which is usually administered intravenously
over several days in a hospital, and succimer (DMSA), which does not
require hospitalization. Succimer (Chemet) has become the preferred
chelating agent for less severe cases because it can be given by
mouth.

The article does not tell us how close the mining operations are to
the villages, how much lead they are emitting or if the mine has been
closed. It is important to clean the environment to prevent a 2nd
round of poisoning in those people who receive treatment.
