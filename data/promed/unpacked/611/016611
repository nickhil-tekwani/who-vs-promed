With Asian soybean rust [ASR] nipping at its heels, the Southeast soybean
crop is nearing the finish line. As pods fill and rust-ravaged leaves fall,
R-6 designation and safety can't come soon enough for producers.
Bob Kermerait, Georgia Extension plant pathologist, stated on 9 Sep 2005
that, except for the northeastern and northwestern parts of the state, ASR
is showing up in commercial fields. Soybeans are either at -- or
approaching -- full seed. The understanding is once they reach that level
of maturity, the crop is fairly safe from ASR.
The 1st 2 weeks of September saw more discoveries of the disease in
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.
ASR remains a threat in Alabama but may be slowing. After a spate of
findings in August, state officials announced just 1 new case in the last 2
weeks in a Chilton County sentinel plot. Ed Sikora, Alabama Extension plant
pathologist, said that much of the crop is being harvested or is nearing it
but "we have quite a few double-crop beans still at risk."
In Georgia, where yields look "very good," September findings have been in
Spalding, Tatnall, Tift, Washington, Laurens, and Marion counties. "Most
growers are very aware of what they're facing with this disease," said
Kemerait. He believes the critical thing now is with growers whose crops
are still in early pod-fill stages. With the plentiful amount of ASR now in
the state there's reason to be worried for them.
Defoliation is occurring in some Georgia fields, but Kemerait is happy it
isn't at the level feared prior to the season's start. "Information out of
Brazil indicated there would be massive defoliation within 2 weeks of
initial infection. That hasn't happened here. ASR isn't moving as quickly
here as it has in Brazil."
But Kermerait said there is no question that ASR is now "definitely
well-established in the state."
