The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said it believes limited
human-to-human transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus did occur
in an Indonesian family in May. But it said that the incident did not
signal a major change in the spread of the disease. The WHO made its
announcement at the end of a 3-day bird flu conference in the
Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The case of 7 family members who died from bird flu has drawn
attention to Indonesia's growing problem. Ending the closed-door
conference, the WHO said its investigation suggested the virus had
been passed between the family members in Sumatra. The WHO also found
that the virus had mutated in one case, but not in a way that made it
more easily transmissible between people.
Nevertheless, according to both the WHO and Indonesian government,
the virus is widespread among poultry in the country and the focus
should now be on implementing Indonesia's national strategy to
contain bird flu. To do that, they said, the country would need
funding. Indonesia has asked for $900 million over the next 3 years
to tackle the virus.
In Indonesia, 39 people are now known to have died from the disease.
The virus cannot yet pass easily from one person to another. But
experts fear it could mutate and in its new form trigger a flu
pandemic, potentially putting millions of human lives at risk.

An Indonesian man who died of H5N1 bird flu caught it from his
10-year-old son, the first laboratory-confirmed case of
human-to-human transmission of the disease, according to a World
Health Organization investigation of an unusual family cluster of
bird-flu cases.
The investigators also found that the virus mutated slightly when the
son had the disease, although not in any way that would allow it to
pass more readily among people. Flu viruses like H5N1 mutate
constantly, although most of the mutations are insignificant
biologically; that appears to be have been the case in the Indonesian cluster.
"Yes, it is slightly altered, but in a way that viruses commonly
mutate," said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the World Health
Organization in Geneva, describing the findings, which were not
publicly released. "But that didn't make it more transmissible, or
cause more severe disease."
The greater importance of the slightly modified virus is that it
allowed researchers from the organization and the United States
Centers for Disease Control to document for the first time that the
virus almost certainly passed from the son directly to his father.
In previous cases where human-to-human transmission was suspected,
scientists were not able to say for sure, either because test samples
from the patients were not available or because the virus in the
patients was the same as that found in poultry in the area.
Scientists say the H5N1 virus, which has killed hundreds of millions
of birds worldwide, does not spread easily to humans or among them.
But they have worried that it might, through normal biological
processes, acquire the ability to do so, potentially setting off a
devastating human pandemic.
More than 200 people have contracted bird flu around the world,
almost all of them after very close contact with infected birds.
International health officials have been in Indonesia for much of the
past month, investigating a family outbreak that affected 7 relatives
in a remote region of Sumatra, 6 of whom died.
Although Indonesia has been struggling all year to control a series
of bird flu outbreaks in poultry, the family on Sumatra had no known
direct contact with sick birds, although the first death in the
family was a woman who sold vegetables in a market that also sold birds.
Scientists have suspected that H5N1, though an avian virus, could
also spread from person to person in rare cases if there were
prolonged close contact.
The family members in the cluster had a banquet in late April 2006,
when the vegetable merchant was already ill and coughing
heavily. Some spent the night in the same small room with her. Some
members also cared for their relatives when they were sick.
In hospitals, doctors and nurses generally wear masks when treating
people who may have bird flu.
The first 5 family members to fall ill had identical strains of H5N1,
one that is common in animals in Indonesia. But the virus mutated
slightly in the 6th victim, the 10-year-old boy, and he apparently
passed the mutated virus to his father. The presence of that mutation
allowed the lab to confirm the route of transmission.
Still, Mr. Thompson said there was no evidence that the mutated virus
is any better adapted to human infection than before. In fact, the
World Health Organization has been following 54 neighbors and family
members who lived near the family for a month, and none has
contracted the virus.

[This statement, issued at the end of the 3-day FAO/MOH/WHO closed
meeting in Jakarta, while confirming the reality of person-to-person
transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus, leaves unresolved the
questions of the origin of the infection initiating the 7-case
cluster in northern Sumatra and why this group of blood relatives
were particularly vulnerable to infection. Further information is
still awaited. - Mod.CP]
