The number of reported malaria cases in Ethiopia has risen sharply
amid fears it could get worse during the "malaria transmission
season," which runs from June to October, the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. "A total of 77
kebeles [administrative zones] were affected by malaria epidemics in
May and June [2005], with 18 911 cases and 42 reported deaths," OCHA
said in a humanitarian update on Monday [8 Aug 2005]. It warned that
the current amount of drugs and insecticide-treated nets being
imported into the country would be inadequate if there were an
epidemic. The highest number of cases, OCHA said, had been reported
to the Ethiopian federal ministry of health from several regions,
including Tigray in the north, Amhara and Afar in north central,
Oromiya, Somali in the east and Benshangul-Gumuz in the west.
Data from Tigray, for example, showed 20 000 cases with 21 deaths in
June 2005 compared to 2000 cases for the same period in 2004. Malaria
is the 3rd biggest killer in Ethiopia, claiming at least 100 000
people a year, according to the country's health ministry. A child is
killed every 30 seconds by the disease throughout the African
continent. Most of Ethiopia's 70 million people live in rural areas,
where health services are poor or non-existent. Many of them are
highly exposed to malaria.

[It is estimated that there are between 4 and 5 million malaria cases
in Ethiopia each year. The geographical distribution depends mainly
on altitude. The distribution of malaria in Ethiopia can found at
<http://www.mara.org.za>.
Outbreaks of malaria occur especially in the transition zones between
highlands and lowlands, where climatic changes have profound effects
on transmission (Abeku TA et al. Parasitology. 2004;128:585-93). -
