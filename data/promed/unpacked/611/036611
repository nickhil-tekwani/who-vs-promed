During the 1st 5 months of this year [2007], in the capital of Sao
Paulo, 694 dengue cases have already been confirmed, some 49 per cent
more than were registered between January and December, 2006 (466
recorded cases.) The number of cases in 2007 comes close to the
historically [highest] number of this disease, registered in 2003.
Sao Paulo had the greatest incidence of infestation by the [dengue
virus] mosquito [vector] _Aedes aegypti_ 4 years ago [2003], with 760
notifications -- just 66 more than have already been registered this
year [2007].
According to the Municipal Health Secretariat mapping of the
distribution of [dengue] cases by neighborhood, the districts most
affected are Sao Raposo Tavares (Zona Oeste), Penha (Zona Leste), and
Campo Limpo (Zona Sul), which, with 208 notifications altogether,
total nearly 30 per cent of the registered cases. About 70 cases were
diagnosed in just one residential area -- Cingapura Chaparral, Penha,
the main focus of dengue in Sao Paulo. "Climate change, which
increased the temperatures during the year, is one of the hypotheses
about the increase of dengue cases in Sao Paulo," explained Adriano
Ogera, biologist of Municipal Epidemiological Control.

In Iloilo province, 2 persons have died of dengue, a viral disease
transmitted through the bite of an infected _Aedes_ mosquito. Dr.
Fabian Mabasa, Regional Dengue/Malaria Coordinator of the Department
of Health Region VI, said that the fatalities were from the
municipalities of Oton and Barrotac Nuevo, Iloilo province.
During the PIA-CATV [Philippine Information Agency-Cable TV] program,
Dr. Mabasa disclosed that the DOH [Department of Health] VI record
from January to May 2007, also showed that those who have been
afflicted with dengue in the region are children aging from 0 to 9-years-old.
The regional Dengue/Malaria Coordinator explained that dengue is a
viral disease common during the rainy season and that it is
transmitted by the bite of an infected _Aedes_ mosquito. Dr. Mabasa
advised the public to properly dispose of their tin cans, bottles,
tires, and other containers so that these do not become
mosquito-breeding places. "Everybody's participation is very
important in our drive against the disease," Dr. Mabasa said as he
urged the public to make it a habit to sustain the cleaning of the
surroundings and especially the inside [of houses].
