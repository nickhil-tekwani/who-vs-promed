Baxter Finds Possible Link in 53 Deaths
----------------------
Baxter International said yesterday that a chemical that it used to
manufacture filters for dialysis patients might have played a role in
dozens of deaths around the world.
The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the deaths of 53 patients
who used the Baxter devices, called dialyzers, which filter toxins out of
the blood of patients whose kidneys have failed. Baxter became aware of
possible problems with the filters in August, after several patients died
in Spain, but a company investigation had failed to find anything wrong
with the devices. The company, which recalled the filters worldwide in
mid-October and continued to study them, said it uncovered the probable
cause of the deaths over the weekend.
Of the 4 deaths that occurred in the United States, 2 were in Austin,
Texas, and 2 in Kearney, Nebraska. Federal regulators said yesterday that a
doctor at the Nebraska dialysis center was questioning whether the
company's filters were to blame.
Croatia was the site of 21 of the deaths being reviewed by the F.D.A. At
least 10 deaths occurred in Spain, 7 in Taiwan, 5 in Germany, 4 in Italy,
and 2 in Colombia, according to the F.D.A.
The company voluntarily recalled all of its dialyzers in the series A, AF
and AX on Oct. 18, sending letters to doctors and asking them to return any
unused filters of that type.
Yesterday, Baxter said it had decided to permanently cease manufacturing
the dialyzers. They were made by Althin Medical, a company Baxter acquired
last year, at a factory in Ronneby, Sweden. Baxter said it planned to
compensate the families of patients who died. "We are greatly saddened by
the patient deaths, and I would like to extend my personal sympathies to
family members," Harry M. Jansen Kraemer Jr., Baxter's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement. "We have a responsibility to make public
our findings immediately and take swift action, even though confirmatory
studies remain under way."
Dr. David W. Feigal, director of the F.D.A.'s center for devices and
radiological health, said yesterday that the problem appeared to be that
the chemical, a fluid called perfluorohydrocarbon that Baxter uses to
manufacture some of the filters, is liquefied at room temperature but
becomes a gas if it is warmed to body temperature. That means the liquid
could have created gas bubbles in the bloodstream, Dr. Feigal said.
Regulators are investigating whether the chemical fluid, which Baxter began
using in December, is used by other filter manufacturers and whether other
patients might have been affected.
"We want to make sure this is not a hidden problem in some other products,"
Dr. Feigal said. Baxter, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said yesterday
that it began an internal investigation of the filters after Spain reported
that 10 people using its filters had died. The company said that an early
series of tests on the filters had found no problems. Perfluorohydrocarbon
is a nontoxic substance, the company said, but it is not labeled for human use.
Sally Benjamin Young, a spokeswoman for Baxter, said the fluid was used in
fewer than 10 percent of the filters, those that had been set aside after
they failed a quality control test. The fluid was used to retest the
filters, she said. To cover the cost of recalling the filters and
compensating families, Baxter said yesterday that it was setting aside $100
million to $150 million. The cost could exceed the $130 million that Baxter
paid for Althin in March 2000.
In Spain, a report by the Ministry of Health that is expected to be
released this week will tie the deaths of more than 10 people to Baxter's
filters, according to Fernando Garcia Lopez, an author of the report.
Autopsies on 5 of those who died found evidence of multiple organ failure
"which is not among the usual causes of sudden death" in kidney patients,
Mr. Garcia Lopez said.
Manuel Mata, a lawyer who represents the families of 8 people who died in
Spain, said his clients were considering filing lawsuits against Baxter in
the United States. Families of people who died after Aug. 18 are especially
angry, Mr. Mata said, because hospitals in the city of Valencia continued
to use Baxter's dialyzers, despite 4 deaths in Madrid between Aug. 15 and
Aug. 18 and after hospitals in that city stopped using the filters. "There
is something very important that must be investigated," Mr. Mata said.
"What happened after Aug. 18 when the dialyzers were removed in Madrid for
fear they were connected to the deaths?"
"Baxter did not withdraw the dialyzers from Valencia," Mr. Mata said. "They
could have pulled the products in that time. Those deaths were avoidable."
Ms. Young, the Baxter spokeswoman, said the company had been told that the
deaths in Madrid were not related to the filters. When it learned of the
deaths in Valencia, she said, Baxter immediately recalled the filters in
Spain and stopped selling them worldwide.

[This latest announcement includes additional cases reported from Italy and
Germany. One wonders if this is a tip-of-the-iceberg phenomenon and what
the true denominator at risk was (none of the articles reviewed to date
gave information on the volume of filters in distribution). Each press
release seems to include more deaths from different countries. Clearly one
wonders about the delay in implementing a worldwide recall of the product
after the initial deaths were reported in Spain. - Mod.MPP
