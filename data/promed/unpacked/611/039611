Colorado animal health officials have confirmed the state's 1st reported equine case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2014 in an Adams County horse. This case was diagnosed by Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins.

Disease transmission from year to year depends on a number of factors, including mosquito numbers. The WNV can be amplified and carried by infected birds and then spread locally by mosquitoes that bite those birds. The mosquitoes can then pass the virus to humans and animals.

Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore, it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[Plagiarising my fellow moderator Tam Garland ex 20130914.1943518: The commonest signs of WNV infection in horses include stumbling, uncoordination, weak limbs, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and in some cases, death. Fever has occurred in less than 1/4th of all confirmed equine cases.

Each horse may exhibit any combination of these signs, which include:
- Muzzle tremors: the muzzle will twitch sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. There will be no apparent reason for it, no flies. Just a constant twitch.
- Muscle twitching: the horse looks like he is trying to get flies off his body.
- Behavior: depression is common. Hyper-responsiveness such as flinging around a stall, and other anxieties. Sweating has been noted, but does not always occur.
- Head pressing, aimless wandering, or circling.
- Facial paralysis: on one or both sides of face. The right ear may droop but the left ear stand up. The muzzle may be paralyzed on just one side or both sides so that the lips won't seal and the horse is constantly drooling.
- Vertigo-balance problems: the horse may actually lean on a wall to stand up. He stumbles a lot and is uncoordinated.
- Tongue paralysis: the tongue may lop out of the mouth. The horse doesn't seem to be able to pull its own tongue back into the mouth. And in some advanced cases, the tongue has to be pushed back into the mouth, but if the muzzle is paralyzed, the tongue will just drop back out.
- Weak, stiff walking, tired.
- Impaired vision.
- Convulsions.
- Collapse, usually in advanced cases. With some, the horse will fall to its front legs as if praying and can't get up. In others, the horse may just sit down and may be unable to stand on the back legs. He'll dog sit. If collapse is on all 4 legs, this case probably won't make it, because the horse can't stand on his own, and these are the most difficult cases to care for.

Treatment is vital for any horse with WNV. At this time, there is no specific "medicine" for a horse once (s)he develops WNV, although there are some promising advances being made in that area. However, your veterinarian will be able to provide supportive therapy that can save your horse's life if he does develop WNV.

For advanced cases, horses usually have to be hospitalized. For mild cases, home care may be adequate. But regardless, nursing care and treatment are important to the recovery process, and each animal is assessed according to its age and health. In cases of WNV, 33 per cent will die, 50 per cent will recover fully, and 17 per cent will have "problem recoveries", relapse or incomplete recovery.

Prevention is much easier than treatment. Prevention consists of a vaccine followed by a 2nd vaccine in 2-3 weeks and then an annual booster. The vaccine is usually in combination with eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and frequently these are combined with the vaccine for tetanus. The vaccine is safe and effective and should be used [Unfortunately, it is not one of the cheaper horse vaccines but very well worth it. - Mod.MHJ].
