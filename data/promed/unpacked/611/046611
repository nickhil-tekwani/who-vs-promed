Benton County [Oregon] Health Department officials said [Wed 11 Mar 2015] that Linus Pauling Middle School and Crescent Valley High School have new confirmed cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough. Bill Emminger, a manager of environmental health with the Benton County Health Department, said there also were confirmed cases in Philomath schools. Corvallis School District sent out alerts about the outbreak [Fri 6 Mar 2015].

Pertussis also broke out in Benton County schools in November [2014].

Emminger said that the Health Department's main message on pertussis is that it is particularly dangerous to children who are less than a year old. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that half of such infants require hospitalization if they contract pertussis. Of those hospitalized, 1 or 2 in 100 will die from it.

According to Emminger, babies can begin to receive pertussis vaccinations at 2 months, but the health department also emphasizes protecting infants by having everyone who has contact with the babies vaccinated against pertussis.

He added that pertussis is distinctive because of the persistent "whooping" cough it causes as patients struggle for air. He said people should stay home if [they] believe they have pertussis because it is highly contagious, and they should see a doctor.

People with pertussis usually get a course of antibiotics and remain contagious for a week, Emminger said.

Since October [2014], 37 cases of pertussis have been confirmed in Benton County. The most in a month was 13 in November [2014]. 8 confirmed cases were reported in February [2015]. The cases in Corvallis mostly have been at Corvallis High School and Crescent Valley High School. Of the people infected, 27 were ages 10 to 19; one was an infant.

No deaths have been reported.

[The news report above does not say the percent of pertussis cases that were unimmunized. Although in some regions low immunization rates account for pertussis outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said that low immunization rates could not account for the current pertussis outbreak in the state, because 90 per cent of those children infected in 2014 had been vaccinated against pertussis (see ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440); increased virulence and a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, attributed to genetic changes, as well as a waning immune response after vaccination may be other causes of the current outbreaks.

In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc. Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccines.
