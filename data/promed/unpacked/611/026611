Cereal growers with crops still to sow, including spring barley, are
being urged to test home-saved seed, think hard before omitting
treatment, and be prepared to raise sowing rates. Although several
factors (not least dry early seed-beds and seed dormancy) led to poor
establishment this autumn [2007], disease hit harder than usual and
must be taken into account, warn several commentators.

Infection by _Microdochium nivale_ seedling blight -- the disease
most farmers and agronomists still refer to as fusarium -- was
exceptionally heavy this autumn [2007], noted Scottish Agricultural
Science Agency seed pathologist Valerie Cockerell. "I don't think
I've ever seen it quite as high. Average levels on Scottish wheats
have been 50 percent".

Fusarium infection in Bayer CropScience trials was up to 70 percent,
noted the firm's Adrian Cottey. "Even in early-drilled crops we lost
a lot. In later sowings without seed treatment you could expect to
lose most of the infected seedlings." Much depended on growing
conditions, he said. "Most farmers treat most, if not all their
wheats. But with spring barley there is a lot more risk-taking which
would be crazy this season."

East Lothian-based AICC [Association of Independent Crop Consultants]
agronomist Andrew Riddell would not normally consider treating spring
barley unless the seed loading was above 20 percent. But given that
fusarium had been particularly troublesome this autumn [2007], his
policy might change. "Seed treatment is probably more justified this
year."

Lincolnshire-based Ruth East, also AICC, looks after plenty of spring
barley following sugar beet. "I always use seed dressing on spring
barley," she said.

Fusarium levels in wheat were so high this autumn [2007] that it had
not been worth running tests, she added.

[Head and seedling blights on cereals worldwide are caused by several
fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_. This
accounts for the common name of these diseases, which remains in use
although some of the pathogens have since been re-assigned to
different genera.

The 'microdochium' seedling blight described above is caused by
_Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Microdochium
nivale_, synonym _Fusarium nivale_). Seedling blight is a major
seedborne disease of cereals, which can lead to a serious reduction
in grain yield. It can affect seed vigour and performance and leads
to poor plant establishment and a thin crop. It can cause very
serious seedling losses, particularly when soil conditions are poor.
Depending on the season and soil conditions, infected seedlings may
be killed before or soon after emergence.

The main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Although found in most
soils, the soil-borne phase of the fungus is of little consequence.
Spores resulting from seedling blight or stem-base browning are
splashed up the plant, ultimately infecting the ear. The fungus does
not produce symptoms on the developing grain and a crop with no
visible ear symptoms may still have high levels of infection. _M. n._
var. _nivalis_ can also contribute to a number of other disease
problems in co-infection with other pathogens.

Fungal development is favoured by wet weather during flowering, and
late-sown crops are at a higher risk. Disease management relies on
fungicide treatments of seed. Generally, seedlots with infection
levels below 10 percent are not considered to need treatment.

A number of other pathogens may also cause seedling blight in cereals
including several species of _Fusarium_ and _Microdochium majus_.
These are usually considered less important.
