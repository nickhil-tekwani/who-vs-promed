A shocking number of children have become sick after ingesting liquid nicotine found in e-cigarettes, says the Washington [State] Poison Center.

The total number of calls to the center about e-cigarettes is up 600 percent compared with recent years. There's also a staggering increase in the number of kids exposed to serious levels of nicotine.

The phenomenon of using an e-cigarette, called vaping, is gaining in popularity.

Oftentimes the products look like candy, attracting curious little ones -- but the Poison Center says a single mouthful can harm a child.

"Sick from nicotine includes things like vomiting, ultimately, if they've taken enough of it -- which isn't very much if you're dealing with taking concentrated nicotine," says Dr Lewis Nelson, a medical toxicologist. "Muscle paralysis and even death is possible."

And he says it's easy to ingest too much of it, since it's so concentrated.

A typical e-cigarette chamber can hold up to 3 milliliters of liquid nicotine. Nicotine concentration in commonly available products can range from 6 milligrams per milliliter all the way up to 24 milligrams per milliliter. That means one e-cigarette can contain anywhere from 18 to 72 milligrams of nicotine.

In comparison, one cigarette can contain 8 to 20 milligrams of nicotine.

So far this year [2014], 83 children have been over-exposed to liquid nicotine, compared with 50 exposures in 2013. And when the center breaks it down by age, we learn that 82 percent of the e-cigarette exposures this year occurred in children ages to 1 to 3.

And it's not just young ones who end up over-exposed to liquid nicotine. Month to month, the number of calls to the poison center have doubled, sometimes even tripled since 2012.

[E-cigarettes are electronic cigarettes. The 1st ones came from Ruyan company [Hong Kong] in 2004. According to media reports, Ruyan says it sold 300 000 e-cigarettes in 2008.

E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes, and there are even flavors other than nicotine available now. Many look more or less like long cigarettes; others look like cigars or pipes. They all work the same basic way:
- The user inhales through a mouthpiece.
- Air flow triggers a sensor that switches on a small, battery-powered heater.
- The heater vaporizes liquid nicotine in a small cartridge (it also activates a light at the "lit" end of the e-cigarette). They do not contain tobacco, but they do contain nicotine. Users can opt for a cartridge without nicotine. In addition to the nicotine-free option, there are flavor options.
- The heater also vaporizes propylene glycol in the cartridge--this is the stuff of which theatrical smoke is made.
- The user gets a puff of hot gas that feels a lot like tobacco smoke.
- When the user exhales, there's a cloud of propylene glycol vapor that looks like smoke. The vapor quickly dissipates.
- E-cigarettes contain no tobacco products; even the nicotine is synthetic.

E-cigarettes comprise less than 2 percent of all tobacco-related sales (data from 2010); they now account for more than 40 percent of poison center calls. More than half of the calls involved children younger than 5 years old, according to the CDC.

"Nicotine is probably the most toxic plant chemical ever discovered," said Dr Richard Clark, medical director for the California Poison Control System and a professor of toxicology. Clark said poison centers like his are seeing a steady increase in calls related to e-cigarettes. Of particular concern, he said, is that unlike the conventional cigarette, which is usually very bitter, these devices are flavored and thus more attractive to children. The solution is also easily absorbed through the skin if spilled, unlike the contents of regular cigarettes.
