Hepatitis-A Outbreak Puts Viljandi Officials on Alert
-----------------------------------------------------
Vaccination generally gives a 20-year immunity against hepatitis A
virus infection. As of Mon 12 Sep 2011, there have been 41 cases of
viral hepatitis in Estonia. Of those, 29 have been confirmed in
Viljandi County.

Hepatitis A is an infection caused by a virus affecting the liver,
causing inflammation of the organ and often jaundice (yellowing of
skin). It can be caused and spread by poor hygiene, contaminated food
and contact with an infected person.

The 1st case was confirmed in Viljandi this past February [2011], and
it was linked to travel abroad. However, since 25 Aug 2011, the number
of cases has spiked dramatically: 28 cases reported across the county,
25 of these in the town of Viljandi.

The mayor of Viljandi, Lembit Kruuse, called for the formation of a
disease prevention task force, with a particular focus on preventing
the spread of the disease.

Last week alone, the number of those infected in Viljandi increased by
30 percent. Unfortunately, officials said, the disease has an
incubation period of 50 days, meaning it will take some time to assess
the impact.

The most effective action to counter hepatitis-A is [vaccination]. The
vaccine is administered in 2 doses at 6- to 18-month intervals.
Immunity generally develops within one month of the 1st dose. The
duration of the immunity is at least 20 years. In terms of prevention,
health officials stress the importance of washing hands with soap and
water after using the washroom, before food preparation, and after
eating.

In Estonia, cases of hepatitis-A infections have been low in number
over recent years, with the majority of those being travel-related: 10
cases in 2007, 13 in 2008, 19 in 2009 and 6 in 2010. The last major
outbreak was in 1993 in Someru, when contaminated drinking water
caused 614 people to become ill.

Its location can be seen in the map at:

In the past hepatitis A virus infection in Estonia has been associated
with illicit drug users, but the source of the current outbreak has
yet to be established and may be water and/of food-borne rather than
travel-related. Visitors to this part of Estonia should ensure that
they have been vaccinated prior to travel. - Mod.CP]
