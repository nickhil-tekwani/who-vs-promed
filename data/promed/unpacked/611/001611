Twelve cattle have been killed through suspected cyanide poisoning.

The 12 cattle which belong to 3 farmers died a few metres from the Eiffel Gold Mine perimeter fence, and owners are blaming the mine for failing to take measures to avoid the overflow of residual cyanide from the mine premises onto the pastures.

Eiffel Gold Mine supervisor Mr Mike Laubscher, however, denied responsibility for the deaths of the cattle, arguing that the mishap could be a result of a feud between the affected farmers and their neighbours, with whom they have disputes over land ownership.

The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) said the overflow control walls at Eiffel Gold Mine were destroyed by rains, resulting in storm water overflowing outside the mine premises.

Water samples have since been collected from the mine for laboratory analysis to establish the levels of residual cyanide in the water.

EMA is urging mines to put up protective measures at their mine plants to avoid continued loss of livestock and other animals.

[All samples, water, soil and tissues, especially blood and urine, from the deceased animals should be collected and transported either packed in ice or in some way kept cool. Cyanide in the deceased animal dissipates rapidly.

Gold mines may use cyanide in the mining and recovery of the gold.

Cyanide can enter surface water through releases from industries using cyanides (e.g., metal finishing industries, iron and steel mills), runoff from disposal of cyanide wastes in landfills, pesticides and the use of cyanide-containing road salts. Cyanide is usually found at very low concentrations in drinking water sources.

Soluble cyanide compounds (e.g. HCN, KCN) are mobile in soils and have low adsorption to soils with high pH, high carbonate and low clay content. Cyanide may leach to groundwater. Under typical conditions in natural waters (pH less than 9.2), most free cyanide is expected to convert to hydrogen cyanide that is highly volatile. Thus, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process. Cyanide is not likely to accumulate in aquatic life.

However, cyanide in sufficient quantities will kill other animals. They may also need to investigate the natural cyanides or prussic acids, such as those in some grasses.
