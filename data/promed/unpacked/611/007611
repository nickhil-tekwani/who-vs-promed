A total of 10 cases of _E. coli_ infection have been confirmed and
another 16 cases are under investigation in what may be a growing
disease outbreak that appears to be linked to the North Carolina State
Fair, state public health officials said Friday [28 Oct 2011]. 4 of
the confirmed cases are children, 3 of whom are hospitalized and have
undergone dialysis for kidney failure brought on by hemolytic uremic
syndrome, a complication of _E. coli_ infection, according to Public
Information Officer Julie Henry of the North Carolina Division of
Public Health. Half of the 26 confirmed and suspected cases are
children, she said.

The 1st illnesses were reported around 15 Oct 2011, Henry said. Since
then, of the 26 patients with suspected or confirmed _E. coli_
infection, 23 are known to have attended the fair, which ran from
13-23 Oct 2011 in Raleigh and drew nearly a million attendees.

"The public health investigators are reasonably confident the state
fair was the place the source was, but we have not been able to
identify, from anything so far, a definitive, actual source of the
outbreak," she told CNN in a telephone interview.

In an attempt to hone in on the source of the outbreak, investigators
will be asking people who were sickened what it was that they ate and
what activities they participated in, she said. They will then compare
the responses with those from fair attendees who did not get sick. But
Henry acknowledged Friday that officials may never determine the
source of the outbreak.

After the initial cases were reported, it did not take long for
suspicion to be directed at the fair, since an _E. coli_ outbreak in
2005 [actually 2004 - Mod.LL] was traced to a petting zoo at the fair,
Henry said.

Officials concerned about the possibility of more cases have alerted
hospitals, physicians and county health departments to be on the
lookout for patients with _E. coli_ symptoms.

The bacteria are found in the feces of animals such as cattle, sheep
and goats. Some types of _E. coli_ can sicken people who drink liquids
or eat food that has come into contact with the bacteria or who
themselves come into contact with infected animals, according to the
Department of Health and Human Services.

The majority of outbreaks, blamed for some 265 000 illnesses and 100
deaths in the USA each year, are linked to raw or undercooked ground
beef, unpasteurized milk, unpasteurized juice and leafy greens, HHS
said on its website.

Brian Long, director of the North Carolina State Fair press office,
said that fair officials are cooperating with public health officials
as they try to determine the source of the outbreak. "Right now there
are still far more questions than answers, and we know the
investigation will take time. But we are eager to help investigators
any way we can," he told CNN.

Lab test results are expected early next week to help health officials
determine whether the _E. coli_ bacteria in the confirmed cases
contain the same genetic fingerprint.

"We want to make people overly aware that this is still the incubation
period, so people can be getting sick," Henry said.

[There are still few, if any, direct reports stating whether the
enterohemorrhagic pathotype here is O157:H7. We await reporting of the
serotype involved. Even if the common factor continues to be the
recently ended State Fair in Raleigh, the source doesn't necessarily
need to be a petting zoo but could be a food vehicle such as
undercooked hamburger or a food containing contaminated raw produce. -
