I live in the southern hemisphere, am over 65, and am vaccinated [against
influenza -- with the southern hemisphere vaccine, obviously. But I'm
currently attending an infectious disease conference in Amsterdam. I was
quite concerned that I would arrive in the middle of a flu epidemic here
and be unprotected. Luckily, there is no one symptomatic here and nothing
in the papers about an outbreak yet. It would have been quite different if
the conference had been in Belarus, where a huge flu outbreak is under way.
Remember the influenza outbreaks on Alaskan cruise liners during the
northern summers of 1997-99, traced to Australian tourists (see references
above)? There are millions of travellers between the 2 hemispheres all year
round, obviously introducing strains of influenza virus from one hemisphere
to the other. I understand that there is a problem in that the southern
hemisphere vaccine is not licensed in the north, and vice versa. But isn't
it time we had a global formulation, available year-round to travellers?
I hear that the World Health Organization is holding a meeting next week in
Geneva to discuss such matters. I personally hope they will give urgent
consideration to a global vaccine.
