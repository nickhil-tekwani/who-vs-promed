At the recently concluded meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO)
Executive Board in Geneva, January 1998, Canada noted its concern regarding
the emergence and re-emergence of both national and international
infectious diseases (ERIDs) as threats to global public health. To respond
to ERIDs, Canada believes that the first priority is to provide support to
WHO?s member countries to improve their national disease surveillance
capacity. Secondly, WHO must have a strengthened capacity to monitor and
coordinate disease surveillance at the international level. Finally, we
must have an effective early detection and response system which will aid
countries to control disease when outbreaks exceed their domestic
capabilities.
An effective early detection system is beginning to evolve and Canada plans
to contribute to that process. In February 1997, the Government of Canada
provided funding to enhance its health information info-structure. Under
the terms of a memorandum of understanding with WHO represented by its
Division of Emerging and other Communicable Diseases Surveillance and
Control (EMC), this funding source is being used to establish a global
disease monitoring system. This system will monitor disease outbreaks and
natural disasters on a world-wide basis, beginning with a pilot project in
May 1998, with a full prototype to follow when the feasibility of the
concept is fully demonstrated. This computer-based electronic system will
scan continuously sources such as ProMED-mail, news wire services and other
Internet-based sources. The information will be provided systematically to
WHO, and WHO will be responsible for working with national authorities to
verify potentially high risk outbreaks.
Canada hopes that its contribution in this area will help knit together an
international surveillance system for ERIDs.
