Compared to last year [2006], the number of rabid animals in Samara
increased 10.7-fold (from 10 to 107) during the last 6 months, the
representative of regional Rospotrebnadzor informed the RIA Novosti
News Agency on Monday [20 Aug 2007].
"The situation regarding rabies morbidity in the Oblast is among the
worst. There are cases among wild carnivores, pets and domestic
animals in 23 districts, particularly 27 cases in Borsky district and
10 cases in Kinel-Cherkassk district," stated an employee of Rospotrebnadzor.
According to her, the most important carriers of the virus are foxes,
48 of which have been found this year [2007]. Feral or domestic dogs
and cats also can spread the infection. 6000 people have suffered
from animal bites and have sought medical treatment, around 1500 of
whom were children. In 227 cases, the biting animals were rabid. She
also mentioned that not only those who have been bitten are at risk
but also those within the area of infection, as the saliva of the
animals may contaminate them.
