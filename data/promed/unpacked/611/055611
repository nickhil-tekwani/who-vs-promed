2000/010 _Tilletia indica_ not found in Alabama and Tennessee [edited
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The report (EPPO RS 98/043) that _Tilletia indica_ (EPPO A1 quarantine
pest), the fungal pathogen that causes Karnal bunt of wheat, is present in
Alabama and Tennessee (US) could not be confirmed. The records are now
considered as misidentifications with another fungus, _Tilletia walkeri_, a
new species which causes a partial bunt on _Lolium multiflorum_ (annual
ryegrass) and _L. perenne_. An extensive survey of _L. multiflorum_ in
wheat fields was conducted in spring 1997 and 1998 in Georgia, Alabama, and
Tennessee. _T. walkeri_ was found to be widely present in these states but
at very low levels. No teliospores of _T. indica_ were found during the
survey.

ryegrass in wheat fields in the Southeastern United States. Plant Disease,

[According to the authors of this report, annual ryegrass is a major weed
problem in wheat fields in the southeastern United States, and ryegrass
seeds are often contaminants of wheat seed samples. Locations in the
southeastern states where ryegrass with bunted seeds and teliospores were
found parallel the areas where teliospores were found on wheat seed in an
APHIS survey in 1996. Teliospores found on wheat seeds in the surveys are
those of _T. walkeri_. They occur at very low levels on ryegrass in the
southeastern region of the USA and are the source of teliospores,
originally identified as those of _T. indica_, associated with wheat seed
in APHIS surveys. No teliospores of _T. indica_ have been found in any of
the samples, and Karnal bunt has not been reported to occur in the region.
