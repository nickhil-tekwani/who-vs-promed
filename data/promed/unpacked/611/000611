An outbreak of a highly contagious form of equine herpes has numerous
horses and stables in quarantine near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,
veterinary officials said.

Dr. Katharina Lohmann of the large animal clinic of the Western
College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) told the Regina Leader Post
that equine herpes virus type one, or EHV-1, is much like herpes
simplex in humans, and horses can transmit it to one another by
sharing a feeding bucket.

It does not infect humans, but can be spread among horses by humans,
the report said.

The 1st incident was noted on 13 Mar 2008, when the operators of a
stable noticed some horses running fevers and stumbling. Two horses
were taken to the WCVM, where they were quarantined. Eight other
horses at the stable were diagnosed as having the virus, and more
than half of the 85 other horses were running high temperatures last
week but were showing no other signs of the infection, spokeswoman
Lynda Jones told the newspaper.

The stable has canceled all transport of horses until the outbreak
dies down, she said.

Lohmann said the large animal clinic was also closed until it could
be disinfected.

"The big mystery is what's causing this large outbreak," she said.

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease (EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe
respiratory infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease
or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity conferred by the disease or the vaccine is relatively short.
Horses on the show or racing circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months.

Isolating the horse and essentially quarantining the others is likely
a good idea. Let us also hope the equipment is being restricted to
single horse use and disinfected. - Mod.TG]
