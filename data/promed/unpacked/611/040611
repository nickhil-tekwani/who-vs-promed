Considered the most damaging root disease of wheat worldwide, take-all control measures are limited. According to Rothamsted [Research Station] Dr Javier Palma-Guerrero, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of this disease.

"New sources of genetic resistance have been identified and are being transferred into wheat. And we now have a better understanding of the soil, rhizosphere and endosphere (plant interior) microbiomes and their association to different wheat cultivars, which shows the importance of considering all these interactions to achieve efficient disease management practices.

"There are still many unknowns, especially at the molecular and community population levels. As no resistant or even partially resistant commercial wheat cultivars are available and chemical control is limited, control measures are largely restricted to crop rotation -- and new control strategies are urgently needed. In addition, climate change is expected to make matters worse as areas where autumns and winters will become milder and wetter will favour fungal diseases."

The ancestral wheat _Triticum monococcum_ has been identified as a potential source of resistance genes to take-all. A few other wheat relatives also show promise for their resistance to take-all, as are mechanisms of resistance found in other cereals such as oats and rye. All of these are currently being investigated.

Another promising area for research is the transcriptome -- the array of messenger molecules that turn DNA instructions into proteins. The fungus and wheat transcriptomes have both been characterized during the infection process, providing new gene targets for future antifungal developments or for improving host resistance. According to Dr Palma-Guerrero, such studies have previously proven difficult but advances in genetic techniques have opened the door to these new approaches.

[Take-all of wheat and barley is caused by the fungus _Gaeumannomyces tritici_ (previously _G. graminis_ var. _tritici_). It can cause severe yield losses of up to 50 percent and grain quality is reduced. The pathogen was first recognised in Australia in 1852. Take-all is considered the most serious root disease of
cereals worldwide but appears to be restricted to temperate growing areas.

Disease symptoms may include rotting of roots and lower stems, stunting of plants, whitened seed heads, shrivelled grains, reduced tillering and sterile spikes. Infection can occur throughout the crop cycle. Disease development is favoured by cool soil temperatures, alkaline or nutrient deficient soils, nitrate and minimum tilling practices. Disease severity is expressed as take-all index (TAI), which is calculated as the proportion of nodal root systems with symptoms.

The pathogen is soil borne and persists on crop debris in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants and grasses may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies primarily on cultural practices (such as crop rotation with non-hosts, moderate planting density, control of reservoir hosts, field drainage) and phytosanitation to minimise carry-over of inoculum to subsequent crops. Fungicides are being used as seed treatments, but are not very effective against soil borne fungi. As stated above, no varieties of wheat or barley exist at present with specific resistance to take-all.

Some decline in disease severity ("take-all decline") has been reported after a few years of successive wheat or barley crops. This is thought to be due to the development of environmental microorganisms antagonistic to the fungus, but does not return yields to the level of uninfected crops.

The related _G. avenae_ affects oats, _G. maydis_ affects maize, _G. graminis_ affects rice (ProMED-mail post 20150910.3635557) and a range of grasses.
