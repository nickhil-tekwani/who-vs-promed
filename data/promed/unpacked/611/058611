[This publication is a summary of an unpasteurized milk-associated outbreak of campylobacteriosis which was covered as it was occurring in ProMED-mail. Longenberger AH, Palumbo AJ, Chu AK, et al. _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections associated with unpasteurized milk -- multiple states, 2012. Clin Infect Dis. 2013; doi: 10.1093/cid/cit231. Below are selected parts of the paper:]

In 2012, a multistate outbreak of campylobacter infections associated with unpasteurized milk resulted in 148 illnesses. A dairy with a Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture [PDA] unpasteurized milk permit and minimal deficiencies identified during inspection was the outbreak source, demonstrating the ongoing hazards of unpasteurized dairy products.

A total of 81 persons with confirmed illness were identified (70 in Pennsylvania, 6 in Maryland, 3 in West Virginia, and 2 in New Jersey). All patients (except 1 with onset 3 to 4 days after other family members) reported consuming unpasteurized milk from the dairy. An additional 67 probable cases were identified in these 4 states (total of 148 cases). Onsets ranged from 14 Jan 2012 through 1 Feb 2012. Among persons with confirmed illness, median age was 31 years (range: 2-74 years); 25 (31 per cent) were aged less than 18 years. 10 (12 per cent) persons were hospitalized; severe outcomes including Guillain-Barre syndrome and death were not identified.

The 24 (30 per cent) _C. jejuni_ clinical isolates available for molecular subtyping were indistinguishable by PFGE. The dairy tested unpasteurized milk for _E. coli_ O157:H7 monthly; all were negative during 2012. Routine regulatory unpasteurized milk samples from 19 Dec 2011 and 11 Jan 2012, tested at a PDA-approved laboratory, had coliform counts of 28/mL and greater than 150/mL, respectively, both above the less than 10/mL regulatory limit. This prompted a warning letter from PDA; however, a sample collected on 24 Jan 2012 (before the outbreak was recognized) had a coliform count of less than 1/mL.

A total of 8 unpasteurized milk aliquots obtained during the investigation and tested at PADOH's [Pennsylvania Department of Health] laboratory and 7 aliquots tested at PDA's laboratory were negative for campylobacter. However, 2 unopened consumer aliquots tested at MDHMH [Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene], with best-by dates of 31 Jan 2012, yielded _C. jejuni_ with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern to all clinical isolates.

[Given a multiplier of 10 (Gall G, Yohannes K, Raupach J, et al. Estimating community incidence of _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, and Shiga Toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ Infections, Australia. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008; 14(10): 1601-9), there may have been as many as almost 1500 cases associated with this outbreak.

The following is from an FDA information sheet regarding unpasteurized milk (http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm):

Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the CDC, between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the USA became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.

Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Listeria_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.

These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, and children. In fact, the CDC analysis found that foodborne illness from raw milk especially affected children and teenagers.

"Pasteurized milk" explained
----------------------------
Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. First developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis.

Research shows no meaningful difference in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk contains low levels of the type of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food spoilage, so storing your pasteurized milk in the refrigerator is still important.

Raw milk and pasteurization: debunking milk myths
-------------------------------------------------
While pasteurization has helped provide safe, nutrient-rich milk and cheese for over 120 years, some people continue to believe that pasteurization harms milk and that raw milk is a safe healthier alternative.

Here are some common myths and proven facts about milk and pasteurization:
Pasteurizing milk DOES NOT cause lactose intolerance and allergic reactions. Both raw milk and pasteurized milk can cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to milk proteins.
Raw milk DOES NOT kill dangerous pathogens by itself.
Pasteurization DOES NOT reduce milk's nutritional value.
Pasteurization DOES NOT mean that it is safe to leave milk out of the refrigerator for extended time, particularly after it has been opened.
Pasteurization DOES kill harmful bacteria.
Pasteurization DOES save lives. - Mod.LL
