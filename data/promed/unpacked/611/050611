1st detection of stolbur phytoplasma in grapevines (_Vitis vinifera_,
cv Chardonnay) affected with grapevine yellows in the Ukraine

publication 25 Oct 2004.

During summer 2003, symptoms typical of a grapevine yellows (GY)
disease were seen in grapevine plots planted in 2000 with cv
Chardonnay in the Ovidiopolskij region (Odessa area) of the Ukraine.
10 to 20 percent of the vines showed typical GY symptoms, i.e.
rolling and discoloration of leaves and uneven lignification of
shoots.
Important GYs in Europe are _Flavescence doree_ (FD) and _Bois noir_
(BN). FD, transmitted by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_,
is a quarantine disease in the EU and Ukraine and is epidemic in
certain areas of France, Italy, and Spain. BN is found in Asia Minor
and is associated with the endemic stolbur phytoplasma and
transmitted by a polyphagous planthopper, _Hyalesthes obsoletus_ [Ho].
DNA extracted from leaf samples taken from 5 diseased grapevines was
tested by PCR using standard generic primers (P1/P7 and R16F2n/R16R2)
that amplify phytoplasma rDNA. Positive amplification was obtained
from all 5 samples (not shown). Cuttings were taken in December 2003
of lignified canes from 15 grapevines that had shown symptoms during
the summer. DNA extracted from phloem scrapings was amplified using a
bi-specific PCR procedure for the detection of FD and BN phytoplasmas
(Clair et al., 2003).
7 of the 15 cuttings tested were positive for a stolbur phytoplasma.
The other 8 cuttings tested negative, as did the healthy grapevine
control.
Earlier reports have described the presence of GY symptoms on cv
Regina in Romania (Rafaila & Costache, 1968) and on cv Chardonnay in
Moldavia (Marinesku et al., 1990). At that time, the phytoplasma
associated with this disease could not be detected in grapevine, and
the etiology and vector of BN were unknown, although Ho had been
described in the South of Ukraine (Zirka, 1967).
Since no direct control methods are available for BN, affected plants
will be mapped over the next years to check for recovery. Further
surveys will include monitoring of GYs, to confirm the role of Ho and
to screen for _S. titanus_, a harmful pest actively spreading in
Europe.
This is the 1st record of stolbur phytoplasma infecting grapevines in Ukraine.

[FD and BN are common in European vineyards, FD being more important.
The principal host of FD is grape (_Vitis vinifera_). Of considerable
significance is that _Convovulus arvensis_ (field bindweed) and
_Solanum nigrum_ (black nightshade) are common in German vineyards,
thus providing an inoculum source. The principal vector for the FD
phytoplasma is _Scaphoideus titanus_ (vine leafhopper), but the
vector for BN is _Hyalesthes obsoletus_, also known as the vector for
potato stolbur. Local spread of FD is about 5-10 km per year, while
that of BN is much slower. Uncontrolled spread of FD is usually
catastrophic, particularly in the cultivars Chardonnay and Pinot
Blanc. BN spreads much more slowly, and its economic impact is much
less. Management of the disease is based on use of suitable planting
material and control of vectors by chemical insecticides.
