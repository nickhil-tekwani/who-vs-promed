Abstract
----------
Background
Only 2 naturally occurring human Sabiá virus (SABV) infections have been reported, and those occurred over 20 years ago.

Methods
We diagnosed 2 new cases of SABV infection using metagenomics in patients thought to have severe yellow fever and described new features of histopathological findings.

Results
We characterized clinical manifestations and histopathology and analyzed possible nosocomial transmission. Patients presented with hepatitis, bleeding, and neurological alterations, and died. We traced 29 hospital contacts and evaluated them clinically and by RT-PCR and neutralizing antibodies. Autopsies uncovered unique features on electron microscopy, such as hepatocyte "pinewood knot" lesions. Although previous reports with similar New-World arenavirus had nosocomial transmission, our data did not find any case in contact tracing.

Conclusions
Although apparently rare, Brazilian mammarenavirus (BM) infection is an etiology for acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome. The 2 fatal cases had peculiar histopathological findings not previously described. The virological diagnosis was possible only by contemporary techniques such as metagenomic assays. We found no subsequent infections when we used serological and molecular tests to evaluate close contacts.

[This report states that there have been 4 BM [Brazilian mammarenavirus] infections previously described. The 2 reported natural infections occurred in the city of Cotia in 1990 and the city of Espirito Santo do Pinhal in 1999. Both cities are in the rural area of the state of Sao Paulo and are approximately 155 km [96 mi] apart. These 2 were infected rural workers, and 2 others were laboratory workers thought to be infected while handling viruses.

During the 2018-2019 yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Sao Paulo, there were 2 cases of BM in this report that were initially admitted to Hospital das Clínicas, city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with the diagnostic hypothesis of severe YF [yellow fever]. However, they tested negative for YF by molecular assays in blood and urine samples, but positive for BM.

This report underscores the possibility that during an outbreak of one disease, in this case YF, another pathogen that causes a similar clinical picture may be circulating. Clearly, timely laboratory diagnostic support is necessary to sort out and identify the pathogens that are circulating. With laboratory capability severely taxed during an outbreak, timely testing a large load of samples may be a challenge.

As an arenavirus, the reservoir host of Sabia virus presumably is one or more rodents yet to be identified as such. - Mod.TY
