Authorities say a 5 year old girl has received a rabies shot after being bitten by a coyote at an Arizona park. Arizona Game and Fish officials say a coyote was later found and killed near Scottsdale's [Maricopa county] Thompson Peak Park and its body sent to a lab for testing.

Officials say they're not certain that the killed coyote was the one that bit the girl [Tue 30 May 2017] so they will continue searching the area.

The girl was bitten as she held a granola bar while sitting on a slide. She didn't know the coyote was under the slide. After biting the girl, the coyote chased her and family members until they were able to get into their car.

Officials say people reportedly had fed a coyote and it might have become used to being around humans.

http://okcfox.com/news/local/rabies-warning-cat-tested-positive-for-disease-in-davis-area


The Oklahoma State Department of Health sent out a warning about rabies after a cat tested positive for the disease. The cat attacked people [in the week of 22 May 2017], near the Arbuckle Wedding Chapel near Davis. It was euthanized and tested for rabies. Since the test came back positive, health officials want to make sure no one else came in contact with the cat. There is no picture of the cat. It was described as medium-size and black.

"How a person can be exposed by rabies is by being bitten or having a lot of saliva into their eyes, their nose, or their mouth, or an open wound less than 24 hours old," said epidemiologist Joli Stone. Stone said the cat was not exhibiting signs of rabies, so someone who came in contact with it, may not realize the cat posed a threat.

Stone said anyone in the Murray county/Garvin county area between 7 May and 22 May 2017 should call the health department, (405) 271-4060. "What we want people to do if they think they've been exposed, seek health care attention because if the vaccine is given, then it can prevent symptoms of disease," Stone said. Untreated, rabies in people is fatal.

http://wfla.com/2017/06/07/target-8-trapped-neutered-vaccinated-and-released-rabid-cat-bites-victim-in-hillsborough-county/


Target 8 has confirmed that a rabid cat that bit a person trying to help it [in the week of 29 May 2017] in Hillsborough county appears to be a feral cat that was trapped, neutered, vaccinated for rabies, then released.

"It did have a clipped ear, yes," said Steve Huard of the Hillsborough County Health Department. The clipped ear signifies the cat was trapped, neutered, vaccinated for rabies and released (TNVR), part of the so called feral cat program. [Many shelters have trap and neuter programs, and some will put a small notch in an ear to indicate the animal has been spayed or neutered. Some veterinarians will do this as well. Some groups will put a tattoo in an ear, often an "X" to indicate the same thing. - Mod.TG] It is aimed at reducing the wild cat population. TNVR is a program the Hillsborough County Pet Resources Center is also helping to fund.

Each month, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, in conjunction with the Pet Resources Center, traps, neuters, vaccinates, and releases hundreds of feral cats. But, there is little accountability. For instance, who worked on the cat in question? Humane Society CEO Sherry Silk was unavailable for an on-camera interview [Wed 7 Jun 2017] but she did text, "No way to know. Could have been us, ACT [Animal Coalition of Tampa], or any of the few vets who do TNR. No way to know."

According to the Department of Health's Steve Huard, it takes 28 days for a rabies vaccine to take hold. That provides little protection for a cat vaccinated one day and released into the wild the next. "If you have an animal that's living in the wild, a feral animal, that was vaccinated and it comes in contact with another animal that has rabies within that 28 day period, it could definitely happen," explained Huard. [Had the cat been exposed prior to being captured for the program? Of course, this question cannot be answered. - Mod.TG]

"If that's the case [referring to the length of 28 days to reach peak titer - Mod.TG], then the cat should've been quarantined until the rabies vaccine took effect," said Amy Howland. Howland sat on the Hillsborough County Animal Advisory Committee task force studying "no kill" policies. She worried this day would come. "This is not a surprise, as pet owners we're supposed to get a rabies shot per our veterinarian once a year," stated Howland. [There are 3-year vaccines, but the rules may vary depending on state or county. - Mod.TG]

As far as rabies shots for feral cats, in Hillsborough county, it's one and done. [Many rabies vaccinations, especially those for cats, are for 3 years. This change was made because some cats develop a vaccine related sarcoma (type of cancer), which can be deadly to the animal. Some states or counties may choose to have the vaccine given more often if there is a large rabies burden in the area. Some recent research has indicated there may be some immunity for 7 years. - Mod.TG]

"I cannot believe that Hillsborough county risks public safety," said Howland. The county's feral cat program runs counter to Department of Health requirements that requires rabies booster shots. Hillsborough county also requires pet owners supply proof that their animals are up to date on their rabies shots before they can be issued licenses.

"Well, the Department of Health's position and recommendation on trap, neuter, and release is, it's not good for public health," explained Huard. [Perhaps it should be asked if it has reduced the cat population, and if there are less cases of rabies in these animals than before the program? - Mod.TG]

[4] New York: goat, human exposure

http://www.timesunion.com/7dayarchive/article/Rabid-goat-euthanized-at-Albany-s-Radix-Center-11203509.php


A goat that was recently euthanized by staff at an Albany nonprofit tested positive for rabies, according to the Albany county's Department of Health.

Members of the public who visited the Radix Ecological Sustainability Center on Grand Street in Albany, where the goat was housed, between 23 May and 6 Jun 2017 [were advised to] contact the county Department of Health to determine if they may need treatment.

The rabies test conducted on the goat's remains came back positive on [Tue 6 Jun 2017]. [What does not seem to be addressed is how did the goat in the center get exposed to rabies? Was it a bite from a rabid bat? Is there some other source of rabies that is being overlooked? Would this set the center up for additional exposures if they have not identified the source? - Mod.TG]

[5] Maine: raccoon, human exposure

A Hope [Knox county] woman began post-exposure vaccinations after being attacked by a raccoon 3 Jun 2017, which the state confirmed had tested positive for rabies. The attack happened in the vicinity of Alford Lake Road and Hatchet Mountain Road, near the lake, said Hope animal control officer Heidi Blood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contacted the town about the positive test, which then informed Officer Blood.

Blood warned that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it's "almost 100 per cent" there are more animals in the area infected with the disease. In fact, Blood said, last summer [2016], 2 raccoons in Lincolnville and one in Hope also all tested positive, so she's seeing an uptick of cases in the area. "Where there is one, there is apt to be more," Blood said of the rabid animals.

Rabies in animals -- especially wildlife -- is common in most parts of the country, including Maine. If a person encounters an animal, it doesn't necessarily have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act "delirious or drunk-like," Blood said. People also commonly think if an animal has mange, it has rabies, which she said is not always the case.

Blood also said it is not uncommon to see young raccoons out and about in the daytime, particularly this time of year, because they are learning to hunt. However, she said people should always err on the side of caution, and they and their pets should avoid the animals. People should also stay away from a dead animal, because rabies can live outside the body for 24 hours, she said.

The animal control officer also reminded residents that it is Maine state law that all cats and dogs must be vaccinated against the disease -- even felines that are considered indoor pets, because bats and other small animals are known to carry the disease.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health [DPH] warned about a possible danger to people after a rabid kitten was found in the Southbury-Waterbury area [New Haven county]. Anyone who might have come into contact with and/or handled the rabid kitten was asked to seek medical attention, the DPH said [on Mon 12 Jun 2017].

It was found in the area of the Wal-Mart off Route 69 in Waterbury at the end of May [2017]. The kitten was also at a Southbury Town Wide Tag Sale on the Town Green near ShopRite on [3 Jun 2017]. Most of the time, the kitten was located near the Whiskers Pet Rescue Booth at the event. The kitten was described as a 4 to 5 week old, injured black and white kitten with a damaged nose. The kitten died on [8 Jun 2017] and tested positive for rabies on [9 Jun 2017].

The Florida Department of Health in Duval County has issued a rabies alert for Jacksonville's beaches area.

The alert, which is in effect through 11 Aug 2017, includes Jacksonville Beach, from the northern border of Neptune Beach to the 26th Avenue South out to the Intracoastal Waterway. The area goes from Osceola Avenue at Blue Heron Lane to Seagate Avenue at Penman Road to the Intracoastal Waterway at Beach Boulevard and to the Atlantic Ocean at Beach Boulevard.

The alert comes after a 19 year old woman said she was attacked by a cat in the Atlantic Beach area and had to be treated for rabies. "I started petting the cat, and it was over kind of perched on a fence, and then I was petting it, and it was fine," she said. But then the cat attacked her. "It jumped over the fence, and then it clawed my arm, and then it bit me," she said. "It was trying to bite me again."

The woman has been to the doctor twice and will have to go 2 more times. She said they are treating her for rabies, even though they can't confirm that's what she has. [She is receiving post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies. - Mod.TG] Rabies exposure in humans can be deadly if not treated immediately. The woman said she called Animal Control, which went to the neighborhood where she was attacked, but it's unclear if the cat was found. Neighbors said there has been a problem with people feeding the stray cats.

According to the health department, there were a total 43 possible rabies exposure cases reported this year [2017] in the area of Clay, Duval, Flagler, and St Johns counties. Anyone bitten by a rabid animal must get a series of vaccines, which can save their life. Stray animals should be reported to local animal control or the city and not approached.

http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/another-rabid-fox-attack-reported-gwinnett/ybu0s5llpb94dr99tuKzEK/


A woman was bit by a rabid fox outside a Lawrenceville repair shop [on Sat 10 Jun 2017], marking the 4th similar incident in Gwinnett county in less than a month. It was also the county's 7th confirmed case of rabies this year [2017]. It saw the same number of cases through the entirety of 2016, officials said.

According to information released by Gwinnett county spokeswoman Heather Sawyer, the unidentified woman was at a repair shop on Cripple Creek Drive on [Sat 10 Jun 2017] when she was bitten on the toe by a young fox. The fox then tried to attack other customers but was killed by bystanders. Tissue from the fox later tested positive for rabies.

Other rabid foxes were reported in the Lawrenceville area on 18, 30, and 31 May 2017. In the 30 May 2017 case, a woman was attacked before fending the fox off with a QuikTrip cup. "Animal welfare and enforcement officials advise there are numerous fox dens in [the area of the Sat 10 Jun 2017 incident] and urge people to use caution if they are approached by animals acting strangely," a county news release said.

Previous rabies cases in Gwinnett included a [15 May 2017] incident involving a cat and 2 separate March incidents involving raccoons. The county had 7 confirmed rabies cases in all of 2016, 4 in 2015, and 12 in 2014, officials said.

Residents are urged to seek immediate medical attention if they come into contact with rabid animals, and to make sure their pets are up-to-date with rabies vaccinations.

An interesting collection of exposures is presented here. With the exception of one, none of these articles emphasize pet vaccinations or the importance of providing rabies clinics to try and reach other people and to make the community aware of a deadly disease. Building a barrier between yourself and this disease is through vaccinating your pets.

Certainly one of these articles explores a controversial issue of when is an animal protected from the virus after receiving a vaccine. According to CDC 28 days is required to reach maximum titers. This is not a forum to debate the trap, neuter, vaccine, release programs nor is it a forum to challenge the 28 days stated by CDC, although there may be more recent research papers that could challenge the time limit and certainly some animals may reach peak titers sooner or later.

The issue of how the goat acquired rabies has not been published or I have missed it [item 4 above].

All mammals are susceptible to this disease and it is deadly. - Mod.TG]
