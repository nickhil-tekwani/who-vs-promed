Two crew members of the container ship MV Athens Bridge, which sailed out of India on 22 Apr [2021], were rushed to the hospital after showing signs of severe COVID-19, the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) said Friday [7 May 2021].

Two members of the Bureau of Quarantine went to check on the crewmen and recommended that 2 of them be brought to the hospital for treatment. Ten other sailors were stricken with COVID-19, but they were left behind on the ship, docked at Sangley Point in Cavite City. Ten oxygen tanks were brought on board the ship to help its ill crew members.

In a Facebook post on Friday [7 May 2021], the Department of Transportation said the maritime sector had aided the vessel's crew of 21 Filipinos, 12 of whom tested positive for COVID-19. The vessel, which flies the flag of Panama, secured clearance from the Bureau of Quarantine and the Department of Health on Thursday [6 May 2021] and was directed to its quarantine anchorage area by the port. "Early evening of the same day [Thu 6 May 2021], BOQ doctors boarded the vessel to assess the condition of the crew and recommended the immediate medical evacuation of 2 crew members in critical condition," the DOTr said.

The Philippine Coast Guard has also provided security to ensure that no unauthorized vessels or bancas would approach the MV Athens Bridge. "The national government, through the maritime sector of the DOTr, assures that the situation and the condition of the crew members will be consistently monitored. Health and safety protocols will also be prioritized throughout the entire process," the DOTr said.

MV Athens Bridge was reported to have departed from India on 22 Apr [2021] and arrived in Haiphong, Viet Nam, on 1 May [2021], where the crew was administered reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.

Thursday [6 May 2021] the PCG received a request from the ship's captain for the medical evacuation of its 2 crew members who required urgent medical care.

[The spread of infectious diseases in a confined environment such as a shipping vessel is a somewhat expected cause of concern for the crew and passengers and presents challenges for public health due to the same reasons: the confinement, together with the high concentration of people in a single space, with potential to enhance the transmission of diseases among those on board. This also mandates stricter control protocols by the health authorities and prevention programs by the industry.

There have been many incidents of SARS-CoV2 outbreaks on cruise ships and other shipping vessels since the start of the pandemic. The 2 largest coronavirus outbreaks occurred on the Ruby Princess ships (March 2020 / Australia; 852 infected, 22 deaths) and Diamond Princess (February 2020 / Japan; 712 infected, 14 deaths). Although the outbreak of COVID-19 contamination at Ruby Princess was the largest recorded in absolute numbers, the extensive literature of articles in international journals of infectology on COVID-19 outbreaks on ships gives greater prominence to the Diamond Princess, both because it was where the 1st outbreak happened, and also because it was the only one where it was possible to map the origin and evolution of the contamination, still inside the ship (https://journals.openedition.org/etudescaribeennes/20047). These outbreaks presented complex problems, which require planning and policy decisions to implement effective control measures, if possible.

[2] Vaccines
[2a] WHO approval of Sinopharm vaccine
Date: Fri 7 May 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/who-lists-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use


The World Health Organization (WHO) today [Fri 7 May 2021] approved emergency listing for China's Sinopharm vaccine, a step that clears the way for a 6th vaccine to be added to the COVAX program.

Today's [Fri 7 May 2021] announcement caps the review of Sinopharm's inactivated vero cell virus vaccine by 2 WHO vaccine advisory groups. The WHO's technical advisory group (TAG) approved the vaccine for emergency listing. Meanwhile, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended the vaccine for people 18 years of age and older on a 2-dose schedule given 3-4 weeks apart. WHO advisors are also reviewing a 2nd vaccine from China, one made by Sinovac.

The vaccine from state-owned Sinopharm had an efficacy rate of 79% in clinical trials.

In a statement, Mariangela Simao, WHO's assistant director-general for access to health products, urged Sinopharm to participate in COVAX, a program designed to speed distribution and equitable access of COVID-19 vaccine. WHO said the vaccine has easy storage requirements that make it well suited to low-resource settings and is the 1st to have a vaccine vial monitor that changes color when the vaccine is exposed to heat.

At a media briefing today [Fri 7 May 2021], WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said vaccines are a vital tool, but the current volume and distribution isn't enough to end the pandemic without the sustained and tailored public health measures that have been shown to work. Tedros praised recent country support for intellectual property waivers for COVID-19 vaccines, and he also emphasized the incredible contributions of the private sector in quickly bringing vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics to the fight against COVID. He added that nearly 100 000 people are dying every week, against the backdrop of vaccine shortages.

"The World Trade Organization provisions for IP waivers were designed precisely for a situation like this," Tedros said. "If we don't use them now, then when?" Tedros urged countries to support technology transfer and offer incentives to manufacturers. However, he said the fastest and most equitable way to increase distribution is for countries with the most vaccines to donate doses to COVAX.

[2b] UK JCVI advises on COVID-19 vaccine for people under 40
Date: Fri 7 May 2021
Source: Gov.UK [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-on-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-aged-under-40


The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has issued advice to the United Kingdom's government on the use of the coronavirus (COVID-19) Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged under 40. The committee has reviewed the latest available evidence, including the current COVID-19 infection rate, the scale and pace of the vaccine programme, and modelling of the timing and size of any 3rd pandemic wave.

This has been considered alongside the latest advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on extremely rare cases of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following the 1st dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

The chances of a younger person becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 get smaller as infection rates increasingly come under control in the UK. Considering this alongside the portfolio of vaccines available in the UK in the coming months and taking a precautionary approach in relation to the extremely small risk of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following the 1st dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the JCVI has advised a preference for adults aged 30-39 without underlying health conditions to receive an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine where available, and only if this does not cause substantial delays in being vaccinated. This follows the decision on 7 Apr [2021] to offer a preference for adults aged under 30.

COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of death, severe disease, and transmission of infection. Over 34 million people have received a 1st dose so far. The vaccine programme is estimated to have prevented over 10 000 deaths by the end of March [2021].

Adverse events following the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are extremely rare, and, for the vast majority of people, the benefits of preventing serious illness and death far outweigh any risks. Up to 28 Apr 2021, the MHRA had received 242 reports of blood clotting cases in people who also had low levels of platelets in the UK, following the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. These numbers are very small compared to the millions of people who have received the vaccine. The overall incidence of case reports of thromboembolic events with low platelets after 1st or unknown doses was 10.5 per million doses. The majority of these extremely rare events occurred after the 1st dose.

Everybody who has already had a 1st dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine should receive a 2nd dose of the same jab, irrespective of age, except for the very small number of people who experienced blood clots with low platelet counts from their 1st vaccination. Getting the 2nd vaccine dose is very important because it further increases the level of protection against COVID-19.

Professor Wei Shen Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JCVI, said: "Safety remains our number one priority. We have continued to assess the benefit-risk balance of COVID-19 vaccines in light of UK infection rates and the latest information from the MHRA on the extremely rare event of blood clots and low platelet counts following vaccination.

"As COVID-19 rates continue to come under control, we are advising that adults aged 18-39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine. The advice is specific to circumstances in the UK at this time and maximises use of the wide portfolio of vaccines available.

"The COVID-19 vaccines have already saved thousands of lives, and the benefit for the majority of the population is clear: if you are offered the vaccine, you should take it."

As a precautionary measure, anyone who has the following symptoms from around 4 days to 4 weeks after vaccination is advised to seek prompt medical advice:
- a severe headache that is not relieved with painkillers or is getting worse;
- a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over;
- a headache that is unusual for you and occurs with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or seizures;
- a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin;
- shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain.

Source: Gov.UK [abridged, edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-response-to-jcvi-advice-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-for-people-aged-under-40


Statement from Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, following the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's new advice

"Public safety is always at the forefront of our minds, and we take every report seriously. Our position remains that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca against COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people but is more finely balanced for younger people, and we advise that this evolving evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the vaccine, as JVCI has done.

"We rigorously monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and all reports of these extremely rare blood clots occurring together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) have been scientifically scrutinised as soon as we have received them. We continue to publish the latest breakdown of all cases of these extremely rare side effects in our weekly summary of coronavirus Yellow Card reporting. We have also issued clear guidance for healthcare professionals on how to minimise risks, as well as further advice on symptoms for vaccine recipients to look out for 4 or more days after vaccination.

"This continuous and rigorous safety monitoring has allowed us to provide scientifically based information, analysis, and advice -- such as that provided to the JCVI -- to enable continued judgements on the most effective use of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca based on the data and the current UK context in terms of COVID-19 incidence and vaccine supply. What this shows is that, with support from the public and healthcare professionals, our safety monitoring systems are working effectively.

"The public should be reassured of our continuing high standards when monitoring these vaccines for safety, quality, and effectiveness. It is still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination when invited to do so. We ask anyone who suspects they have experienced a side effect linked with their COVID-19 vaccine to report it to the Coronavirus Yellow Card website."

Background:
These reports have also been analysed by the government's independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and its COVID-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group, which includes lay representatives and advice from leading haematologists.

As a precautionary measure, anyone is advised to seek prompt medical advice [if experiencing] symptoms 4 days or more after vaccination such as
- a new onset of severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion, or seizures;
- shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain;
- unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the injection site.

[3] Variants
[3a] B.1.617.2 designated a "variant of concern"
Date: Fri 7 May 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/7/uk-scientists-warn-over-indian-covid-variant-of-concern-report


British officials could declare one of the new coronavirus strains first found in India a "variant of concern", the BBC said. The BBC said scientists in the United Kingdom have flagged evidence that the Indian variant of the virus spreads more quickly than its original version, Reuters news agency reported on Friday [7 May 2021]. Scientists have recommended that one version of the variant first found in India, known as B.1.617.2, is designated a "variant of concern", the BBC said, adding more than 500 cases of the variant had been recorded, up from 202 last week.

Public Health England (PHE), which postponed publication of its weekly data on variants on Thursday [6 May 2021], had no immediate comment on the report.

Jeff Barrett, director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute COVID-19 Genomics Initiative, said that high numbers of cases of B.1.617.2 in Britain and around the world were "consistent with this one being more transmissible than older versions of the virus from last year [2020]."

"(It is) possibly as transmissible as the B.117 Kent variant that is very widespread in the UK," Barrett said on BBC radio, referring to the strain found in south east England that fuelled Britain's 2nd COVID-19 wave.

The original India variant, B.1.617, was first detected in October [2020], but PHE has categorised 3 different subtypes, all with slightly different mutations. WHO says the variant has already spread to more than a dozen countries, forcing nations to cut or restrict movements from India.

Other variants of concern include variants first identified in Kent, southeast England, as well as South Africa and Brazil, and Barrett said that there had been reassuring evidence from real-world studies on the effectiveness of vaccines on those. "That paints a relatively positive picture that the vaccines are going to continue to have efficacy," he said. "So obviously for new variants like this one, we need to do additional experiments and really get the solid proof one way or the other about that."

Prominent US disease modeller Chris Murray, from the University of Washington, said the sheer magnitude of infections in India in a short period of time suggests an "escape variant" may be overpowering any prior immunity from natural infections. Infections are now spreading from overcrowded cities to remote rural villages that are home to nearly 70% of the 1.3 billion population.

Although northern and western India bear the brunt of the disease, southern India now seems to be turning into the new epicentre. The share of the 5 southern states in the country's daily surge in infections rose from 28% to 33% in the 1st 7 days of May [2021], data shows. On Friday [7 May 2021], India reported another record daily rise in coronavirus cases -- 414 188 -- bringing total new cases for the week to 1.57 million. Deaths from COVID-19 rose by 3915 to 234 083. Medical experts say the real extent of COVID-19 in India is 5-10 times the official tallies.

In the past week, India has reported an extra 1.5 million new infections and record daily death tolls as its hospitals run out of beds and medical oxygen. Since the start of the pandemic, it has reported 21.49 million cases and 234 083 deaths. It currently has 3.6 million active cases.

While India is the world's biggest vaccine maker, it is struggling to produce and distribute enough doses to stem the wave of COVID-19. Although the country has administered at least 157 million vaccine doses, its rate of inoculation has fallen sharply in recent days.

"After having achieved a rate of around 4 million a day, we are now down to 2.5 million per day due to vaccine shortages," Amartya Lahiri, an economics professor at University of British Columbia, was quoted as saying in the Mint newspaper. "The 5 million a day target is the lower bound of what we have to aim for, since even at that rate, it will take a year for us to get everyone 2 doses. The situation, unfortunately, is very grim."

In India's tech capital, Bengaluru, also in the south, only 23 of the 590 beds in ICUs were vacant, and only one in 50 beds with a ventilator were vacant, a situation that officials say points to an impending crisis. The test-positivity rate -- the percentage of people tested who are found to have the disease -- in the city of 12.5 million has tripled to almost 39% as of Wednesday [5 May 2021], from about 13% 2 weeks ago, data showed.

Bengaluru has 325 000 active COVID-19 cases, with demand for ICU and high-dependency unit (HDU) beds up more than 20-fold, said H M Prasanna, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association in Karnataka state, which includes Bengaluru. "Every patient coming to the hospital needs an ICU or an HDU bed... That is why patients are running from one hospital to another searching for an ICU bed," he said. "There is also a short supply of medical oxygen... Most of the small hospitals now who can't procure oxygen on a daily basis are refusing to admit COVID patients."

[Also see https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/who-lists-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use: "...In a related development, Public Health England today said it has reclassified B1617.2, a version of the variant first seen in India, as a variant of concern, and current evidence suggests it as at least as transmissible at the B117 variant first detected in the UK.

"At today's [Fri 7 May 2021] WHO briefing, Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the group's technical lead for COVID, said the variant has characteristics that are associated with increased transmission and that a WHO working group is currently reviewing more detailed information from India and other countries where B1617 is circulated.

"WHO officials emphasized today [Fri 7 May 2021] that the variants are only one factor in recent surges, including in India, and pointed out that social mixing and relaxed restrictions are also playing key roles in virus spread."

The strain -- B1617.2 -- is one of 3 related variants that have been detected in the UK. The others are B1617.1 and B1617.3. All 3 were designated as variants under investigation; however, PHE confirmed on Fri 7 May [2021] that B1617.2 is now a variant of concern.

Initial data suggested there were 202 cases of the B1617.2 variant, 193 confirmed cases of the B1617.1 variant, with 61 more cases confirmed since then, and 5 cases of the B1617.3 variant. On 7 May 7 [2021], PHE confirmed cases of B1617.2 had shot up to 520 in the space of a week. Almost half the cases were related to travel or contact with a traveller.

WHO is also monitoring the India variant, which was first discovered in October 2020. It is currently designated a "variant under investigation" by the global health body. There is no evidence so far that the B1617.2 variant can sidestep vaccine immunity, and health experts have said they "haven't seen any hint" of a current COVID variant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines, which is promising. There is also insufficient evidence to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India causes more severe disease. - Mod.UBA]

[3b] SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351: reinfections
Date: Sat 8 May 2021
Source: Eurosurveillance [edited]
https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.18.2100423


Abstract. We describe 4 SARS-CoV-2 reinfections with a B.1.351 variant in 2021, in health care workers (HCWs) previously infected in 2020, before detection of this variant in Europe. Cases live in France, near the border with Luxembourg, where variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 circulated. All work in the same hospital unit where a cluster of COVID 19 with B1.351 variant occurred, affecting patients and HCWs. Before the cluster onset, HCWs used surgical masks, as per recommendations. After cluster onset, HCWs used FFP2 masks.

[In South Africa, another variant of SARS-CoV-2 (known as 20H/501Y.V2 or B.1.351) emerged independently of B.1.1.7, which was reported first in the UK. This variant has multiple mutations in the spike protein, including K417N, E484K, N501Y. Unlike the B.1.1.7 lineage detected in the UK, this variant does not contain the deletion at 69/70. This variant was first identified in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, in samples dating back to the beginning of October 2020, and cases attributed to this variant have been detected in multiple countries outside of South Africa. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that this variant has any impact on disease severity. However, there is some evidence to indicate that one of the spike protein mutations, E484K, may affect neutralization by some polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the most important neutralising potential is ascribed to antibodies against the S protein, given its role in binding to and fusing to the targeted host cells, and its exposure to the immune system [https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001439]. Because of its binding and fusing functions, the S protein has been chosen as the target for vaccines. All currently authorised COVID-19 vaccines are mostly based on the well-characterised historical SARS-CoV-2 variants. Titres of anti-S antibodies seem to be higher on average in vaccinated subjects (2 weeks after receiving the 2nd dose of the mRNA-based vaccines) than following natural infection.

However, there are no established threshold of antibody protection to date, and the main purpose of performing serology in a routine hospital setting remains the demonstration of earlier contact with the virus itself or, more recently, with a spike-based vaccine.

So with reinfections being reported even in vaccinated individuals, the use of serological tests for the presence of antibodies would likely provide evidence of a past infection than to determine a protection.

The authors conclude: "Re-infection is possible with the B1.351 variant in people who had a 1st asymptomatic or symptomatic infection with one of the historical SARS-CoV-2 strains between 3 to 12 months earlier. Anti-spike antibodies may perhaps not protect against a re-infection with the B1.351 variant. The number of re-infections described here was limited, and re-infections should be further studied in larger populations to determine their frequency. The re-infections we observed were in young HCWs without underlying conditions, and disease was not severe." - Mod.UBA]

[4] Slovakia: impact of population-wide rapid antigen testing on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence
Date: Fri 7 May 2021
Source: Science [summ., edited]
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6542/635.abstract


Slovakia conducted multiple rounds of population-wide rapid antigen testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2020, combined with a period of additional contact restrictions. Observed prevalence decreased by 58% (95% confidence interval: 57 to 58%) within one week in the 45 counties that were subject to 2 rounds of mass testing, an estimate that remained robust when adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Adjusting for epidemic growth of 4.4% (1.1 to 6.9%) per day preceding the mass testing campaign, the estimated decrease in prevalence compared with a scenario of unmitigated growth was 70% (67 to 73%). Modeling indicated that this decrease could not be explained solely by infection control measures but required the addition of the isolation and quarantine of household members of those testing positive.

[Mass testing campaigns are proposed to rapidly identify infectious individuals and allow the targeting of nonpharmaceutical interventions. However, molecular testing using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection is not suitable for mass use. Although laboratory capacities have been expanded in most countries, PCR testing remains expensive, with turnaround times of more than one day, which undermines its utility, with PCR detection extending to even the post-infectious period with false positive results.

On the other hand, rapid antigen tests are more cost effective and can be quickly produced in large quantities, with onsite results in 15-30 min without the need for a complex laboratory facility. They are less sensitive in detecting infections with low viral load but can detect over 70% of likely infectious cases. A recent observational study estimated the sensitivity of lateral flow devices in detecting infectious individuals to be as high as 83-91%. [<www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-21-lateral-flow-devices-detect-most-infectious-covid-19-casesand-could-allow-safer>]. Mass testing can be considered as a viable part of the portfolio of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

In October and November 2020, Slovakia used rapid antigen tests in a pilot campaign that targeted the whole population to identify infectious cases at scale, rapidly reduce transmission, and thus allow easing of lockdown measures, and the testing was prioritized in the high-burden counties.

The authors conclude: "The combination of nationwide restrictions and mass testing with quarantining of household contacts of test positives rapidly reduced the prevalence of infectious residents in Slovakia. Although it was impossible to disentangle the precise contribution of control measures and mass testing, the latter is likely to have had a substantial effect in curbing the pandemic in Slovakia and may provide a valuable tool in future containment of SARS-CoV-2 elsewhere." - Mod.UBA]
