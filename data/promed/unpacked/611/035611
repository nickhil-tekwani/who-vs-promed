The death toll in a Ugandan cholera epidemic that began late last year and
has been been worsened by floods bursting sewers, and has now reached 460.
Ten thousand people have been hospitalised. Primary schools have been given
strict hygienic measures to adhere to, and food will be banned from the
schools when classes begin again on Monday after a holiday.
