Current health crisis: anthrax
------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported some 200 human cases of
anthrax since November 2008 with 8 confirmed deaths. These cases were
attributed to the ingestion of animals (cattle and goats) that had died of
anthrax. Zimbabweans avoid eating animals that have died of disease, but
these cases appear to [have] occurred in starving rural people scavenging
carrion.

Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) was told that veterinary anthrax control
programs in Zimbabwe, which had included regular monthly control programs,
have been dramatically curtailed in the economic collapse. The surviving
herds are now much more vulnerable to infectious diseases.

[Seen against the larger canvas the anthrax problem is trivial unless one
accepts that with the breakdown of human and veterinary health services the
available data is but a fraction of reality; in the late 1970s there were
some 10 000 human cases of anthrax in the country due to wet weather and a
breakdown in the delivery of veterinary services thanks to the civil
insurgency.

The above came from the PHR Executive Summary of the report. Other links:

A search of the PHR full report (see pages 31-32)
<http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/documents/reports/2009-health-in-ruins-zim-full.pdf>
revealed the the following comment in WHO source document below from which
the PHR segment was based:

"According to WHO figures, there have been 200 human cases of anthrax
reported since November 2008, with 8 deaths. Consumption of contaminated
meat is a possible cause." ex WHO Zimbabwe Health Cluster Bulletin No 2 -
12 December 2008
<http://www.who.int/hac/crises/zmb/sitreps/health_cluster_bulletin_12dec2008/en/>.

PHR also comments: "PHR was also told that veterinary anthrax control
programs in Zimbabwe, which had included regular monthly dipping programs
for cattle, have been dramatically curtailed in the economic collapse. The
results in the veterinary sector are that dipping and vaccination of
livestock have largely ceased and the surviving herds are much more
vulnerable to infectious diseases." There is little that one can add.
