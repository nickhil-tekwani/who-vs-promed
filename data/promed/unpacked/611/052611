WEST NILE VIRUS, REPTILES, ALLIGATORS - USA (FL) (03)

I think that another question should be: What does West Nile virus in
Florida alligators tell us about West Nile virus and its spread in the US?
The first of the articles that Promed-mail posted [see: West Nile virus,
reptiles, alligators - USA (FL) 20021114.5797 - Mod.CP] discussed the
possibility that some or many of the deaths of "hundreds" of alligators in
a 4 year period was caused by West Nile virus. If this is proven, then West
Nile virus must have been ingrained in the Florida environment long before
theorized. It might also indicate that West Nile virus was here long before
1999.
Another possibility is that West Nile virus was first in the Florida
environment then made its way to New York City. This would make a case for
entry of West Nile virus into the US [from the south rather than the east].
I hope that someone with expertise in reptile viruses would post comments
on finding West Nile virus in alligators. An arbovirus expert told me that
finding West Nile virus in alligators was "amazing".
