Haiti has seen an increase in cholera cases since May 2011, due to a
lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and the beginning of the
rainy season and flooding, the Geneva-based World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Fri 24 Jun 2011.

The rise was particularly strong in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and
the southern peninsula. In Port-au-Prince alone, WHO reported 18 182
new cases from 2 May 2011 to 12 Jun 2011. A shortage of funds was also
threatening international health efforts in Haiti, it said.

WHO said the number of nongovernmental organizations (NGO) fighting
cholera in the country had decreased from several hundred at the
beginning of the outbreak in 2010 to about 60 because of insufficient
funding. For the same reason, the remaining NGOs had cut their
programs in providing clean water and sanitation and other measures to
contain the epidemic.

According to Haiti's Ministry of Public Health, as of 12 Jun 2011,
there had been a total of 344 623 cases of cholera and 5397 related
deaths.

[With the onset of the spring/summer rainy season to more easily
spread _V. cholerae_ via contaminated water, cholera has become even
more of an issue in the country. The lack of clean water and much of a
public health infrastructure and drying up of outside funding will all
compound to produce a horrendous impact on this country. - Mod.LL

Health authorities in the Dominican Republic say cholera has killed 2
more people, bringing the death toll from the disease to at least 48
people in the country.

The Ministry of Health said the latest victims were a 29 year old man
and a 63 year old man. The ministry said in a statement Mon 20 Jun
2011, that the deaths occurred over the weekend in Santiago, about 93
miles (150 kilometers) north of the capital.

Cholera has sickened more than 1550 in the Dominican Republic since
May 2011.

[The disease had smoldered in DR after introduction primarily from
contaminated rivers and streams flowing from Haiti until the
spring/summer rainy season has hastened its effect on the Dominican
Republic. - Mod.LL
