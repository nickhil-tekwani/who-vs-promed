A border guard in Southern Kazakhstan has been hospitalized on
suspicion of rabies virus infection. The information was given by
Galimjan Abish, deputy minister of the health department.

According to him, the border guard has been admitted to the
Infectious Diseases Department of Saryagash District Hospital [South
Kazakhstan province]. The border guard is under medical surveillance,
but the clinical assessment strongly suggests that he has rabies, said
Abish.

On 26 Mar 2011 the 25-year-old border guard attended a Health Post
complaining of symptoms of osteochondrosis, On 28 Mar 2011 he felt
worse and when exhibiting other symptoms he was transferred to
hospital. According to Abish, the young man had not been bitten by a
dog. However in 2010 his father was bitten by a dog. The young man
killed the dog and sent the head for medical examination. However,
medical authorities concluded that that dog did not have rabies.

Currently the young man remains in hospital in very severe
condition.

[This may be the 2nd of case of human rabies recorded in Southern
Kazakhstan in 2011. A previous case occurred in March in Shymkent
where a 51-year old woman died from rabies. - Corr.BA]

[The report above does not indicate whether the father of the young
man actually contracted rabies, or alternatively whether he received
post-exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.NR]

[Further information on the outcome of the patient's illness and
final confirmation of the diagnosis of rabies are awaited. A map of
