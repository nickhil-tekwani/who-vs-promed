The deaths due to an unknown disease in Kandhamal district of Odisha
increased to 10 on Wed 23 Oct 2009, with 2 more persons breathing
their last at the MKCG Hospital at Berhampur.

Although the 1st death took place at Gudrigaon village of Kandhamal 6
days ago, the authorities had not been able to conduct the necessary
examination to know the cause of the deaths so far.

Even as the state government had sent a medical team, the death toll
was likely to rise, as 10 more persons were admitted to different
hospitals.

All the deaths had taken place in Gudrigaon village so far, though
some people from a neighbouring village had been taken ill with
similar symptoms.

While some were of the view that deaths could be due to cerebral
malaria, others were suspecting that the deaths were due to
consumption of poisonous mushrooms.

Meanwhile, a team of medical experts from the Regional Medical
Research Centre in Bhubaneswar left for Kandhamal to inquire about
the cause of the deaths, as they were suspecting that the deaths
could have taken place due to some viral infection.

[It is very difficult to know what is happening without further
information. Orissa is not a high risk area for malaria, and the
report does not mention fever as part of the symptoms, which -- if
true -- rules out malaria with a high probability. ProMED will be
glad to post further information on the outbreak.
