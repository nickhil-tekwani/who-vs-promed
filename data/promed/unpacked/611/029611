On [27 Aug 2020], officials at the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed a 5-year-old Paint mare in Riverside County with West Nile virus (WNV). She began experiencing clinical signs of ataxia (loss of control of limb and bodily movements), facial twitching, and muscle fasciculations (twitching) on [17 Aug 2020]. The mare, who was unvaccinated, is reported as recovering.

This is California's 6th confirmed case of WNV in 2020. Confirmed positive horses have been located in the following counties:
Amador (1)
Merced (1)
Riverside (2)
San Joaquin (1)
Stanislaus (1)

Four of the horses were unvaccinated, and 2 had unknown vaccination histories. 4 horses have survived, 1 died, and 1 was euthanized.

On 26 Aug 2020 officials at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) confirmed a 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding with West Nile virus (WNV). The horse first showed clinical signs on [4 Aug 2020]. Signs included fever, ataxia (loss of control of bodily movement), and depression. The horse was under-vaccinated and is reported as recovering. This case marks Florida's 7th confirmed case of WNV in 2020.

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- mild anorexia and depression;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against, at least annually.

An unvaccinated gelding in Washington County was the 1st reported West Nile virus (WNV) case in Kentucky for 2020.

Results of diagnostic testing reported on [15 Sep 2020] by the University of Kentucky's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the state's 1st equine diagnosed with West Nile Virus in Kentucky this year, according to Rusty Ford, Equine Operations Consultant with the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office.

The confirmation is based on detectable West Nile virus-specific IgM antibodies and compatible clinical symptoms.

The 15-year-old unvaccinated Quarter Horse gelding in Washington County had onset of clinical signs on [8 Sep 2020] including being hypersensitive to touch and knuckling over. On [15 Sep 2020] the gelding was described by the attending veterinarian as having responded to treatment and was much improved with a favorable prognosis.

The Kentucky Department of Agriculture's web page will be updated to reflect this 1st equine case. Current and historical summaries can be found by visiting its website at https://www.kyagr.com/statevet/west-nile-info.html.

"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus first detected in the USA in the New York City area in 1999. Since 1999, the virus has spread throughout the USA and Canada, infecting birds, humans, horses, and other animals. The virus is maintained in the wild bird population and is spread between birds by mosquitos. Birds are considered the natural reservoir for WNV since high levels of virus circulate in their bloodstream. Mosquitos acquire WNV in blood meals from infected birds and pass it on to other birds, animals, and people. Mosquitos that feed on an infected horse or human have not demonstrated the ability to ingest enough of the virus to transmit it to other animals or humans; therefore, horses and humans are considered "dead end hosts.

"Clinical signs: WNV may cause a wide range of clinical illness ranging from mild "flu-like" signs to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that may be fatal to both humans and horses. While horses are susceptible to WNV infection, many infected horses do not develop clinical illness and recover uneventfully.

Consult a veterinarian if your horse exhibits any of the following clinical signs:
- fever
- incoordination, especially in rear limbs, causing stumbling and falling
- generalized weakness, muscle twitching, seizures or coma
- drooping lips and lip smacking, head drooping, grinding teeth
- hypersensitivity to touch or sound
- recumbency (inability to rise)

"Diagnosis: Any horse displaying abnormal behavior or neurologic signs should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out neurologic diseases, such as WNV, equine herpesvirus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalopathy, eastern/western encephalomyelitis, and rabies."

Please remember to prevent this disease by vaccinating your animal.
