In the 1st 3-6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of overweight or obese children and teens from low-income families in Ohio climbed from 38% to 45%, suggests a study presented last week at the European Congress on Obesity in the Netherlands [see citation below].

In the observational study, which was published online 6 Apr [2022] in Clinical Obesity, researchers from Nationwide Children's Hospital and Ohio State University used primary-care electronic medical records to track the body mass index (BMI) of 4509 children and teens aged 2-17 years from low-income families, comparing weight and height data from both before and after the pandemic began (1 Jan - 30 Mar 2020 and 1 Jun - September 2020).

From before to after the beginning of the pandemic, the proportion of overweight or obese youth rose from 37.8% to 44.6%, while the share of healthy-weight youth fell by 5.6%. Overall, 23.1% of children and teens gained 5 or more kilograms (kg) (11 pounds), while 4.3% gained at least 10 kg (22 pounds), and 17.8% saw an increase in BMI of 2 or more units.

Of youth who were underweight before the pandemic, 45.3% moved into the healthy-weight range after a median gain of 2.1 kg (4.6 pounds). Among children and teens who stayed in the same weight category, median weight gain was greatest in those who were severely obese, at 5.8 kg (12.8 pounds), those who were obese (4.3 kg [9.5 pounds]), overweight (2.7 kg [5.6 pounds]), and healthy weight (1.7 kg [3.7 pounds]).

In an age-stratified analysis, boys aged 2-5 years were less likely than girls their age to move to concerning weight change (CWC) status, and Hispanic youth were more likely than their White counterparts to do so (odds ratio [OR], 2.04).

Among 6-9-year-olds, boys were more likely than girls to move to CWC status (OR, 1.36). In the 10-13-year age group, the likelihood of change to CWC was higher among Black than White youth.

Most children (80.5%) were in the non-concerning weight-change category, 73.8% stayed in their original weight category, 6.7% moved to a healthier weight category, and 19.5% moved from a healthier weight to CWC.

In a binomial logistic regression analysis, the chances of 2-5-year-olds and 6-9-year-olds moving to CWC status were higher than those of 14-17-year-olds (OR, 1.9).

In a European Association for the Study of Obesity news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/951909], Ihuoma Eneli, MD, said that pandemic lockdowns may have exacerbated a long-regarded problem with overweight and obesity in the United States. "The early months of school closures, bans on social gatherings, disruptions to sleep, and lack of exercise, increased screen time and snacking, as well as heightened stress and anxiety created the perfect storm for having issues with weight gain," she said.

Eneli said that weight gain during childhood endures into adulthood and can have substantial health consequences such as type 2 diabetes and lead to increased healthcare utilization. "Poverty makes both obesity and its negative health effects more likely, and access to obesity care is disproportionately lower in minority populations," she said. "These new data underscore why urgent action is needed to close the gap between the most and least deprived to ensure every child has an equal chance to grow up healthy."

Eneli called for studies tracking weight changes over a long period later in the pandemic. "Along with several negative pandemic-related consequences on child health (e.g., increased mental health concerns, food insecurity, deficits in immunization coverage, and school performance), addressing the excessive weight gain should be a top priority for families, administrators, or policymakers," she said.

The researchers said that the concerning findings in non-White youth may indicate a further widening of racial and ethnic healthy disparities. "These results should inform decision-making in short-term responses to catastrophic events, particularly when safety and social networks to support families are limited," they wrote.

Without a substantial infusion of cash from Congress, the United States could see another 100 million COVID-19 cases come fall, the White House warned today [9 May 2022].

The Biden administration is asking for USD 22.5 billion in emergency aid, but Republicans are countering with a USD 10 billion plan with a limited package for global aid. The White House argues that cases will soar without adequate resources for booster vaccines, testing, and treatments.

COVID-19 cases are increasing across the country at a steady clip. The 7-day average of new daily cases is 72 345, with 286 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]. In the past week, new daily cases rose 24%, hospitalizations rose 9%, and deaths fell 15%.

In other news, nearly 70% of Americans think long COVID is a disability and approve of giving stronger support to people who have it, including workplace protections and free medical care, according to a new Axios-Ipsos poll [https://www.axios.com/2022/05/07/axios-ipsos-poll-long-covid].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late last month [April 2022] released new data showing that about 60% of Americans have been infected with COVID-19 [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/cdc-58-americans-have-had-covid-19].

In March [2022], the Government Accountability Office estimated 7.7 million - 23 million Americans may be suffering from long COVID symptoms.

In China, officials in Shanghai -- now in its 6th week of lockdown -- are tightening restrictions again in 4 districts where they had recently loosened them. The step is because of ongoing cases detected outside of quarantine facilities. In Beijing, officials are imposing lockdowns in hot spot districts.

In South Africa, an ongoing 5th wave of COVID-19 activity has been fueled by BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants. Hospitalizations are increasing, but not as much as in earlier waves.

The subvariant infections are breaking through original omicron variant infections, but less so in people who have hybrid immunity from vaccines and previous infections.

[3] COVID surges
Date: Tue 10 May 2022

Here we go again. Nearly 6 months after researchers in South Africa identified the omicron coronavirus variant, 2 offshoots of the game-changing lineage are once again driving a surge in COVID-19 cases there.

Several studies released in the past week show that the variants -- known as BA.4 and BA.5 -- are slightly more transmissible than earlier forms of omicron (1) and can dodge some of the immune protection conferred by previous infection and vaccination (2,3).

"We're definitely entering a resurgence in South Africa, and it seems to be driven entirely by BA.4 and BA.5," says Penny Moore, a virologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, whose team is studying the variants. "We're seeing crazy numbers of infections. Just within my lab, I have 6 people off sick."

However, scientists say it is not yet clear whether BA.4 and BA.5 will cause much of a spike in hospitalizations in South Africa or elsewhere. High levels of population immunity -- provided by previous waves of omicron infection and by vaccination -- might blunt much of the damage previously associated with new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Moreover, the rise of BA.4 and BA.5 -- as well as that of another omicron offshoot in North America -- could mean that SARS-CoV-2 waves are beginning to settle into predictable patterns, with new waves periodically emerging from circulating strains (see 'Omicron's new identities'). "These are the 1st signs that the virus is evolving differently," compared with the 1st 2 years of the pandemic when variants seemed to appear out of nowhere, says Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, who led one of the studies.

By analysing viral genomes from clinical samples, de Oliveira and his colleagues found1that BA.4 and BA.5 emerged in mid-December 2021 and early January 2022, respectively. The lineages have been rising in prevalence since then, and currently account for 60-75% of COVID-19 cases in South Africa. Researchers have also identified the variants in more than a dozen other countries, mostly in Europe.

On the basis of the growth in BA.4 and BA.5 case numbers in South Africa -- which now average nearly 5000 per day, from a low of around 1200 in March [2022] -- de Oliveira's team estimates that the variants are spreading slightly faster than the BA.2 sub-lineage of omicron (which itself was a bit more transmissible than the 1st omicron variant, BA.1). The study was posted on the medRxiv preprint server and has not yet been peer-reviewed.

The boost in transmissibility is "quite an advantage" and similar in magnitude to the advantages that some other fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants had over their predecessors, says Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. "Taking everything together and looking at all the data, it seems a sizeable new infection wave is certain to come."

Jesse Bloom, a viral evolutionary biologist at Fred Hutch, a research centre in Seattle, Washington, agrees that BA.4 and BA.5 are spreading faster than other omicron lineages. "What is still unclear is why they are more transmissible," he says. "One possibility is that they are just inherently better at transmitting." The other is that the variants are better at eluding immune responses such as antibodies, allowing them to infect people with prior immunity.

Both are closely related to BA.2, although exactly how is not clear, Bloom adds (see 'Pathogen progression'). BA.4 and BA.5 both carry a key mutation called F486V in their spike proteins -- the viral protein responsible for infection and the prime target of immune responses. Bloom's team has previously found that this mutation could help variants to dodge virus-blocking antibodies.

Further studies suggest that BA.4 and BA.5 are growing, at least in part, because of their ability to evade immune responses. A team led by virologist Alex Sigal at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, analysed blood samples from 39 people who had been infected during the first omicron wave, 15 of whom had been vaccinated (2).

In lab experiments, antibodies in these samples were several times less effective at preventing cells from being infected by BA.4 or BA.5 than they were at keeping out the original omicron strain. However, antibodies produced by people who had been vaccinated were more potent against the new variants than were those from people whose immunity stemmed solely from BA.1 infection. The study was posted on medRxiv.

Another study (3), posted on the ResearchSquare preprint server and led by virologist Xiaoliang Xie at Peking University in Beijing, also found that antibodies triggered by BA.1 infection were less potent against BA.4 and BA.5. Moore says the results chime with her unpublished experiments, too.

BA.4 and BA.5's capacity to escape immunity, although not dramatic, "is enough to cause trouble and lead to an infection wave," but the variants are not likely to cause disease much more severe than was seen during the previous wave, especially in vaccinated people, Sigal said in a Twitter post [https://twitter.com/sigallab/]. "They clearly have an advantage in antibody escape, which is one contributing factor in why they are spreading," says Bloom.

Hospitalizations are slowly ticking up in South Africa -- from a low of just under 2000 people in hospital with COVID-19 in early April [2022] -- but researchers say it's too soon to tell whether BA.4 and BA.5 will put much pressure on health-care systems. "The hospitals are empty in South Africa, and we have high population immunity," says de Oliveira.

Although BA.4 and BA.5 have been detected in several European countries and in North America, the variants might not set off a fresh COVID-19 wave in these places, at least right away. The closely related BA.2 variant has just swept through Europe, so the population's immunity could still be high, says Wenseleers. "It gives hope that maybe in Europe it will have a smaller advantage and will cause a smaller wave."

Some parts of North America are also seeing the rise of other omicron sub-lineages that have spike-protein mutations in some of the same places as in BA.4 and BA.5. One such variant -- called BA.2.12.1 -- also has the capacity to evade antibodies triggered by a previous omicron infection and vaccination, according to the study (3) led by Xie, and separate work by virologist David Ho at Columbia University in New York City. (Ho hasn't yet reported his team's data in a preprint, but has shared them with US government officials.)

The emergence of these strains suggests that the omicron lineage is continuing to make gains by eroding immunity, says Ho. "It's pretty clear that there are a few holes in omicron that are gradually being filled up by these new sub-variants."

If SARS-CoV-2 continues along this path, its evolution could come to resemble that of other respiratory infections, such as influenza. In this scenario, immune-evading mutations in circulating variants, such as omicron, could combine with dips in population-wide immunity to become the key drivers of periodic waves of infection. "It is probably what we should expect to see more and more of in the future," says Moore.

Previous variants, including alpha, delta, and omicron, differed substantially from their immediate predecessors, and all emerged, instead, from distant branches on the SARS-CoV-2 family tree.

Wenseleers and other scientists say we shouldn't rule out more such surprises from SARS-CoV-2. For instance, Delta hasn't completely vanished and, as global immunity to omicron and its expanding family increases, a delta descendant could mount a comeback. Whatever their source, new variants seem to emerge roughly every 6 months, notes Wenseleers, and he wonders whether this is the structure that COVID-19 epidemics will settle into.

"That is one way to read the patterns that have been observed so far," says Bloom. "But I think we should be cautious in extrapolating general rules from a fairly short observation time frame."

[In the past 24 hours, 9 countries including the USA (106 473), Japan (74 606), South Korea (49 896), Australia (48 884), Germany (40 350), Taiwan (40 233), the UK (26 253), Argentina (17 646), and Italy (17 421) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1700 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 7 May 2022 to late 8 May 2022).

A total of 31 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 16 of the 31 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 0 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 0.18%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 24.4% increase in daily reported cases and 23.5% increase in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths (US has shown an increasing trend in cases and deaths over the last few days).

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.51 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 517.77 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.27 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
