The Public Health Agency has already recorded 14 persons affected in the current legionellosis outbreak detected in Blanes 2 weeks ago. There are 11 male and 3 female patients between 47 and 82 years old, 4 more affected subjects compared to one week ago. 4 of the 14 patients are still hospitalized, 2 of them in Blanes Community Hospital: an 80-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman, both local residents in the community. Also, a 64-year-old man in Puigvert Clinic and a 54-year-old Blanes citizen are still hospitalized. This last subject is in the Intensive Care Unit of Josep Trueta Hospital in Girona.

All patients are responding well to therapy measures for pneumonia caused by _Legionella_, and according to the Public Health Agency, officers are working in order to detect the presence of additional cases related to this legionellosis outbreak in Blanes.

On the other hand, investigations to find out the origin of this outbreak are still ongoing, and results of comparative studies of samples taken from patients and samples taken from suspicious sites are pending. Preventative measures have been implemented in suspicious sites, in order to avoid the occurrence of new cases.

The 1st 3 affected persons diagnosed with the disease are Dutch tourists who were living in a local camping site, so technicians directed their investigations to this facility, and preventive measures have been taken in toilet modules and the swimming pool.

However, the 3 following cases and the other remaining affected persons were living in households located in the same community, so the investigation area has been widened.

[For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post: Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142.

The number of cases of Legionnaires' disease in Blanes, Spain, has increased from 8 in the prior ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - Spain (06): (CT) tourists 20120912.1292046) to now 14 cases. The 1st 3 cases detected were Dutch tourists who were on holiday at a campsite in Blanes, but the subsequent cases were apparently located in town at other locations. The source or sources have not been as yet identified. It is hoped that genotyping of clinical and environmental isolated is being done.

The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

Blanes is a town with a population of 40 010 (in 2010) northeast of Barcelona in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain, on the Costa Brava, which stretches from Blanes all the way to the French border (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanes). The Costa Brava is a holiday destination with large numbers of hotels and apartments in seaside resorts such as Blanes, mainly for package holiday tourists from Northern Europe and especially the United Kingdom and France (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Brava). For a map of the Costa Brava, see http://www.wordtravels.com/assets/map//Spain/Costa_Brava_map.jpg.
