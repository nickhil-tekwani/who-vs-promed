[1] Cholera - Congo DR-Uganda border: (Rukwanzi Island)

Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have ordered
the partial evacuation of a disputed island in Lake Albert, where
health workers are unable to tackle a cholera outbreak partly because
of security concerns linked to the discovery of oil.

"We have just ordered the section head and police on the ground to
evacuate children and the elderly" from Rukwanzi Island, which lies
on a poorly-defined border separating DRC and Uganda, said Dieudonne
Rwabona, acting district commissioner in DRC's northeastern region of
Ituri. Since 5 Oct 2007, police on the island have reported 57 cases
of cholera with 3 fatalities.

"Things are getting worse. Just in the last 2 days, we registered 6
cholera cases. Since there is no healthcare infrastructure, we treat
the sick ourselves with our own first aid medicines," a police
commander on the island said on 12 Nov 2007.

"They don't have access to [clean] water or healthcare where they
are. Those who develop diarrhea are told to take a boat to Tchomia, a
lakeside town where there is an isolation ward," said Eustace
Kyroussis from the WHO in Bunia, Ituri's main town.

Rukwanzi, with an area of 12 sq km (4.6 sq mi), is home to about 3000
people, mostly fishermen and their families. The recent discovery of
oil under Lake Albert has exacerbated the territorial dispute. Troops
from DRC and Uganda exchanged gunfire near the island in August 2007
and, despite a fence-mending meeting between their respective
presidents, again in September 2007.

"It's an island that shouldn't really be habitable," said Kyroussis.

[2] Cholera - Mozambique: (Cabo Delgado)

A total of 15 people have died and hundreds of others have been
admitted to hospital following an outbreak of cholera in the northern
Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, health authorities said on Tue
13 Nov 2007.

Quinhas Fernandes, the provincial chief doctor, said that at least
400 new cases have been reported in the past 2 weeks in Cabo Delgado.
"Cholera is always an emergency situation, it's still under control
but we are going to boost campaigns ... in order to avoid its rapid
spread," he told Reuters.

In 2006 over 44 000 cases of cholera were recorded in the province.
Over 39 000 cases have been recorded since January [2007], officials
said. [Despite these numbers, WHO had reports of only 6309 cholera
cases in Mozambique for 2006 with 29 deaths
<http://www.who.int/wer/2007/wer8231.pdf> - Mod. LL]

The new outbreak has been blamed on contaminated water and poor
sanitary conditions. Health authorities in Cabo Delgado have warned
that the outbreak could rise as the rainy season reaches its peak,
particularly in the Impirre district, where most of the 15 deaths
occurred.

Acute diarrhea has spread to 14 cities and provinces in Viet Nam,
affecting 1661 people since 23 Oct 2007, local newspaper Labor
reported Tue 13 Nov 2007.

Of the total infection cases, 204 people, including 3 foreigners from
the Philippines, Belgium, and Japan, contracted cholera, the paper
quoted a report of the Vietnamese Health Ministry as saying. Initial
tests showed that the 31-year-old Filipino woman, who is working for
a company in Hanoi capital, a Japanese man, and a Belgian female
tourist, have been infected with cholera. The Japanese man's health
has recovered, the paper said, noting that samples from his
Vietnamese interpreter were tested positive for cholera, although the
interpreter has shown no signs of having contracted acute diarrhea.

[5] Diarrhea, fatal - Philippines: (Benguet)

<http://www.gmanews.tv/story/68793/Diarrhea-kills-1-downs-45-in-Benguet>


At least one person died while 45 others were hospitalized after
cases of diarrhea rose significantly in Itogon town in Benguet
province, radio dzRH reported Thursday morning [15 Nov 2007].

Citing initial reports from the Cordillera regional health
department, the report said authorities suspect "half-cooked" pork
and carabao meat as well as contaminated water may have caused the
latest diarrhea cases. Health officials said that as of Thursday
morning [15 Nov 2007], 11 of the hospitalized remained confined at
the hospital while the other 34 were allowed to go home.

Authorities dispatched antibiotics and chlorine water treatment
packages to Itogon town in response to the health problem. It was not
immediately clear if health officials were inclined to declare an
outbreak.

[6] Cholera, orphanage - Iraq: (Baghdad)
Date: Thu 15 Nov 2007

<http://www.pr-inside.com/iraqi-health-official-says-2-boys-r303417.htm>


Iraq's Health Ministry said Thu 15 Nov 2007, 2 Iraqi boys have died
from cholera in the Baghdad al-Hanan orphanage. One boy died Thu 15
Nov 2007, and the other died a day earlier [14 Nov 2007], said Adel
Muhsin, the Health Ministry's inspector-general. He said 6 other
children at the orphanage have been diagnosed with cholera.

Muhsin blamed this week's cholera deaths on unclean water being
stored in a tank on the facility's roof. "The people in the orphanage
did not clean the water tank, and they kept filling it with water
while neglecting our health experts' recommendations," Muhsin told
The Associated Press. "The percentage of the chlorine in the tank was
zero when we inspected it."

The World Health Organization estimates that more than 30 000 people
in Iraq have come down with acute watery diarrhea, which may later be
confirmed as cholera. The hardest-hit provinces are Kirkuk and
Sulaimaniyah, both in northern Iraq.
