Sao Paulo closed its zoo and botanical gardens Tuesday [23 Jan 2018] as a yellow fever outbreak that has led to 70 deaths is picking up steam.

The big Inhotim art park, which attracts visitors from all over the world, also announced that all visitors would have to show proof of vaccination to be allowed in. The park said the measure was preventative, and no case of yellow fever had been found there.

Cases of yellow fever have been rising in Brazil during the Southern Hemisphere summer rainy season, and health officials are planning to vaccinate millions of people in the coming weeks in the hopes of containing the outbreak.

Authorities did not say when the Sao Paulo zoo or nearby botanical gardens would reopen. The zoo said in a statement that a wild monkey was found dead last week in the park that contains the zoo, and tests Monday [22 Jan 2018] confirmed it was positive for yellow fever.

According to figures put out by each state, 148 cases have been confirmed in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Of those, 69 people have died. A week ago, the Health Ministry had confirmed 34 cases and 19 deaths in those states; it also confirmed one case in the capital district that ended in death.

Sao Paulo has registered the most cases, with 81, and the World Health Organization recommended last week that foreigners planning to travel anywhere in the state be vaccinated for the mosquito-borne disease. Brazil's own recommendations include only parts of the state.

Much of Brazil is considered at risk for the yellow fever, but last year [2017], it saw its largest outbreak of the disease in decades, including in areas not previously thought to be at risk. More than 770 people were infected, and more than 250 died. Minas Gerais was at the epicenter of that outbreak, and it declared a state of [health] emergency last week.

Yellow fever typically causes fever, muscle pain and nausea; some patients also experience the jaundice from which the disease gets its name.

[In an effort to avoid additional human cases, Sao Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, has closed a score of public parks in the metropolitan region after several monkeys died of yellow fever. The above report indicates that additional areas are now closed or require proof of vaccination to access them. An active vaccination campaign will begin next week in the areas of risk within the state, including metropolitan Sao Paulo. So far, all human cases are the result of yellow fever virus spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle to humans. The strategy is to have a sufficient level of herd immunity via vaccination to prevent spill-over of the virus from the sylvan cycle into a person-person transmission via _Aedes aegypti_ urban cycle.
