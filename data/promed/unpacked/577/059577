[1] KPTD (Miran Ali): new case
Date: Wed 8 May 2019

[According to the End Polio Pakistan website, there has been a newly confirmed case of polio reported in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal District (KPTD) town Miran Ali.

The addition of this new case brings the total number of cases reported from Pakistan since 1 Jan 2019 to 13, in KPTD to 4 and globally to 20 (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019). I suspect that Miran Ali is the town mentioned in North Waziristan referred to as Mir Ali on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Ali,_Pakistan).

More information on the epidemiologic investigation (age, sex, vaccination history, virus isolated) of this newly confirmed case would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to a request for information sent to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members, we received several replies providing information on the epidemiologic picture surrounding this new case.

The patient is a 38-month-old female child from Taluka Dokri in Larkana district, Sindh province, with date of onset of paralysis on 17 Apr 2019. The child had a history of travel to Karachi in the week prior to onset of paralysis. WPV1 was isolated.

[We are very grateful to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members for their rapid and very helpful replies to the request for information sent yesterday [7 May 2019]. As there was a previous case reported from Karachi around the same time as this case, the history of travel to Karachi may be significant in terms of location of exposure to the WPV1 (see Poliomyelitis update (32): Pakistan (SD) RFI 20190507.6458248).

[3] Sindh: media report

While Larkana is already reeling from an HIV epidemic, a 3-year-old girl tested positive for polio in Taluka Dokri of Larkana, health officials confirmed on [Tue 7 May 2019], increasing the total polio case count in Sindh in 2019 to 2, with one case from Karachi and another from Larkana.

"It is highly unfortunate to announce that a polio case was reported from Larkana where a 38-month-old girl has tested positive for polio," said Umar Farooq Bullo, Coordinator for the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) for Polio Eradication in Sindh. "The child was vaccinated but was low on immunity and malnourished, [which makes] repeated vaccination of OPV [oral polio vaccine] mandatory. Further investigation into the case is underway," EOC Sindh Coordinator Umar Farooq Bullo said.

Larkana district of Sindh is already facing a health emergency, as dozens of children have tested positive for HIV during the past 12 days, and the recent emergence of a polio case would further aggravate the situation. Sindh health department officials said following emergence of scores of HIV-positive cases and the recent polio case, they have decided to screen the entire population for all the infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and several other infectious diseases. At the same time, an awareness campaign is also being launched to sensitize people about importance of vaccination, giving polio vaccine to children, and adopting preventive measures to ward off the dangers of contracting lethal viral diseases.

"Parents must understand that with the polio virus present in the environment, they must vaccinate every child under 5 years of age during every campaign to protect them against polio," Farooq Bullo said and pledged to implement an aggressive case response in Northern Sindh to further build the immunity of children. Refusal by the parents to give OPV drops to children is also on the rise in the province due to negative propaganda through social media, rumours, overemphasis by the polio eradication initiative and other cultural and religious reasons. It is worth mentioning here that Sindh had 30 cases of polio in 2014, one in 2018 and now the number is 2 in 2019.

[This media report also mentions the child had questionable immunity levels with a history of malnutrition.

It is disturbing to read that the antivaccination propaganda is now reaching Sindh province as well via social media. It was challenging enough for the polio eradication activities to work in the areas where there were political rumors about the vaccine, but now the formerly accepting populations are joining the global antivaccination movement and putting millions of children at risk from these pockets of susceptibles, blocking the communal protection of herd immunity (if there are high levels of immunity in a community -- the poliovirus does not have easy contact with individual susceptibles in this community having been protected against continued circulation in the community by this wall of immune individuals). - Mod.MPP]
