Native to East Asia, _Erysiphe corylacearum_ is a new powdery mildew of hazelnuts (_Corylus_ spp.) which has rapidly extended its distribution range in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Mediterranean as well as some countries in Eastern and Central Europe (EPPO RS 2021/042, RS 2021/049, RS 2021/249).

In Hungary, _E. corylacearum_ was observed in a hazelnut (_Corylus avellana_) plantation and in a university collection of different hazelnut varieties in 2021. White patches of mycelium and conidia were observed on both sides of the leaves. The disease incidence varied from 100% to 30%, depending on the variety. _E. corylacearum_ occurred together with _Phyllactinia guttata_.

In Germany, the presence of _E. corylacearum_ was recorded in Bavaria, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, and Nordrhein-Westfalen in gardens, parks, and forests. It was mainly found on _Corylus avellana_, but also a few times on other _Corylus_ species. The pattern and the speed of its spread may suggest that _E. corylacearum_ is spread both by wind-borne conidia and human activities.

In Switzerland, the pathogen was first reported in urban areas, but is now widespread, including in forests removed from settlements; in the alpine region, it occurs at altitudes up to 1450 m [4757 ft].

[_Erysiphe corylacearum_ is considered an emerging pathogen in Europe. Symptoms of _Phyllactinia guttata_ mentioned above, as well as some other _Erysiphe_ species on _Corylus_ are similar. Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildews have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and increased chance of winter injury to soft twigs and growth points. Spores are spread mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means (including insect, animal, or human activities). The fungi overwinter in infected leaves and plant debris on the ground.

Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of host species it affects. The pathogens cause serious losses in many important crops including cereals, hops, oilseed rape, sugar beet, grapevine, and a number of vegetable crops. The diseases are usually controlled with fungicides.
