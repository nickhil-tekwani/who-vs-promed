Biosecurity officers are assessing all animals on a southwest Queensland property after a horse contracted the deadly bat-borne lyssavirus.

Tests have confirmed the 1st case of the rare virus in a horse, which was put down at an equestrian centre last Saturday [11 May 2013].

Another horse with similar signs was euthanized on the same property a fortnight ago, however Biosecurity Queensland says the horse was disposed of before it could be tested.

The centre's owner, Cameron Osborne, says his property and the area are not home to bat colonies. "We are in an area that's believed to be free of bats," Dr Osborne told AAP. "We don't have many trees on the property and we've taken care not to plant fruit trees or anything that attracts bats. No one knows if bats fly through here overnight but we certainly haven't seen them and my neighbours are of the same opinion. It's very puzzling."

Dr Osborne could not recall obvious bites or scratches on the 2 dead horses.

Biosecurity officers have quarantined the property and the animals on it, including 20 horses.

Up until now, the lyssavirus has only been known to infect humans from a bite or scratch from a bat.

All 3 people to have contracted the virus in Australia, all in Queensland, have died; 2 were in the late 1990s and the other was in February this year (2013).

Queensland Health is tracing people who came into contact with either of the 2 horses. Dr Osborne, former doctor for the Wallabies and Queensland rugby teams, and 3 other workers are undergoing precautionary treatment. He said others don't work on his property but came into contact with the sick horses at Highborne Farm, north of Warwick. Queensland Health was unable to confirm media reports 6 people are being treated.

"Because of possible exposure to the lyssavirus we've been advised it's very wise to have a rabies vaccination," Dr Osborne said.

"Worldwide, anyone who has been exposed to [lyssaviruses], who has not [yet] had any signs of the illness, and has followed through [with]the vaccination [series] has not developed the condition."

He said vaccination began on Saturday and they will require 3 more injections over a fortnight. "It's not nerve-racking but it is concerning," Dr Osborne said. "We are just following prudent biosecurity measures as we did when the horses began showing signs of being unwell."

He said a 3rd horse kept in the same paddock as the 2 sick horses had
not contracted the virus.

[The virus is closely related to rabies virus, so it is sensible to be treated with a rabies vaccine. There have been some reports in diverse media of microbats being in the area, but they have not been verified.

Microbats does not necessarily mean small, as they often range in size from 4-16 cm (1.6-6.3 in) in length. They may be insect or fruit bats, and vampire bats are often in this category. Likely, the biosecurity folks have some sort of provision for observation of bats in the area.

[There are no blood-sucking bats in Australia -- their range is confined to Mexico & South America. The location of Highborne Farm is given as north of Warwick, which is
SW of Brisbane -- see map:
