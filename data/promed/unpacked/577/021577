BLUETONGUE IN BULGARIA: Follow-up report No. 2
See also: 5 Oct 2001, 28 Sep 2001
Information received on 1 Nov 2001 from Dr Nikola T. Belev, Delegate of
Bulgaria to the OIE:
End of previous report period: 1 Oct 2001 (see Disease Information, 14
[40, 230, dated 5 Oct 2001).
End of this report period: 28 Oct 2001.
- On 26 Oct 2001, all tests concerning sentinel animals along the borders
with Greece and Turkey were negative for the presence of antibodies (see
map [map is not reproduced here but well worth the visit; kudos to those
that produced them. - Mod.PC).
- Clinical signs were detected in 4 sheep in the villages of Bersin and
Eremia (Kyustendil region). The total number of settlements where clinical
cases of bluetongue have been detected is 12, all in Kyustendil region.
- Isolates of the virus were sent for serotyping to the OIE Reference
Laboratory for bluetongue in Pirbright, United Kingdom.
- All sentinel animals located in 20 settlements along the western borders
were tested for a second time and gave negative results, except for animals
reared in 3 villages in Sofia region and one village in Vratsa region.
Results of the laboratory tests, by village
Region / No. villages involved / Results of the laboratory tests
Vidin / 2 / negative
Montana / 2 / negative
Vratsa / 3 / 1 positive (Lyutadjik), 2 negative
Sofia / 4 / 3 positive (Tserovo, Tompson and Pozharevo), 1 negative
Pernik / 3 / negative
Kyustendil / 3 / negative
Blagoevrad / 3 / negative
- New settlements with sentinel animals were designated, located in Vratsa
and Sofia regions 30 km from the border. All tests gave negative results.
- Cold weather started on 25 Oct and no insects of the family _Culicoides_
have since been detected.
- In spite of the absence of the vector of the disease, sentinel animals
will be tested according to the surveillance programme every 15 days until
the end of Nov 2001.

BLUETONGUE IN GREECE: Follow-up report No. 2
See also: 12 Oct 2001, 21 Sep 2001
Information received on 6 Nov 2001 from Dr Vasilios Stylas, Head, Animal
Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
End of previous report period: 5 Oct 2001 (see Disease Information, 14
[41, 237, dated 12 Oct 2001).
End of this report period: 1 Nov 2001.
New outbreaks:
Location (prefecture) / No. of outbreaks
Aitoloakarnania / 3
Evritania / 1
Kastoria / 1
Larissa / 6
Lesvos / 19
Preveza / 1
Thesprotia / 1
Trikala/ 1
Total number of outbreaks reported to date: 52.
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
ovi & cap / 4750 / 330 / 80 / 158 / --
[Note that not all the cases appear to have been destroyed, although that
is the control measure presently in place. Tabular results of bluetongue
serological testing by prefecture are presented in the OIE report. I have
deleted them to conserve space, but they are obtainable via the URL above.
Surveillance was done both near bluetongue outbreaks and in the "affected"
prefectures, but outside the 20-km radius zones for cattle and
ovine/caprine species. - Mod.PC
Current control and safeguard measures applicable inside Greece:
In the light of the evolution of bluetongue and having regard to the need
of conducting domestic trade in live susceptible animals in a safe and
disciplined manner, the Greek Authorities, by Ministerial Decision No.
408773 of 29 Oct 2001, have updated the applicable control and safeguard
measures as follows:
a) Clinically affected animals are killed and destroyed.
b) 20-km-radius zones are established around all outbreaks, and inside
these zones a complete standstill on movements of live susceptible animals
is enforced.
c) Areas of "affected" prefectures, situated outside the 20-km-radius
zones, are subject to animal movement restrictions requiring sampling, with
negative results, of 100 percent of the animals within 10 days prior to
their movement out of the prefecture.
d) "Buffer" prefectures, surrounding "affected" ones, are subject to animal
movement restrictions requiring random sampling, with negative results, of
10 percent of animals in 100 percent of consignments within 10 days prior
to their movement out of the prefecture.
e) "Free" prefectures, far from outbreaks and with no evidence of
bluetongue virus circulation, are not subjected to any animal movement
restrictions.
f) In geographical areas under (b), (c) and (d) above, surveillance and
control apply, including:
- Clinical surveillance of sheep/goat flocks.
- Placement of sentinel bovines and regular sero-monitoring thereof.
- Placement of light traps and vector monitoring.
- Vector control campaigns in and around animal holdings and in breeding
sites.

BLUETONGUE IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Follow-up report No. 1
See also: 12 Oct 2001
Information received on 6 Nov 2001 from Dr Zoran Danevski, Director of
Veterinary Service, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy,
Skopje:
End of previous report period: 5 Oct 2001 (see Disease Information, 14
[41, 234, dated 12 Oct 2001).
End of this report period: 25 Oct 2001.
After laboratory confirmation of bluetongue virus in the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, a mass clinical investigation was implemented over
the whole territory of the country.
A serological investigation was implemented in regions where clinically
affected animals were reported, but also in regions where no clinical
disease was reported, with aim of detecting any presence of the disease. In
addition to sheep, the serological investigation included goats and cattle.
The clinical and serological investigations resulted in the detection of
new outbreaks. All of the clinically diagnosed cases were confirmed at the
laboratory.
New outbreaks:
Location (region) / No. of outbreaks
Berovo / 5
Gostivar / 3
Kriva Palanka / 8
Krusevo / 4
Makedonski Brod / 3
Skopje / 2
Struga / 3
Veles / 4
Total / 32
Note: communal grazing is practised in most of the regions; each villages
where positive animals were identified is therefore considered as one
outbreak.
[Excellent maps are posted on the OIE website show geographical
distribution of the affected villages. Kudos to those who prepared these
maps. - Mod.PC
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible* / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 5154 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
ovi / 22 880 / 158 / 16 / 142 / 0
cap / 1560 / 2** / 0 / 2 / 0
* Number of susceptible/at-risk animals is the total number of animals in
the affected villages or which are communally grazed.
** Serologically identified.
Epidemiology:
- On average, the number of affected sheep is low and clinical signs of the
disease are mild.
- Up to now, 8 regions have been affected by the disease, 3 of them (Kriva
Palanka, Berovo and Krusevo) being affected more heavily than the others.
- The last clinically affected animal was detected on 16 October. Since
then, no new cases have been reported.
- The average temperature decreased in the last 10 days of October, and new
cases of the disease are not therefore expected.
- Sheep on pastures in the affected regions (mainly Berovo, where there are
mountain pastures) are not expected to move to low lands before the end of
November or before the first snow is expected. These will be subjected to
serological investigation prior to movement.
Control measures during reporting period:
- A standstill on susceptible animals is in force in the villages where the
disease has been detected. Animals can be moved after the presence of the
disease has been ruled out on the basis of a clinical and serological
investigation.
- Movement of animals within the protection zone is allowed after the
presence of the disease has been ruled out on the basis of a questionnaire
and a clinical and serological investigation.
- All of the positive animals have been destroyed.
- Compulsory clinical investigation on the presence of the disease,
covering the whole of the territory of the country.
- Disinsectisation of the premises and surroundings where positive animals
have been found.
- Serological surveillance for the disease.
When the epizootic is considered to be at an end (winter, when no vectors
are present), a mass serological investigation will be implemented covering
the whole of the territory of the country. The aim will be to detect a
seroconversion incidence of 2 percent with 95 percent confidence.

[We should stop seeing new reports of infection as many areas will be cold
enough to kill the _Culicoides_ vector soon. Any insights into the
origin of this epidemic would be appreciated. - Mod.PC
