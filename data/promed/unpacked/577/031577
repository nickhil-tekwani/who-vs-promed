Comments from Prof. F. Blaine Hollinger
---------------------------------------
The Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is classified in the family _Hepevridae_,
genus _Hepevirus_ (see
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi>). There are
presumed to be 5 genotypes: 1 and 2 are from humans, 3 and 4 from
humans and swine, and a 5th genotype is an avian HEV found in
chickens that represents a branch distinct from human and swine HEVs.
Genotypes 1 and 2 occur in younger populations, whereas genotypes 3
and 4 occur in an older age group that may be immunocompromised
(e.g., infected with HIV) and may be acquired from an animal
reservoir. Human cases have been linked to transmission from uncooked
meat from wild boar and deer
According to Shrestha and Scott et al: [Safety and efficacy of a
Hepatitis E virus vaccine conducted in Nepal];
<http://www.asc2006.com/posters/KP-20.pdf> (personal communication,
2006), there have been continuing outbreaks of hepatitis in Nepal
resulting in increased admissions to Valley hospitals due to
jaundice, almost every year beginning in May and usually ending in
January, with lower levels of endemicity occurring throughout the
rest of the year. Most of these cases have been identified in Valley
hospitals around Kathmandu: Ayurvedic centers, Teku, the Tribhuvan
University Teaching Hospital, among the police and in the army.
Major recent outbreaks of jaundice occurred in 1996 and 1997 (170-190
cases of jaundice reported), but from 50-120 cases of jaundice have
been treated at these centers, each year, from at least 1994-2003.
Hepatitis E is assumed to be responsible for up to 75 percent of
these cases. A very safe and successful HEV vaccine trial was
concluded in 2004, in Kathmandu, by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, the
Army Institute of Research, the Nepalese Army, and the Military
Infectious Diseases Research Program (Fort Detrick, MD) that
demonstrated 96 percent vaccine efficacy against the acquisition of
HEV (95 percent CI [confidence interval] of 86-99 percent) among
approximately 900 vaccinated individuals, when compared to a similar
number of unvaccinated controls.
