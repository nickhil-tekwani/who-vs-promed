CHIPLEY, Florida -- More than 20 cases of a mosquito-borne disease killing
more than half the horses it infects has been reported in the panhandle of
Florida, leading officials to warn horse owners to take special precautions.
State Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson said more than 20 cases of
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) were reported in Holmes and Jackson
counties along the Georgia border west of Tallahassee. Another case was
reported in Santa Rosa County, and officials are investigating other
unconfirmed infections.
State officials had scheduled a special meeting for Monday night in Chipley
and urged horse owners to attend.
"While the recent rainy weather across the state has brought welcome relief
from the drought, it has also caused an increase in the mosquito
population," Bronson said in a statement released by his office.
Bronson said that [the rainy weather had increased the chance of horses
being infected and urged owners to have their animals vaccinated and watch
for signs of nervous system damage.
The disease is transmitted from infected birds to horses through
mosquitoes. No human cases have been reported in Florida this year.
The disease is deadly but rare in people, because it cannot be spread from
horses to humans or humans to humans, said the Association of State and
Territorial Directors of Health Promotion and Public Health.
People can be infected only if bitten by mosquitoes having fed on birds
infected with the disease [virus.

[Although rainy weather will bring out the mosquitoes, this article does
not give any indication of which laboratory or which tests were used to
confirm EEE. Likewise, it does not specify the clinical signs seen in
horses. The first of July is early for this disease to be appearing. - Mod.TG
