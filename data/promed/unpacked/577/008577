Lassa fever situation report -- epidemiological week 13 (23-29 Mar 2020)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Table 1: Summary of current week (13), cumulative from epiweeks 1-13, 2020, and comparison with previous year (2019)
Current week (13) [23-29 Mar 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-13 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-13
Suspected cases: 182 / 4194 / 2034
Confirmed cases: 19 / 951/ 526
Probable cases: 0 / 14 / 15
Deaths: 1 / 185 / 121
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 5.3 / 19.5 / 23.0
Number of states affected: 8 / 27 / 21
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 14 / 126 / 74

Highlights

- In week 13, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 28 cases in week 12, 2020, to 19 cases. These were reported from 8 states (Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Taraba, Plateau, Kogi, and Delta) (table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 13, 2020, 185 deaths have been reported, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.5%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (23.0%).
- In total for 2020, 27 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 126 local government areas [LGAs] (figures 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 72% are from Edo (32%), Ondo (32%), and Ebonyi (8%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 78 years; median age: 33 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.
- No new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 13.

Response activities

- The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities across states. Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state-level EOCs.
- National Rapid Response teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states.
- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians, and hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.
- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
-----------
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever EOC.

Case definitions
----------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and has either a) history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents, or b) history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, OR any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.
- Healthcare worker (HCW) infections may not necessarily be of nosocomial origin; proposed study to differentiate nosocomial healthcare worker infection from community infection.

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[The 19 new confirmed and 182 new suspected cases in week 13 (23-29 Mar 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The graph in figure 6 indicates a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. It will be interesting to see whether the decline in cases continues going forward. There are now 185 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 13).

The report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local governement areas increased to 126 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
