Missouri equine piroplasmosis outbreak 'resolved' in OIE report
----------------------------------------------------------------
A 15 Sep 2009 report on the cases of equine piroplasmosis earlier this
year in Missouri and Kansas declares the outbreak resolved.

A total of 3 positive horses that were removed from quarantine remain
missing. (See the OIE report at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8406>.)

In June [2009], animal health officials confirmed equine piroplasmosis
in Missouri after a horse formerly stabled at the Raytown Equestrian
Park was hospitalized and found to be positive for the disease,
setting off a foreign animal disease investigation. The stable, home
to 64 equids, was placed under quarantine on 6 Jun 2009. On 17 Jun
2009 someone removed 2 bay quarter horses that had been confirmed
positive for causative organism _Theileria equi_ from the Raytown
quarantine. As of 15 Sep 2009 these horses have not been located.

Another 5 positive horses there were euthanized 18 Jun 2009 with their
owners' consent.

A 26 Jun 2009, the World Organization for Animal Health (or OIE)
statement noted a 3rd positive horse was also illegally removed from
quarantine in Kansas. A spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service [APHIS] said the Kansas horse was a gray mare that
had originated from the Raytown premises.

Equine piroplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by either of 2
different protozoal parasites [_Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia
equi_) and _Babesia caballi_. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] that attack the red
blood cells. It is characterized by fever, anemia, weight loss,
jaundice, and, in some cases, death. The case fatality rate can be up
to 20 percent in naive horses (those which have never been exposed).
The only treatment is a potent type of chemotherapy that can have
serious side effects in some horses. United States officials have
screened all imported horses for piroplasmosis for nearly 30 years.

The new OIE report by John Clifford, DVM, deputy administrator of the
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, cited needle
sharing resulting in the transfer of whole blood between horses as the
route of transmission of the disease. Tick surveillance performed on
the index premises uncovered 4 ticks, which were submitted to the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The lab determined the ticks
found were not competent vectors for the causative organism.

All equids remaining at and traced to the index premises have tested
negative for _Theileria equi_.

"The investigation into the illegal removal of the horses from the
index premises continues to be conducted by law enforcement agencies.
Unsubstantiated accounts indicate that the illegally removed horses
have been illegally transported out of country," the report noted.
"All epidemiological investigations of this event have been concluded
and, unless new law enforcement information is uncovered, this equine
piroplasmosis event is considered closed."
