A fungus that can kill entire colonies of hibernating bats has been detected in the Wenatchee Valley for the 1st time. White-nose fungus has devastated bat populations in 35 states over the last decade. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife says it's now been found in samples taken from a nesting colony of little brown bats (_Myotis lucifugus_) in Chelan County. The precise location of the colony wasn't disclosed.

Wildlife officials say the discovery is concerning, since it indicates further spread of the disease. White-nose fungus doesn't pose any threat to people, but it's often carried from one environment to another by human beings. It attacks bats' skin, damages their wings, and forces them to emerge too early from winter hibernation.

The fungus has previously been detected in King, Snohomish, Pierce and other western Washington counties, but last year [2019] was discovered east of the Cascades for the 1st time, in a Cle Elum bat population.

[The updated geographical spread of white nose syndrome (WNS) as well as detailed information about the disease can be accessed at https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/.

The causal agent of WNS is established in the continent and it is impossible to eradicate, as treatment of wild bats is extremely challenging. Bats need to evolve resistance and/or tolerance for their populations to endure. The good news is that resistance in persisting bat populations have been documented (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0044). - Mod.PMB
