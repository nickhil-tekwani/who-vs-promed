The continuous rain has posed a threat to the standing paddy crop in [Tiruchi] district. Paddy raised on several hectares has been affected by bacterial leaf blight disease. The leaves appear to have changed into yellow and white.

R. Chandrasekeran, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that field officials had been asked to create awareness of the disease among farmers. The prevailing climate conditions were favourable to bacterial leaf blight. Change of colour was a symptom of the disease. It would affect the yield.

Further, the bacterial infestation would lead to secondary infestation with fungal pathogens in the later stage of the crop. There was a need to save the crop from the disease. The farmers should create adequate drainage facilities and spray [antibacterial mixtures containing tetracycline and copper].

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern Australia, Africa and the USA. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60 per cent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage (as mentioned above). Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management usually includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers) and use of resistant crop varieties. Control of insect populations by insecticides may help reduce the unspecific spread of bacteria via their scratching and sucking wounds. Antibacterial sprays containing antibiotics, as suggested above, are rarely used because they often provide little benefit, and agricultural application of antibiotics is strictly regulated in most countries.

An outbreak of BLB has also been reported recently from neighbouring Bangladesh (ProMED-mail post 20151009.3702001).

The related _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.
