Kansas: Fatal and Non-fatal Hantavirus Infection in Same Family
---------------------------------------------------
A man formerly of Liberal, Kansas has died and his wife is
recovering from a bout with a deadly disease, which medical officials
say is contracted through exposure to [hantavirus-infected] rodents.
The 39-year old man died on Thu 29 May 2003 at Morton County Hospital
in Elkhart. His wife also had the virus infection; however, she has
since recovered.
This death is the first hantavirus infection death since 2000,
according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE),
and it may very well be the first hantivirus diagnosis of 2 people in
one family; however, health officials say there is no reason to worry
about the disease being passed from one person to another.
"Hantaviruses are contracted through exposure to rodent [vectors],"
Sharon Watson of the KDHE said. "The situation here involves a couple
who had been working in an area where there was a lot of dust and a
rodent infestation -- both outside and indoors. They had been in some
areas where they were inhaling a lot of dust that had particles from
the rodent droppings. That is why both people in the same family
contracted the illness. It didn't have anything to do with them
passing it from one person to another."
There have been 18 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infection] reported
in Kansas since the virus was first discovered in the U.S. in 1993,
according to the KDHE. 6 of the Kansas cases have resulted in death.
"Hantavirus is a reportable disease, so we would have to be
(notified) once it is diagnosed and confirmed," Watson said.
Symptoms of Hantavirus [Pulmonary Syndrome, HPS], a serious
respiratory illness, may be similar to the flu, including: fever,
body aches, chills, and trouble breathing. Symptoms may be mild at
first, but can progress very rapidly and may last a few hours to
several days, according to the KDHE. The first symptoms of HPS may
appear from one to 4 weeks after contact with the virus, Watson said,
and most people with hantavirus infection need hospitalization and
may need intensive care. "Risks of contracting a Hantavirus
infection increases with one's exposure to rodents, rodent droppings,
and dusty areas where rodents have been," Dr. Gail Hansen, state
public health veterinarian with the KDHE said. "Rodent control in and
around the home is the best way to prevent hantavirus infection."
Hantavirus is spread by specific rodents, most often deer mice, found
predominantly in rural areas of Kansas. The virus is contracted by
inhaling airborne particles of urine, droppings, or saliva of
infected mice, commonly found in abandoned outbuildings and sometimes
in homes during severe weather. Mice do not get visibly sick when
they are infected with the virus. [The hantavirus carried by deer
mice is the species of hantavirus designated _Sin Nombre virus_. -
