Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Uganda 3 August 2007
Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) has been confirmed in a 29-year-old
man in Uganda. The man became symptomatic on [4 Jul 2007], was
admitted to hospital on [7 Jul 2007] and died on [14 Jul 2007]. The
disease was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis on [30 Jul 2007].
The man had had prolonged close contact with a 21-year-old co-worker
with a similar illness to whom he had been providing care. The
21-year-old had developed symptoms on [27 Jun 2007] and was
hospitalized with a haemorrhagic illness. He then recovered and was
discharged on [9 Jul 2007]. Both men were working in a mine in western Uganda.
The Ministry of Health (MoH), Uganda, has mobilized national rapid
response teams to the area, supported by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and other partners in the field, to investigate
the outbreak. Laboratory investigations are being supported by the
Uganda Virology Research Institute (UVRI), the Kenya Medical Research
Institute (KEMRI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Atlanta at which the definitive laboratory diagnosis of MHF was made.
Case investigations, including extensive contact tracing and contact
monitoring are under-way at the mine, at the health care facilities
that cared for the men during their illness, and within the
community. Appropriate isolation facilities, active case finding,
enhanced surveillance, infection control, safe burial practices and
social mobilization activities have been put in place under the
oversight of a national Task Force with high level political representation.
Interviews conducted with the mine authorities have identified one
additional suspected case and 2 individuals who were taken ill in
mid-June [2007] and have since recovered. These individuals are being
investigated as a matter of priority. All the miners under
investigation for MHF had been at the mine for approximately 8 months
with no movements outside the mining area during that time. To date,
there have been no reported cases among health care workers.
The MoH has requested WHO to coordinate international assistance to
support the MoH in its outbreak response and containment activities.
WHO, along with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network (GOARN), will also be providing ongoing support in
epidemiology, ecological studies, field communications, supplies and
logistics. The containment and control measures that have been
implemented by the MoH to date are in accordance with international
best practice. WHO advises that there is no indication of the need
for any restrictions on travel or trade with Uganda.

Marburg fever kills miner in Uganda
------------------------------------------------
The deadly Marburg haemorrhagic fever has broken out in a mining
community in western Uganda, killing one person and possibly
infecting 4 others, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Thursday [2 Aug 2007]. The Kitaka mine, located in Kamwenge district
some 250 km (155 miles) west of the capital Kampala, has been shut
down temporarily, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said.
The rare but highly fatal disease, caused by a virus from the same
family as the one that causes Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is
transmitted by close contact with blood or other body fluids and can
cause bleeding from multiple orifices.
"We have one confirmed case of death from Marburg haemorrhagic fever
plus up to 4 rumoured or suspected cases," Hartl said.
The confirmed case was a 29-year-old miner who died on [14 Jul 2007]
after accompanying a sick miner in an ambulance to hospital from a
local clinic, he said. His laboratory results were only received this week.
The sick miner, 21, was discharged from hospital after recovering.
Tests have not yet confirmed if he had been infected with Marburg
fever, but it was strongly suspected, Hartl said.
Dr Sam Okware, head of Uganda's national task force for haemorrhagic
viruses, played down the risk. "There was just one confirmed case of
Marburg, the one who died, and one suspected case -- he recovered
from a fever, but we have no confirmation it was the virus," Okware
told Reuters.
Local residents would be told to stay where they were for 21 days, he
said, which was enough time to complete 2 cycles of the virus, which
takes up to 10 days to kill.
"No one in the area is supposed to leave their villages," he said.
"By the end of next week, if there are no further cases, I would be
quite comfortable that the virus has been contained."
A WHO official in Uganda was helping the health ministry, which has
deployed a rapid response team. Officials have been tracing contacts
of the sick men and carrying out public awareness campaigns in the area.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Marburg disease, which
begins abruptly with severe headache and fever followed by rapid
debilitation. Severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting begin
about the 3rd day, and in fatal cases, death occurs 8 to 9 days after
the onset of symptoms.

Kamwenge area residents' movement restricted over virus
------------------------------------------------------
Residents neighbouring Kitaka mine in Kamwenge district where the
deadly Marburg haemorrhagic fever was confirmed, should restrict
their movements, the Ministry of Health has advised. The police have
been deployed in the area to block outsiders from accessing the mine
where 2 cases were recorded, of whom one died.
The Galena ore mine, located some 420 km [261 miles] from Kampala and
47 km [29.2 miles] from Kamwenge town, has been closed temporarily.
Dr. Sam Okware, the head of national task force for haemorrhagic
viruses, said sealing off the mine would allow the virus to complete
its cycle and the epidemic to be declared over. "No new cases have
been reported. We, however, advise residents of the communities
surrounding the mine to stay where they are for at least 21 days,"
Okware told The New Vision yesterday.
The rare but highly fatal disease, caused by a virus related to the
one that causes Ebola, is transmitted through contact with blood or
other body fluids of infected people and can cause bleeding from
multiple orifices. The disease is also said to be spread by bats and
rats. Charles Mkundane, the mine manager, said there were over 10
million bats in clusters found in the tunnels. He asked the
government to exterminate them.
"These bats have got ticks that could have bitten the workers," said Mkundane.
The confirmed case was a 29-year-old Ugandan miner who died on 13 Jul
2007 after accompanying another sick miner in an ambulance from Ntara
health centre to the hospital. He was reportedly bitten by a tick.
His laboratory results were only received this week [2 Aug 2007]
because the sample was tested in the US.
The sick miner, 21, was discharged from hospital after recovering.
Tests have not yet confirmed if he had been infected with Marburg
fever but it was strongly suspected, said Dr. Okware.
The Ministry of Health has set up a national emergency plan to halt
the spread of the deadly virus and to deal with any suspected cases.
The plan involves strengthening the laboratory at the Uganda Virus
Institute, increasing surveillance on contact cases, case management
and sensitising the general public about the disease.
"We're looking at all options. Already there is a mobile van in
Kamwenge telling the residents to be alert and report any suspicious
cases of severe fever and unexplained bleeding," Okware said.
By yesterday evening [1 Aug 2007], the health ministry was still
tracing contacts of sick people for possible isolation and close monitoring.

[The viruses belonging to the genera _Ebolavirus_ and _Marburgvirus_
family _Filoviridae_) cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and
nonhuman primates. Confirmed cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have
been reported in the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Gabon, Sudan, and Uganda. Occupational infection of laboratory
workers resulting from needle-stick injury has been documented in
England and Russia. Marburgvirus has been less frequently encountered
and its geographic range in Africa has been more restricted, so far
being limited to Uganda, western Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Angola, and possibly Zimbabwe. The reservoir host(s) for these
filoviruses have not yet been identified unequivocally.
Although the current outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Uganda
so far amounts to a single fatality and 4/5 suspected cases it has
features in common with earlier outbreaks, one being the association
with gold or galena mining. Bausch et al. (N Engl J Med. 2006 Aug
31;355(9):866-9) have describe the outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic
fever which was observed in a gold-mining village in north-eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo in October 1998. Sporadic cases and
short chains of human-to-human transmission continued to occur until
September 2000. A total of 154 cases (48 laboratory-confirmed and 106
suspected) were identified (case fatality rate, 83 percent); 52
percent of cases were in young male miners. Only 27 percent of these
men reported having had contact with other affected persons, whereas
67 percent of patients who were not miners reported such contact (p
less than 0.001). Most of the affected miners (94 percent) worked in
an underground mine. Cessation of the outbreak coincided with
flooding of the mine. Epidemiologic evidence of multiple
introductions of infection into the population was substantiated by
the detection of at least nine genetically distinct lineages of virus
in circulation during the outbreak. It was concluded that Marburg
hemorrhagic fever can have a very high case fatality rate. Since
multiple genetic variants of virus were identified, ongoing
introduction of virus into the population helped perpetuate this
outbreak. The findings imply that reservoir hosts of Marburgvirus
inhabit caves, mines, or similar habitats. However, the inference in
the current reports from Uganda that the virus may be transmitted by
ticks from infected bats has yet to be substantiated.
More recently Tower et al. (J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(13):6497-516) have
reported their analysis of the very large outbreak that occurred in
Uige Province in northern Angola, West Africa. The outbreak began in
October 2004 and ended in July 2005, and it included 252 cases and
227 (90 percent) fatalities making it the largest Marburg outbreak
on record. Partial Marburgvirus RNA sequence analysis revealed up to
21 percent nucleotide divergence among the previously characterized
East African strains, with the most distinct being a strain from
Kenya. The Angolan strain was less different (approximately 7
percent) from the main group of East African Marburgviruses than
might have been expected given the large geographic separation. To
analyze the virus genetic differences between outbreaks and among
viruses within the Angola outbreak itself, a total of 16 complete
virus genomes were determined. While the Marburgviruses exhibited
high overall genetic diversity (up to 22 percent), only 6.8 percent
nucleotide difference was found between the West African Angolan
viruses and the majority of East African viruses, suggesting that the
virus reservoir species in these regions are not substantially
distinct. Few nucleotide differences were found among the Angolan
clinical specimens (0 to 0.07 percent), consistent with an outbreak
scenario in which a single (or rare) introduction of virus from the
reservoir species into the human population was followed by
person-to-person transmission with little accumulation of mutations.
This was in contrast to the 1998 to 2000 Marburgvirus outbreak, where
evidence of several virus genetic lineages (with up to 21 percent
divergence) and multiple virus introductions into the human
population was found.
It remains to be seen whether the current outbreak in Uganda will
conform to the pattern of introduction from a single source,
connected with the mining industry, followed by subsequent
person-to-person spread in a health-care setting, or by repeated
introduction from unknown reservoir. - Mod.CP]
