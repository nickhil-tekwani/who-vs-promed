Fatal malaria contracted in Mumbai by a Danish sailor
-----------------------------------------------------
A 32-year-old previously healthy sailor boarded a ship in Sweden on 3
Jun 2010. [His] last medical examination was in May 2010. The ship
passed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal on 11 Jul 2010
and docked in Mumbai 26-28 Jul 2010.

From Mumbai the ship sailed to Oman and docked at Khor Fakkan, 2 and
3 Aug 2010, and returned to Mumbai, where it docked from 7-14 Aug
2010. The sailor did not leave the ship during the 2 periods in
Mumbai, and did not take any malaria chemoprophylaxis in these
destinations in accordance with the national guidelines for malaria
prophylaxis for Danish merchant ships.

The symptoms started on 12 Aug 2010 with headache and muscle pains.
He continued working until 16 Aug 2010 where he experienced fever and
chills. The temperature was found to be 42 deg C [107.6 deg F] and a
malaria quick-test was strongly positive for _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Despite treatment he died the same evening of 16 Aug 2010.

[ProMED-mail has posted several reports (see below) over the past
year about malaria in Mumbai. Poorly managed construction sites have
been blamed by the BMC (Bombay -- now Mumbai -- Municipal
Corporation) and even an outbreak at a hospital (ProMED-mail 21 Dec
2010: Malaria - India (12): (Mumbai) 20101221.4496) explained the
malaria in hospital residents as transmission from nearby construction sites.

The ship docked in Mumbai 26-28 Jul 2010 and the symptoms started on
12 Aug 2010, which fits perfectly with the incubation time for
falciparum malaria.

There is no local malaria transmission in Oman (World Malaria Report
2010
<http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html>)
and the infection can therefore only have been acquired in Mumbai.
This report indicates a risk of malaria in the port areas of Mumbai.

Is Mumbai becoming a high risk area for falciparum malaria and should
we consider recommending visitors to take malaria prophylaxis? - Mod. EP]
