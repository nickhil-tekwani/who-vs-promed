Anthrax Causes 6 Deaths in Togo
----------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries announced
recently that anthrax has occurred in the country's north, and 6
people have already died. The announcement said that anthrax appeared
in cows and other livestock in early December [2007] in the country's
northern plains region, and that 6 people had died from eating
diseased beef. Others have also been infected and are undergoing
treatment in hospital.
Togo's government has sent medical teams to the affected area[s] and
announced the preventive vaccination of cows and other measures.
Agencies in Togo have warned residents to maintain alert and avoid
eating beef from dead or diseased livestock.

[We greatly appreciate Dan translating this report and submitting it to us.
Anthrax is regularly seen in cattle and sometimes reported in sheep
and goats in Togo, along with human cases. This is because there are
'champs maudit' in the regions of Savanes and Kara, and control is
inconstant. In spite of the high risk of this disease in Togo, this
is our 1st report. - Mod.MHJ]
