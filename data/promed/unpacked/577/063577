Fruiti Pops, Inc. of Santa Fe Springs, New Mexico, has recalled its
mamey frozen fruit bars because of a possible link to a rare USA
outbreak of typhoid fever.

The company said Thursday [26 Aug 2010] that the fruit bars were
distributed in California, Arizona, and Texas since May 2009.

Fruiti Pops says retail stores, ice cream trucks and vending machines
sold the frozen fruit bars, which have the UPC number 763734000097.
The company says the frozen fruit bars were made from contaminated
mamey pulp that Goya Foods, Inc. voluntarily recalled on 12 Aug 2010,
after it was linked to a typhoid fever outbreak in California and
Nevada. So far no illnesses have been reported from the mamey fruit bars.

Mamey or zapote, is a fruit popular in Latin America and the Caribbean.
