[2] China's Ministry of Agriculture PPR control policy

Vice Minister Yu Kangzhen: Major animal diseases in the country - prevention and control (spring video conference)
--------------------------------------------
2. Peste des petits ruminants - prevention and control work

The initial introduction of PPR to China took place in 2007 in Tibet. In December 2013, the epidemic crossed the border of Xinjiang, leading to outbreaks in the 4 provinces Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia, in which 8 outbreaks were recorded. Following the extinction of the previous outbreak (Tibet, 2010), no outbreaks were recorded until the current epizootic, after a lapse of 3 years. Following the new outbreaks, the Ministry of Agriculture and the agricultural sector in the provinces have actively responded and achieved initial success.

Recently, the ministry has formulated and issued the guide for the "peste des petits ruminants prevention and control program," especially around several key provinces. The program should be accomplished at the earliest, before the commencement of the spring grazing season, and be included the implementation of animal movements restrictions.

Several steps were prescribed:
1st, culling of infected flocks in order to eradicate the epizootic;
2nd, emergency vaccination, covering the susceptible animals in threatened areas;
3rd, strict animal movement control (the relevant provinces are required to implement a policy of discontinued transportation of live sheep and carry out the quarantine regulations);
4th, improvement of animal monitoring and epidemiological investigations, allowing improved, early diagnosis and tracing back of infections;
5th, enhanced training for better diagnosis and monitoring techniques and strengthening advocacy training.

The agricultural sector at all levels must invest effort to fully achieve the national goals of PPR prevention and control in the current "chess game." We must win this battle.

[The above speech of the deputy minister reflects the severity of the PPR situation and is instrumental in deciphering the striking change in China's PPR control policy as expressed in the numerous new detections of disease foci in flocks which have introduced infected animals throughout vast parts of the country, leading to the total culling of these flocks (see updated map at http://tinyurl.com/oqx8okm).

Since 22 Mar 2014, 7 follow-up reports on PPR in China have been submitted to the OIE, an unprecedented reporting intensity. In all of them, the respective affected populations are described as "animals purchased from another place." The updated number of PPR outbreaks in China since the start of the current epizootic on 5 Dec 2013 is 56. According to OIE's summary, the following updated total figures relate to the 56 outbreaks:

Species / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed
Goats / 1236 / 203 / 6671
Sheep & goats / 6213 / 2695 / 8761
Sheep / 176 / 34 / 271

In relation to PPR vaccination in China, the following information has been collected:

1. Following the PPR outbreaks in Tibet in 2007 and 2008, China reported "Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)" as a measure to be applied (http://tinyurl.com/pdoau9d, http://tinyurl.com/psfdkda).

2. Following the PPR outbreaks in Tibet in 2010, China reported to the OIE "no vaccination" (see http://tinyurl.com/q3qfp8l). However, according to China's national animal diseases compulsory immunization plan (2010), border areas in Tibet were vaccinated (see the Chinese web-site at http://www.gov.cn/gzdt/2010-02/05/content_1529163.htm). In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the vaccination was continued there. Could this explain the absence of PPR outbreaks in southwest China during the current epizootic? (We are grateful to the subscriber who has assisted in obtaining this source).

According to China's report to the OIE on animal vaccines production, PPR vaccine (live attenuated) was produced during the years 2011 (18 241 500 doses) and 2012 (23 109 000 doses); no report is yet available for 2013.

Interestingly, research addressing PPR vaccination has been undertaken in China, e.g. Qin J, Huang H, Ruan Y, Hou X, Yang S, et al. (2012) A Novel Recombinant Peste des Petits Ruminants-Canine Adenovirus Vaccine Elicits Long-Lasting Neutralizing Antibody Response against PPR in Goats. PLoS ONE 7(5): e37170. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037170. - Mods.AS/CRD
