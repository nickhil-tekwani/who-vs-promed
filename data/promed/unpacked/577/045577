The incidence of the potentially deadly canine parvovirus has
increased dramatically in the Peel region [Western Australia/WA], with
one veterinary practice reporting about 10 cases per week.

Pinjarra Veterinary Hospital head nurse Lauren Renwick said there had
been a huge increase in parvo [virus infection] cases, when last year
[2009] there were only 10 cases. "It usually comes in bouts, but the
other week we were bombarded," she said. "We are very concerned
because of the severity and we put up flyers at the service station
and shops around town."

Ms Renwick said the cost to treat dogs suffering from parvo could
reach thousands of dollars. Some people opt to have their dog
euthanised because of the high cost of treatment.

Halls Head Small Animal Clinic veterinarian Julie Willmore said the
number of dogs and puppies with parvo had doubled in the past year.

Coastal Veterinary Hospital vet Rebecca Taylor said parvo was endemic
in Mandurah because of lower vaccination rates. "There used to be
pockets in Mandurah and Coodanup that were contaminated -- the virus
can remain resistant in the soil where an infected dog has been for 3
years," she said. "But the virus has spread all over now to suburbs
such as Halls Head and Dawesville."

While there has been an increase in parvo cases in WA, Dr Taylor said
the high incidence in Peel could be explained by the high rate of dog
ownership in the region.

Veterinarians across WA have been treating up to 5 times the normal
number cases of parvo. Australian Veterinary Association spokesman
Garry Edgar said there had been hundreds of reported cases in the past
few months.

"This is particularly worrying for new dog owners as parvovirus is
most severe in puppies, with death in around 80 per cent of untreated
cases," he said.

"Common signs of the disease are severe vomiting and bloody diarrhoea.
The frustrating thing for vets is that this virus is highly
preventable."

[Raising community awareness of this disease is one issue. Learning
biosecurity issues in clinics and shelters is another method of
control. But why did the veterinarians not recommend vaccination?
There are effective vaccinations against this disease. Why are the
community and area not being encouraged to vaccinate their animals? -
