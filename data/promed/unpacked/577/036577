Pennsylvania officials have announced what they say is the state's 1st confirmed case of a deer found to be suffering from a disorder similar to "mad cow" disease.

Pennsylvania agriculture secretary George Greig says chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disorder affecting deer and other animals in the cervid family, including moose and elk. "There's no scientific evidence that CWD can affect humans," he said. "But the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people or other animals do not eat any part of cervids diagnosed with or showing signs of CWD."

The animal in question was found through random testing on a deer farm in Adams County, and the disease has not yet been confirmed in Pennsylvania's wild deer population.

Hunters are advised to take precautions such as wearing gloves while field-dressing deer and washing thoroughly when they are finished. Otherwise, they are free to enjoy hunting season.

[This represents an expansion of the disease. The disease has lurked on the borders of Pennsylvania for years, but this disease or any other disease is no respecter of borders.

Deer and elk affected by chronic wasting disease show loss of body condition and changes in behavior. The clinical disease is often more subtle and prolonged in elk than in deer. Affected animals may walk repetitive courses; they may show subtle ataxia and wide based stance; subtle head tremors occur in some animals; they may be found near water sources or in riparian areas [river banks. - Mod.SH]; they may have periods of somnolence; and they may carry their head and ears lowered. Chronic wasting disease affected animals continue to eat, but amounts of feed consumed are reduced, leading to gradual loss of body condition. Excessive drinking and urination are common in the terminal stages because of specific lesions in the brain. Many animals in terminal stages of CWD have excessive salivation and drooling; this may result in wetting of the hairs of the chin and neck. Death is inevitable once clinical disease occurs. The clinical course of CWD varies from a few days to about a year, with most animals surviving from a few weeks to several months.

Clinical signs of CWD alone are not diagnostic, and definitive diagnosis is based on examination of the brain for spongiform lesions and/or accumulation of the CWD associated protease resistant protein (PrPCWD) in brain and lymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry. This test is based on use of monoclonal antibodies and chromogens to detect accumulation of PrPCWD in various tissues.
