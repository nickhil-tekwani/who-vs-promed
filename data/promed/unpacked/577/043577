Salmonella link to Southeast confirmed
---------------------------------------
The Roma tomatoes linked to the still-growing salmonellosis outbreak
that has sickened 365 people in 5 states were grown in the Southeast
USA, and federal investigators are visiting suspected farms, a Food
and Drug Administration official said Thu, 29 Jul 2004. The FDA
would not identify the states or farms.
State health investigators discovered this week that 2 strains of the
salmonella bacteria have sickened people in the outbreak linked to
Sheetz convenience stores, Pennsylvania Department of Health
spokesman Richard McGarvey said.
The Javiana strain [_S. enteritidis_ serotype Javiana - Mod.LL] has
infected 362 confirmed cases in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio,
Maryland and Virginia -- which for the 1st time linked 5 cases to the
outbreak yesterday, 29 Jul 2004. All ate at a Sheetz convenience
store, officials said.
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture officials found another
salmonella strain, Anatum [_S. enteritidis_ serotype Anatum -
Mod.LL], 19 Jul 2004, in an unopened bag of Roma tomatoes taken from
a Sheetz in Greencastle, Franklin County.
State officials learned earlier this week that 3 more people,
including one who ate at the Greencastle Sheetz, developed
salmonellosis caused by the Anatum strain that is a genetic match to
that found on the tomatoes, McGarvey said.
All 365 people were infected in early Jul 2004, meaning that the
contaminated food appears to be gone from the market, McGarvey said.
He and Jennifer Morcone, a spokeswoman for CDC, said it is not
possible to know at this point whether the tomatoes were contaminated
at different times in the food chain or whether one animal carried 2
strains of salmonella that tainted the food.
The state health department issued a statewide health alert to
doctors and hospitals yesterday evening about the 2nd strain, but it
does not change the investigation. All strains of salmonellosis cause
diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, generally within 12 to 72 hours
of infection. Symptoms last up to 10 days.
Officials in Florida, South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina said
the FDA has not notified them that Roma tomatoes growers in those
states are being investigated as would be required.
An official with Coronet Foods Inc., the Wheeling, WV-based produce
supplier to Sheetz at the time of the outbreak, initially said the
tainted tomatoes were grown in Central Florida. It later said they
had come from other parts in the Southeast as well. She declined to
name the growers, but the company has provided that information to
the FDA.

[More cases related to this outbreak are being recognized in an
increasing number of states. It is noteworthy that a 2nd serotype of
_S. enteritidis_ has been identified that has been isolated in both
human cases and tomatoes. It is also noteworthy that the tomatoes
appear to have been grown in the USA, whereas many of the previous
produce-associated outbreaks have been related to food produced
outside of the USA. - Mod.LL]
