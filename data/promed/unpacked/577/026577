The State Secretariat of Health (SESA) confirmed this Wednesday [22
Jul 2009] the death of a 13-year-old boy who was infected by a
hantavirus. This is 1st occurrence of the year [2009] in Parana. The
Head of Division of Zoonoses of SESA, Giselia Rubio, said that the
agency does not know whether the transmission occurred in Curitiba
--where the boy lived -- or Araucaria -- where he was visiting
relatives. Hantavirus disease is caused by the infection with a
hantavirus, which has a host in wild rats. Usually the animals are
found in rural areas, so transmission in large cities is not common.
[This statement is not correct. The hosts of Seoul hantavirus are
rats (_Rattus_), and are found in many large cities, especially ports
with active maritime shipping, around the world. However, Seoul virus
causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, rather than the
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) seen in this case and other HPS
cases in the Americas. - Mod.TY]

The family of the boy said the health status of the boy became
suddenly worse. They believe the boy's contact with rats occurred
near the residence of the grandmother in Rio Bonito, in the Tatuquara
neighborhood in Curitiba. On 20 Jun [2009] he played football in a
field the area, where he could have been bitten by an animal in a
location with high weeds. The victim's aunt said that approximately 7
days later he had symptoms of a cold and was taken to hospital with
fever, headache, and vomiting. The family returned to the hospital 2
more times until, on Tuesday, 30 Mar [2009], he was transferred to
the intensive care unit (ICU). He felt shortness of breath, had
vomiting, cough, and pain in his body.

However, Giselia Rubio explained that the boy had not acquired the
infection as the family thought, because transmission needs
aspiration of dust contaminated with saliva, feces, or urine from
[virus infected] wild rats. It is unlikely that the boy had trampled
on a wild rodent, or been bitten by the animal, which caused the
[virus] transmission, even if he had a wound on the foot, she said.

According to the biologists, the wild rats would hardly be in a
football field, because they tend to hide in closed places. Other
ways of contracting the virus is by ingestion of food contaminated by
feces or urine of [virus infected] wild rodents, and also by the bite
of an animal. [Although transmission of hantaviruses between rodents
is associated with fighting, transmission to humans by bite, although
biologically possible, is unlikely to occur. - Mod.TY]

According to the head of the Division of Zoonoses of SESA, there is
no specific treatment, drug, or vaccine for hantavirus [infections].
And the symptoms of the disease are similar to those of a common flu.
The difference is the great difficulty that the patient has to
breathe, because the virus attacks the lungs. If is determined that
the person has the disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome], the
patient should be placed in an intensive care unit, provided the help
of a respirator, and with monitoring of vital signs -- temperature
and blood pressure, among others. It is very important to see a
doctor at the beginning of the onset of symptoms and have an X-ray
done because we can see if there has been infiltration in the lungs,
Giselia explained.

An infectious disease physician of the Vita Hospitals and Clinics,
Marta Fragoso, said that the majority of victims [of hantavirus
infections] are farmers and forest tree cutters. "Now Health
Surveillance should investigate how the infection occurred and see if
it is possible that the rats in cities are infected [with
hantaviruses]," said the doctor.

The infectious disease physician of the Sergio Penteado Evangelical
Hospital had already noted that families should avoid accumulating
garbage near their houses and maintain cleanliness. "We need to study
the cause of this infection and if the rats are coming to the city
seeking food, for example," he said.

According to the SESA, 187 people had the disease in Parana from
1992-2009, of which 67 died -- a case fatality rate of 35 percent.
Last year [2008] there were 10 cases and 3 deaths in the state. In
2009, there have been 2 cases and this one was the 1st death
recorded. Since 1992, 11 cases of the disease have been registered in
the 2nd Regional Health district, which includes Curitiba and
metropolitan region, and 6 people died.

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus was responsible for
this fatality, or for the previous cases in Parana. ProMED-mail would
appreciate receiving further information about the confirmation of
the specific hantavirus involved in this case.

The ProMED-mail report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008
(ProMED-mail archive no. 20080223.07412) indicated that hantaviruses
circulating in other areas of Brazil (Mato Grosso) included: Laguna
Negra, which has the _Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos
Sonhos which had previously been found in Para state, but without a
known host there. Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the
rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus.

A brief description of other hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and
their rodent hosts is given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080702.2020,
which comments that Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent
of HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Oligoryzomys fornesi_ in Brazil
and is cited in: Rosa ES, Mills JN, Padula PJ, Elkhoury MR, et al,

pulmonary syndrome in northern Brazil: partial genetic
characterization of viruses and serologic implication of likely
