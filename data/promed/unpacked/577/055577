The recent deaths of a pregnant mother and 2 children were not caused
by avian influenza virus as reported earlier, an Indonesian health
official said [on Wed 8 Mar 2006]. "Local tests showed they are
negative for bird flu," said Hariadi Wibisono, director of
animal-borne disease eradication with the Health Ministry.
But a 3-year-old boy who died in the Central Java capital of Semarang
was tested positive of bird flu by a local laboratory, he told Xinhua
over telephone. [Now confirmed by WHO; see below. - Mod.CP]
The death toll in confirmed bird flu cases in the country now stands
at 21, he said.

Avian Influenza Situation in Indonesia - WHO Update 6
---------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 10 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 4-year-old
boy from Semerang, Central Java. He developed symptoms (fever) on 10
Feb 2006 and died on 28 Feb 2006.
A joint investigation involving provincial health and agricultural
authorities found that chickens had died in the boy's neighbourhood
in the days preceding symptom onset. No other human cases were
identified in the family or neighbourhood.
The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia to 28. Of
these, 21 were fatal.
Agricultural authorities have reported a recent increase in the
number of poultry deaths in Central and East Java. These reports have
led to heightened awareness of the risk of human cases and a higher
level of clinical suspicion when patients present with respiratory
symptoms.
The Ministry of Health and WHO are monitoring the situation closely.
Many patients under investigation have subsequently been ruled out by
tests conducted at local and WHO-affiliated laboratories.

Avian influenza has killed its 22nd human victim in Indonesia, a
12-year-old girl, according to tests by the World Health
Organisation's Hong Kong laboratory, an Indonesian health ministry
official said on Friday [10 Mar 2006]. "We have confirmation from the
Hong Kong lab that a 12-year-old girl from Boyolali in Central Java
died of bird flu. We now have 30 cases, with 22 of them dead," said
Hariadi Wibisono, director-general of control of animal-borne disease
at the health ministry.

There is a discrepancy between 10 Indonesian Ministry of Health
confirmed case count and that published by WHO. The WHO cumulative
number of confirmed human cases of avian A (H5N1) influenza released
today [Fri 10 Mar 2008] is given as 28, 21 of whom have died. This is
the figure quoted in WHO Update 6 cited in part (3) above. The
Indonesian Ministry of Health, on the other hand, states that the
number of confirmed cases is now 30, with 22 deaths. The 12-year-old
girl from Boyolali may account for the difference in the number of
fatalities, but a discrepancy of one non-fatal case remains
unexplained. - Mod.CP]

Between 1 and 10 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Health in Azerbaijian has
been investigating a cluster of 10 persons placed under observation
for possible infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. All of
these persons are from the Daikyand settlement in Salyan Rayon in the
eastern part of the country.
The Salyan Rayon is located near wetlands frequented by migratory
birds. Recent deaths of poultry have been reported in the Daikyand
settlement, but the cause of these deaths has not yet been determined.
The investigation was launched when 2 young women who were neighbours
died within a week of each other. The 1st patient, a 17-year-old
girl, died on 23 Feb 2006. She was reported to have suffered for more
than a year from respiratory symptoms associated with a neoplastic
condition. Her death is now thought to have been caused by this
pre-existing disease. As a precaution, samples have been taken and
will be sent for H5N1 testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in
the United Kingdom.
The 2nd death occurred on 3 Mar 2006 in a 20-year-old woman who died
following rapidly progressive acute pneumonia, which is a
characteristic feature in many cases of H5N1 infection.
Immediately following the 2nd death, the Ministry of Health initiated
daily house-to-house investigations, conducted by 4 teams of hospital
staff, looking for persons in the settlement having respiratory
symptoms or fever. As a result, an additional 8 persons were
hospitalized for observation. Of these, 6 showed only mild symptoms.
They have fully recovered and have now been discharged from hospital.
Of the remaining 2 patients, one, a 17-year-old girl, died on 8 Mar
2006. A 16-year-old boy remains hospitalized in isolation. His
condition is critical.
The response of the Ministry of Health has been prompt and efficient,
but hampered by the lack of some essential equipment and supplies and
inadequate diagnostic capacity. Prior to the event, staff from the
Ministry of Health had visited offices of sanitary hygiene and
epidemiology in each rayon within the country, creating a high level
of awareness of the disease and a correspondingly high level of alert
for possible cases of unusual respiratory disease. The house-to-house
surveillance for cases is continuing.
A WHO team is presently in Azerbaijan to assess needs and provide
technical support to health officials. The team will be augmented on
Monday with additional expertise and supplies, including laboratory
equipment and diagnostic reagents. Samples have been collected by
local officials and shipment to the WHO-affiliated laboratory is
expected to take place early next week. Supplies of the antiviral
drug oseltamivir are available in Azerbaijan, but the quantity is
limited. To date, all patients under investigation have received
treatment with this drug.
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was initially confirmed in
Azerbaijan on 9 Feb 2006 in wild birds found in the coastal area near
the capital city of Baku. On 24 Feb 2006, the country announced
detection of infection in poultry at farms in Khyzy (in the
north-eastern part of the country) and Bilasuvar (near Salyan). Some
300 000 birds were culled as a result.
