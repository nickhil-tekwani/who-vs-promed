FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - TANZANIA, SEYCHELLES
===========================================
In October my wife and I went on a safari and bird-watching vacation
trip to northern Tanzania (Tarangire, Manyara, Ngorongoro) and to the
Seychelles, where we stayed mostly on Praslin Island, but with a day
trip to Cousin Island to see the thousands of nesting Noddies (Brown
and Lesser Noddies), Terns, and other sea birds.
About a month after our return to the States my wife developed a modest
fever 99 - 101, worse during the afternoons. After three weeks she was
hospitalized for a few days for tests (malaria, etc.). All the tests
came back negative. Finally, after the fever peaked at about 103 during
several afternoons, it gradually abated, and at four weeks she had fully
recovered her normal good health. The doctors were all stumped: the
final diagnosis - she must have picked up a virus someplace. However,
during their investigation, many doctors focused on our visits to bird
sanctuaries like Cousin Island in the Seychelles where we were in very
close proximity (a few feet) to thousands of nesting birds.
We wonder if anyone has heard of others having had this experience after
visiting Seychelles or other bird colonies, or was this questioning just a
medical "shot-in-the-dark".

[There are a whole slew of arboviruses carried by seabird ticks, including
Soldado Rock virus, first isolated from the seabird nesting site off
Trinidad, but also in the Seychelles. Your wife could be the first recorded
human case - if she would like to send a specimen of her serum to my lab (NY
State Dept of Health) I can arrange to have it tested by a reference
laboratory.
Other seabird tick disease organisms include one that causes Laysan disease,
a nasty fever contracted by Park Rangers who live on that Hawaiian island to
protect the breeding birds; Sakhalin virus, from the Russian islands in the
Pacific; Mono Lake virus, from bird ticks collected on a gull-breeding islet
in California; Hughes virus from Soldado Rock again & also other islands off
the coast of Florida, California & Mexico.
Of course, if she picked up the infection in Tanzania, it could be one of a
large number of arboviruses - again, I can arrange for the necessary testing.
However, one month is rather a long incubation period for an arbovirus, more
likely delayed onset of resistant malaria due to her taking prophylaxis.
What prophylaxis was she on? What malaria test was done? Was malaria
serology done? - Jack Woodall, Moderator]
