More cases of measles in the Calgary area
-----------------------------------------
Alberta Health Services (AHS) reports 4 more cases of measles have
been reported in the Calgary area and that number could grow.

It was a week ago that AHS announced a case in a young child under
the age of 5 and now it says more people have come down with the
highly contagious virus. Of the new cases, 3 are connected to the
case reported last Friday [7 May 2010]. They are either family
members or friends of the family and the virus matches the virus
involved in an outbreak in British Columbia. AHS doesn't know where
the [1st] person came in contact with the virus.

No emergency rooms that treated the patients were shut down, but AHS
says some staff were sent home as a precaution. AHS is investigating
8 more suspected cases of the measles.

[The significance of these cases is that that the outbreak of measles
that occurred in British Columbia at the time of the Winter Olympic
Games may now be spreading eastwards.
