Further to your post of a news item listing the fact that an elephant
at Taronga Zoo has been diagnosed with TB, I noted that the ensuing
comments required further information about the type of infection and
treatment under way.

As the communications manager for Taronga Zoo, I have liaised with
our veterinarians and would appreciate if you could update the
original listing with the following information:

Pak Boon, one of Taronga Zoo's elephants has been diagnosed with
tuberculosis. The organism has been confirmed as _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_. The isolate has been genotyped as belonging to the
Beijing family. The isolate is fully sensitive to isoniazid,
pyrazinamide, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Treatment commenced
immediately the diagnosis was confirmed.
