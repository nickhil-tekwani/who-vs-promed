TRYPANOSOMIASIS - INDIA (WEST BENGAL)(02)

After reading your posting on trypanosomiasis in India [reference below], I
would like to know why Dr. Das wrote that " ...vector of sleeping sickness
is absent in India". Perhaps his patient was not infected by an African
trypanosome!
I consulted the booklet published in 1977 by ICAR (Indian Council of
Agricultural Research, New Delhi) 124 p.: " B.S. Gill: Trypanosomes &
Trypanosomiases of Indian Livestock," a very well-documented review on
_Trypanosoma evansi_ and _T. equiperdum_ in which the author describes a
human laboratory contamination by _T. evansi_ that was cured by Atoxyl
(arsenical derivative) (p. 36).
Unfortunately [a reprint of] this unique report (published in the C.R. of
the French Acad. Sci. ,1945) is impossible to obtain. This human case of a
so-called human trypanosomiasis in Asia has to be compared with a similar
case occurred in Sri Lanka in 1999. At that time I was in contact with the
Sri Lankan epidemiological service and was given some details, but there
was no follow-up.

[An interesting comment to add to the diagnostic considerations. ProMED
still looks forward to receiving more data regarding these 2 patients. -
Mod.EP]
[As Dr. Louis Touratier mentioned, there was a report of a case of human
trypanosomiasis reported from Sri Lanka in 1999 (see ProMED-mail 1999 refs
below which contain interesting discussions). At the time of report it was
mentioned that a _T. evansi_ like organism was identified but there was no
definitive conclusion as to the final identification of the organism. In
that incident, the case was a cattle herder with significant exposure to
cattle, somewhat "explaining" the possible risk exposures. Perhaps sources
in India might have more information on possible sources of contact for the
2 reported cases (Maharashtra and Kolkata), and sources in Sri Lanka might
have final information on the 1999 case. - Mod.MPP]
[Human sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) in Africa is transmitted by
tsetse flies (_Glossina_ species) and they certainly do not occur in India.
Apart from two localities in the Arabian peninsular these flies are
restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. Other biting flies such as stable flies
(_Stomoxys_ species) and tabanids have been considered of possibly
transmitting human trypanosomes in Africa by purely mechanical means, that
is through their contaminated mouthparts.
Species of _Trypanosoma_, such as _Trypanosoma evansi_, are widely
distributed in Central and South America and also Asia and infect domestic
and wild animals causing animal trypanosomiasis. In the absence of tsetse
flies other biting flies such as tabanids and stable flies are the vectors.
But this does not add much in clarifying the recently reported cases of
trypanosomes in India, because we still do not know what trypanosome
species is involved, but together with a previous report (20041216.3323)
it does help stress that there are many species of trypanosomes, some of
which occur outside Africa.- Mod MS]
