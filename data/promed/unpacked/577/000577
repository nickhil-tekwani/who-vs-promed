Upon reading the excerpt on TB in Kruger National Park Buffalo and
predators, I immediately thought of an interesting parallel situation in
Canada. Tuberculosis (and brucellosis) has been present in bison in Wood
Buffalo National Park since _Mycobacterium bovis_ was introduced with
infected plains bison during the 1920's. Its presence became an issue
during the last 15 years or so as disease-free (TB and brucellosis)
free-ranging populations of bison were reestablished in adjacent areas in
northern Alberta, southern NWT, and northeastern British Columbia, and with
the rapid expansion of captive commercial bison herds in the region.
Parks Canada is in a similar position to Kruger NP in that it may only take
action to manage or eradicate the disease organisms if significant
ecological effects on park bison or the park ecosystem can be demonstrated.
A multi-year project was undertaken by Dr. Francois Messier and Mr. Damien
Joly of the University of Saskatchewan in1997 to evaluate the role of the
diseases in bison population ecology (messier@sask.usask.ca). Preliminary
findings were presented in a progress report in March 1998.
Fifty-one percent of 124 bison tested positive for tuberculosis based on
combined results of the tuberculin caudal fold test and an ELISA. There was
no significant difference between the sexes in prevalence. Infection rate
increased with age. Pregnancy rate (serum progesterone and pregnancy
specific protein B) was significantly lower in bison testing positive for
tuberculosis. The authors acknowledge that this is the first report of an
effect of tuberculosis on pregnancy rates in bison.
It is noteworthy that predation by wolves is a major source of mortality in
bison, especially in the area with the largest, though declining, number of
bison, the Peace/Athabasca Delta (PAD). The prevalence of tuberculosis in
the PAD was significantly lower than in two other subpopulations studied.
The authors speculated that higher wolf predation in this area may be
acting to reduce the proportion of infected individuals.
