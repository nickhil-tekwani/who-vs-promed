Elephant death sparks anthrax panic
-----------------------------------
Anthrax fear grips state tiger reserves yet again. The sudden death of an adult makna (male without tusks) elephant in Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary has set the alarm bells ringing among forest department officials. Though attending vets ruled out poisoning as the cause of death, they were cautious not to specify any other reason.

The carcass of the elephant was found on Tuesday morning [12 Feb 2013] at the Siltorsa compartment in the west range of the forest. During examination, veterinary doctors found blood oozing out from the nose and mouth of the animal which has sparked panic among foresters.

While anthrax might be a remote possibility, nothing can be said for sure until the test reports for viscera samples are received, said sources. The samples have been sent to Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Kolkata.

The elephant carcass was buried hastily to prevent the virus from spreading.

The forest department has also started a thorough screening of the forests in North Bengal to find out whether any other elephant or animal has died in the past few days. Foresters said the last case of anthrax was reported from Jaldapara in the 90s when few elephants and rhinos had died due to this virus. [It is not a virus. It is a bacterium.]

"So far we have not spotted any other carcass in the forests. Had the disease spread, there would have been more deaths. We are taking every necessary step to arrest the disease from spreading. We have also asked the animal husbandry department to check whether any case of anthrax was reported among the cattle in forest villages," said BK Sood, conservator of forests, wildlife, Northern Circle.

The department is working in tandem with the veterinary department and has also planned to vaccinate cattle belonging to villagers and in fringe areas of the different forests in North Bengal. "We are keeping a close watch on the rhino population as well. Besides, we have stopped our captive elephants from grazing inside the forest, especially where the carcass of the elephant was found," Sood added.

The forest department has 80 kunki (trained) elephants in Jaldapara, Gorumara National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve Forest and Mahananda wildlife sanctuary. It is now checking if all these elephants are properly vaccinated. If not, they will be vaccinated.

[Anthrax was suspected and samples were sent to Kalkata for analysis; nothing has been heard since. The elephant has been buried. Though he was bleeding from orifices, we do not suspect anthrax. Instead we suspect one of 3 novel herpesviruses -- EEHV1A, EEHV1B and EEHV2 -- all members of the Proboscivirus genus and are the only ones associated with acute haemorrhagic disease. This virus is quite common in Asian elephants.

A total of 3 novel herpesviruses EEHV1A, EEHV1B and EEHV2 were identified originally as the causes of fatal haemorrhagic disease in 1999. However since 2007 many more types have been detected with a total number of 12 species and 2 subspecies. The 8 known EEHV types are all members of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and are the only ones associated with acute haemorrhagic disease. (Garner et al., 2009; Latimer et al., 2010). EEHV causes fatal haemorrhagic disease, attacking endothelial cells (blood vessels, heart and similar organs) among Asian elephants and has become a very serious problem. This disease has a sudden acute onset and preferentially targets calves between the ages of one and 8 years (with more than half of those between one and 3 years of age). The 1st case was identified in 1995 at the Washington Zoo and reported in Science in 1999 (the earliest confirmed case is from 1983).

In the absence of the proven presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ in this elephant, we propose that a herpesvirus infection should be considered and investigated. One should remember that whatever the textbooks may say, blood extravsation in anthrax is more the exception than the rule; for example in the 1993 anthrax epidemic in the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary in NWT Canada there were just a a couple of dead bison out of 175 with any haemorrhaging -- the rest were just dead. So realise that there may be other diseases to test for as well as anthrax when animals are bleeding from their orifices.
