4 deaths due to Primary Amebic Encephalitis, Karachi
----------------------------------------------------
The emergence of a rare parasitic disease called _Naegleria_ has led to 4 deaths after the victims swam in water bodies such as swimming pools at farmhouses that were not properly disinfected.

Since 3 Jul 2012, 3 cases were received at Liaquat National Hospital [LNH] and one at Aga Khan University Hospital. All of the patients died within a few days.

An unconscious resident of Islamia Colony, was brought to Liaquat National Hospital on [3 Jul 2012] with fever. He died on [6 Jul 2012]. Patient number 2 from Nazimabad came in the same condition on [10 Jul 2012] and died after 24 hours. Patient number 3 from Korangi was brought on [11 Jul2012] and died on [14 Jul 2012].

A senior medical officer from the LNH medical ICU ward which treated 2 of the patients told The Express Tribune that they had a history of going to a swimming pool at a farmhouse.

This information indicates that there is no cause for alarm. "It is not a communicable disease and cannot turn into an epidemic, so there is no need for panic", explained Prof. Dr Afia Zafar, an expert microbiologist at the Aga Khan University. She urged that simple precautions can decrease the risk significantly.

The parasitic ameba _Naegleria fowleri_ penetrates the human body when a person dives into an infected swimming pool, fresh water pond, lake or river, when the water hits the roof of the nose. From there the parasite travels directly to the brain, causing acute meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and the membrane around it).

The disease progresses with high grade fever, headache, vomiting and a stiff neck. This is followed by unconsciousness and the disoriented or comatose patient is diagnosed with acute pyogenic meningitis, which can later result in cardio-respiratory failure.

The disease can be identified by an MRI, CT Scan or a spinal tap. "However, the disease is not identified as it is rare and clinicians do not look for it and most labs also do the same",¬ù Zafar said. She suggested that doctors broaden their index of suspicion, as it is very easy to detect under the microscope. There is a suspicion that some patients are going undetected.

The course of the illness is fairly short - about 5 days. As doctors most commonly treat acute bacterial meningitis there is a risk the proper treatment is not given in time. Over the world, the mortality rate is known to be 95 per cent mostly because it is not diagnosed within time.

While the parasite can attack anyone, Zafar said that the younger lot is more likely to get affected as they often take to swimming to beat the heat. The 1st few cases surfaced about 3 years ago in Karachi. Last year there were about 9 cases at different hospitals, but there appear to be more this time, she said. It is a very rare disease but cases have been noted in the USA and Australia.

People should avoid swimming in pools that are not properly disinfected with the internationally recommended percentage of chlorine. Fresh water ponds, lakes and rivers should also be avoided, she recommended.

Fatal cases of Naegleria fowleri encephalitis in Pakistan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
More cases of the rare infection caused by Naegleria, a waterborne parasite, have emerged, taking the total number of patients to nine this year.

Since July 3, three Naegleria cases were received at Liaquat National Hospital and one at Aga Khan University Hospital. All of them died within a few days. Dr Naseem Salahuddin, the head of the Indus Hospital's Infectious Diseases Department, confirmed on Friday that her hospital had received two patients infected by Naegleria fowleri.

Sources at the Aga Khan University Hospital also revised their total number of patients dying of the rare disease from one to four this year. Prof Dr Afia Zafar of the pathology and microbiology department at Aga Khan University Hospital said that the patient numbers could be much more as only a few hospitals have equipment to diagnose the parasite.

The parasite penetrates the human body through the nose when a person dives into an infected swimming pool or a freshwater pond or river. From there the amoeba travels directly to the brain, causing acute inflammation.

Dr Salahuddin said that the situation is not alarming but the doctors should look for the symptoms and identify the disease. She said that the only threat in Karachi lies with the swimming pools since there are no lakes or rivers in the city.

"Some patients who came to the hospital, however, said they had not visited any pool or lake", she said. "We do not have any proof, but we can assume that people could get the infection while washing the face or during ablution when water forced into nostrils."

Official concern
The Sindh health department tasked two officials with a survey of the water parks and swimming pools. Health minister Dr Sagheer Ahmed told the press that four deaths by the parasite have been confirmed so far. The departments have been directed to add as much chlorine in the water as possible.

The KMC has two swimming pools at the KMC Sports Complex and Women's Sports Complex.

[Naegleria fowleria is one of the free living amebae oocationally causing human infections. It probably occur worldwide even though primary amebic encephalitis, PAM. PAM has been reported from Pakistan (Shakoor et al. Primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri, Karachi, Pakistan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2011;17:258-61), India (Jain R, Tilak V. Primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri. J Indian Med Assoc. 2011;109:500-1) and Malaysia (Ithoi I et al. Detection of Naegleria species in environmental samples from Peninsular Malaysia. PLoS One. 2011;6:e24327).
It will be important to know whether the microscopic diagnosis of PAM due to naegleria fowleri was confirmed by either culture or polymerase chain reaction, PCR.
