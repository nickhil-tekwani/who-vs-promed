Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Worthington due to contaminated milk powder
---------------------------------------------------
In May 2005, InVS was informed of a cluster of 6 cases of _Salmonella_
Worthington (_S. enterica_ serotype Worthington - Mod.LL) infections in 1
hospital by the Centre de Coordination de la Lutte contre les Infections
Nosocomiales (CCLIN, Coordination centre for nosocomial infection control)
in Bordeaux (south west France). The hospital was located in the
administrative departement of Haute-Garonne and the 1st case developed
symptoms on 29 Jan 2005.
During the same period the Centre national de reference des Salmonella
(national Salmonella reference centre, CNR) identified 13 cases of _S._
Worthington infections, far more than annual average of 5 cases detected in
recent years. An epidemiological investigation was conducted by the local
health departments, the Cellules interregionales d'epidemiologie (CIRE,
interregional epidemiology teams) in Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees (south
west France), the infection control professionals of the hospitals
concerned, and the Institut de veille sanitaire (InVS), to search for
additional cases, identify the source and propose appropriate control measures.
Results
To date, the investigation has identified 49 cases of _S._ Worthington with
illness onset between 29 Jan and 5 Jul 2005 [see URL for figure]. 38 cases
were clustered in 3 hospitals located in 3 administrative districts, and 11
were isolated cases. The investigation results for the 3 clusters are
detailed below.
Hospital 1 (Haute-Garonne, south west France):
14 cases were identified between 29 Jan and 21 Jun 2005. 10 cases occurred
between 10 Feb and 14 Apr 2005, followed by 4 cases between 7 and 21 Jun
2005. The patients had been admitted to 3 different wards within the
hospital (mostly for long-term admission), and acquired their salmonella
infections in hospital. 2 patients died from causes unrelated to salmonella
infection.
Hospital 2 (Pyrenees-Atlantiques, south west France);
19 cases were identified between 3 Apr and 23 May 2005. The patients had
been admitted to hospital in long-term care wards at 2 different sites.
Hospital 3 (Val-de-Marne, northern France):
5 cases were identified between 6 May and 5 July 2005. These patients had
been admitted to hospital at 3 different wards. 2 patients died from causes
unrelated to salmonella infection.
"Isolated" cases identified by the CNR:
11 cases were identified between 8 Mar and 30 Jun 2005. These cases
occurred in 10 different administrative districts. At the time of their
salmonellosis, 7 of the patients had been admitted to 7 different
hospitals, and 4 patients were living at home. One of the hospitalized
patients died from causes unrelated to salmonella infection.
Case summary
45 of the 49 cases (92 per cent) were identified in patients who had
already been admitted to hospital for other reasons, and 2/3 of these
hospital cases were hospitalized in long-term care wards (table 1, for
tables see URL). The mean age for the hospital cases was 79 years (range:
29-104 years); the mean age of the cases that had not already been admitted
to hospital was 63 years (range: 15-90 years).
Symptoms were less severe than those usually observed for salmonellosis
(table 2): 28 per cent of cases presented with fever, and for 44 per cent
of cases, the only symptoms seen were a change in stools (loose stools).
The investigation into cases' food consumption in the week before symptom
onset did not find evidence of any common dishes or other food preparation
or dietary supplements. However, an analysis of the ingredients used in
food preparation found that the majority of patients had consumed powdered
milk from the same manufacturer, used to enrich or alter food texture to
make it easier to eat for elderly and malnourished patients. Among the 37
hospital cases for whom information was available, 37 (100 per cent) had
definitely (23 cases) or probably (14 cases) eaten food prepared with
powdered milk during the 7 days before symptom onset. None of the 4 cases
who became ill while living at home had consumed powdered milk.
The investigation conducted by the local veterinary services in Jun 2005
isolated _S._ Worthington from environmental samples taken at the
manufacturing plant, in milk powder produced in Mar 2005 sampled from one
of the hospitals and from a sample of milk powder produced in Dec 2004 that
was stored in the manufacturing plant.
It was concluded that the outbreak of cases of serotype Worthington
identified in hospitals in the first 6 months of 2005 was due to the
consumption of this contaminated powdered milk.
Control measures:
Hygiene control measures (hand hygiene and disinfection of equipment and
premises) were reinforced in the 3 hospitals from the beginning of the
investigation, with the help of CCLIN and CIRE.
A communication was sent from InVS to the 5 French CCLINs on 24 Jun 2005 to
reinforce vigilance for salmonella caused by serotype Worthington in
hospitals in the areas affected, particularly facilities with long-term
care wards.
On 7 Jul 2005, the suspected batches of milk were withdrawn by the
manufacturer, through the distributors, in collaboration with the local
veterinary services and the directorate-general for food products. The
production of milk powder was stopped on 6 Jul 2005 at the manufacturing
plant and cleaning and disinfection were carried out there. The
manufacturing process was reviewed in collaboration with the local
veterinary services and an external expert.
Because this powdered milk was distributed nationwide for institutional use
(hospitals, residential homes, schools and day care centres), and cases
were seen mainly in elderly, hospitalized people, a communication about the
withdrawal of these products was sent out on 7 Jul 2005 to all hospitals by
the ministry of health. Reminders about recommendations for the use of
powdered milk were made: hand hygiene, respecting the cold chain, and
application of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) risk
management system when preparing food.
