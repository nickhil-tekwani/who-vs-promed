[1] Baricitinib for severe COVID-19 in the elderly
Date: Sun 15 Nov 2020
Source: News Medical [edited]
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201115/Arthritis-drug-may-improve-COVID-19-survival-among-elderly-patients.aspx


A type of arthritis drug may reduce the risk of dying for elderly patients with COVID-19. This is the finding of a new international study, led by scientists at Imperial College London and the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, published in the journal Science Advances.

In the early-stage study, 83 patients, with a median age of 81 and all suffering from moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, were given a drug called baricitinib. This medication is usually used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and was initially identified by the Imperial team using artificial intelligence (AI) as a drug that could have anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects.

In the study, the patients, who were in multiple hospitals across Italy and Spain, had a 71% reduced risk of dying compared with patients who had not taken the drug. The study also found that 17% of patients who were given the drug died or needed to go on a ventilator, compared with 35% in the control group who were not given the medication.

The research team say the findings are being followed up with large-scale clinical trials. "We urgently need to find more effective treatments for COVID-19 while we wait for a vaccine to become widely available. This is one of the first COVID-19 treatments to go from computer to clinic and laboratory. It was first identified by an AI algorithm in February [2020], which scanned thousands of potential drugs that could work against this virus. The study suggests this drug can aid recovery of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and may provide a new weapon in our arsenal against the virus. Large-scale clinical trials of this drug, to further investigate its potential, are now under way," [said] Professor Justin Stebbing, co-lead author of the study from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial.

In the research, scientists from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, together with the Imperial team, grew miniature human organs in the lab, called organoids, to investigate how exactly the drug may combat COVID-19. The findings revealed that the drug may help work in 2 ways: reduce organ damage caused by inflammation and block the virus entering human cells. When infected with the COVID-19 virus, called SARS-CoV-2, the body releases different types of inflammatory molecules, called chemokines and cytokines. These molecules act as the early warning system for the body, telling the immune system the body is under attack. However, in the case of COVID-19, particular cytokines and chemokines, including those called interleukins and interferons, cause this warning system to spiral out of control and trigger a so-called cytokine storm.

This cytokine storm not only causes significant damage to the body's organs, but the study revealed it also helps the virus gain access inside human cells. The study showed a particular cytokine, called an interferon, increases the number of receptors, or docking points, for the virus. By doing this, it, in effect, lowers the drawbridge and lets the virus into the cells of the body. The researchers revealed the drug blocks this process occurring and so increases survival from COVID-19. The research also suggested COVID-19 increases the activity of genes related to platelets, which can make the blood sticky and more likely to form clots. The drug baricitinib was shown to reduce the activity of the genes.

Professor Volker Lauschke, co-lead author from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, explained: "This study confirms what AI predicted, and what we were hearing from patient case reports. For instance, one case involved an 87 year old severely unwell patient from Foggia, Italy, who showed rapid improvement after being given the drug, whereas her husband and son, who did not receive baricitinib, died. This study has also shone a light on exactly how this drug may protect us at the cellular level. This helps us understand why other types of drugs are proving beneficial, or not beneficial, as we as help identify other treatments which may tackle COVID-19."

Professor Stebbing added: "We have seen the top line results of a randomized study called the Adaptive Covid Treatment Trial-2 announced recently, showing benefits of baricitinib plus remdesivir, compared with remdesivir alone in over 1000 patients. Other very large trials occurring now include COV-BARRIER, and this will help create a fuller picture of the benefits and side effects of the oral medication (a small number of the patients in our study needed to stop the treatment due to problems with liver function). Further trials comparing baricitinib to other drugs in COVID-19 patients would also be helpful in improving outcomes."

Abstract
--------
Using AI we identified baricitinib as possessing anti-viral and anti-cytokine efficacy. We now show a 71% (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.58) mortality benefit in 83 patients with moderate-severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with few drug-induced adverse events, including a large elderly cohort (median age, 81 years). A further 48 cases with mild-moderate pneumonia recovered uneventfully. Using organotypic 3D cultures of primary human liver cells, we demonstrate that interferon-alpha-2 (IFN-alpha-2) significantly increases ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in parenchymal cells by more than 5-fold. RNA-Seq reveals gene response signatures associated with platelet activation, fully inhibited by baricitinib. Using viral load quantifications and super-resolution microscopy, baricitinib exerts activity rapidly through the inhibition of host proteins (numb associated kinases), uniquely amongst anti-virals. This reveals mechanistic actions of a Janus kinase-1/2 inhibitor targeting viral entry, replication and the cytokine storm, and is associated with beneficial outcomes including in severely ill elderly patients, data that incentivize further randomized controlled trials.

---
The study enrolled 601 patients at the University of Pisa (Italy) (n = 179) and Albacete Hospital (Spain) (n = 422). The Pisa cohort treated 37 patients with baricitinib, and the Albacete cohort treated 46 with baricitinib. All patients were of European descent. There were 83 controls.

Safety issues seen in study with baricitinib: Seven (19%) patients from Pisa had a transaminitis (2-5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 72 hours of commencing baricitinib, with 4 having drug cessation. The remaining 3 had continued treatment with baricitinib with self-resolution of liver function abnormalities. One individual had a severe lymphocytopenia (less than 500 cells/mm3), and the drug was discontinued. A total of 5 (14%) patients from Pisa developed infectious complications during baricitinib treatment (1 bacteremia due to urinary tract, 2 episodes of central venous catheter [CVC]-related bacteremia, 1 urinary tract infection, and 1 severe facial herpes simplex infection). In the unmatched control group, there were 21 (14.8%) patients developing infections: 8 bloodstream infections, 8 urinary tract infections and 5 with pneumonia. In the PS-matched control group, 6 (16.2%) episodes of infection occurred: 2 cases of bacteremia (1 from the urinary tract), 3 urinary tract infections, and 1 pneumonia.

The authors noted that baricitinib's effects were evident from the first treatment days and maintained over follow-up. They also noted that while most recommended treatment regimens support the use of 4 mg for 14 days, lower doses and shorter durations may be beneficial for certain populations, including elderly patients.

The authors cite limitations: It not a randomized trial comparing baricitinib with a placebo control group. Therefore, known and unknown confounding variables could have compromised the results, and the authors mention randomized trials that are in progress.

I would add to the limitation is that the study patients were all of European descent; other identified high-risk groups need to be studied as well. If the 71% reduction in mortality is reproducible in the randomized trials, this is potentially a significant finding. We await further study information. - Mod.MPP]

Summary
-------
Background: Viral load kinetics and duration of viral shedding are important determinants for disease transmission. We aimed to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA shedding, and viable virus shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in various body fluids, and to compare SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral dynamics.

Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, and the grey literature, for research articles published between 1 Jan 2003 and 6 Jun 2020. We included case series (with 5 or more participants), cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that reported SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV infection, and reported viral load kinetics, duration of viral shedding, or viable virus. Two authors independently extracted data from published studies, or contacted authors to request data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools. We calculated the mean duration of viral shedding and 95% CIs for every study included and applied the random-effects model to estimate a pooled effect size. We used a weighted meta-regression with an unrestricted maximum likelihood model to assess the effect of potential moderators on the pooled effect size. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020181914.

Findings: A total of 79 studies (5340 individuals) on SARS-CoV-2, 8 studies (1858 individuals) on SARS-CoV, and 11 studies (799 individuals) on MERS-CoV were included. Mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 17.0 days (95% CI, 15.5-18.6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) in upper respiratory tract, 14.6 days (9.3-20.0; 7 studies, 260 individuals) in lower respiratory tract, 17.2 days (14.4-20.1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) in stool, and 16.6 days (3.6-29.7; 2 studies, 108 individuals) in serum samples. Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope, 0.304 [95% CI, 0.115-0.493]; p = 0.0016). No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads, which were inferred from cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the 1st week of illness, whereas that of SARS-CoV peaked at days 10-14 and that of MERS-CoV peaked at days 7-10.

Interpretation: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the 1st week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2.

[The following "Research in context" discussion has been extracted from the above-cited article:

Evidence before this study
Understanding when patients are most infectious and the duration of infectiousness are of critical importance to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration of RNA detection across human coronaviruses has not been well characterised, and comprehensive understanding about viral load dynamics and the duration of viral shedding in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is lacking. We retrieved all articles reporting the dynamics and the duration of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) shedding in various specimens through systematic searches of major databases. Our research identified publications that included terms related to viral dynamics and viral shedding. We included case series, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials in which the viral dynamics or the duration of viral shedding was reported. We excluded case reports, case series with fewer than 5 patients, and studies that did not have a clear time of symptom onset.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the 1st systematic review and meta-analysis that has examined and compared the viral dynamics of the 3 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. The results provide a comprehensive understanding regarding their viral kinetics and duration of shedding. Mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration was 17.0 days (maximum shedding duration, 83 days) in upper respiratory tract, 14.6 days (maximum, 59 days) in lower respiratory tract, 17.2 days (maximum, 35 days) in stool, and 16.6 days (maximum, 60 days) in serum samples. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age. No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the 1st week of illness, whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV peaked later. Several studies reported similar viral loads at the start of infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, most studies demonstrated faster viral clearance in asymptomatic individuals, as also seen in MERS-CoV, suggesting a shorter infectious period but with similar potential transmissibility at the onset of infection.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our study shows that despite evidence of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples, viable virus appears to be short-lived. Therefore, RNA detection cannot be used to infer infectiousness. High titres of SARS-CoV-2 are detected early in the disease course, with an early peak observed at the time of symptom onset to day 5 of illness; this finding probably explains the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This has important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community and hospital setting, emphasising the importance of early case finding and prompt isolation as well as public education about the spectrum of illness. Our study shows that isolation practices should be commenced with the start of 1st symptoms, which can include mild and atypical symptoms, preceding typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as cough and fever. However, given the potential delays in isolation of patients, even the early detection and isolation strategy might not be fully effective in containing SARS-CoV-2.

---
Factors identified with prolonged viral shedding included age greater than 60 years, male sex and conflicting findings regarding the use of steroids, with 4 studies demonstrating delayed viral clearance and one study showing no difference.

Use of the antiviral remdesivir found the same decrease in viral load in both treated and control groups; interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin showed a shorter duration of viral shedding with combination treatment compared with controls. Noteworthy was none of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, Arbidol, and lopinavir-ritonavir) reduced viral shedding on their own. In one study, lopinavir-ritonavir use was associated with delayed viral clearance.

Multiple studies demonstrated faster viral clearance in asymptomatic infections.

Cultures of infected individuals identified live virus during the 1st week of illness but none past the 1st week.

Studies on SARS-CoV did not have information on mean or median duration of viral shedding but did report a maximum duration of viral shedding of 8 weeks in the upper respiratory tract and 52 days in the lower respiratory tract, 6-7 weeks in serum, and 126 days in stool samples.

Studies found low viral load in the initial days of illness, increasing after the 1st week of illness in upper respiratory tract samples, peaking at day 10, or days 12-14, and declining after weeks 3-4. High viral loads correlated with severity of illness and poor survival.

Viable virus was isolated from stool and respiratory samples up to 4 weeks, and urine specimens up to day 36 from symptom onset.

Studies on MERS-CoV found a mean viral shedding duration of 15.3 days (95% CI, 11.6-19.0) in the upper respiratory tract and 16.3 days (13.8-18.9) in the lower respiratory tract. Prolonged shedding was associated with illness severity and survival. Peak viral loads were found between days 7 and 10.

The authors conclude: "These findings highlight that isolation practices should be commenced with the start of 1st symptoms, including mild and atypical symptoms that precede more typical COVID-19 symptoms. However, given potential delays in the isolation of patients, effective containment of SARS-CoV-2 might be challenging even with an early detection and isolation strategy."

Countries that have had relative success with control of viral transmission include early identification of infections, testing asymptomatic individuals arriving from elsewhere ("imported infections"), and testing all known contacts including asymptomatic contacts using monitored isolation. This study highlights the need for inclusion of identifying early infections, either asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Samoa: 1st case
Date: Thu 19 Nov 2020

Samoa has announced its 1st coronavirus case as the pandemic continues to spread to previously untouched Pacific island nations. Samoa on Thursday [19 Nov 2020] said a sailor had tested positive for coronavirus after returning from Europe via New Zealand, in what would be the island nation's 1st case if confirmed.

As of Wednesday afternoon [18 Nov 2020], the remote island country of about 200 000 people had recorded zero cases of coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization's data. The sailor had flown to Samoa from Auckland last Friday [13 Nov 2020] and tested positive to the virus late on Wednesday [18 Nov 2020] after several days in a quarantine facility, prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said.

"We now have one case and will be added to the countries of the world that have the coronavirus," the mask-wearing leader said during a televised address on Thursday [19 Nov 2020]. However, in a statement on Facebook later on Thursday [19 Nov 2020], the nation's government noted that a 2nd test returned a negative result and that the man was in isolation at a local hospital. The prime minister called for calm in his address, as the country's cabinet called a meeting with the latest health development on top of its agenda.

Until recently, the remote Pacific islands were among the most successful in the world at keeping out the virus after closing their borders early in response to the threat, despite the huge cost to tourism-reliant economies. But in the past 2 months, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands and now Samoa have lost their coveted virus-free status, although none has so far reported community transmission. The island nations and territories of Kiribati, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be free of the virus.

The cautious approach adopted in the Pacific islands was prompted by fears that they are particularly vulnerable because of poor hospital infrastructure and high rates of underlying health conditions such as obesity and heart disease. The devastation a viral outbreak can create in such a fragile environment was demonstrated during a measles epidemic in Samoa late last year [2019] that claimed 83 lives, most of them babies and toddlers.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (although that may be changing with the addition of Samoa - see [3] above).

Data by country, area, or territory for 19 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov19_1605823613.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 39.0% of daily case numbers and 32.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 23.8 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Canada. Other countries/territories reporting more than 1000 cases include Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama. And countries reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 42.8% of daily case numbers and 47.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 15.9 million. Countries not reporting cases today (19 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, France, Russia, Germany, Poland, UK, Ukraine, and Romania. There are 23 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.9% of daily case numbers and 9.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.6 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Iraq, Pakistan, Lebanon, Tunisia, UAE, and the Palestinian Authority. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the last few days.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.42 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Congo Republic (Brazzaville), Reunion, and Angola.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.83% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.81 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Mongolia, and China. Mongolia has reported 65 locally transmitted cases (https://akipress.com/news:651115:Mongolia_reports_31_new_cases_of_coronavirus,_505_in_total/). All 12 of the newly confirmed cases in Viet Nam were imported cases -- from Russia, Germany via Romania, and Canada (https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-confirms-12-new-covid-19-cases-4193736.html).

- The South East Asia region reported 9.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.1 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Thailand reported 8 cases, all of whom were imported cases -- 3 symptomatic from the UK, others asymptomatic from Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the UK (https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2022411/8-more-arrivals-test-positive).

Impression: There is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region with combined reports from these 2 regions representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (196 985), India (46 182), Italy (36 176), Brazil (35 686), and Spain (31 596) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 845 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (18-19 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, India, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Poland (23 975), Germany (23 676), Russia (23 610), UK (22 915), France (21 150), Ukraine (13 357), Iran (13 223), Romania (10 108), and Argentina (10 097). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 62 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.6%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 29.4% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 25.4% and in reported deaths is 27.7%. In Italy, the dominant country in the European region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 0.25% and in reported deaths is 26.0%. And in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 23.6% and in reported deaths is 4.9%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase. The 56 million case mark was crossed 24 hours ago and today (19 Nov 2020) the 57 million case mark was crossed. Daily reported cases in the past 24 hours have been close to 700 000 cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
