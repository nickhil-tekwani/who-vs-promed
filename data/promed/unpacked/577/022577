The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that while flu season is winding down, a 2nd strain that is more severe in younger children remains prevalent.

In an update, the CDC says that reports of the influenza A virus are on the decline while reports of the influenza B virus were more prevalent. A spokesperson for the CDC told CNN that influenza B can be "just as severe" as influenza A, and that "we also know that influenza B tends to be more severe for younger children." Flu season is getting worse, highest level in nearly a decade.

According to a government report released [Fri 23 Mar 2018], 1 out of every 13 visits to doctor's offices last week was for fever, cough, or flu symptoms.

As of its latest update, the CDC reports that flu-related child deaths are up to 133 for the 2017-2018 flu season. There were 5 pediatric deaths reported between [10 and 17 Mar 2018] related to influenza B, and one related to influenza A. During this week, 2.7 percent of patients visiting a doctor's office complained of flu-like symptoms.

Michigan, and most of the Midwest, is listed as having low to minimal flu activity as of the CDC's most recent update from the week ending on [17 Mar 2018].

A little more than a month ago, the CDC along with the Food and Drug Administration reported that this year's [2018] flu vaccine had been 36 percent effective. While this number sounds low to some, both agencies reported that this level was "better than some might have predicted." In fact, this number was 19 percent higher than Canada's vaccine, and 26 percent higher than Australia's.

At this time, the influenza A strain had accounted for 75 percent of all cases. 2 Michigan cities ranked among most at-risk in US for flu, influenza Grand Rapids-Wyoming is listed in the very high at-risk group and Detroit can be found one rung below in the high at-risk group. The Doctors Report app reports in a news release it compiles its rankings using data from nearly one million doctors across the United States.

"However, because of the severity of this season, there have been questions raised about how well this year's flu vaccine worked," the FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a news release. "Although the initial report of 36 percent overall efficacy for this year's vaccine in the United States that has been reported by our colleagues at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is better than some might have predicted, there is still clearly significant room for improvement.

"Because influenza viruses can change their genetic make-up rapidly during the course of a single year, seasonal influenza vaccines are unlike most other preventative vaccines, in that the strains contained in the vaccine constantly need to be adjusted based on the viruses that are expected to be in circulation."

Pennsylvania's unusually-severe flu season peaked in February [2018], but cases rose slightly last week, likely because of a "B strain" of the flu, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported [Tue 27 Mar 2018].

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also noted a national increase in the B strain, with a CDC doctor telling CNN that B strains can be hard on young children, so parents should continue to be on the lookout for symptoms in their child.

The report from the Pennsylvania health department stated, "There is usually co-circulation of influenza viruses during any one season and it's not uncommon for there to be second waves of influenza B activity during an influenza season."

Still, the flu was far less prevalent during the week that ended [Sat 24 Mar 2018] than it was during the weeks surrounding the peak reached during the week ending [10 Feb 2018].

The peak-period was dominated by a flu strain called H3N2, an A strain known for causing an unusually high number of hospitalizations and deaths. A strains are generally considered more harmful than B strains.

As of [Sat 24 Mar 2018], A strains had accounted for about 71 percent of flu cases in Pennsylvania in the 2017-2018 flu season, with B strains accounting for about 26 percent.

As of [Sat 24 Mar 2018], 207 people in Pennsylvania had died of flu-related causes during the flu season that began in late October [2017] and is usually over by May, with 15 of the deaths reported last week [week of 19 Mar 2918]. For the year, 6 of the flu-related deaths have involved children.

Symptoms of A and B strains are similar, typically involving fever, congestion, fatigue, and muscle soreness. Most people recover at home with rest, drinking plenty of fluids and using over-the-counter pain relievers.

To date, more research has focused on influenza A than on influenza B. Current opinion of influenza B remains influenced by early studies that concluded that influenza B posed less of a disease burden than influenza A. Furthermore, because of the ability of influenza A to cause severe pandemics, it is more frequently a topic of press coverage than influenza B, reinforcing the perception that influenza B does not pose a serious threat to public health. In contrast to the popular view that influenza B has minimal impact, there are indications that the impact of influenza B is substantial (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673513/).

Surveillance data from the United States and Europe suggest a potentially increasing burden of influenza B in recent years. This high variability in influenza B circulation may be attributable to variable population immunity and competition between the 2 co-circulating lineages of influenza B. Furthermore, influenza B-attributable primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalization rate in the United States was a substantial 81.4 per 100 000 -- midway between the primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalization rates for seasonal A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) at 55.9 and 99.0 per 100 000, respectively (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367555).

Available medical literature shows that influenza B can pose a significant burden to the global population. The comprehensiveness and quality of reporting of influenza B can be substantially improved. Additional data regarding the incidence, clinical burden, and economic impact of influenza B would augment our understanding of the disease and assist in vaccine development. - Mod.UBA]
