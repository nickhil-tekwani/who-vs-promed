In April, three soldiers died with symptoms of an hemorragic fever in a
non-endemic area of yellow fever in Esmeraldas province. Another 200
soldiers presented similar symptoms, of which 68 have been admitted to the
Military Hospital in Quito. All the soldiers had recently been in amazonic
area near the border with Peru.
As of June the cause of the disease has not been established. The first
studies in the Instituto Nacional de Higiene did not show evidence of
flavivirus infection, but yellow fever has not been discarded [as a
diagnosis? - Mod. pc].
There have not been similar cases in the population of the area.
Samples of the three died soldiers are being analyzed at CDC.
All of the soldiers were vaccinated against yellow fever.
Other hypothesis are:
Oropouche fever: Apparently people in Peru near the border with Ecuador
were affected, and all the soldiers came from this area.
Dengue fever: This is an endemic area for classic dengue fever.
I think that Dr Marcelo Aguilar <jproanio@uio.satnet.net> from the
Ministerio de Salud can provide more accurate information.

I am an epidemiologist who was born in Cuenca, Ecuador. Through this
exceptional line of communication I am always keeping track of what is
going on in Latin America, especially in Ecuador. As epidemiologist I
immediately start wondering if this outbreak is explained by special
weather conditions or other factors affecting mosquito population? Or if
similar conditions are maintained, is the Ecuadorian army continuously
exposed to similar risk? What is the baseline observation of cases in this
geographic area? Besides in the last couple of weeks we received the
notification that unidentified disease was responsible for several deaths
in the same Amazonic area and other surrounding provinces. I am not
suggesting a direct connection of these two outbreaks but it will be
important to rule out any common factor.
I deeply appreciate Ecuadorian researchers keeping us informed of this kind
of occurrences.
