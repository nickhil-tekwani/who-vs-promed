[1] Cholera - Congo DR (Kivu province)

A month-long water shortage in Goma has led to an outbreak of cholera. Poorer neighborhoods are suffering in this city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Cholera outbreaks regularly occur in Goma, capital of the DRC's Northern Kivu province. Yet, in the past few weeks the disease has spread rapidly, claiming over 50 lives. "Because of the shortage of clean water, we have to use the water from the lake for our daily drinking, cooking and washing. In our neighborhood, 3 children and 4 women have already succumbed to the disease," says Virginie Kahambu.

"Since the Rwandan refugee camps in 1994, where cholera was widespread, Lake Kivu has been a breeding ground for the cholera bacteria," says Dr Dominique Baabo, the provincial health inspector for North Kivu. "When there is a water shortage and people are forced to use the water from the lake, there is always a new cholera outbreak."

The current water shortage is said to be the result of the failure of the national water company [Regideso; Regie de distribution d'eau] to pay its electricity bill, which compelled national electricity company SNEL to cut its power supply. According to provincial Regideso director Deogratias Kizibisha Kabiona, the water shortage is caused by a failing pump.

Today, more than 300 million Africans lack access to clean water.

The Ministry of Health has announced an outbreak of cholera in some parts of the country. On behalf of the director general of the health service Dr Denise Lwamafa says that 280 cholera cases have been reported in the districts of Kasese, Mbale, Sironko, Bududa, and Buliisa.

Dr Lwamafa promises that the Ministry of Health is undertaking a number of measures to control the spread of cholera and the other water-related diseases ahead of the rainy seasons. He says that surveillance and epidemiological programs will continue in the affected and neighbouring districts to detect cases for early treatment. The National Medical Stores (NMS) has disbursed the necessary drugs to the affected districts in case more cases are reported.
