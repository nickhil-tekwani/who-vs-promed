Chronic wasting disease is devastating deer populations near the South Saskatchewan River Valley, with as many as 70% of male deer testing positive for the fatal nervous system disease.

"It's unfortunately gotten to a point we are seeing such high infection rates [that] we expect some impacts on the population," said Iga Stasiak, a wildlife health specialist with the Ministry of Environment.

CWD was 1st recorded in Saskatchewan in 1996 on a game farm, but has since moved into the wild deer, elk and moose populations, with wildfire-like infection rates in some areas.

The land near the South Saskatchewan River Valley and the town of Outlook, 93 kilometres [58 mi] southwest of Saskatoon, provides a prime habitat for deer and has become a breeding ground for CWD.

"This is a fatal disease in animals succumbing to the infection within typically 2 years. So this is particularly concerning."

CWD is spread through urine, feces and saliva, with disease proteins remaining infectious on the land for years and possibly decades after they are deposited.

"The environment has unfortunately gotten contaminated," Stasiak said.

CWD is a prion disease and in the same family as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), more commonly known as mad cow disease.

BSE devastated the British cattle industry in the 1980s and 1990s and is linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, a fatal prion disease creating holes in infected brains giving them a "sponge-like" appearance.

Stasiak said, unlike BSE, there is no evidence to show CWD is transmitted to people through eating infected animals.

However, it is fatal in deer, elk and moose, and there is a theoretical risk to humans, Stasiak said.

"We can't be 100% certain. That's why the recommendations are there to avoid eating animals known to be infected."

Hunters, conservation officers and butchers in the Outlook area are increasingly getting positive CWD test results back on animals showing no signs of being sick.

It's only later, in the end stages of CWD, when animals are visibly unwell, looking malnourished and acting disoriented, Stasiak said.

Darryl Sander, owner and operator of Sander's Meat Processing in Beechy, 188 kilometres [117 mi] southwest of Saskatoon, said even though there is no evidence showing CWD is transmitted to people, hunters are worried about eating deer meat.

"They're just asking me, 'What should I do? I just shot this deer, should I get it tested first? Do I process it and then get it tested? Do I take a chance and eat it?'" Sander said.

CWD testing takes about 6 weeks to complete, with government officials collecting animal heads that are taken to a provincial laboratory for examination.

In the meantime, hunters have often paid hundreds of dollars to have the animal cut and wrapped at an abattoir.

"It's going to cost you to process it, but it's up to you if you want to do that or not," Sander said.

Despite the wait for test results, conservation officer Ted Glass said testing is crucial to managing CWD.

"I think everyone, when they see a deer not behaving well, the answer comes back more and more often it's chronic wasting disease."

Glass, who is based out of Kindersley, about 148 kilometres [92 mi] straight west of Outlook, said he's seen too many deer with CWD to keep track over the years.

"Initially, the animal looks very normal, very natural, and then the signs come on awfully quick and you'll see signs of disorientation. They look malnourished. You can start seeing ribs and the spine. Their head will droop. And it becomes clear, very fast, there's something not quite right with the deer."

In addition to testing, Glass said hunters should avoid transporting carcasses, which can bring the disease to new areas.

Stasiak agreed and said the province is working on programs to manage CWD in deer.

One option is increasing hunting quotas on male deer, who are thought to have higher rates of infection than females because of their rutting behavior, which puts them in contact with infected feces and urine.

"The other thing which is quite important is avoiding baiting and feeding. We want to limit the contacts and try to reduce transmission in that way," Stasiak said.

[2] USA (Union County, Arkansas): deer

Chronic wasting disease has been found in a deer in southern Arkansas, near the Louisiana state line, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) reported Thursday [2 Dec 2021].

The deer was harvested in the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge in Union County, the commission said, and a sample was confirmed with the fatal disease which affects deer, elk, caribou and moose in 26 states nationwide.

There are no reported cases of CWD in humans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the agency recommends against eating infected meat.

The source of CWD found in the Arkansas deer is unknown as the nearest known positive case was 120 miles (193 kilometers) away in Issaquena County, Mississippi, and is more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) from the nearest known positive case in Arkansas, the commission said.

"With this positive case being so far from any previously known source, we've already begun working on ways to gather more samples from the surrounding area to determine the extent of the infection in this part of the state," said Cory Gray, chief of the AGFC's Research Division.

The Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission on Thursday [2 Dec 2021] declared an emergency ban on feeding and baiting in nearby Morehouse and Union parishes beginning Monday [6 Dec 2021]. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said it will increase surveillance for the disease in those parishes.

Chronic wasting disease is spread by contact with infected saliva, blood, urine, feces, food, water and soil.

Signs in the animals include weight loss, excessive salivation, teeth grinding, head tremors, excessive urination and thirst, lowering their heads and separating from their herds, according to the commission.

["CWD is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environment contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)" (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-chronic-wasting-disease). - Mod.TG
