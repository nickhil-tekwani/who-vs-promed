[1] Cholera - Haiti (UN update)

Haiti's cholera outbreak appears to be diminishing nationwide but the
death rate in rural areas remains alarmingly high, the United Nations
said Friday, 18 Feb 2011. The mixed picture comes from Haitian
government figures citing 231 070 reported cases and 4549 deaths since
the epidemic began in October 2010.

National mortality rates from cholera are down to 2 percent, from as
high as 9 percent earlier, but in some rural areas, more than 1 in 10
people who contract the disease die. In Haiti's Sud Est region, the
mortality rate hit 10.7 percent as of 9 Feb 2011, while in Nippes it
was 6.7 percent and in the Grande Anse region, 5.9 percent. The rate
should be under 1 percent, according to the WHO.

"It's there (in rural areas) that we absolutely have to strengthen our
efforts," said Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the UN humanitarian
coordination office. "For that we need money."

The UN also is concerned about the possible spread of the disease
during Haiti's upcoming Carnival season.

[3] Diarrhea, amoebic dysentery - Saudi Arabia (Makkah Province)

A number of people have been treated for dysentery following the 26
Jan 2011 floods in Jeddah, although the exact numbers are unknown.
Pharmacies have also reported a rise in the number of people asking
for diarrhea medication.

According to Sami Badawood, the city's director of health affairs, 161
people were admitted to hospital following the floods for a variety of
reasons. However, complaints include not only dysentery, but also
panic and asthma attacks triggered by the floods.

A case of dysentery serious enough to require hospitalization was that
of a 45-year-old Filipino who was rushed to hospital on Sunday
evening, 6 Feb 2011, suffering from acute amoebic dysentery. He fell
ill after consuming tap water that turned out to have been
contaminated when the sewage-filled floodwaters entered the
underground water tank where he lives.

The man's boss, who is manager of a major Jeddah interior decoration
company, said that a quarter of his workforce had come down with
dysentery, although not all at the same time. He added that this man
was the worst case.

This illness is a warning to other Jeddah residents not to drink tap
water. On Sat 5 Feb 2011, they were advised by Badawood not to do so.
He said that 70 percent of water in storage tanks had been
contaminated by the floods and people should drink only bottled water
until further notice. On Sun 6 Feb 2011, city doctors warned that the
symptoms of diseases caught from contaminated water might not manifest
for several months.

Papua New Guinea's top health official says nearly 500 people have
died from the country's prolonged cholera outbreak. The health
secretary, Dr Clement Malau, has told the newspaper, The National,
that 483 people have died while more than 10 000 have been diagnosed
with cholera since the 1st outbreak in August 2009 in Morobe Province.

So far, 7 regions, including the capital Port Moresby, have been
affected by cholera with Dr Malau saying Western Province was the
worst hit with 300 deaths.

[5] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (Morobe)

Post-Courier report [edited]
<http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2011/January/01-31-12.htm>


In Papua New Guinea, cholera has raised its ugly head once more in
Morobe Province, with 19 cases reported to the health authorities in
the province since last Sun 23 Jan 2011. A lone case was reported from
Mandok Island in Siassi district while 18 cases were reported in Lae
city.

Morobe Province's health adviser and chairman of the cholera task
force, Dr Likei Theo said 12 patients with signs of cholera were
admitted to the cholera treatment centre at Angau Memorial Hospital
with no deaths. Dr Theo said the cases are not confined to one
specific location but all over the city and most of these areas are
settlements. He named the areas in which the cases were reported as
East Taraka, Uniblock, Situm, Nawae Block, Salamander Tais, 12 Mile,
Bumayong, Tanam, 6 Mile, 1 Mile, Talair Compound, and 2nd street.

He said that Morobe Province was in dry season now and the lack of
access to clean drinking water in the settlement areas and the return
of cooked food being sold in open-air markets and roadsides posed a
very high risk. He said poor personal and environmental hygiene was
also contributing to cholera re-emerging.

He warned all city residents and people in Morobe Province that
cholera has never left the province. He said it was now one of the
illnesses we had to contend with in our daily lives from now on.

"Cholera is here to stay. No matter what the situation is, people must
always seek advice at any health centers near them even when having
general diarrhea," said Dr Theo.

As a consequence of "La Nina", the southern part of Africa has had an
exceptional amount of rainfall since December 2010, which has led to
heavy flooding.

In South Africa, approximately 20 000 people throughout 9 South
African provinces have been heavily affected, with a total of 70
deaths already. The floods damage infrastructure and the harvests, and
increase the risk of illnesses that are borne by the contaminated
water. For example, there are reports of cholera in the province of
Limpopo. Many of the affected people are living in temporary
settlements where basic facilities are either totally missing or
scarcely available. The most vulnerable groups need long-term aid for
health care, hygiene and clean water.

The Regional Health Directorate of Ghana Health Service (GHS) on Fri
11 Feb 2011, cautioned residents to observe personal hygiene and
adhere to advice provided by health professionals as the number of
deaths from the cholera outbreak in Accra rose to 6.

Speaking to the GNA in Accra, the deputy regional director of public
health, Dr Edward Antwi, said so far 505 cases had been recorded. The
Health Directorate has also expressed worry at the turn of events due
to the increase in the number of cases after the 1st case was reported
on 10 Jan 2011 and reiterated its warning to residents to take
precautionary measures to avoid contamination.

[9] Cholera - Cote d'Ivoire (Lagunes)

<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=91784>


Health experts and residents say poor hygiene exacerbated by growing
piles of rubbish is largely to blame for a dry-season cholera outbreak
in Cote d'Ivoire's main city of Abidjan, which has killed 8 people of
61 infected.

The diarrhoeal disease, contracted through contaminated food or water,
generally occurs during the rainy season when flooding can contaminate
water sources, according to the WHO. But outbreaks can also occur in
the dry season, WHO says.

The initial case, in Abidjan's Adjame District (a poor neighborhood
that has seen severe post-election violence in recent weeks), was
registered in mid-January 2011; the major rains ended in November
2010. Cholera has also affected the district of Williamsville.

"Across this region [West Africa] there are pockets of poverty where
hygiene is poor and we see occasional outbreaks," Mamadou D Ball, WHO
representative in Cote d'Ivoire, told IRIN. "The cholera bacterium is
always present."

Residents of Ette community in Kogi Local Government Area of Kogi
State say they have lost 10 persons to a cholera epidemic since the
weekend [29-30 Jan 2011]. But the member representing Kogi/Kotonkarfe
Constituency in the state House of Assembly, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ndako,
told our correspondent yesterday, 2 Feb 2011, in a telephone interview
that he could only confirm 3 deaths.

The lawmaker, who added that 23 persons were also currently afflicted
with the disease in the area, said the epidemic had already spread to
several other communities like Edekakpo, Edegaki, Koton-Karfe, Ikumo,
and Edeha. He expressed concern that if urgent steps were not taken,
more people would be affected.
