Tularemia - USA (Utah, Wyoming): alert 20010729.1484
Date: 29 Jul 2001
From: Scott Seys <saseys@state.wy.us>

CHEYENNE - The diagnosis of a rare bacterial illness known as
tularemia in 2 Sweetwater County residents on 25 Jul 2001 has
prompted Wyoming Department of Health officials to issue a warning
regarding the disease.
Dr. Karl Musgrave, state epidemiologist for the Wyoming Department
of Health, said an unusual aspect of the 2 cases is that they both had
experienced recent horsefly or deer fly bites. "We are concerned there
may be an infected animal population in the county acting as a
reservoir source of tularemia for insects," he said.
Tularemia -- also known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever" -- is an
infectious disease in ticks and rabbits caused by a bacterium
(_Francisella tularensis_). There are 2 common ways humans contract
tularemia, including the bite of an infected tick, deer fly, or mosquito,
and when broken skin comes into contact with an infected rabbit
carcass. Although uncommon, people also may contract tularemia by
inhaling contaminated dust or by ingesting contaminated meats or
water. Human-to-human transmission of tularemia is uncommon.
Deputy state epidemiologist Scott Seys said 2 cases from the same
county reported within a few days of each other is unusual, as there
have only been 5 cases of tularemia reported in Wyoming since 1995.
Individuals who become ill after an insect bite or after handling a
rabbit or squirrel should contact their physician said. Dr. Brent
Sherard, state health officer. "Patients will typically develop symptoms
of tularemia between 2 and 10 days after exposure to the bacteria," he
said. "Those who acquire the disease through the bite of an infected
tick or from contact with infected animals will develop an ulcer at the
site of infection and experience a swelling of lymph nodes. Severe
fever and flu-like symptoms may accompany the ulcer or lesion."
Dr. Sherard said patients with the less common form of tularemia
which occurs mainly after inhalation of bacteria typically experience a
fever alone or in combination with a pneumonia-like illness. Those
who ingest the bacteria may develop intestinal pain and experience
diarrhea and vomiting.
The Wyoming Department of Health recommends that individuals take
the following precautions to reduce the risk of tularemia infection:
- Rubber gloves should be worn when skinning animals, especially
rabbits;
- Wild rabbit meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating;
- People should try to avoid bites from flies and ticks;
- People should avoid bathing, swimming, or working in untreated
water; and
- People should avoid handling squirrels, rabbits, or other animals that
appear sick and call the local animal control office or the Wyoming
Game and Fish Department.
