The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation is
leading the investigation into bird deaths in the town of Esperance on the
south coast of Western Australia.
The number of confirmed deaths is 400 to 500. Estimates of total deaths,
based on extrapolation, range up to 4000 to 5000. The majority of deaths
were reported during mid December 2006, and further reports of dead and
dying birds have tapered off since that time. The Western Australian
Department of Agriculture and Food's Animal Health Laboratory (AHL) in
Perth is providing laboratory and diagnostic support to the investigation.
Dead birds sent to the AHL were in good body condition, but very little
content was present in the upper gastrointestinal tract. No macroscopic
lesions have been detected. All PCR results for avian influenza and West
Nile virus have been negative. Subtle and non-specific histological changes
were present in the liver of some birds. There is no histological evidence
of inflammatory change in the brain or visceral tissues that might suggest
an infectious condition. Brain and other tissues are being tested for
organophosphates and organochlorines. At this stage, a non-infectious cause
is suspected, and there is no evidence to suggest that the birds died from
an exotic disease.
The Department of Environment and Conservation is also investigating the
reported death of about 200 tree martins and other birds in the town of
Narembeen, 300 km southeast of Perth, in early January 2007. The deaths
were detected some days after severe storms in the area. None of the tree
martins was suitable for necropsy. A necropsy on 2 dead crows found in the
townsite found empty gastrointestinal tracts.
The AHL is testing samples to exclude exotic disease, including AI and WNV.
The course and nature of the bird deaths in Narembeen indicate that the
deaths are unrelated to the deaths in Esperance.
Indications to date are that the deaths in Narembeen are linked to the
effects of the storms and were not due to an infectious or chemical source.
