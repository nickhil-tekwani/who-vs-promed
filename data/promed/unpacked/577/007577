UK: probable Lassa fever in traveller returning from West Africa
----------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests performed on Tue 14 Sep 2004 at the Health Protection
Agency (HPA), Colindale, indicated Lassa fever virus infection in a patient
who has returned to the United Kingdom (UK) from West Africa. Confirmatory
tests are in progress, together with virus isolation.
The patient had travelled in west Africa (Ivory Coast and Chad) for a month
before returning to the UK on Thu 9 Sep 2004. He became unwell the next day
with fever, and attended his local Accident and Emergency Department 2 days
later. He was admitted in the early morning of 13 Sep 2004 and when the
diagnosis was suspected to be Lassa fever, he was transferred to
medium-secure facilities. After initial tests suggested Lassa fever, he was
started on ribavirin treatment and transferred to high-security infectious
disease facilities. He remained well with a low-grade fever and remained
haemodynamically stable. He was discharged from hospital after tests were
persistently negative and he had been apyrexial for 3 days.
Contacts are being followed up for 21 days, although all are considered to
be low risk. Staff who cared for the patient, handled his specimens or
otherwise had contact, visitors of the patient, and other community
contacts are being monitored through recording daily temperatures,
following guidance in the 1996 memorandum (1). Possible non-hospital
contacts have been assessed as low risk, and are self-monitoring their
temperature. As he was well and asymptomatic at the time of his travel, and
Lassa fever patients are thought not to be infectious until symptomatic, no
travel contacts are being followed up. Only 6 cases of Lassa fever have
been imported into the UK since 1976.
Lassa fever background
----------------------
Lassa fever is a zoonosis, an infection acquired from _Mastomys
natalensis_, the multimammate rat. It is endemic in west Africa. The risk
of further transmission to humans of Lassa fever in the UK from imported
cases is extremely low, and the natural reservoir is not found in the UK.
Risk is confined to those who have had direct physical contact with body
fluids from the patient during the infectious period. There have been no
recorded transmissions by such a route in the UK, including 74 health care
worker contacts followed up by serology after the case in 2000 (2). There
is no risk to the general public including travelling companions. A review
of casual contacts that took place in the 1960/70s found no transmission
among airline passengers travelling with confirmed Lassa cases (3).
