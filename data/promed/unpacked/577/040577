In response to ProMED posting "ANTHRAX, HUMAN - UNITED KINGDOM (07): (ENGLAND) FATAL", for clarification we can confirm that the wording used in the HPA press statement is a standard phrase and doesn't mean there was any uncertainty about the information given.

We can also confirm that the case in Wales is separate and this was confirmed by Public Health Wales on Fri 7 Sep 2012.

My understanding is that this is the 2nd addict from Blackpool to have died of anthrax. The Welsh patient is still alive as far as I know.

[Pose a question and folk present the answer. In a severely economically challenged city with casinos and unemployment it is to be expected that there are drug addicts who it seems, unfortunately, are unaware of the need to seek medical help as soon as one develops a fever and without any delays. In the "old days" Blackpool was a much favoured place for working folk in the Midlands to go to for fun with music halls, restaurants & bars, dance halls, lots of celebrities, nationally known illuminations, beach front. Those days are long past.

One more news report but it adds little:

And thanks to Mandy and Bob for satisfying the academic curiosity of this questioning moderator. - Mod.MHJ
