Regarding the Australian with meliodosis from the tsunami in Sri Lanka
mentioned in the previous posting [reference below], I am able to confirm
that we have received a positive _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ swab result
from a leg wound of a Brisbane (Australia) man. He was holidaying in Sri
Lanka at the time, and was swept inland a considerable distance by the
tsunami, with a sustained leg injury resulting in abscess formation.
The pathology report indicated "light growth", with resistance to
amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. However, the
reporting pathologist indicated that sensitivity testing may be unreliable
with slow-growing organisms such as the one in question.

We in Helsinki University Central Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB, Finland)
know of 3 tsunami-related _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ isolates. One we
found ourselves and the other 2 we received for confirmation from other
Finnish hospitals. _B. pseudomallei_ was confirmed by sequence analysis of
16sRNA.
Our own isolate was a pure but sparse growth from a surgically treated
Achilles tendon. The patient was from Peijas Hospital, Vantaa (a town in
the metropolitan Helsinki area), and to my knowledge had no symptoms
characteristic of melioidosis. The bacterium was found only in the first
sample after the patient's return 31 Dec 2004 from Asia.
The 2 other patients were diagnosed with pneumonia. One was from Turku (a
city on the Southwest coast) and _B. pseudomallei_ was isolated from the
patient's blood in Turku University Hospital. The other finding was from a
wound treated in Keski-Suomen Keskussairaala (a hospital in Central
Finland). Unfortunately this is all I know about the cases at the moment.

[ProMED thanks Drs. Jarvinen and Puohiniemi for their personal reports of
_B. pseudomallei_ infections in persons returning from tsunami-affected
areas. - Mod.LL]
[In the 2nd posting on this (see ProMED-mail Melioidosis, tsunami-related
(02): Thailand RFI 20050202.0356), Dr. David Dance stated: "However, the
island of Phuket is not an area of high incidence under normal
circumstances, and only a handful of cases in the world literature are
known to have been acquired in many of the other areas affected by the
tsunami, such as Sri Lanka or Indonesia. It may be that this episode will
also point to areas where melioidosis is currently under-recognized." The
above case report from Dr. Jarvinen mentions the patient had been in Sri
Lanka, one of the other locations where not many reports of melioidosis
have been reported. The geographic origin of infection for the case
reports presented by Dr. Puohiniemi were not mentioned/known at the time of
the report, but would be of interest in keeping with Dr. Dance's comments.
