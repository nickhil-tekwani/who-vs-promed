From: Gerardo Grezzi <101776.3337@compuserve.com>
I read Dr. Gardner's article about the infectious bursal disease in
penguins and I found it very interesting. I strongly suggest for anybody
involved in the prevention and control of infectious disease to visit Antec
International web page at: http://www.antecint.com
It is really worth looking at all the information posted there.
[For our readers convenience, here is a repeat of the website addresses
