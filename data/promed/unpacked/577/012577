The 1st positive result of _Xylella fastidiosa_ in Portugal, already confirmed by the French Reference Laboratory (ANSES), was communicated to the DGAV (General Directorate of Food and Veterinary Sciences). The plants were found in an ornamental bed of the genus _Lavandula dentata_ (French lavender) in a zoo in Porto district during the national xylella monitoring programme and showed no symptoms of disease.

Work will continue to survey and collect samples of host plants within a radius of 100 metres (Infected Zone), as well as surveying plant species susceptible to the agent within a radius of 5 km (Buffer Zone). Information on the strain of the bacteria is still being awaited.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. A second species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, has recently been reported as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see ProMED-mail post 20181022.6105629).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In Europe, it was first reported in olives from Italy in 2013 (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497). The subsequent detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals, suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production and the pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Three subspecies have been formally accepted for Xf: _fastidiosa_ (grapevine strain, Pierce's disease), _pauca_ and _multiplex_, but additional ones have been proposed. It appears that subspecies vary in host range, but more research is needed on susceptibility of different plant hosts to the different Xf subspecies, and multiple Xf subspecies have been found to be able to infect the same host species (e.g. both _pauca_ and _multiplex_ can affect olives). The initial European detection in olives was of ssp. _pauca_ in southern Italy, but all 3 ssp. have since been found in different European areas in a range of hosts. A recent detection of _multiplex_, previously reported in Europe only from France and Spain, from northern Italy (see links below) illustrates the urgent need for more information on distribution, epidemiology and the risks to different crops of Xf or its subspecies.
