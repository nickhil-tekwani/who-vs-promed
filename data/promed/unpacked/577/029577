Dengue outbreak in Kaohsiung
----------------------------
The dengue outbreak in Kaohsiung continues to worsen. Since the 1st
autochthonous dengue case was reported on 6 Jul 2006 in the Qienzeng
district of this city, there have been 28 reported cases. Among these, 25
cases are from Qienzeng district and 3 from Qianjin district. The municipal
bureau of diseases prevention and control points out that among the 18 Lis
tested in the 2 prevalent districts [a Li is a demographic unit for
household management under a district within a city - Mod.TY], the
_Aedes_-positive ovitrap indices ranged from 75 per cent in Qienzeng and 50
per cent in Qienjin. This means that the area is still in a vulnerable
situation for dengue infections.

Everything seems to indicate that that there were no carnivals in Santiago
de Cuba this year [2006] because of an epidemic of hemorrhagic dengue
nearly similar to the one which occurred in 1981.
As for dengue [cases], in the Hospital Clinico Quirurgico de la Carretera
del Caney between 18 and 20 rooms were filled with cases, and various
children have been admitted in the South Children's [Hospital], better
known as the Colonia Espanola. A public health official commented that
there have been no reports of deaths, but in these cases, the death
certificates are issued at the endpoint of this disease. Operations and
admissions [in the hospital] have been suspended except for extreme
emergencies, such as those for consultations by specialists for patients
sent from other hospitals.
Health authorities are focusing sanitary measures throughout the city.
Orders were give more than 15 days ago that all the trash that has
accumulated in patios be taken to the street, although trash collection has
not yet begun.

[This is a report from a dissident group's news release and is not official
information from the Cuban Ministry of Health. ProMED-mail requests
information from the Cuban Ministry of Health about specific numbers of
cases over time and the dengue virus serotypes that are involved. A map of

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death.
The clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop shock
syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older
children and adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the
classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe
headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C, possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena.
In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever
subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate
after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state
of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy.
Treatment: there is no specific treatment for dengue fever. However,
careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently
saves the lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive
therapy, mortality may be reduced to less than one per cent. Maintenance of
the circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
