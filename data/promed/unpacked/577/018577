3 sheep on farm near Dusseldorf, North Rhein Westfalia, imported into
Germany from the United Kingdom (UK) found to have a low level Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD) antibodies. 2000 sheep imported from the UK have beeen
destroyed. The UK CVO says the antibodies are probably not significant.
More outbreaks [are expected in [the UK - probably in Wales and SW of
country where many herds are under investigation.

Outbreaks 19-22 involve sheep at a farm in Llangowan, Herefordshire; a farm
at Paincastle near Hay on Wye, Powys, Wales; a farm at Felindre near
Newtown, Powys; an abattoir at Great Harwood, near Preston, Lancashire. The
cases are probably related to sheep marketing movements prior to movement ban.
Also, 30 000 sheep have been destroyed in France
Outbreaks 23-24 have been confirmed on sheep farm in Stonesby, near Melton
Mowbray, Leicestershire and at another farm in Highampton, Devon.
Outbreaks 25-26 confirmed: farm in Essex, farm in Warwickshire
Outbreak in Co. Armagh, N. Ireland is strongly suspected. 200 sheep were
imported from the UK market, only 20 have been traced. There are concerns
animals may have been moved into the Republic of Ireland. 1300 sheep were
destroyed there already which had been imported from Devon.

Vaccination dilemma
-------------------
The government is not now ruling out a vaccination program for Foot and
Mouth Disease. The advice of its veterinary chief is still against
vaccination. Agriculture minister in the Lords Hayman explained, "The use
of the vaccine means you compromise fatally your 'disease free' status,
because it is impossible to distinguish between animals having antibodies
because of vaccination and animals having antibodies because of disease.
And therefore there are enormous trade ramifications."

Thousands of cattle are being burnt at farms across the country. Desperate
farmers are inundating a helpline as fears about the impact of Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD) grow. Experts are afraid this latest farming crisis
could be the last straw for many, leading to an even higher suicide rate in
the farming community.
Suicide rates are high, with 79 farm owners and managers, horticulturists
and farm workers in England and Wales killing themselves in 1999. The
helpline had received a number of calls from farmer's wives worried about
the mental health of their sons and husbands.

The search for the source of the Foot-and Mouth Disease-epidemic which is
paralyzing Britain has switched to a row of Chinese restaurants in
Newcastle and a number of schools located around the city. The Scotsman can
reveal some of the waste food which was turned into pigswill, and used by
the 2 farms in Northumbria believed to be at the center of the outbreak,
was collected from up to 10 Chinese restaurants in Stowell Street, in
Newcastle's China Town.
Inspectors from the Ministry of Agriculture contacted farmer Bobby Waugh
yesterday to demand a list of suppliers of the waste food he collected to
feed to his pigs at his farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland. Mr
Waugh and his immediate farming neighbor, Jimmy Brown, jointly turn waste
food, collected in Newcastle, into pigswill at a shared processing plant
located on Mr Brown's farm. All animals at both farms have now been
destroyed, even though FMD has only been confirmed on the farm run by Mr
Waugh and his brother Ronnie. It has been identified as the original source
of the outbreak.
Mr Brown is known as one of the largest collectors of waste food for
pigswill in Newcastle, with most being picked up free from the city's
Chinese community. Mr Waugh also collects waste food from a number of
schools in Sunderland and Gateshead and is supplied by one hotel, which he
refused to name yesterday. It is thought any of these suppliers could be a
source of the disease, but it is believed there is a high probability
people who work in Chinese restaurants may have traveled abroad recently.
The disease does not affect humans, but can be carried across borders on
their hands, feet and clothing.
Mr Waugh said he and his neighbor were licensed to create pigswill on Mr
Brown's premises. "We boil the waste food at 93 degrees [C for 4 hours.
Those are the rules and everything is sterilized. The tanks are tested
every 3 months by the ministry to check they are working properly." He said
he did not believe the outbreak had started in pigswill. "This all started
because somebody claimed the food came from the airport. But that's wrong.
It is illegal to collect swill from ports or airports."
Mr Brown could not be contacted for comment yesterday. His wife, however,
insisted batches of pigswill were kept separate. "We have had the tests
back now," she added. "And foot-and-mouth wasn't confirmed. It could have
been incubating in the animals. You don't know that."
Inspectors from Newcastle City Council were yesterday visiting Chinese
restaurants in Stowell Street and advising their owners to find new
arrangements for disposing of waste food. The practice of having food
collected by pig farmers is popular because it is free of charge and saves
payments having to be made to commercial waste collectors.
Newcastle International Airport yesterday confirmed all their waste food
does not re-enter the food chain and is taken away for destruction by
licensed contractors.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the supply of
pigswill was being looked into. "It is one of a number of lines we're
pursuing. We have asked local authorities to investigate on our behalf."

This devastating situation affects not only animals, but the livelihood of
farmers and of a nation. The helplessness of seeing your animals, your very
livelihood, slaughtered and no way to pay the bills and support a family is
devastating to the farmers; even to the nation as they continue to face the
crisis of FMD, higher food prices and, potentially, food shortages within
the country. - Mod.TG
