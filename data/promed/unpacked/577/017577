The health department has issued an alert in Madhya Pradesh regarding scrub typhus after a few cases were reported from some districts. At present, the alert has been sounded for 3 districts -- Jabalpur, Satna, and Khargone.

Dr Himanshu Jaiswar, deputy director health, said, "An alert has been issued for scrub typhus in the state. Districts from Vindhya, Bundelkhand, and other regions have reported a few cases and so the health department is not taking any chances and has issued an alert." The Regional Director of Jabalpur division, Dr Sanjay Mishra issued an alert regarding scrub typhus directing the health officials to spread public awareness related to the disease. The risk of scrub typhus continues to haunt Satna, Jabalpur, and Mandsaur as last year [2021] the maximum number of patients of the disease were reported from these districts.

To prevent the growth of scrub typhus, the Directorate of Medical and Health Department has decided to run a research project in these 3 districts with help of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhopal.

Scrub typhus spreads to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). According to doctors, symptoms of scrub typhus start developing after 6-21 days of the [tick] bite. The common symptoms of scrub typhus include high fever, chills, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash, according to doctors. The skin also starts turning black after the worm bite and soon blisters develop.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, but we are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis was made. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Madhya Pradesh (pop., about 72.6 million residents in 2011) is a state in central India, bordering the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest; its capital is Bhopal, with Jabalpur, Satna being some other major cities (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh). Madhya Pradesh is divided into 52 districts: Khargone District is located in southwest of the state, Satna District is located in the northeast of the state, and Jabalpur is located in central Madhya Pradesh.
