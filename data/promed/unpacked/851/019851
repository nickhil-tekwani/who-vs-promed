A 6th prawn farm south of the Logan River has been infected with the virus that causes white spot disease.

Prawn farmers from the area met on Thursday [2 Feb 2017] to work out the way forward for the industry, which has been promised compensation from the federal government.

Biosecurity Queensland said on Friday [27 Jan 2017] positive test results had been recorded at the farm. Chief Biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson said all of the prawn stock from the farm was almost completely harvested, so only the water in the ponds was required to be treated. "Throughout this response, we have constantly tested and retested to confirm all results and track the progress of the disease on infected farms," he said. "To date, more than 50 000 tests have been conducted.

"There are 8 farms in the affected area. Currently, 6 are now known to have had the virus, one remains free of the virus, and the other has had no stock in its ponds since before this response began. Today [2 Feb 2017], we will begin the gradual process of draining, drying out and clearing sediment from the farms that have already been decontaminated. This is expected to take a number of months. It is our intention to have all of the affected farms operating again towards the end of the year."

Dr Thompson said Biosecurity Queensland had also tested more than 8000 samples of wild-caught crustaceans from local waterways. "This week, a single prawn taken from the Logan River has tested positive for the virus that causes WSD," he said. "This is only the 2nd time the virus has been found in prawns in the river adjacent to the aquaculture farms at Alberton following a positive detection in early December 2016. Given there have only been such a small number of positive detections, we are still working to understand if the virus is established in local waterways."

Dr Thompson said Biosecurity Queensland met with commercial fishers and a recreational fishing representative to discuss managing white spot disease under a range of possible future scenarios. "Yesterday [1 Feb 2017], we also met with the prawn farmers impacted by this disease incident, along with key industry members and the white spot disease advisory panel. The expert advisory panel presented their recommendations for future white spot disease management options. The panel members were selected for their expertise in aquatic animal health and disease management, biosecurity and white spot disease. Their role is to provide an objective assessment of the options available and, using their extensive experience, provide critical advice to ensure we achieve the best possible outcome. It is crucial that all aquaculture operators, commercial and recreational fishers and other waterway users continue to report any unusual signs in prawns (including bait) and other crustaceans. Early detection provides a better chance of being able to contain and eradicate this serious disease."

[White spot viral disease (WSVD) has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The virus was 1st detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries.

The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil last year (2016). This episode, detected in December 2017, represents the 1st confirmed case of WSVD in an aquaculture center in Australia.

Acutely affected shrimp are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic, and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name white spot disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
