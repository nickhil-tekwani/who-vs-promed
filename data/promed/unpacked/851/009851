Pertussis (whooping cough) cases are on the rise across the state, with almost 6 times as many cases in the first 11 weeks of 2012 as the same time period in 2011.
State health officials have reports of 463 cases through 17 Mar 2012, compared with 82 by this time in 2011.

Pertussis cases are on the rise in Benton and Franklin counties, which have seen 19 cases so far in 2012. Dr. Amy Person, health officer for Benton and Franklin counties, said most of the reported Tri-City cases have been schoolchildren or people around them. A small outbreak was reported in some Kennewick schools in February, and Person said she has heard some recent reports of pertussis in Pasco schools.

Person said the increased number of cases in Benton and Franklin counties isn't abnormal, particularly as nearby counties were reporting outbreaks in late 2010.

Grant County experienced 57 cases, including one infant death, during a 16-month outbreak that started in late 2010. included one infant death. In the previous five years, Grant County reported one to four cases per year.

Benton County was seeing very few cases during Grant County's outbreak, but now is seeing activity while Grant County has had no reported cases in 2012.

"I think it ended up just being our time," Person said. "It ends up being everybody's time at some point."

Flathead City-County Health Department officials have confirmed a case of pertussis (whooping cough) in a Whitefish Middle School student, according to a Friday news release from the department. Health department and school staff “are working diligently to contain the spread of illness,” according to the release.

The health department contacted parents of students at risk for contracting the illness and canceled a band festival scheduled to take place at the middle school. To prevent secondary cases, household and close contacts, including classmates, need to be treated with medication at the same time as the ill people.

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA continue to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _B. pertussis_ clones are being selected, which we are no longer as well protected against with the current vaccines. - Mod.
