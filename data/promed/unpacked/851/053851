Another elephant has been found dead of cyanide poisoning in north western Zimbabwe, 2 months after around 60 elephants were killed in the area, it was reported on Sun [17 Jan 2016]. According to the state-controlled Sunday Mail, the decomposing body of the elephant was found last week [week of 11 Jan 2016] in Sikumi Forest next to Hwange National Park, where poachers have poisoned dozens of elephants since September [2015].

The elephant had been dead for around 10 days. Poachers had not had time to remove the elephants' tusks, according to the report.

An official from the Forestry Commission, Armstrong Tembo, told the newspaper: "On Tuesday last week [12 Jan 2016] our workers recovered the carcass of an elephant that was decomposing. The ivory was also recovered. The cause of the death is a mixture of salt and cyanide."

Poachers have commonly poisoned waterholes with cyanide, a fast-acting poison, or they have poisoned salt-licks near waterholes. There was a hiatus in the poisonings in Hwange over November and December [2015].

One possible contributing factor may be the lack of rain, which has seen elephant numbers reduced in parts of the park as the animals move away to look for water and food. The Bhejane Trust, a conservation group that operates in the vast national park, said in its latest report this week: "With very few elephants in the Sinamatella area still, we have not had to worry much about any repeat of the cyanide killings."

In October [2015], 22 elephants were poached in a single poisoning incident in Sinamatella, in the north of the park. The authorities believe at least 2 gangs were involved in the attacks. At least 7 people have been reportedly arrested so far, though it is far from certain that the ringleaders have been caught.

The official Herald newspaper reported last week [week of 11 Jan 2016] that a man had been arrested at a logistics company in Bulawayo after he was found with more than a tonne of cyanide -- and no licence for it -- in his warehouse. Bulawayo is on the main road between the Zimbabwean capital Harare and Hwange National Park.

This area has been plagued by poachers using cyanide to kill the elephants for their ivory. It is unlikely that any cyanide would have remained in the carcass after the animal had been dead for 10 days. Therefore the statement in the article is probably based on the fact that poachers in this area have previously used cyanide.

At one point, at least a year ago, it was suggested that park rangers use cameras and drones with cameras to watch the elephants and to document who in the area is poisoning them and/or their 'mineral holes' or their watering area. It is lamentable that these poachers have not been apprehended and the horrible act stopped.

Cyanide can come as either a gas, as in hydrogen cyanide, or as a solid, in the form of potassium cyanide and/or sodium cyanide. As a solid crystalline form, it may well have been put out as some kind of bait for the elephants. Once cyanide is in the system, the cells are unable to use oxygen, because cellular respiration is blocked through the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase system and inhibition of the enzyme.

If cyanide was put out as a crystalline bait, then the perpetrators might have expected crystalline cyanide salts to work faster because of the acid in the stomach. These animals would likely have had difficulty breathing, perhaps causing panic, and then cardiac arrest. This would have been a painful death for these elephants.

Elephants are exceptionally intelligent, family oriented animals. They are very human-like in their emotions and thought processes. This is truly a heinous crime. The poachers are likely to have been shrewd observers of animal behavior.

Elephants need a relatively large amount of sodium in their diet. The Journal of Mammalogy indicates that they tend to be somewhat deficient in sodium. As a consequence, they tend to seek out salty soil and consume it.

Many elephant and mammal salt licks are areas within the ground that are high in sodium. An early salt lick may be seen at http://www.lastrefuge.co.uk/php/show-images-all-big.php?id=AW03538. However, these salt licks do not remain flat. After a time, they resemble a hole which can hold water, as seen at http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X1100314X-gr2.jpg.

According to Holdo RM, Dudley JP, and McDowell LR (Geophagy in the African elephant in relation to availability of dietary sodium. Journal of Mammalogy 2002; 83(3): 652-64, http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1644/1545-1542(2002)083%3C0652%3AGITAEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2):

"We studied the use of mineral licks by African elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) during the dry season in a Kalahari-sand habitat in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low Na+ [sodium] levels in browse and natural water supplies. Plant, water, and soil macrominerals were measured to evaluate mineral availability for elephants during the dry season. Elephant behavior was monitored at licks to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. Female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. We found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-Kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in Kalahari-sand habitats."

But according to Young CA and Jordan TS (Cyanide remediation: current and past technologies. Proc. 10th Annual Conf. on Hazardous Waste Research, Kansas State University 1995, http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Cyanide/upload/CN_remediation_young.pdf, page 109):

"Soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (FeTiO3), hematite (Fe2O3), bauxite [AlO.OH/Al(OH)3], and pyrite (FeS2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. Depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. Cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations."

With bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. It is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. However, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. The rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.

While some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. However, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. This would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.

Additional information is available from Young and Jordan's document.

Perhaps if lucky, at least some of the cyanide in the salt licks will be bound and neutralized by the calcrete clays, which are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix of the natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. - Mod.TG]
