[1] Absence of fever

Many people suffering from swine influenza [A (H1N1)], even those who are
severely ill, do not have fever, an odd feature of the new virus that could
increase the difficulty of controlling the epidemic, said a leading
American infectious disease expert who examined cases in Mexico last week.

Fever is a hallmark of influenza, often rising abruptly to 104 degrees F
[40 degrees C] at the onset of illness. Because many infectious disease
experts consider fever the most important sign of the disease, the presence
of fever is a critical part of screening patients.

But about a 3rd of the patients at 2 hospitals in Mexico City where the
American expert, Dr Richard P Wenzel, consulted for 4 days last week had no
fever when screened, he said. It surprised me and my Mexican colleagues,
because the textbooks say that in an influenza outbreak, the predictive
value of fever and cough is 90 per cent, Dr Wenzel said by telephone from
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, where he is chairman of the
department of internal medicine.

While many people with severe cases went on to develop fever after they
were admitted, about half of the milder cases did not; nearly all patients
had coughing and malaise, Dr Wenzel said. Also, about 12 per cent of
patients at the 2 Mexican hospitals had severe diarrhea in addition to
respiratory symptoms like coughing and breathing difficulty, said Dr
Wenzel, who is also a former president of the International Society for
Infectious Diseases. He said many such patients had 6 bowel movements a day
for 3 days. Dr Wenzel said he had urged his Mexican colleagues to test the
stools for the presence of the swine virus, named A(H1N1). If the A(H1N1)
virus goes from person to person and there is virus in the stool, infection
control will be much more difficult, particularly if it spreads in poor
countries, he said. The doctor said he had also urged his Mexican
colleagues to perform tests to determine whether some people without
symptoms still carried the virus.

He also said he had examined patients and data at the invitation of Dr.
Samuel Ponce de Len, who directs the Mexico national vaccination program.
Dr Wenzel said that an unusual feature of the Mexican epidemic, which
complicates the understanding of it, was that in recent months, 5 different
influenza viruses have been circulating in Mexico simultaneously. Pneumonia
rates at one of the hospitals Dr Wenzel visited, the National Institute for
Respiratory Diseases, reached 120 per week recently compared with 20 per
week during the past 2 years, suggesting a possible relation to the swine
flu. The pneumonias that the flu patients developed did not resemble the
staphylococcal lung infections that were believed to be a common
complication in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, Dr Wenzel said.

He said the 2 Mexican hospitals were well prepared for an outbreak of
respiratory disease. Mexican doctors activated a program to allay anxiety
among staff members, offering the staff information, a hotline,
psychological support, and medical examinations. "This aspect of epidemic
response is not well appreciated in the United States in my estimation, yet
is critical for success," Dr Wenzel said. "We haven't put nearly enough
into managing fear among health workers."

[Dr Wenzel has identified some unusual features of the 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) outbreak; namely, absence of fever in the early stages of illness,
the co-circulation of at least 5 influenza viruses in Mexico, a high
frequency of pneumonia admissions in Mexican hospitals, and a high
frequency of symptoms of diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

Perhaps the absence of fever in the early stages of illness is the most
significant; it implies that the use of thermal scanners in airports is
unlikely to retard the global spread of the virus. - Mod.CP]

[2] Symptoms in pigs
Date: Mon 11 May 2009

Thai scientists who infected piglets with the new H1N1 virus spreading
around the world said on Monday [11 May 2009] that the strain caused
flu-like symptoms in the animals before disappearing, just as in many of
the human cases. An outbreak of the new strain, known as swine flu [now
re-designated as 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus], that has killed at least
53 people -- mainly in Mexico -- has prompted some countries to ban pork
from countries reporting human cases, even though officials have said there
is no risk of spreading the virus by eating pork. However, some pork
producers are unsure how the virus could affect their animals.

The 22 piglets infected with the new virus showed flu-like symptoms between
one and 4 days after infection and were shedding virus -- meaning they
could spread it -- 2 days after infection, the researchers said. None of
the animals, also infected with the less dangerous H3N2 subtype, died,
Roongroje Thanawongnuwech and colleagues from Chulalongkorn University in
Bangkok reported.

"The results of this study may assist in the prevention and control of
swine influenza virus in Thailand," the researchers wrote in BioMed
Central's Virology Journal [see comment below]. The new virus is a complex
mix of swine viruses with avian and human bits, though nobody knows exactly
where the new infection that 1st emerged in Mexico originated. Influenza
viruses mutate constantly, and they also swap genetic material with one
another promiscuously, especially if an animal or person is infected with 2
strains at once.

The team found that all infected pigs developed respiratory symptoms such
as nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, and conjunctivitis. They also
developed lung lesions large enough to be seen by the naked eye. The
lesions were characterized by dark, plum-colored areas on the lung and were
most severe 2 days after infection. This was especially the case in the
H1N1-infected pigs, where about a 3rd of the lung was covered.

"The results demonstrated that both swine flu subtypes were able to induce
flu-like symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs. However, the severity
of the disease with regard to both gross and microscopic lung lesions was
greater in the H1N1-infected pigs," Thanawongnuwech said in a statement.

[The abstract of the paper which is the subject of this report (Sreta D,
Kedkovid R, Tuamsang S, Kitikoon P,Thanawongnuwech R. Pathogenesis of swine
influenza virus (Thai isolates) in weanling pigs: an experimental trial.
Virology Journal 2009; 6:34 <http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/34>)
reads as follows:

"Background: The objective of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis
of swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype H1N1 and H3N2 (Thai isolates) in
22-day-old SPF pigs. Results: The study found that all pigs in the infected
groups developed typical signs of flu-like symptoms on 1-4 days post-
infection (dpi). The H1N1-infected pigs had greater lung lesion scores than
those of the H3N2-infected pigs. Histopathological lesions related to swine
influenza-induced lesions consisting of epithelial cells damage, airway
plugging, and peribronchial and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration
were present in both infected groups. Immunofluorescence and
immunohistochemistry using nucleoprotein specific monoclonal antibodies
revealed positive staining cells in lung sections of both infected groups
at 2 and 4 dpi. Virus shedding was detected at 2 dpi from both infected
groups as demonstrated by RT-PCR and virus isolation. Conclusion: The
results demonstrated that both SIV subtypes were able to induce flu-like
symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs. However, the severity of the
diseases with regards to lung lesions, both gross and microscopic lesions,
was greater in the H1N1-infected pigs. Based on phylogenetic analysis,
hemagglutinin gene of subtype H1N1 from Thailand clustered with the
classical H1 SIV sequences, and neuraminidase gene clustered with virus of
avian origin, whereas, both genes of H3N2 subtype clustered with H3N2
human-like SIV from the 1970s." - Mod.CP]

[3] Origin in eggs?

The World Health Organization (WHO) and leading influenza research groups
are investigating unpublished claims that the new H1N1 swine flu virus may
have evolved in a laboratory, not in nature. WHO was informed of the
pending publication over the weekend by the author, a retired Australian
virologist named Adrian Gibbs. It scrambled to draw in researchers from
leading human and animal influenza laboratories around the world in a bid
to determine if the claim has merit, and, if it does, whether that changes
the advice WHO gives member countries on the threat posed by the new H1N1
swine flu virus. WHO's leading flu scientist said the consultation is still
ongoing, and a conclusion hasn't been reached, but the weight of evidence
so far suggests the theory isn't correct.

"I think the preliminary analyses certainly suggest there are other
explanations and that the explanation suggested by the author is not the
best one," Dr Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director general for health
security and environment, said in an interview from Geneva. Fukuda said at
least one WHO collaborating centre for influenza, the US Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, has done an extensive analysis of available
genetic sequence data for swine influenza viruses. That work does not
support the claim made by Gibbs, he said. Researchers at Cambridge
University who specialize in the evolution of influenza viruses also
challenge the hypothesis, Fukuda said. "They also feel that there are
alternate explanations for this."

Bloomberg News reported Tuesday [12 May 2009] that Gibbs plans to publish
online a scientific report saying the never-before-seen virus may have
evolved in eggs. Eggs are used in laboratories and in vaccine manufacturing
to grow up quantities of influenza viruses. If the virus had spent time
evolving in eggs, it would suggest it was not solely the creation of nature
but may have been accidentally or deliberately engineered in a lab. If that
were the case, it would of course raise questions about how something
constructed in a lab ended up circulating in humans in at least 30
countries around the globe. If there was evidence that it was an
egg-derived isolate, then that means it had been handled in a laboratory.
And if it's been handled in a laboratory, "then there are different
possibilities that you have to think of," Fukuda said. "Was this developed
in part as a vaccine virus? Was this developed as some sort of research
project? And in those instances, was it released on purpose? Was it an
accidental release? What would be the circumstances?"

Gibbs apparently claims that the virus bears the hallmarks of having
undergone "accelerated evolution" such as what happens when flu viruses try
to adapt to growth in eggs. But the head of the CDC's influenza division,
Dr Nancy Cox, said her labs and others cannot find evidence to support the
claim that the virus has undergone accelerated evolution. Italian influenza
researcher Dr. Ilaria Capua said there is too little known about swine
influenza virus evolution to make the claim in the 1st place. Capua, who
runs an international reference laboratory for avian influenza in Padua,
said Gibbs argues that the virus had accumulated mutations known to be seen
in laboratory manipulation of viruses, specifically growth in eggs. But she
said the same mutations have been noted in a swine flu virus isolated from
a pig in Italy. "So it can occur spontaneously in nature. There is not
enough scientific evidence to build this reasoning," Capua said. "This
virus could have generated itself by many ways: In swine or in another host
or God or laboratory manipulation or whatever. But we just cannot say. This
is not how science works. Science works by building a case. And in this
case, at least from what I've read, there isn't enough information to build
that case."

[4] Origin in eggs?

WHO is investigating a claim by an Australian researcher that the swine flu
virus circling the globe may have been created as a result of human error.
Adrian Gibbs, 75, who collaborated on research that led to the development
of Roche Holding's Tamiflu drug, said in an interview that he intends to
publish a report suggesting the new strain may have accidentally evolved in
eggs scientists use to grow viruses and drug makers use to make vaccines.
Gibbs said he came to his conclusion as part of an effort to trace the
virus's origins by analyzing its genetic blueprint. "One of the simplest
explanations is that it's a laboratory escape," Gibbs said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today [14 May 2009]. But there "are lots of others."

WHO received the study last weekend and is reviewing it, Keiji Fukuda, the
agency's assistant director-general of health security and environment,
said in an interview 11 May 2009. Gibbs, who has studied germ [virus]
evolution for 4 decades, is one of the 1st scientists to analyze the
genetic makeup of the virus that was identified 3 weeks ago in Mexico and
threatens to touch off the 1st flu pandemic since 1968.

A virus that resulted from lab experimentation or vaccine production may
indicate a greater need for security, Fukuda said. By pinpointing the
source of the virus, scientists also may better understand the microbe's
potential for spreading and causing illness, Gibbs said.

"The sooner we get to grips with where it's come from, the safer things
might become," Gibbs said by phone from Canberra yesterday [13 May 2009].
"It could be a mistake" that occurred at a vaccine production facility, or
the virus could have jumped from a pig to another mammal or a bird before
reaching humans, he said. Gibbs and 2 colleagues analyzed the publicly
available sequences of hundreds of amino acids coded by each of the flu
virus's 8 genes. He said he aims to submit his 3-page paper today [14 May
2009] for publication in a medical journal.

"You really want a very sober assessment" of the science behind the claim,
Fukuda said on 11 May 2009 at the WHO's Geneva headquarters. CDC in Atlanta
has received the report and has decided there is no evidence to support
Gibbs's conclusion, said Nancy Cox, director of the agency's influenza
division. She said since researchers don't have samples of swine flu
viruses from South America and Africa, where the new strain may have
evolved, those regions can't be ruled out as natural sources for the new
flu. "We are interested in the origins of this new influenza virus," Cox
said. "But contrary to what the author has found, when we do the
comparisons that are most relevant, there is no evidence that this virus
was derived by passage in eggs."

WHO's collaborative influenza research centers, which includes CDC, and
sites in Memphis, Melbourne, London and Tokyo, were asked by the
international health agency to review the study over the weekend, Fukuda
said. The request was extended to scientists at the Food and Agriculture
Organization in Rome, the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] in
Paris, as well as the WHO's influenza network, he said. "My guess is that
the picture should be a lot clearer over the next few days," Fukuda said.
"We have asked a lot of people to look at this."

Swine flu has infected 5251 people in 30 countries so far, killing 61,
according to WHO data. Scientists are trying to determine whether the virus
will mutate and become more deadly if it spreads to the southern hemisphere
and back. Flu pandemics occur when a strain of the disease to which few
people have immunity evolves and spreads.

Gibbs said his analysis supports research by scientists including Richard
Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who
found the new strain is the product of 2 distinct lineages of influenza
that have circulated among swine in North America and Europe for more than
a decade. In addition, Gibbs said his research found the rate of genetic
mutation in the new virus was about 3 times faster than that of the most
closely related viruses found in pigs, suggesting it evolved outside of swine.

"Whatever speeded up the evolution of these genes happened at least 7 or 8
years ago, so one wonders, why hasn't it been found?" Gibbs said today [14
May 2009]. Some scientists have speculated that the 1977 Russian flu, the
most recent global outbreak, began when a virus escaped from a laboratory.
Identifying the source of new flu viruses is difficult without finding the
exact strain in an animal or bird "reservoir," said Jennifer
McKimm-Breschkin, a virologist at the Commonwealth Science and Industrial
Research Organization in Melbourne. "If you can't find an exact match, the
best you can do is compare sequences," she said. "Similarities may give an
indication of a possible source, but this remains theoretical."

OIE, which represents chief veterinary officers from 174 countries,
received the Gibbs paper and is working with the WHO on an assessment, said
Maria Zampaglione, a spokeswoman. WHO wants to know whether any evidence
that the virus may have been developed in a laboratory can be corroborated
and whether there are other explanations for its particular genetic
patterns, according to Fukuda. "These things have to be dealt with straight
on," he said. "If someone makes a hypothesis, then you test it, and you let
scientific process take its course."

Gibbs said he has no evidence that the swine-derived virus was a
deliberate, man-made product. "I don't think it could be a malignant
thing," he said. "It's much more likely that some random thing has put
these 2 viruses together."

Gibbs, who spent most of his academic career studying plant viruses, said
his major contribution to the study of influenza occurred in 1975, while
collaborating with scientists Graeme Laver and Robert Webster in research
that led to the development of the anti-flu medicines Tamiflu [oseltamivir]
and Relenza [zanamivir], made by GlaxoSmithKline plc. "We were out on one
of the Barrier Reef islands, off Australia, catching birds for the flu in
them, and I happened to be the guy who caught the best," Gibbs said. The
bird he got "yielded the poo from which was isolated the influenza isolate
strain from which all the work on Tamiflu and Relenza started." Gibbs, who
says he studies the evolution of flu viruses as a "retirement hobby,"
expects his research to be challenged by other scientists." This is how
science progresses," he said. "Somebody comes up with a wild idea, and then
they all pounce on it and kick you to death, and then you start off on
another silly idea."
