[This was a very long message, incuding information on hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome and exclusion of rodents. I have abbreviated it severely, deleting
such hot items as descriptions of "white bellies and furry tails". -- Mod
CHC]
A human hantavirus infection was reported in King and Klickitat Counties
[Washington] this week.
In Klickitat County, a 52 year-old man contracted the virus while vacuuming a
mouse nest and droppings from a storage area in a windowseat. He was
hospitalized in Vancouver [Canada] and is recovering from the illness.
In King County, a 23 year-old man died of the illness July 8. Investigators
now are trying to determine how the man was exposed.
Department of Health participated in testing 63 deer mice for hantavirus
[ostensibly Sin Nombre virus] in 14 counties. Positive mice were found in 10
counties in both eastern and western parts of the state. About 11 percent of
deer mice tested have been positive, which is similar to the 12 percent
positive in other western states.
To date, 14 cases of hantavirus have been confirmed in Washington, seven were
fatal. This year there have been three cases, one each in Adams, King and
Klickitat counties. Last year there were single cases in four counties --
Snohomish, Franklin, Lewis and Lincoln. In 1995 there were four cases --
one in Yakima County, two in Stevens County, and one in Grant County. One
Lincoln County case that occurred in 1985 was confirmed in 1994. Also in
1994, there was a case in Lewis County that occurred out of state and one in
Adams County.
For more information please contact Dr. John Kobayashi at 206/361-2831. News
releases and factsheets are available on the Department of Health website at
