Mystery surrounds tourist deaths
--------------------------------
A 59-year-old Edmontonian is now 7th on the list of mysterious deaths
that have hit tourists passing through a Thailand hotel since January
[2011]. The Edmontonian died 26 Jan 2011 in Chiang Mai in northern
Thailand of suspected natural disease after vacationing in the city
for 2 weeks prior. A friend and travel companion told a freelance
journalist that although his friend was staying at the People Palace
Hotel, he had used facilities, including the swimming pool, at the
Downtown Inn a common location between 6 other people who have died in
the region since January.

His death is a complete mystery. He seemed fit enough with no history
of heart problems. We have not been told his cause of death. We only
have an initial report his friend told the journalist. He had no
history of heart problems and in the 7 weeks since his death, no
toxicology reports have been returned.

We have pressed the Canadian consul to try and get answers for us,
said his companion. I know he used the facilities at the Downtown Inn
because he asked me to go there with him but I had other things to do
at the time.

On 24 Jan 2011 the victim began to feel sick, complaining of lack of
sleep due to chest pains. He was taken to the local hospital where his
friend said he was kept for 24 hours and tested for signs of a heart
attack. The tests all came back negative. On the morning of the 26th,
the chest pains were less and the doctor diagnosed him with acid
reflux and sent him home, according to his friend. His friend said
that the same evening, when he checked on him, he was in bed sweating
and saying that he was not feeling well again. Later when his friend
called on him, he came to the door but before he could open it, he
could hear him collapse on the other side. They had to kick the door
in. His friend said that they tried to revive him in vain. At the
hospital he was pronounced dead 15 minutes after arrival.

The investigative journalist reported that the Thailand Department
for Disease Control said so far there are no links between the deaths
of cases examined of people visiting Chiang Mai in January and
February and no link to the Downtown Inn. Chiang Mai Governor Pannada
Disakul reportedly said the deaths were coincidental.

The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs told QMI Agency on Sunday
[20 Mar 2011] that it is aware of the Canadian death.

Another mysterious death in Thai tourist resort
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll in Chiang Mai, Thailand, continues to rise with a 7th
person now identified as having died in similar circumstances to a
young New Zealand tourist.

A 59-year-old Canadian died after using the facilities of the
Downtown Inn, the same hotel linked to the deaths of an elderly
British couple, a Thai tourist guide and a 23-year-old female New
Zealand tourist. The New Zealander died in hospital from a heart
inflammation [myocarditis] 2 days after she and 2 friends became sick
while staying at the Inn, which is in the heart of Chiang Mai next to
the popular Night Bazaar markets.

In addition, 2 other women, who were not staying at the Inn, have
also died in the city in similar circumstances within a month. Thai
authorities deny any link between the deaths, but victims' families
are demanding answers, with some alleging there is a cover-up into the
real cause.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said last night he had
asked for more information about the latest death. "Obviously that
lends some weight to the concerns we have expressed previously."

[The death of this elderly Canadian male occurred contemporaneously
with the previously reported deaths of 6 people (5 females and one
male) in the resort town of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. All had
some association of differing extents with one particular tourist
hotel (the Downtown Inn). (It is important to note, however, that the
7th victim did not die in this hotel).

Where autopsies were undertaken the common feature was myocarditis,
possible as a direct consequence of virus infection. Myocarditis can
be caused by a variety of infections (mainly viral), and by immune
diseases (such as systemic lupus, etc.), pregnancy, and other
ill-defined conditions. The commonest cause of myocarditis is viral
infection of heart muscle resulting in local inflammation (which in
females may be influenced by hormonal factors). No evidence has been
forthcoming subsequently to support the inference of virus infection,
though myocarditis could be a consequence of either gastrointestinal
(e.g., enteroviruses) or respiratory virus (e.g., influenza virus)
infection.

So far nothing untoward has been reported by the Thai authorities
following inspections of the Downtown Inn and no confirmation of a
common viral infection either in the victims or in the general
community has been reported. The best explanations remain exposure to
some form of environmental or food-borne toxin, or simply
coincidence.

Chiang Mai is located in the mountainous north of Thailand and is a
favourite destination for tourists of all ages and motivations. The
hotel involved has been rated a 2/3 star establishment. The HealthMap/
