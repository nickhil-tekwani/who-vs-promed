The number of children who have died from a mysterious disease in Deleig camp for the displaced in Central Darfur has increased to 23. The number of fatalities among donkeys stands at 59.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, a sheikh of the Deleig camp in Wadi Salih locality reported that 23 children have died so far of a mysterious disease that affects children below the age of 12 and donkeys.

The sheikh complained that no official or medical team from the locality or Central Darfur state had come to examine and treat the young patients. "Also, no effort has been done to define and contain the causes of the disease, in spite of the high number of deaths, and the fear and horror experienced by the people in the region."

The Minister of Health of Central Darfur State, Dr Eisa Mohamed Musa, has acknowledged the "emergence of an unknown inflammation" among the children in Deleig. He stated in a press statement that 12 cases were recorded in Deleig. The disease, the minister noted, affects young children below the age of 5 years. The "mysterious disease" symptoms indicate a severe acute respiratory syndrome, according to Musa.

The minister also stated that a medical team was sent to Deleig to investigate the epidemic disease. "We are still waiting for the result of tests on samples collected in the area."

On 12 Feb [2014], Radio Dabanga reported that about 75 percent of the children in Deleig camp were infected with a mysterious disease affecting children below the age of 12 years and donkeys. The symptoms are coughing, vomiting, inflammation in the genitals, and sleeplessness. On 16 Feb [2014], a Deleig camp sheikh reported that 15 children and 47 donkeys had died.

People of the Southern Camp for the Displaced in Nierteti locality, Central Darfur have complained of the spread of an unknown disease among donkeys. 36 of the 146 infected donkeys have died within a week.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, a camp resident reported on Sunday [23 Feb 2014] that the mysterious disease broke out among donkeys 15 days ago. The symptoms are severe coughing, weakness, [loss of] appetite and weight loss. Veterinary authorities have advised people to vaccinate the donkeys, but the camp resident said: "Most of us cannot afford the costs of a vaccination, which ranges between SDG 15 (USD 2.60) and SDG 20 (USD 3.50)."

The displaced appealed to the authorities and organisations working in the field of veterinary services to intervene as soon as possible to vaccinate the donkeys and contain the spread of the disease. "Donkeys are the most important means of livelihood for us."

On 12 Feb 2014 Radio Dabanga reported that about 75 percent of the children below the age of 12 years in the Deleig Camp for the Displaced in Central Darfur were infected with a mysterious disease. The disease affects children below the age of 12 years and donkeys. Four days later, 15 children and 47 donkeys had died.

[The news reports above add little to the description of the disease in the Deleig refugee camp in Central Darfur given in the prior news reports (coughing, vomiting, inflammation in the genitals, and sleeplessness) (see ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed outbreak - Sudan (04): (CD) children, donkeys 20140214.2278865) that is affecting 75 percent of children under 12 years of age and donkeys. Now we learn that the disease (or perhaps another disease) is also affecting donkeys (severe coughing, weakness, appetite and weight loss) in another Central Darfur refugee camp in Nierteti (perhaps also spelled Nertiti). And we now also learn that the disease is rapidly fatal and has killed 23 children and 59 donkeys in Deleig and 36 of the 146 infected donkeys in Niertiti.

However, we are not given a better description of the illness to suggest a diagnosis. Is fever part of the illness? What is the sex distribution of the cases? What exactly is meant by "inflammation in the genitals?" What vaccine is being requested by the refugees for their donkeys in Niertiti? More information on the illness affecting the children in the Deleig camp and the donkeys in the Deleig and Niertiti camps would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Sudan is an Arab state in the Nile Valley of North Africa. Sudan is divided into 18 states or wilayat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). Central Darfur is one of the states of Sudan, and one of 5 comprising the Darfur region. It was created in January 2012 as a result of the ongoing peace process for the wider Darfur region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Darfur). The state was formed from land that was previously part of the states of West Darfur and South Darfur.
