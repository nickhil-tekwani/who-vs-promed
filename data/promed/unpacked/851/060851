Influenza update no 229 [based on data obtained up to 11 Jan 2015]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally influenza activity was high in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far this season [2014-15]. Antigenic characterization of most recent A(H3N2) viruses thus far indicated differences from the A(H3N2) virus used in the influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2014-2015. Based on tests to date, the influenza A(H3N2) viruses are expected to be sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors.

- In North America, the influenza season was ongoing with still high levels of influenza activity in most countries. Influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated. The influenza activity might have peaked in the USA.
- In Europe influenza activity was still on the rise with highest activity in the north-western part. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated this season.
- In northern and western Africa influenza activity seemed to have peaked with influenza B virus predominating, while Egypt reported mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections.
- In Eastern Asia, influenza activity started to decrease with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating.
- In Central Asia influenza activity remained low.
- In Western Asia, Bahrain and the Islamic Republic of Iran reported mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity was low in most countries of the Caribbean, Central America and in the tropical countries of South America.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity increased slightly, but remained low with influenza B predominating.
- the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 23 Jan 2015 18:05 UTC), during week 53, 2014 and week 1, 2015 (28 Dec 2014 to 10 Jan 2015), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 88 countries, areas or territories reported data.

The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 133 812 specimens. 32 903 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 30 926 (94 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1977 (6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 453 (3.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 12 678 (96.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 495 (98 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 10 (2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
In North America, the influenza season was still ongoing with high influenza activity in most countries. Influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated, with patterns similar to the influenza season of 2012-2013 when influenza A(H3N2) was also predominant.

In Canada, influenza activity continued to increase. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity was above expected rates and influenza detections increased further in the last few weeks to 34 percent. More regions reported widespread ILI/influenza activity, and the number of influenza -confirmed outbreaks increased further with the majority recorded in long-term care facilities. Influenza A(H3N2) continued to be the most common detected influenza virus. Of the laboratory confirmed influenza virus detections, 98 percent were influenza A; of the subtyped influenza A viruses 99.7 percent were influenza A(H3N2). Among cases with reported ages, 70 percent were 65 years or older. The majority of adult hospitalizations were among adults of 65 years of age or older. RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] remained the 2nd most frequently detected virus after influenza.

In the United States of America (USA), ILI activity seemed to have peaked and the timing and height of the peak mimicked the 2012-2013 season. The influenza detection rate peaked at 30.4 percent positivity. The pneumonia and influenza mortality from the 122 Cities Reporting Systems was just above the epidemic threshold of 6.9 percent. The influenza-associated hospitalizations continued to increase with the highest rate among adults aged 65 years or older. Of 7515 influenza positive specimens, 96 percent were influenza A and 4 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses subtyped, 99 percent were influenza A(H3N2). Influenza viral characterization data indicated that 68.4 percent of the influenza A(H3N2) viruses collected and analyzed in the USA from 1 Oct 2014 through 3 Jan 2015 were antigenically different (drifted) from the A(H3N2) vaccine virus currently in the northern hemisphere, but most were similar to the A(H3N2) vaccine virus strain selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. In the USA, all recently circulating influenza viruses that have been tested have been susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drugs.

In Mexico, acute respiratory infections (ARI) activity remained consistent with seasonal patterns and influenza detections were mainly due to influenza A(H3N2). Compared to the previous report, activity was still increasing, although most countries still reported low intensity of influenza activity. 80 (16 percent) of 509 sentinel specimens were positive for influenza virus in 19 of 30 countries that reported virological data for the 1st week of January 2015. Influenza activity was highest in the northwestern countries. The predominant influenza virus subtype circulating has been A(H3N2).

Europe
Similar to the findings in the USA, viral characterization data in Europe showed that a proportion of the A(H3N2) viruses has drifted from the H3N2 vaccine virus. All influenza A(H3N2) (n=79) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (n=20) tested this season for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility were sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir.

North Africa
In northern Africa, influenza B detections started to decrease in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia while Algeria reported some increased Influenza A detections of both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). In Egypt decreased influenza activity was reported with predominantly A(H3N2) detected.

Central and Western Asia
In the central and western Asian region, influenza activity remained low or decreased. Uzbekistan had decreasing activity with A(H3N2) while Bahrain reported decreased activity with mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported increased influenza activity with mainly A(H1N1) pdm09, but influenza A(H3N2) and B co-circulated at lower levels.

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity seemed to have peaked. In north China, influenza activity started to decrease with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. ILI activity decreased to 3.5 percent from 4.1 percent in the last update. In Japan, ILI activity increased, but influenza virus detection started to decrease with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. In Mongolia, ILI activity continued to rise and exceeded the upper tolerance limit, with influenza A(H3N2) virus detected predominantly.

Countries of the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall in this region, influenza activity was low. In Cuba, influenza A(H3N2) detections started to decrease in the last few weeks. In Central America, influenza activity decreased after a wave of influenza A(H3N2) activity during the autumn 2014. RSV activity declining but remained the most detected respiratory virus.

Tropical countries in South America reported low ILI, SARI [severe acute respiratory infections], and laboratory-confirmed influenza activity.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, influenza detections were reported from a few countries. Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana reported decreased influenza B activity. Madagascar reported increased influenza detections with influenza H3N2 and influenza B.

Tropical Asia
In most southern Asian and South-Eastern Asian countries, influenza remained low. Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam reported influenza activity with mainly influenza B detections.

Countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere Influenza activity was at an inter-seasonal level in the southern hemisphere countries, except for some Pacific Islands where high ILI activity was reported in American Samoa, Niue, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.

[The seasonal northern hemisphere influenza virus epidemics are in full swing, more or less according to expectation. The predominant virus is an A(H3N2) virus with distinctive antigenic properties that are poorly matched by the current seasonal vaccine virus. Outside of North America the antigenic properties of the H3N2 epidemic virus remain less clear.

Despite the uncertainties regarding the antigenic specificity of the H3N2 virus in North America, this report suggests that the 2014/15 influenza epidemic has reached its peak. What is clear is that no antigenically novel A-type influenza viruses have appeared and the epidemic virus characterised so far remains predominantly resistant to the neuraminidase-inhibiters currently in wide spread use, suggesting that the clinical use of these antivirals is being carefully controlled. - Mod.CP]
