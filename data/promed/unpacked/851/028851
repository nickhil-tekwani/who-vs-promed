The regional office of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare] has published the recent epidemiological
data on tick bites, tick infection rates, and tick-borne borreliosis
[Lyme disease] cases in the region [Nizhny Novgorod].

There were 2722 cases of tick bites in the region during April
[2011], and 1004 people have sought medical help after tick bites. [So
far this year] there have been 5 tick-borne borreliosis [Lyme disease]
cases. In 23 ticks that were tested, the antigens of _Borrelia
burgdorferi_ were detected (that is, 1.7 percent of all tested ticks).
Rospotrebnadzor urges the population to seek medical help after tick
bites and bring the ticks, which will be tested free of charge.
