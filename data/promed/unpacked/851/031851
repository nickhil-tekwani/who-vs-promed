Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Germany are approaching record numbers in 2020. So far, more than 530 human cases have been reported to the German governmental agency Robert Koch-Institute (SurvStat@RKI 2.0, https://survstat.rki.de; 06.09.2020).

This year [2020], about 90% of all cases have been reported from the 2 federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria. The 1st detailed analyses show that especially the districts with altitudes of 550 to over 600 meters [1804 to over 1969 feet] are more heavily affected with increased numbers of human cases, while the districts in lower altitudes show case numbers comparable to the past years.

The 2 reasons for this development are being discussed: The current COVID-19 situation caused many Germans to spend their holidays in Germany, especially at the mountainous recreational areas of southern Germany and, therefore, had increased exposure to ticks and risk of TBE infection in the Alpian, the Bavarian Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Black Forest mountains.

Already before COVID-19, there was a clear trend of increase of human TBE cases in the mentioned affected mountainous areas. In addition to the described indirect COVID effect, record numbers of ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) have been observed for 3 consecutive years with unusually high numbers of TBE virus (TBEV)-infected adult ticks in 2020. Therefore, in spring 2020, a 50% increased risk of TBE infection for this year has been predicted, referring to the observed numbers of TBEV-infected ticks. The change of weather (and climate in a longer respect) during the last years, with record temperatures and mild winters, is apparently the reason for the better survival of ticks and for an intensified virus circulation among rodents and ticks also at higher altitudes.

The current TBE vaccination recommendations for inhabitants and visitors must be revisited and adapted to the new epidemiological situation.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Dobler for this report.

In late June this year (2020), Drs. Gerhard Dobler and Lidia Chitimia-Dobler reported that according to several results of tick sampling studies from different places in Southern Germany, numbers of ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) are again at a record level this year (2020), with a 3-fold increase of adult ticks in comparison to last year [2019]. In some TBE natural foci, even higher absolute numbers of adult ticks than nymphal ticks were found. It is not surprising that there is a subsequent increase in human TBE cases there.

The above report is a good illustration of the effects of climate change on tick populations and their acquisition of TBE virus from abundant rodents. Occurrence of human TBE virus infection this year (2020) has been increased by more frequent recreational use of natural areas by people whose activities are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading them to be active in areas where TBE-infected ticks occur.

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where the ticks are abundant. - Mod.TY
