From: Department of Health (Ministero de Salud Publica), Uruguay
Via: Jose_Campione@hc-sc.gc.ca

The cases are sporadic and remain without any geographical or temporal
association.
Since February up to October 29 [1999 there have been 14 cases diagnosed
as Purpura with the following microbiology:
6 cases - Meningococcus B
1 case - Meningococcus C
1 case - Meningococcus (typing pending)
3 cases - Pneumococcus
3 cases - No laboratory etiological diagnosis (2 with negative paraclinical
studies).
Etiological diagnosis is done by culture and isolation of the agent and the
typing is done by ELISA at the National Reference Laboratory (Departamento
de Laboratorio de Salud Publica).
Although two of the cases had negative cultures both for blood and CSF, the
characteristics of the epidemiological presentation do not correspond to an
outbreak. There has been no evidence of conjunctivitis to suspect Brazilian
Purpuric Fever, and there is no evidence in the country of circulation of
_Haemophilus influenzae_ biogroup aegyptius. (The vaccine in use would not
have been effective against this agent in particular).
