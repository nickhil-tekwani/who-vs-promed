At least 7 beavers in Mongolia have tested positive for COVID-19, the country's National Centre for Zoonotic Diseases (NCZD) said.

"Workers of the Beaver Breeding Centre at the Environmental Department of the capital [Ulaanbaatar] tested positive for the COVID-19 in August [2021]. After that, the COVID-19 delta variant were detected in 7 beavers," Nyamdorj Tsogbadrakh, director of the NCZD, told local media on Saturday [11 Sep 2021].

It is the 1st time that COVID-19 has been detected in animals in Mongolia, Xinhua news agency quoted Tsogbadrakh as saying.

The infected beavers showed symptoms of cough, runny nose, sticky eyes, and others, he said, adding that the animals have already recovered from the disease.

The disease has spread to the capital city and all 21 provinces of the country, and the delta variant, in particular, has been detected in the capital and 20 provinces.

Mongolia, with a population of around 3.4 million, has registered a total of 252 648 COVID-19 cases, with 1021 deaths.

[It has been shown that species in the Felidae, Mustelidae, and Cervidae families are highly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Among rodents, Cricetidae such as hamsters and _Peromyscus_ spp. are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Muridae such as the house mouse and the Norway rat have low susceptibility. Beavers are rodents in the Castoridae family, and this report adds a taxonomic group that may become infected by SARS-CoV-2. The significance of such susceptibility, including host competence and virulence, should be investigated.

There are 2 beaver species: the American beaver _Castor canadensis_ and the Eurasian beaver _C. fiber_. The Eurasian beaver has recovered across much of its range as a result of conservation programs. The Asian populations, however, are small and threatened. The Sino-Mongolian beaver, _C. f. birulai_ is a threatened subspecies that lives only in the Ulungur watershed between Mongolia and China. - Mod.PMB

The Ulungur River (that is, its upper reaches and major tributary) is known in Mongolia as the Bulgan River. Although the report above indicates that the affected beavers were being raised in a beaver breeding project in the capital of Ulaanbaatar, presumably the native locale for these beavers in Mongolia is the Bulgan River area. In addition, Chinese zoologists refer to the area in bordering Xinjiang where they have studied _Castor fiber birulai_ as the Bulgan Beaver Nature Reserve (Chu H, Jiang Z. Distribution and conservation of the Sino-Mongolian beaver _Castor fiber birulai_ in China. Oryx. 2009; 43(2): 197-202; https://doi.org/10.1017/S0030605308002056). - Mod.LXL
