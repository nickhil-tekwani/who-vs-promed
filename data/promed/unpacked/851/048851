Of course, ticks do exist in Madagascar! Many species are known there, and
a systematic review was already published in 1979. The reference is:=20
UILENBERG,G., HOOGSTRAAL,H., KLEIN,J.M.: Les Tiques (Ixodoidea) de
Madagascar et leur Role Vecteur. Archives de l'Institut Pasteur de
Madagascar (1979),n=B0 special,1-153. Thirty-three species are recorded in
this work.
After this publication, another species has been recorded by FONTENILLE and
PEREZ in 1984: Amblyomma loculosum.
However,the presence of ticks parasiting lemurs is exceptional. At least
one tick-borne agent is known there: the virus of the Crimean-Congo
Haemorrhagic Fever.
If you wish more information, please let us know.
[Thanks very much for the definitive summary and offer of help. I think we
can close the book and cut the thread on this one. - Mod. p.c.]
