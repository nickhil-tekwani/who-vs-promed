The number of people affected by the Fiji typhoid outbreak continues
to rise with a further 13 confirmed cases reported this week,
bringing the total to 112.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, Iliesa Tora, says
inspectors are now looking for possible sources of the outbreak
during a 2-week tour of affected areas beginning in the Northern
[Division]. The inspection will cover sanitation and environmental
contributors as well providing community leaders with information
about protecting the clean water supply. Mr Tora says identifying
typhoid carriers who may be unconsciously spreading the infection
will be a priority. "What we would do then is take them in and treat
them, treat them basically so that we can also go back and study
their history especially their movements, of where they've been over
the past year or so. We hope that would definitely help us to
identify where there's a possibility of outbreaks happening."

US Embassy Suva [Suva is the capital and largest city of Fiji. It is
located on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu, in the
Central Division] issued the following Warden Message on 8 Mar 2010:

This warden message is to alert US citizens that the Fiji Ministry of
Health has declared an outbreak of typhoid fever in Fiji. Symptoms
include fever, gastroenteritis, and diarrhea. US citizens resident in
Fiji or visiting Fiji are advised to pay particular attention to
personal hygiene and food safety and ensure that their typhoid
vaccination is up to date. The most effective prevention of
typhoid-related diseases, as with other diarrheal diseases, is
careful selection of food, water, and beverages. Note: The typhoid
vaccination is not 100 percent effective so even those who have had
it should take precautions.

The Fiji Ministry of Health is advising visitors to villages and
settlements to exercise caution with local water supplies and
recommends tourists carry their own drinking water on such
excursions. Tourists should avoid taking part in kava drinking
ceremonies unless tour operators can provide assurances that Fiji
Ministry of Health guidelines are being observed.
