Two more horse deaths bring total to 12
---------------------------------------
Two more horses from the University of Findlay have died from an equine
strain of the herpes virus, bringing the total number of deaths to 12. The
horses died in the last few days at Ohio State University where they were
being treated, said Kathryn Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Findlay school.
Eight other horses started showing signs of the virus in the last week. All
have a fever, but none was showing any of the neurological signs that the
12 dead horses exhibited.
The Ohio Department of Agriculture has said that an equine strain of the
herpes virus was responsible for the horse deaths that started about 2
weeks ago. State veterinarian David Glauer said the infected horses showed
signs of the respiratory and neurological forms of the disease. The virus
is not a threat to humans.
School officials have not determined why the virus hit one of its
equestrian centers. Findlay, a private university of 4500 students, offers
majors in western and English riding and equine business management. Owners
can pay a fee for equestrian students to train their horses to compete.
About 350 of the animals go through the program each year.
A self-imposed quarantine is in place for the English riding facility where
the outbreak started at the school, and area horse owners have been advised
to quarantine their horses, the department said.
