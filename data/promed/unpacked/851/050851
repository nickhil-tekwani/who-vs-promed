Bird flu confirmed in 10 rural communities across Russia
-----------------------------------------------
Suspected cases of avian influenza have now been confirmed in 10
rural communities across Russia and are being verified in 19 others,
the Agriculture Ministry said in a press release Monday [31 Oct
2005]. The confirmed outbreak sites are in the central regions of
Tula and Tambov, as well as in the Urals province of Chelyabinsk and
in Omsk and Altai, in Siberia. [Map at

Russia's Kurgan region is the worst affected, with 3 confirmed
outbreak sites and 3 suspected. In the Novosibirsk province, 16
communities are currently under suspicion.

[A separate newswire of Ria Novosti, 31 Oct 2005, says:
"Mass deaths of migrant birds have been registered outside
Yekaterinburg, the Urals, a spokesman for the local consumer
protection service said Monday [31 Oct 2005].
"Late last week, dead waxwings were found in Asbest [a local town],"
the spokesman said, adding that samples had been taken and sent for
examination. The results will be ready Wednesday [2 Nov 2005], the
representative said."
Waxwings belong to Order: Passeriformes, Family: Bombycillidae,
Genus: _Bombycilla_. Details on the identity of the species involved
are requested; see following items. - Mod.AS]

More bird flu cases found in Romania
-------------------------------------------
Chief veterinarian Ion Agafitei said a goose and a swan had both
tested positive for the H5 type of bird flu.
He said it had not yet been decided whether to send the samples to
the UK to see whether they had the virulent H5N1 strain.
Earlier this month [October 2005], the Balkan state became the 1st
country in mainland Europe to detect the deadly H5N1 virus in poultry
in 2 villages in the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands.
A heron carrying the strain was also found near the border with Moldova.
"We found a wild goose near the village of Vadu Oii and a swan next
to the Razim lake, which were tested positive for H5," Mr. Agafitei said.
The areas will not be quarantined as the birds were found at least
one mile from the nearest human settlement, and no poultry will be culled.
Vadu Oii lies close to the Danube river in Constanta county [at
Giurgeni in the map
<http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/turism/r_constanta.jpg>],
while Razim is the biggest lake in the delta near the Black Sea,
which wild birds use to rest on their way to warmer climes [see map
<http://www.ici.ro/romania/images/turism/r_tulcea.jpg>].
The areas are roughly 44 miles [70 km] from each other.
Romanian authorities have said over 500 tests were done over the past
2 weeks on birds in the country's southeast, and they all turned out
negative for bird flu.
The deadly strain was found in samples taken from 2 villages in the
Danube delta earlier in October 2005. Over 21 000 domestic birds in
the 2 villages, which were quarantined, were culled.

[3] Call for wild-bird identification

Influenza virus in wild birds: request to provide species identification
-----------------------------------------------
The attention to subtype and pathogenicity of influenza viruses
detected in wild birds is not coupled with a similar attention to the
identity of the wild birds.
For example, in recent ProMED-mail messages, H5N1 virus was reported
in "wild swans" in Croatia (24 Oct 2005, archive number
20051024.3104) and in "a heron" in Romania (28 Oct 2005, archive
number 20051028.3147). The underlying reports to the World
Organisation for Animal Health do not provide more detail on the
birds involved. However, Avibase <http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/>
lists 3 swan species in the wild bird checklist for Croatia and 4
heron species in the checklist for Romania, so it is not clear in
which species H5N1 virus was detected.
The precise identity of wild birds in which avian influenza viruses
is detected is important to understand the epidemiology of influenza.
The wild bird species involved is particularly important with regard
to their migratory patterns and behavior. For the current H5N1 virus
outbreak, knowledge of the bird species involved is crucial to help
direct surveillance activities for influenza virus in wild birds. We
recommend that, whenever possible, people submitting information
provide both the common and scientific names of the wild bird species
in which influenza virus has been detected. For example, whooper swan
(_Cygnus cygnus_) and grey heron (_Ardea cinerea_). If this is not
provided in the original report, we ask moderators to request this
information with the same tenacity with which they insist on
determination of subtype and pathogenicity of the influenza virus involved.

[We wholeheartedly endorse the above call for detailed reports
regarding the species of tested birds, positive or otherwise. This
may require closer cooperation with and active involvement of
zoologists and ornithologists. Veterinary authorities should include
the acquired data in their official notifications to the
international organizations; ProMED-mail will appreciate such
information, if available, from subscribers.
An exemplary handling of the matter has been forthcoming from Hong
Kong. During the last 2 years, the HK authorities officially reported
the following positive cases:
1. 26 Jan 2004, peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_): found dead.
2. 5 Nov 2004, grey heron (_Ardea cinerea_): found dead.
3. 3 Dec 2004, grey heron (_Ardea cinerea_): observed sick, found
dead next day.
4. 14 Jan 2005, Chinese pond heron (_Ardeola bacchus_): found dead.
Similarly, P.R. China specified the following species in its report
of 21 May 2005 from the Qinqhai nature reserve: bar-headed geese
_Anser indicus_, great black-headed gulls _Larus ichthyaetus_,
brown-headed gulls _Larus brunnicephalus_, ruddy shelducks _Tadorna
ferruginea_ and great cormorants _Phalacrocorax carbo_.
Mongolia reported on 8 Aug 2005 about die-off affecting "wild ducks,
geese and swans;" later, they specified the identity of 4 birds that
tested positive at the reference laboratory in Japan: 3 whooper swans
_Cygnus cygnus_ and one bar-headed goose _Anser indicus_.
Croatia reported on 27 Oct 2005 dead swans found H5N1 positive;
Romania, on 22 Oct 2005, about a dead heron found H5N1 positive.
Finland and Sweden identified LPNAI viruses in a seagull
(unspecified) and a mallard, respectively.
A wealth of data is included in the report of OIE's mission to
Russia. Annex 3 of the report includes a list of 228 samples from
dead, sick, and "hunted" (assumed clinically healthy) wild birds
collected in affected and unaffected parts of Russia and tested at
the central all-Russian laboratory ARRIAH in Vladimir. See
20051015.3004 and the original at
<http://www.oie.int/downld/Missions/2005/ReportRussia2005Final2.pdf>.
All birds listed in the table as "wild duck" are of undetermined species.
There are accumulating indications that migratory birds play a role
in the spread of H5N1. However, no smoking gun (a carrier reaching an
unaffected area) has been demonstrated so far. A list of identified
potential transmitters, namely susceptible birds that are capable of
covering the distance to disease-free destinations within the
incubation period, or infected asymptomatic carriers, should enable
efficient sampling and testing efforts in the target regions. - Mod.AS]
