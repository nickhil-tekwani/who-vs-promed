[On 3 Apr 2018, South Sudan's Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Tourism, Animal Resources, Fisheries, Cooperatives, JUBA) submitted its follow-up report No. 3 (Final report) on Rift Valley fever (RVF) to the OIE (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=26345). This follow-up report, created on 31 Mar 2018, notified continued absence of new animal cases since the initial, immediate notification to the OIE, dated 8 Mar 2018, when 8 cases in cattle were reported. The said notification included the following epidemiological comment: "There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed and the number of mosquitoes increased. No mortalities in cattle have been reported. During the investigation clinical signs, consistent with Rift Valley fever, were observed" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26127. The "9 confirmed animal cases" included in the 12th weekly ReliefWeb report are, probably, not new.

OIE's follow-up report 3 included the following final comment: "The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports".

Unfortunately, during the recent S. Sudan RVF event, as in most - if not all - previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa, to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans.

The initial WHO report on the S. Sudan RVF event (20180119.5568536) mentioned "wild birds" among the affected animal species. It deserves to be noted that birds are known to be refractory to experimental infection with the RVF virus.. - Mod.AS

It is fortunate that the RVF outbreak has ended, with no new reported cases in livestock. RVF-infected livestock can pose a significant risk to humans in contact with them, often livestock owners and veterinarians. Abortions in livestock with a loss in productivity present an economic problem for many ethnic groups that depend on them for livelihoods. In the absence of banks or similar institutions of financial support, livestock represent a kind of living bank account for their owners, in addition to a source of milk and meat. Apparently, this RVF outbreak did not result in an abortion storm that could have had serious economic, social and public health consequences. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long period of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for maintaining livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod. TY]
