[2] Mosquito repellent plants
Date: Thu 27 Dec 2018
Source: Technology times[edited]
https://www.technologytimes.pk/mosquito-repellent-plants/


Mosquitoes get their meal by sucking blood from the animal or human beings. Mosquitoes are dreadful in a sense that they transfer many diseases like dengue, malaria, West Nile virus, or Zika virus to the human population. There are some plants that have mosquito repellent properties, which can be used instead of commercially available insect repellent.

Human skin has some specific odors and various secretions to which many insects as well as mosquitoes are attracted. So if a person is exercising or working hard in the lawn or ground, then chances of mosquito bite increase.

Some strong and unpleasant smells can overcome the human scent, thus preventing insect and mosquito bites. This is the reason why citronella candles and DEET sprays sell a lot in the summer season. Similarly, various plants have very strong scents that human finds comfortable, which help to hide the human scent and thus preventing the bites of neighboring mosquitoes. Ideally the scent of plants should be on the skin but can work well if present in your surroundings.

These plants give best results as mosquito repellents when herbs are crushed in the palm of the hand due to which aroma and essential oils are released. Apply leaves and oil to your body.

Lemon balm: It belongs to mint family. It has white flowers, some healing properties and the scent resembles that of lemon. It can reduce the chances of mosquito bites but it is an invasive species so be careful, when thinking of growing in lawn.

Catnip: Nepetalactone, a natural chemical found in plant. It has insect repellent and feline attractant activity. So if you are not a cat lover then don't grow this in your lawn.

Basil: The essential oil produced from this plant is very toxic to the larvae of mosquitoes. If you grow this plant near water sources, it has the ability to reduce the egg laying capacity of mosquitoes.

Lavender: It can repel flies, moths, and mosquitoes. The most effective way to get benefit as mosquito repellent from this plant is to rub its leaves which result in extraction of the oil. Apply oil to the body.

Peppermint: Mostly peppermint in concentrated form is used as insect repellent. Peppermint oil has great tendency to repel adults as well as ability to kill eggs and larvae of some species.

Citrosum: It is a perennial plant. Its market name is "mosquito plant" and is also known as citronella (as its strong scent correlates with citronella). Despite being largely marketed, research said that it has minimum mosquito repellent activity as compared to other plants.

Sage and rosemary: Burning small amounts of sage and rosemary produces a strong aroma, [not only agreeable to human beings] but also repels most insects [while you are near the fire or smoke produced from it.]
