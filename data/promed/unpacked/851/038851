The Southern African region has been warned to brace itself for the spread of anthrax which has killed more than 100 hippos in Namibia. The disease has already spread to Botswana through the Okavango River and has already claimed the lives of 3 hippos.

The Director of Department of Veterinary Service Dr Letshwenyo Modisa said his department and other stakeholders were monitoring the situation. Speaking during a live broadcast on Botswana Television, Modisa said they had removed more than 8 dead carcases of hippos from the Okavango River. He said the carcasses of dead hippos killed by anthrax were spilling into the country from Namibia through the Okavango River. The river, which flows in the northern part of the country, is shared between Botswana, Namibia and Angola.

According to Modisa, the infection occurs when the bacteria enters a cut or scratch in the skin [or] through inhalation. But he allayed fears that crocodiles and other wild animals which feed on the infected carcass are immune from infection adding that they help in mitigating the spread of the disease by feeding on the carcasses.

As the number of hippos which died of suspected anthrax from neighbouring Namibia rises, Botswana has confirmed that at least 3 hippos have died in the country. The Director of Wildlife and National Parks, Otisitswe Tiroyamodimo, said while the death toll may rise in the near future, a considerable number of dead hippos came floating in the Okavango River at Mohembo in northern Botswana from Namibia. He said they are working around the clock to remove the dead hippos from the river to curb further spread.

"A significant number of dead hippo carcasses are floating in the river from Namibia into Botswana. The public is warned not to touch any carcass found along the river or anywhere else. Eating meat of these animals will be very dangerous as anthrax is suspected to be causing the mortalities," he said. He said all dead animal sightings, be it in the water, river or land, must be reported to the nearest Department of Wildlife and National Parks office, police station or veterinary office.

For her part, the [Botswana] Ministry of Health and Wellness's permanent secretary Shenaaz El-Halabi said though the incident has occurred in northern Botswana, all public health facilities in the country are ready to provide all the necessary health services for the management of anthrax. She warned that it was dangerous and risky to touch, skin, cut, handle or eat hippo meat or it's by products.

Reports indicate that wild animal anthrax is a natural occurrence in many areas in southern Africa. Outbreaks of anthrax in hippos are common across the region. In dry seasons, there is concentration of both animals and anthrax spores in the reduced volumes of water, and the infection is able to spread rapidly among the hippos. New sightings of hippo carcasses should be reported to game reserve officials.

Tourists and others are not at risk if they avoid direct contact with the dead hippos.

Residents living in the Bwabwata National Park have been warned not to fish in the area where more than 100 hippos have died of an anthrax outbreak.

[It is not completely clear whether 3 Botswana hippos were found dead and confirmed that they had died of anthrax, or whether the 3 had floated south from the Bwabwata National Park [BNP]. [See: 12 Oct 2017 Anthrax - Namibia (06): (Bwabwata Natl Park) anthrax confirmed 20171012.5376938]

The fishing warning for waters within and adjoining the BNP is wise. The presence of dead fish indicates a significant water contamination from the rotting hippo carcasses. This will not be from the vegetative _Bacillus anthracis_ vegetative cells as their survival in water is a matter of a few hours and sporulation in water is not possible because of the absence of sufficient oxygen and nutrients. The contamination will be from the bacteria involved in the carcass decomposition. This will also have removed much of the oxygen in the water and can kill fish. Farmed fish from the Okavango river are temporally not being marketed because of the perceived risk. - Mod.MHJ
