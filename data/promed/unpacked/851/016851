The first measures thought to be capable of containing a global flu
outbreak have been agreed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), a
leading British scientist said yesterday Tue 21 Mar 2006].
The plan makes it clear that there would be a window of opportunity
of only around 3 weeks after an outbreak to prevent a pandemic that
could sicken 20 per cent of the global population and put 30 million
people in hospital, of whom around 20 per cent could die.
2 computer models of an outbreak, one by Prof Neil Ferguson of
Imperial College London, demonstrated in 2005 that early antiviral
treatment would be critical if H5N1 began to spread between people.
In the past few days the WHO has published its first recommendations
on how to carry out the plan.
"This is remarkable," Professor Ferguson said yesterday. "This is the
first time it has even been thought a possibility." The plan, or
protocol, which was drawn up by more than 70 international experts
and WHO staff, suggests for the first time that it may be possible
"to alter the natural course of a pandemic near its start".
By May [2006] the WHO will have a stockpile of 3 million courses of
the antiviral drug oseltamivir in warehouses in America and
Switzerland, after donations from industry. The modelling studies
suggest that the mass administration of antiviral drugs must begin
within 21 days after the detection of the first case, which would
represent improved human-to-human transmission of the virus.
The meeting agreed a point that would mark the start of a pandemic:
"3 or more persons with unexplained moderate-to-severe acute
respiratory illness (or who died of an unexplained acute respiratory
illness) and with onset of illness within seven to 10 days of each
other and with a history strongly suggesting potential exposure to
the H5N1 virus."
2 types of changes to the virus would be considered causes for
concern: detection of a virus with new features, for example a
"reassortant" virus containing both human and avian genetic material,
or the isolation of a virus from a human case showing a number of
mutations not seen in the avian strains.
The national health authority should notify the WHO "immediately
following detection of a credible signal". If the WHO agreed that
this were a potential pandemic, a range of logistical measures and
tests would be carried out along with control measures, notably the
use of antivirals, quarantine and hygiene measures.
But the document said that it would not be able to contain the
pandemic if the number or geographical distribution of the affected
people were too large at the time of detection, exceeded supplies of
antivirals or the capacity of medical and emergency services, or if
more than 4-6 weeks had passed since the detection of the initial cluster.

[2] WHO containment plan
Date Wed 22 Mar 2006

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a new draft of its
plan for spotting and stopping a budding influenza pandemic. "The WHO
pandemic influenza draft protocol for rapid response and containment"
posits the possibility of identifying an emerging pandemic in time to
stop it by using antivirals, isolation, quarantine, and social
distancing. The document is a revision of a first draft that was
released in late January [2006].
The concept is based on mathematical models suggesting that early,
efficient human-to-human transmission of a potential pandemic virus
could be identified and contained if authorities had appropriate
surveillance in place and moved quickly to quell the outbreak. The
models relied on mass dispensing of antiviral drugs in an outbreak
zone, along with social distancing and quarantine measures.
"No attempt has ever been made to alter the natural course of a
pandemic near its start," WHO says. "Moreover, given the
unpredictable behavior of influenza viruses, no one can know in
advance whether the start of a pandemic will begin gradually,
following the emergence of a virus not yet fully adapted to humans,
or be announced by a sudden explosion of cases, thereby precluding
any attempt at containment."
WHO has convened experts 3 times since December [2005] to consider a
draft protocol for early containment of a pandemic flu, the document states.
To further that effort, an international stockpile of antivirals has
been created with industry donations. 3 million treatment courses
will be ready by May 2006 for use only in an intervention to contain
the virus at it source, the WHO said.
Success would depend on prompt response to suspicious clusters of
human influenza cases, WHO acknowledged. The mass dispensing of
antivirals would need to start within 21 days after detection of the
first case of efficient human-to-human transmission. Accomplishing
that implies succeeding at a number of earlier steps, including
detecting the clusters, communicating quickly and accurately from the
local to the international level, and quickly obtaining outside
assistance in investigation and response.
The WHO recommends investigating clusters of 3 or more people with
unexplained moderate-to-severe respiratory illness and with illness
onsets within 7 to 10 days of one another. In addition, the patients
in the cluster must have a history "strongly suggesting potential
exposure to the H5N1 virus," such as travel in an infected area,
direct contact with infected or dead birds or animals, close contact
with an H5N1 patient, or possible occupational exposure.
The WHO identified 4 trigger points for attempting rapid containment
of a virus:
(1) Moderate-to-severe respiratory illness or death in 3 or more
healthcare workers with no known exposure to H5N1 other than contact
with ill patients, and laboratory confirmation of H5N1 infection in
at least one of those workers.
(2) Moderate-to-severe respiratory illness or death in 5 to 10 people
with evidence of human-to-human transmission to at least some of
them, and lab-confirmed H5N1 diagnoses in more than 2 of them.
(3) Compelling evidence that more than one generation of
human-to-human transmission has occurred.
(4) Isolation of a novel virus with avian and human genes, or a virus
with an increased number of mutations not seen in avian isolates,
from one or more people with moderate-to-severe respiratory illness,
along with epidemiological evidence of a change in transmission pattern.
The WHO also identifies situations in which rapid containment should
not be tried: when studies fail to confirm H5N1 or another novel
influenza A virus; when the affected population is too big to provide
for basic needs and emergency care during containment; and when more
than 4 to 6 weeks have passed since the initial cluster was identified.
The initial protocol is still being refined, with a meeting scheduled
28 Mar 2006 with Roche officials to refine procedures for delivering
the company's oseltamivir supplies to WHO. "A more detailed
operational plan, in line with actions recommended in this protocol,
is the expected outcome," WHO said in its report. Further meetings
"with countries and partners" will be scheduled to address drug
distribution issues. Currently the plan indicates that Roche stands
ready to ship 1.5 million doses stored in the United States and
another 1.5 million doses stored in Switzerland.
The WHO document further describes the roles and responsibilities of
countries in helping to contain a pandemic, as well as the roles and
responsibilities of WHO.
One of the agency's roles will be to train rapid reaction teams over
the next few months, according to a 10 Mar 2006 news release from the
agency. The teams will include epidemiologists, laboratory
specialists, and logistics, ethics, and communications experts, the
release said.
"We will develop a roster of people who have received a great deal of
training about what in fact are the containment procedures, what is
influenza, what is the nature of the threat," said Keiji Fukuda,
acting director of the WHO's global influenza program, in the news
release. Reuters news service reported on Mar 10 that WHO would train
about 100 experts for the rapid response. Fukuda noted in another 10
Mar 2006 Reuters report that aspects of the WHO containment plan
raise challenging ethical issues, including some related to quarantine.
"It is clear that if we try to contain a pandemic -- and this has
never been attempted before, there is no precedent -- that there is a
very good chance that we will fail, that we will not be able to stop
it," Fukuda said. "However, there is also a very good chance that if
we mount this kind of effort we may slow down the spread of a
pandemic virus early on. If we do that, if we buy some substantial
amount of time and that means weeks, then we can really increase the
chance for having more vaccines available more rapidly."
Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, a leading pandemic preparedness
advocate and a skeptic on the possibility of containment, said the
revised WHO plan represents "a more realistic approach" to
containment than the previous version. "However, the activity of the
last 2 months in countries throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa only
further supports the fact that early recognition and documentation of
an emerging pandemic is going to be difficult if not impossible," he
added. "If a pandemic flu strain had emerged in any number of areas
where cases or clusters have occurred in recent months, that pandemic
strain would've been long gone to the rest of world by now," said
Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of the CIDRAP Web site.
He said he still regards a flu pandemic, sooner or later, as
inevitable. "The only thing that's really going to take pandemic
influenza off the table is an influenza vaccine that can be produced
in advance of the actual pandemic strain, and for which there is
global production capacity and distribution ability to quickly put a
world seal over this virus, not a local blanket," he said.

A woman has died of what could be avian influenza in the eastern
Chinese city of Shanghai, state television said on Thursday [23 Mar
2006]. The patient, a 29-year-old female migrant worker, died on
Tuesday [21 Mar 2006] of a pneumonia of unconfirmed origin, an
official at the Shanghai municipality information office told Reuters.
The case is under investigation for bird flu, Shanghai Television
said. China has recorded 15 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans
since late 2005, 10 of whom have died. Doctors and nurses who tended
the patient were under quarantine, said a source at the hospital,
adding final test results were awaited. "It's a suspected case, not
yet confirmed," the source told Reuters.
The Ministry of Health declined immediate comment. The World Health
Organisation said it was investigating. "We are verifying this rumour
at the moment. We are still treating this as a rumour since there is
no confirmation yet," said Aphaluck Bhatiasevi, WHO spokeswoman in Beijing.

A female patient in Shanghai was reported to have died of an
unidentified type of pneumonia on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006] and experts
say it may be the first human bird flu infectious case in the city.
The 29-year-old migrant worker suffered cough and fever and went to
hospital for the first time on 15 Mar 2006.
Shanghai Municipal Health Department organized experts on Wed 22 Mar
2006 to perform multiple tests and analysis on the case and made a
preliminary conclusion that the pneumonia was probably caused by high
pathogenic [H5N1] avian influenza virus. The department said it has
already reported the case to the Ministry of Health, asking the
experts for a further diagnosis. According to the department, people
who have had close contact with the dead patient are receiving
medical inspections, but no infectious symptoms have been detected.
The government have also disinfected places where the deceased
patient had visited.
