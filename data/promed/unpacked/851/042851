WALKERTON - A large percentage of Walkerton residents who became sick this
spring didn't have _E. coli_ [infections after all, health officials say.
In fact, 3 different types of bacteria plagued 2000 of the town's residents
during the May outbreak, said Dr. Walter Ewing, associate medical officer
of health for Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. While the final number hasn't been
determined yet, Ewing estimates as many as 40 per cent were suffering from
_Campylobacter_ [infections, not _E. coli_ [infections. Others had
_Salmonella_ infections. Ewing's estimates are based on tests on about 300
residents who fell ill during the outbreak.
_Campylobacter_ bacteria, which [are often associated with poultry, wild
birds or contact with young animals such as puppies, cause bloody diarrhea,
cramping and bloating. But [this illness is not considered as dangerous as
[that caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7, said Ewing. It can, however, cause
miscarriages, although this is rare, said Ewing.
_Campylobacter_ was found in the Walkerton water system during the outbreak
in May, but there have been no reports of it since. Town water was
contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ and
several [bacteria during extensive flooding.
_Campylobacter_ is not known to cause kidney problems. "But _Campylobacter_
symptoms may last a lot longer than _E. coli_ symptoms, although that's not
very common, but we're seeing it because of the large number of people
affected by this," said Ewing.
During a public meeting in Walkerton last Thursday, one resident said many
Walkerton women are reporting menstrual irregularities and others suffered
miscarriages. Ewing said _E. coli_ was not known to cause these problems,
but they could be the result of _Campylobacter_ infections.
_E. coli_, not _Campylobacter_, caused the 6 confirmed deaths linked to the
outbreak. _Campylobacter_ infections are sometimes the result of eating
undercooked poultry or drinking water contaminated by bird droppings. The
former Maple Leaf poultry plant in Walkerton was flooded during heavy rain
in mid-May, said Ron Leavoy, whose printing and graphics store is nearby.
But the plant, which processed tens of thousands of turkeys a year, is
downstream from all the town's wells, he noted.
The plant closed in April, 1999, and was "properly decommissioned," said a
Maple Leaf Foods Inc. spokesperson.

[This report of the involvement of multiple enteric pathogens suggests to
me the possibility of contamination of the town's water supply with raw
human sewage rather than just farm runoff. Prior conclusions about the
inadequacies of water treatment procedures and reporting of problems with
the water supply are unchanged by these observations. The presence of
former turkey processing facilities downstream from the water supply could
also be related via contamination of underground aquifers that are not
truly downstream. - Mod.ES
