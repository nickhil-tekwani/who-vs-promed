Texas anthrax situational update no. 4
----------------------------------
Since the 22 Jul 2019 update, anthrax has been detected on 4 new premises. One premises is in southeast Crockett County, one premises is in south Sutton County, one premises is in northwest Uvalde County, and one premises is in northeast Val Verde County. The Texas Animal Health Commission quarantined the premises after animals tested positive for the reportable disease. Anthrax quarantines are typically lifted 10 days from vaccination or the last death loss.

To date, 14 premises in 5 Texas counties have had animals confirmed with anthrax. Animals include the following species: antelope, goat, horses, deer, and cattle. Producers have been advised on vaccinating exposed animals and instructed on the proper disposal of affected carcasses, as outlined by TAHC's rules.

2019 anthrax confirmations:
Texas County / Confirmation(s) received
1. Crockett / 2
2. Kinney / 1
3. Sutton / 7
4. Uvalde / 3
5. Val Verde / 1
Total: 14

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay or inhale the spores. [Inhalation anthrax is exceptionally rare in livestock and wildlife. - Mod.MHJ] Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

There is an effective anthrax vaccine available for use in susceptible livestock (includes but is not limited to swine, equine, sheep, goats, cattle, etc.).TAHC encourages livestock owners to consult with a local veterinary practitioner and consider vaccinating livestock if owners live where anthrax is historically found in Crockett, Uvalde, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties. Producers may order anthrax vaccines directly from the manufacturer.

After exposure to anthrax, it usually takes 3-7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. Owners of livestock and animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax or experiencing death of animals should contact a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official.

Producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions when handling affected livestock or carcasses. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and long-sleeve shirts and to wash thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides benefits to eligible livestock owners for livestock deaths caused by eligible loss conditions. Anthrax is identified as an eligible disease.

[There is a map in the TAHC report showing where the affected counties are. This epidemic is following the pattern of the Texas Paradigm that we have seen before: late spring / early summer rains provide for a significant hatch of biting flies. These flies both multiply cases and fly to infect animals on other ranches. Private information from various sources in Texas are that the losses on the affected ranches, reported and as yet unreported, are significant, involving a high financial cost to the owners. As has been pointed out before, we need an effective oral anthrax vaccine for deer. They are used to going to feeding stations inside and outside the hunting season, and therefore, an oral vaccine would have its place both for proactive vaccination and in response to outbreaks like these. - Mod.MHJ
