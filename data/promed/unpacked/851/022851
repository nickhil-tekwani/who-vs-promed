Stanford University researchers have identified 5 new cases of a "double mutant" Covid-19 strain that was recently discovered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Doctors suspect it could be more contagious than earlier strains and may be resistant to existing vaccines.

The new variant originated in India where it's credited with a recent 55% surge in cases in the state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, after months of declining cases.

It contains 2 key mutations, which scientists call E484Q and L452R, that have been found separately in other variants but not together in a single strain, according to Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of Stanford's clinical virology laboratory, which discovered the new variant in the U.S.

"There's a decent amount of information of how these mutations behave in viruses on their own, but not in combination," Pinsky said in an interview.

In other variants, the L452R mutation has been shown to make the virus more transmissible. There is also evidence that antibodies don't recognize that mutation, which has been found in other strains to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.

The E484Q mutation has also been shown to be less susceptible to neutralizing antibodies, which help fight the coronavirus. It's still too early to tell if the mutation makes the virus more contagious.

"But you'd expect that in combination with L452R that there may be an increase in transmission as well as reduction in antibody neutralization," Pinsky said.

If the mutation makes the virus more resistant to antibodies, that could reduce the effectiveness of both vaccines as well as antibody treatments that have become a critical tool for doctors in fighting Covid-19, according to Pinsky.

"I suspect that existing vaccines will be slightly less effective in preventing infection by this new variant," he said, "but all of the vaccines are extremely effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths."

Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab antibody treatment has been shown to be less effective in treating strains that contain the E484Q or L452R mutations. U.S. health regulators halted distribution of that antibody treatment last month [March 2021], saying it wasn't that effective against the new variants.

The double mutant variant "has known mutations in the scariest place to have a mutation -- the receptor binding domain, where the virus uses to latch on to cells in our bodies in order to enter," said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at the University of California San Francisco. "The mutations are either identical or eerily similar to mutations in variants that we already know about that have been scientifically proven to be more transmissible and/or evade vaccines. Hence many believe that this Indian variant will also have these superpowers."

Dr. Tom Kenyon, chief health officer at Project HOPE and former director of global health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said scientists are finding more mutations, at least in part, because new CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky directed the agency to increase surveillance. "So the more that we look for these, the more we're going to find them," he said.

"There's something about the world 'double' that scares people and makes it sound like it's double bad," Kenyon said in an interview. "Any mutation affecting transmissibility or viral replication would be dangerous."

There's a possibility the new variant will stay in the Bay Area, unlike the B.1.1.7 variant from the United Kingdom that has become the predominant strain just about anywhere it goes, Chin-Hong said.

"If the U.K. variant went into a boxing ring with the Indian variant, the U.K. variant will probably emerge victorious. But only time will tell," Chin-Hong said.

The longer it takes to vaccinate the world, the more opportunities the virus has to mutate into even worse strains, scientists say. Walensky has warned of "impending doom" in the U.S. as states roll back Covid-19 restrictions. She's urged people to get vaccinated and continue following public health precautions, including wearing masks and practicing social distancing.

"The variants that scare me the most are the ones that haven't been invented as yet ... the more the virus replicates, we will continue to see these escape mutants," Chin-Hong said. "We need global vaccination equity and continued battles against pandemic fatigue."

California is set to lift most Covid restrictions by [15 Jun 2021] but still plans to keep a mask mandate in place.

[1b] India: B.1.617
Date: Fri 9 Apr 2021

https://weather.com/en-IN/india/coronavirus/news/2021-04-10-india-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-named-b1617


India continues to reel under the vicious cycle of the novel coronavirus, with infections sky-rocketing across the country day after day. The present situation is also a double whammy of sorts--while the 2nd wave appears to be rising, health officials also detected a double mutant strain on March [2021]-end that remains in circulation.

Now, the double mutant variant has been scientifically named B.1.617, which contains E484Q and L452R mutations.

As per reports, the variant is found to be common in India, but how many states have it in circulation remains unclear. So far, it has been detected among the positive cases in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab.

Meanwhile, the researchers are also trying to decipher the role of this double mutant variant in the surging cases, especially considering it has been found to be more infectious.

The Indian SARS-Cov-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) has revealed that the B.1.617 variant was 1st detected in the country on [7 Dec 2020]. INSACOG --a group of 10 national laboratories-- has been conducting genomic sequencing of variants in India.

The B.1.617 has now been found in 8 countries. Approximately 70% of the cases are noted to be from India, while other countries that have this mutation include the United Kingdom (23%), Singapore (2%) and Australia (1%). Recently, this strain was also detected in the United States, where its 1st case was reported from a patient in California.

Genomic sequences had previously found these 2 mutations in separate variants, but this is the 1st time the 2 have merged together. As per experts, the characteristics of the 2 individuals strains have been known, but how they would impact the population together is still to be deciphered.

Genomic analysis has revealed that both E484Q and L452R mutations can be a concern of increased infectivity. The double mutation depicts 2 separate spike protein substitutions on this coronavirus strain. The spike protein is basically a part of the virus's outer layer, through which it attaches to the human cells, and invades into the body. With the continuous mutation, the structure of the spike proteins changes, which is also a threat for the vaccines.

The individual strain E484Q is found to be similar to the E484K mutation circulating in Brazil and South Africa. On the other hand, the L452R mutation has been detected in a large number of cases in Maharashtra and some outbreaks in California.

Both these variants can alter the structure of the spike protein, thereby making it more efficient in attaching with the human host cells and multiplying faster. The statement from the ministry highlights that such mutations can result in immune escape and increased infectivity.

The mutation can also create a neutralising impact on the antibodies generated from vaccines or the 1st infection.

So far, India has reported cases of the UK variant, the South African, and the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. States like Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala, Delhi, and Karnataka have reported an increase in the cases originating from different variants.

The authorities have been working continuously to scale up genome sequencing testing methods in order to quickly identify new variants and curb the infection spread.

On the other hand, the cases have been spiking at a faster rate. In just the last 24 hours, India reported more than one lakh [equal to one hundred thousand] cases, and that too for the 4th time in the past 5 days. In terms of vaccination, the country has successfully crossed the 9 crore [equal to 90 million] mark.

Abstract
An ultra-sensitive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid antigen assay (S-PLEX, MesoScale Diagnostics) was evaluated in 250 retrospective and 200 prospective upper respiratory specimens. In samples with cycle threshold under 35, there was 95%-98% positive and 93%-96% negative percent agreement with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. S-PLEX may provide a high-throughput alternative to nucleic acid-based testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed extreme pressure on laboratory testing infrastructure and the supply chain for critical reagents and consumables necessary for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid amplification testing [1, 2]. Alternatives to viral RNA detection, such as antigen testing have been introduced, but have been limited by suboptimal sensitivity and specificity [3-6]. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of an ultra-sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (SARS-CoV-2 S-PLEX, MesoScale Diagnostics [MSD], Rockville, MD) in 450 upper respiratory samples.

Discussion
In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen detection in 450 individuals, and demonstrated similar PPA to RT-PCR for upper respiratory specimens with Ct under 35. A prior retrospective study assessing S-PLEX demonstrated similar performance in frozen adult and pediatric samples [12]. Our study generally corroborates these findings and extends them to a larger and clinically characterized prospective cohort using fresh clinical specimens. The 93% NPA in our study, however, was noted to be lower than the specificity in this prior study and several commercially available antigen assays (NPA 97%-100%) [3-6]. This may be partially explained by differences in patient populations and study design (prospective with consecutive positive samples versus retrospective with selected well-characterized specimens). Further work is required to determine whether antigen-positive, RNA-negative specimens are falsely positive, or represent biologically relevant findings. Repeat/confirmatory testing may be required for specimens with low-positive antigen levels by S-PLEX.

This assay offers a high-throughput, relatively compact SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen testing approach well suited for implementation in high-complexity laboratories, but would not supplant point-of-care rapid testing. We estimate that 2 clinical laboratory scientists can perform around 960 tests in an 8-hour shift, although future advances may increase throughput or reduce turnaround time (currently equal or over 4 hours). Given the observed performance, use of this assay may be envisioned in high-volume and/or surge SARS-CoV-2 testing settings, especially to identify the high-priority group of individuals with Ct under 35 who are most likely to contribute to onward transmission [8-10]. Nonetheless, its lower overall PPA compared with RT-PCR is an assay limitation. Indeed, despite observed late Ct values, 61% (19/31) of false-negative samples were collected on the day of initial diagnosis. Although it remains unclear whether these individuals were infectious, a missed diagnosis could hinder appropriate clinical management. Ultimately, this assay is expected to offer sensitivity between that of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, and may offer a complementary diagnostic option to help mitigate ongoing molecular supply shortages.

Limitations of this study include limited patient follow-up time precluding a full assessment of the relationship between antigen detection and clinical outcomes, limited data about different specimen types and collection media, and lack of a 3rd laboratory method, such as serology, to adjudicate discrepant RT-PCR and antigen results.

In summary, the S-PLEX ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen assay demonstrated comparable PPA to RT-PCR in upper respiratory samples with Ct under 35, suggesting potential use for acute SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. The observed NPA of 93% suggests confirmatory testing may be required for low-positive samples. Further work will be needed to assess the benefit of expanding testing to additional sample types including plasma, perform cost-effectiveness and feasibility analyses of different testing strategies, and assess the potential incremental utility as a prognostic tool for COVID-19.

[3] Children: low level of virus transmission
Date: Sat 10 Apr 2021

https://weather.com/en-IN/india/coronavirus/news/2021-04-11-children-transmit-relatively-less-sars-cov-2-study


A team of researchers has found that children may not be as infectious in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, to other people as previously thought. According to the researchers, including Jared Bullard from the University of Manitoba in Canada, the findings have important public health and clinical implications.

"If younger children are less capable of transmitting infectious virus, daycare, in-person school and cautious extracurricular activities may be safe to continue, with appropriate precautions in place, and with lower risk to childcare staff, educators and support staff than initially anticipated," said Bullard.

For the study published in the CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), a team of 14 researchers analysed samples from 175 children and 130 adults in Manitoba infected with SARS-CoV-2 to see if there was a difference in infectiousness. Using cell cultures of nasopharyngeal swabs, they investigated viral loads in both groups to determine if children were more infectious.

"As an increasing number of jurisdictions consider whether in-school learning, daycares and extracurricular activities should continue or resume, a better understanding of the relative contributions of children and adolescents to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, when compared with adults is essential," the researcher said. "This is particularly important given the increased likelihood of asymptomatic infection in this group," they added.

Abstract
"Background: The role of children in the transmission and community spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. We aimed to quantify the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from children compared with adults.

"Methods: We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from adult and pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and from their contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Manitoba between March and December 2020. We compared viral growth in cell culture, cycle threshold values from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50/mL) between adults and children.

"Results: Among 305 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, 97 samples were from children aged 10 years or younger, 78 were from children aged 11-17 years and 130 were from adults (18 yr or older). Viral growth in culture was present in 31% of samples, including 18 (19%) samples from children 10 years or younger, 18 (23%) from children aged 11-17 years and 57 (44%) from adults (children v. adults, odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.72). The cycle threshold was 25.1 (95% CI 17.7- 31.3) in children 10 years or younger, 22.2 (95% CI 18.3-29.0) in children aged 11-17 years and 18.7 (95% CI 17.9-30.4) in adults (p under 0.001). The median TCID50/mL was significantly lower in children aged 11-17 years (316, interquartile range [IQR] 178-2125) than adults (5620, IQR 1171 to 17 800, p under 0.001). Cycle threshold was an accurate predictor of positive culture in both children and adults (area under the receiver-operator curve, 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93 v. 0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.96, p equal 0.6).

"Interpretation: Compared with adults, children with nasopharyngeal swabs that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were less likely to grow virus in culture, and had higher cycle thresholds and lower viral concentrations, suggesting that children are not the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
