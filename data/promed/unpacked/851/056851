A 33-year-old Indonesian man from Sumatra island died of bird flu on
Thursday [6 Sep 2007], bringing the death toll in the world's
worst-affected nation to 85 and the global toll to 200, health officials said.
The plantation worker died at 2:00 pm (0700 GMT), the doctor treating
him at the state general hospital in the city of Pekanbaru, Azizman
Daad, told AFP. A health ministry official earlier confirmed that the
man was infected with the deadly H5N1 virus, after 2 tests came back positive.
H5N1 is endemic in birds across nearly all of Indonesia. The
archipelago nation has now reported 106 cases overall, including the
85 deaths. Daad said it was not clear whether the man had come into
contact with infected poultry, but he had bought 2 live chickens at a
local market.
The patient was taken to hospital in Pekanbaru on Saturday [1 Sep
2007] and transferred on Monday to the general state hospital, the
facility designated by the government to treat bird flu patients in the region.
Separately, 2 children and an adult on the island of Bali were being
treated as suspected carriers of the virus, said Putu Andrika, from
the bird flu team at Sanglah general hospital in the capital
Denpasar. "They are not in critical condition," Andrika said. Tests
were being carried out to confirm whether they were infected, he added.
The island has reported 2 bird flu deaths in the past month,
triggering fears of an impact on the tourism industry as it recovers
in the wake of deadly bombings carried out by Islamic extremists in
2002 and 2005.
Prior to the latest death, the World Health Organisation had recorded
a human bird flu toll of 199. Besides Indonesia, deaths occurred in
Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Iraq, Laos, Nigeria, Thailand,
Turkey and Vietnam.
