Update: Influenza activity -- United States and worldwide, 19 May-8 Sep 2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------
During 19 May-8 Sep 2013, the United States experienced low levels of seasonal influenza activity overall. Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were detected worldwide and were identified sporadically in the United States. In June [2013], influenza A (H3N2) variant viruses (H3N2)v were first detected in Indiana, and between 18 Jun and 28 Sep 2013, a total of 20 cases of influenza A variant viruses ([H3N2]v and influenza A (H1N1) variant [H1N1]v) were reported from 5 states. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide from 19 May through 28 Sep 2013.

United States
-------------
During 19 May through 28 Sep 2013, WHO and NREVSS [National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System] collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 52 150 respiratory specimens for influenza; 2013 (3.9 per cent) tested positive for influenza.

Of the 2013 specimens positive for influenza in the summer months of 2013, 1403 (70 per cent) were influenza A viruses, and 610 (30 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Influenza B viruses were reported more frequently than influenza A viruses from late May until early June, and influenza A (pH1N1) viruses were more commonly reported than influenza A (H3N2) viruses from mid-June to September. Of the 1403 influenza A viruses, 621 (44 per cent) were subtyped: 402 (65 per cent) were influenza A (pH1N1) viruses, 201 (32 per cent) were influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 18 (3 per cent) were influenza A (H3N2)v viruses. Influenza viruses were reported from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 45 states in all 10 US Department of Health and Human Services regions. The largest number of influenza-positive specimens (971) came from the south eastern United States, followed by the western states, with 505 influenza-positive specimens.

During 19 May through 28 Sep 2013 data indicated that the weekly percentage of outpatient visits influenza-like (ILI)** remained below the national baseline of 2.2 per cent (range: 0.7 per cent-1.2 per cent). The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), as reported by the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System, remained below the epidemic threshold (range: 5.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent). 2 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during 19 May through 28 Sep 2013 were reported; one was associated with an influenza A (pH1N1) virus and one was associated with an influenza A virus for which subtyping was not performed.

** Defined as a temperature of 100 deg F or higher (37.8 deg C or higher), oral or equivalent, and cough and/or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.

Novel influenza A virus infection
---------------------------------
Between 19 May and 28 Sep 2013, a total of 20 cases of influenza A variant viruses (18 [H3N2]v and 2 [H1N1]v) were reported from 5 states (Arkansas [2], Illinois [1], Indiana [14], Michigan [2] and Ohio [1]). The 20 cases reported resulted in one influenza A (H3N2)v-associated hospitalization and no deaths. Although cases have been identified from 5 states, Indiana reported 14 (70 per cent) of the 20 cases. In all 20 cases, contact with swine in the week before illness onset was reported. No ongoing community transmission of these viruses has been detected. The median age of patients was 6.5 years (range: 2-69 years); 65 per cent were female (Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC, unpublished data, 2013).

Worldwide
---------
During 19 May through 28 Sep 2013, typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity occurred in the temperate climate Southern Hemisphere countries. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity began in early August and decreased in mid-September. Influenza A viruses predominated in both countries with influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified more frequently than influenza A (pH1N1) viruses. Influenza B viruses were also identified in both countries. In South Africa, after a peak in influenza activity caused by influenza A (pH1N1) in June, a 2nd, smaller peak was observed in early August because of increased influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B virus circulation. In temperate areas of South America, influenza activity peaked in June and declined through September. Influenza A viruses were reported more frequently than influenza B viruses, and influenza A (pH1N1) was the predominant virus reported by Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in Paraguay.

Influenza activity was reported from countries with tropical influenza seasonality. The overall level of activity compared with previous seasons, and the predominant subtype varied by country. In the Caribbean and Central America, influenza activity peaked in early July and declined during August and September, with cocirculation of influenza A (pH1N1) and influenza A (H3N2) viruses. In tropical South America, influenza A (pH1N1) viruses predominated, with 2 peaks of activity: the 1st in June, primarily the result of activity in Brazil and Columbia, and a 2nd peak in late July, the result of increased activity in Ecuador and Peru. South Asia and Southeast Asia saw a decrease in influenza activity during September. Different combinations of types and subtypes of influenza cocirculated in several countries, including Cambodia, India, China, Viet Nam, and Thailand.

In temperate climate countries in North America and Europe, influenza activity remained low, with small numbers of influenza A (H3N2), influenza A (pH1N1), and influenza B viruses identified. During 19 Feb through 28 Sep 2013, a total of 135 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported (3). No human cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection have been detected outside of China.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
During 19 May through 28 Sep 2013, influenza A (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses cocirculated worldwide. In the United States, similar levels of seasonal influenza viruses were detected compared with summer months of previous years (excluding the 2009 pandemic), and influenza A viruses were predominant.

Although neither the influenza viruses that will predominate nor the severity of influenza-related disease during the 2013-14 season in the United States can be predicted, antigenic characterization of viral isolates submitted during the summer demonstrated that the majority of influenza viruses were antigenically similar to the influenza vaccine strains contained in the 2013-14 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.

Compared with the summer of 2012, fewer human infections with novel influenza A viruses were identified in the United States in the summer of 2013. Since the 1st identification of H3N2v viruses in humans, direct contact with swine has been documented in most cases, but limited person-to-person spread is suspected in a small number. Consistent with the age distribution of patients, serologic studies suggest there is little or no existing cross-reactive antibody to H3N2v in young children, but a substantial proportion of adolescents and younger adults have cross-reactive antibodies. Where community transmission of this virus has not been identified, the potential for this virus to develop the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person is of concern. Rapid and intensive investigation of each novel influenza A case remains necessary to evaluate the spread of disease and the possibility of person-to-person transmission. While seasonal influenza viruses are circulating at low levels, state and local health departments should consider increased specimen collection among patients with ILI who 1) seek care at an ILINet provider; 2) are part of an ILI outbreak among children in child-care or school settings (because these settings were associated with person-to-person H3N2v, virus transmission in 2011); 3) have an unusual or severe presentation of ILI, including hospitalized persons; or 4) have medically attended ILI or acute respiratory infection, especially among children in jurisdictions where H3N2v cases have occurred.

Annual influenza vaccination remains the best method for preventing influenza and its associated complications. For optimal protection against seasonal influenza viruses, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or older each year, regardless of whether the vaccine virus strains have changed since the previous season.

In addition to the types of influenza vaccines available during the last season, several new influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will be available for the 2013-14 season, including a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4), quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4), a trivalent cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3), and a new recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV3).

For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within indications and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. Where more than one type of vaccine is appropriate and available, ACIP has not recommended any one influenza vaccine product over another. Children aged 6 months-8 years who are being vaccinated for the 1st time should receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine. For children aged 6 months-8 years who have received influenza vaccination before, health-care providers should consult the ACIP guidelines to assess whether 1 or 2 doses are required.

To prevent influenza and its associated complications, influenza vaccination is recommended in all persons aged 6 months or older. Year-round influenza surveillance provides critical information for planning interventions to prevent and control influenza, developing vaccine recommendations and antiviral treatment guidance, and presenting information to the media and public regarding the progress and severity of the influenza season.

[The United States experienced low levels of influenza activity during 19 May through 28 Sep 2013, and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (pH1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses were identified sporadically. 20 cases of influenza A variant viruses (influenza A [H3N2]v and influenza A [H1N1]v) were detected in 5 states, all of which were associated with swine contact. The majority of recent seasonal influenza viruses are antigenically similar to the influenza vaccine for the 2013-14 season.

Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from humans. A variant virus (human isolate) might have the M gene alone or the M gene plus other genes from the influenza A (pH1N1) virus, along with other genetic changes. Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population have significant antigenic and genetic differences from influenza A (H3N2) viruses circulating in swine.
