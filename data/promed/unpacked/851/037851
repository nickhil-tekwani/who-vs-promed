In a tragic incident, 13 Sambar deer kept in Sayaji Baug zoo died one after another within 3 weeks.

The zoo officials said that these deer were suffering from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and only one baby deer that was away from the herd managed to survive.

The Sambar deer, the largest deer in India, were kept in a large enclosure adjacent to that of spotted deer near the fountain. Their deaths came to light a couple of days ago when the expenses recurred on their treatment were brought to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation's (VMC) standing committee.

[The Sayaji Baug zoo is located in (the city) Vadodara, Gujarat State, India (map at https://goo.gl/maps/2tMcYngDThDVkGbs7). According to the website of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, the Sayaji Baug Zoo maintains 212 mammals, belonging to 18 species, including 9 species of ungulates. The herbivores are kept on 25 enclosures (https://vmc.gov.in/ZooDetails.aspx).

Sambar (_Rusa unicolor_, picture at https://creatures-of-the-world.fandom.com/wiki/Sambar_Deer) is a large deer native to the Indian subcontinent, southern China, and Southeast Asia.

Since the animals were, reportedly, treated during the 3-week-long health episode, their illness does not seem to have been sudden. Fatal FMD is mostly acute and more common in juveniles. It is mostly caused by cardiac failure, with typical lesions.

Attributing, retrospectively, the death of a large number of (adult?) animals to infection with the FMD virus will require epidemiological, clinical, and gross pathology evidence while excluding other possible etiologies, infectious and non-infectious. It will also be helpful to obtain information about the health status of other FMD-susceptible species kept on the zoo premises, such as the spotted deer, kept close to the sambars. - Mod.AS
