[Another RFI from French Polynesia, about the practices regarding the
International Health Regulations in Pacific Island countries and
territories - TK.
What is done in practice against the diseases actually submitted to the
International Health Regulations (i.e. cholera, plague and yellow fever)?
Is there any particular measure taken at the potential entry points
(international airports, harbours) in the different Pacific Island
countries and territories? It seems nothing in particular is done in the
French territories of the Pacific (i.e. French Polynesia, New Caledonia and
Wallis and Futuna). What is the situation in the other Islands?
[To our knowledge*, the International Health Regulations (IHR) are being
revised. As stated in ProMED-mail - 23 Jan 1998 - International health
regulations, revisions, from the WER Vol. 73 No. 4, January 23, 1998: "The
[new IHR will provide a mechanism for immediate notification of all
disease outbreaks of urgent international importance. The disease outbreaks
will be characterized initially by clinical syndrome rather than specific
diagnosis, in order to expedite notification. An outbreak will be
notifiable under the IHR only if both of the following conditions are
met:(1) it corresponds to the case definition of one of the specified
syndromes, and (2) it represents an event of urgent international
importance."
We would like to underline that the syndromic approach is fully in line
with the concept of fever surveillance, for example, that we and others
(members of the Coordinating body of the PPHSN in particular) have been
advocating on PACNET recently.
* As far as we know, in the questionnaire (quarantine and/or disembarkation
card) completed by passengers travelling to Pacific Island countries or
territories, there is a question asking whether they have been travelling
in the previous 2(?) weeks in regions of the world were yellow fever is
present (i.e., Africa, South America). We suppose the purpose of it is to
check yellow fever immunization status of the passengers coming from places
affected by the disease (but we are unclear about what might happen if, for
example, a person is not immunized). Maybe some of the PACNET participants
from the Pacific Islands can clarify, or give us more details about what is
done in their country or territory. - TK
