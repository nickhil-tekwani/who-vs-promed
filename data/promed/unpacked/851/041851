It is a hard call. This would be a lot harder if it was a communicable
disease such as TB that poses a clear threat to third parties. Still, I
think that you will be facing a rabid person, who will pose a substantial
threat to those around him, both family and health care providers. This
would provide a public health rationale for the involuntary treatment.
Ed Richards

I have been Health Officer in cities and counties in south Texas and in
Kansas during outbreaks of Rabies. It is amazing how dense some people can
be when they don't want to understand. If this man were a dog we would put
him in quarantine for six months, strict quarantine with no human contact.
You might look at your laws and see if there is any mandatory distinction
between humans and other domestic animals. If you give this guy the choice
between the immunization and six months isolation, he might become more
cooperative. :-)
Of course, biologically the six months is not long enough in humans. There
was a young girl in Houston 10 or 15 years ago who died of rabies that she
appeared to have acquired in Asia 8 years before her death. This is
another point to discuss with the individual exposed. He would be a threat
to himself and others for years. At the least, household members and
healthcare providers who are exposed to him on an ongoing basis should be
informed and given pre-exposure prophylaxis with boosters just like animal
handlers and veterinary personnel who work in rabies endemic areas. This
too may encourage the individual to cooperate a little better. Most people
do not understand that the public health authority can do some things very
publicly. They think of this as a private medical issue with confidential
medical records.
Another way to go at this is through other types of public health
authority. Are there any children who are exposed to this possibly rabid
man? With this level of exposure and a month having elapsed since he was
first exposed, his close contacts are in danger. We do not know reliably
how long he would be shedding virus before symptoms develop. However, we
can say that he would be infectious for days before being seriously ill and
it might be much longer. Having any household or visitation contact with
children would be a direct threat to the children. Even if the judge
doesn't believe in forcing treatment, he might be persuaded to take action
to protect any children.
If he continues to refuse immunization, this man should be treated like a
typhoid carrier. He has a known exposure with a fair probability of
developing disease in the next few months. He should be restricted from
any activity that might spread the disease during the prodrome. Such
restrictions should include forbidding him to do child care, medical care,
or any other activity that brings him into intimate contact with other
people or other susceptible animals.

All human beings have the basic right to refuse any medical treatment for
whatever reason. Humans can also elect to take risks, as they regularly do
with smoking. In my opinion, you would have little chance of getting a
court order, unless you prove that the patient is not in a condition to
consent to treatment. Disagreeing with you is not proof of psychiatric
illness.
In general, it's better to reason with the patient. I would suggest
enrolling help from your staff physician. You could also suggest that the
patient discuss the situation with his own physician.

The story provided in Dr. Eidson's report is very suggestive of rabies in a
skunk who bit dog and man and showed unusual behavior. We here in Thailand
see in our OPD some 30 new animal bites daily and have never encountered a
case of refusal under such conditions. It seems that Thai farmers and even
slum dwellers are somewhat more educated in this field and certainly more
reasonable. This case reminds me of encounters I had in previous lives
with patients who refuse blood transfusion in the presence of severe shock
due to blood loss. There is little you can do unless it is a child and you
are prepared to get a court order. The obligation of the health care
professional attending such a patient as you have on hand in New York,
would be to inform him fully, inform the family to see if they could not
influence the man and leave it at that.

officials.
The answer will depend upon whether the individual is insured or not, but
if he is not, then surely the bill will be paid by the same people who pay
for cancer treatments for smokers who continue to smoke against all
reasonable health advice; for liver transplants for those who knowingly and
despite doctors' advice destroy their livers by alcohol; and treatments for
AIDS patients who knowingly have unprotected and dangerous sex: the
American public.
Moderator PC also writes:
>Would anyone care to provide us with ... a short description of the
limitations of public health officials in terms of compliance.
The limitations "in terms of compliance" are set by the rights that
individuals have over their own persons to be free against the coercive
interference of the state, even when that interference is "for their own
good."

From: David Dassey <ddassey@dhs.co.la.ca.us>

The legal authority for communicable disease control in the USA resides at
the state level; an excellent reference for this is the _Public Health Law
Manual_, 2nd edition, by Frank P Grad, published by the American Public
Health Association 1990. In most states these laws and regulations have
not been updated in many decades, while the science of disease diagnosis
and control has advanced markedly. What has changed over the last 30 years
is judicial interpretation of public health laws. Where it was once
acceptable to incarcerate women simply for frequenting bars near military
bases, such detention would never be acceptable today.
Thus there may be differences state by state in what can be done with the
man exposed to rabies who rejects post-exposure prophylaxis. What I would
probably do in this case is place the man under a quarantine order for the
incubation period of rabies, and require he remain at home at all times and
submit to routine examinations. If/when symptoms develop the order would
be changed to an order for isolation; at this point he would be
hospitalized anyhow. The admitting facility would know in advance of the
suspected diagnosis, and standard precautions for body fluids would apply.
At least there would be no inadvertant exposures of health care workers
needing their own post-exposure treatment.
The near-universal fatal outcome of the disease and the near-perfect
efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis makes me wonder if the man is
refusing care out of old misperceptions of rabies vaccination. How many
times do I still hear people and the media remark of "the painful series of
rabies shots in the stomach"!

Maybe you should just provide him a tape of someone suffering from the

From: "Thomas P. Bleck MD FCCM" <tpb9k@virginia.edu>
This is a straightforward if uncomfortable issue. Unless you can convince
a judge that the patient is incompetent to make the decision about
post-exposure prophylaxis, and have a guardian appointed by the court to
make it for him, you cannot force him to accept treatment. There is
enormous legal precedent for a patient's right to refuse treatment, even
for fatal disorders, and that refusal by itself is not evidence of
incompetence. If the refusal were part of a larger delusional system (such
as a belief in invulnerability), court-ordered treatment might be possible.
The subsequent cost of his care will not be considered. As far as I can
tell, the only circumstance that would lead a judge to compel treatment for
a competent adult would be one in which the patient poses a serious risk to
other individuals, such as a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis. I
doubt that the potential for the patient to spread rabies if he develops it
would be considered a sufficiently pressing danger to convince the judge,
but one could attempt that argument.
