Foot-and-mouth disease spreads as Malawi has no vaccine
-------------------------------------------------------
At least 70 000 head of cattle in the cattle heartland of the Lower
Shire Valley are at risk as an outbreak of the livestock
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is spreading fast in the area. According
to Dr Ben Chimera, the acting head of Animal Health Services in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Malawi has not vaccine to
contain the spread of the disease. "We have ordered a consignment from
Botswana and we expect it to arrive in the country by next week," he
said.

Chimera said the disease, that was first noted in the eastern side of
Chikwawa district -- some 50 km [31 mi] from Blantyre, a fortnight
ago, has started spreading to other parts of the Lower Shire [see
comment]. Although the disease rarely directly affects humans it has a
devastating effect on the economy. "Many countries do not accept not
only meat and meat product exports but also any other export,
including tobacco and cotton, from country that has cases of FMD," he
said.

Already, according to Dr Chimera, the outbreak has affected supply of
milk and beef in the city of Blantyre and other surrounding
districts.

FMD, otherwise known as foot or hoof-and-mouth disease (aphtae
epizooticae), is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that
affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild bovines,
according to the information-sharing website Wikipedia. The virus
causes a high fever for 2 or 3 days, followed by blisters inside the
mouth and on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness. Susceptible
animals include cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs, antelope, deer,
and bison. It has also been known to infect hedgehogs, elephants, and
llamas.

[According to Malawi's semi-annual report for January-June 2011, a
single outbreak of FMD serotype SAT2 was recorded in Chikwawa already
in June 2011, affecting cattle. Reportedly, it involved 5075
susceptible animals, 11 cases, no mortality; 4430 cattle were "ring
vaccinated" (around the disease focus).

The Lower Shire Valley is situated in the Southern Region of Malawi.
For the location of Chikwawa and Blantyre districts, see
http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/malawi.pdf. The
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Malawi can be seen at
http://healthmap.org/r/1m1k.

Malawi mentions routine vaccination as one of the control measures
included in its FMD control programme. No vaccination statistics are
available for 2011. During 2010, 14 893 cattle were, reportedly,
routinely vaccinated. This means a fraction of the country's cattle
population which is (2010 figures) 1 069 854 head.

According to the Malawi page in the WRLFMD (Pirbright) website, the
previous outbreak of serotype SAT 2 in Malawi was reported in 2008.
FMD SAT 1 was reported in 2000-2001, FMD SAT 3 in 1976, and FMD-A in
1981.

Information on the FMDV serotype involved in the current epizootic is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
