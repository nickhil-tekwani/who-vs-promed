On Monday [16 Nov 2020], 3 more local government areas [LGAs] in the state of Enugu were suspected to have recorded yellow fever outbreaks. This came as the Igbo-Eze North LGA, where the outbreak of the disease was 1st reported, directed residents of the LGA and nearby communities to stop eating beef, following strange deaths of cows in some communities in the area.

Enugu had been battling to contain the outbreak of yellow fever in 2 communities of Ette Uno and Umuopu in Igbo-Eze North LGA, which reportedly claimed 52 lives between October [2020] (when the outbreak was1st reported) and November 2020. The state government also confirmed it had received reports of strange deaths within communities in Nsukka, Isi-Uzo, and Igbo-Etiti LGAs.

A statement by the commissioner of health, Professor Ikechukwu Obi, released on Sunday night [15 Nov 2020], disclosed that the ministry's rapid response team, LGA rapid response teams in collaboration with international and national partners, had visited the communities to take samples for testing. The statement, in part, read, "Following the confirmed cases of yellow fever in Igbo Eze North LGA of Enugu State and the concerted efforts to control the situation in the LGA by the state government, stakeholders, and partners, reports have also been received of strange deaths within communities in Nsukka, Isi-Uzo, and Igbo-Etiti LGAs.

"The new set of samples from these LGAs has been sent to the national reference laboratory at the federal capital territory Abuja for a thorough and complete examination to determine conclusively the reasons for this new set of reports, and the results are expected back early this week."

Professor Obi advised that people should keep their environment clean and remove mosquito breeding sites around their homes. He further stated, "Yellow fever vaccination is not for treatment of yellow fever; it is for prevention of yellow fever. If you have been recently vaccinated against yellow fever, you do not need to be vaccinated again."

Meanwhile, the Benue state government on Monday [16 Nov 2020] confirmed that the strange illness that had claimed 20 lives at Okpeilo-Otukpa in the Ogbadibo LGA of the state was yellow fever. The state commissioner for information and orientation, Mrs Ngunna Adingi, stated this at the end of the State Executive Council meeting. Mrs Adingi said, "The results from which they got the test; we found out that people actually died from yellow fever. Our appeal to the people of Ogbadibo is that they should make themselves available for vaccination."

[The above report indicates that yellow fever (YF) occurrence is expanding, with the LGAs now increased to 3. YF occurrence in Benue state is now confirmed. The Benue state case count may be an underestimate. The state's epidemiologist reported that 26 people, 2 females and 24 males, had fallen ill with the sickness. He also indicated that the state is planning to initiate a yellow fever campaign (see Yellow fever - Africa (16): Nigeria (BE) susp. 20201115.7945914). One hopes that the campaign in Benue will be initiated very soon. YF outbreaks can quickly get out of hand. The above report does not indicate if Enugu state is planning a vaccination campaign. Given the apparent spread of the disease, that would be prudent. - Mod.TY
