Colombia: First Cases of Hantavirus Infection Reported in the North
-------------------------------------------------
Health authorities detected the first cases of hantavirus infection in the
north of Colombia. These first Colombian cases were seen in agricultural
communities of Cotorra and Cienaga de Oro, as well as in Lorica and Cordoba
and in the rural zone of San Marcos in the department of Sucre.

[There is considerable diversity among the hantaviruses present in the
South American region. The rodent host (the cotton rat, _Sigmodon
hispidus_) of Black Creek Canal virus, a hantavirus associated with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome elsewhere, has been recorded in northern
Colombia. Similarly, the rodent hosts of Rio Segundo virus and Cano
Delgadito virus, _Reithrodontomys mexicanus_ and _Sigmodon alstoni_,
respectively, have also been recorded in the same region, although neither
virus has been associated previously with outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. Further information would be appreciated concerning the identity
of the hantavirus or hantaviruses responsible for this outbreak. - Mod.CP]
