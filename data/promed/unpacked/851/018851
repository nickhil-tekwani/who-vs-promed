Russia reports bird flu in 6th region
-----------------------------------------
A bird flu outbreak in Russia appeared to be spreading westward on Monday
[15 Aug 2005], after officials confirmed the virus had broken out in a 6th
region since the epidemic struck the country in mid-July 2005.
It was unclear whether the virus found in the Urals region of Chelyabinsk
was the deadly H5N1 strain that has killed more than 50 people in Asia
since 2003. It has been confirmed in a number of Siberian regions and
neighboring Kazakhstan.
Interfax news agency quoted Andrei Gasilov, vice-governor of Chelyabinsk,
as saying the virus had killed 60 birds in the village of Oktyabrskoye on
the Kazakh border since Saturday [13 Aug 2005].
Other Russian regions hit by the flu include Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Omsk,
Kurgan and Altai.
Chelyabinsk, which borders Kurgan on the east side of the Ural mountains
dividing Europe and Asia, is the westernmost region to have been struck so
far. The Emergencies Ministry in Moscow, contacted by Reuters, could not
confirm the Chelyabinsk outbreak.
Although no humans have yet been affected, there are fears the disease
could spread to humans on the Eurasian landmass, possibly unleashing a
global influenza pandemic.
Interfax quoted Gasilov as saying domestic birds were being culled in the
village to prevent the virus, which has killed more than 10 000 birds
countrywide, from spreading further.
Officials said wild birds, increasingly active in August as they prepare to
migrate to warmer regions in Europe, Asia and America, were to blame.
"Results of epizootic checks have shown that they (migrant birds) are the
main source of infection," Ria-Novosti news agency quoted an official with
the Novosibirsk state consumer rights watchdog as saying.

Russian bird flu outbreak advances towards Europe
-----------------------------------------------
Russia cordoned off roads and slaughtered hundreds of birds on Monday [15
Aug 2005] to contain the advance of a bird flu epidemic towards Western Europe.
The outbreak, previously confined to 5 remote areas of Siberia, has now
struck a major industrial region -- Chelyabinsk -- in the Ural mountains,
which separate Asia from Europe. "All ill and infected birds are being
slaughtered there," the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.
It was unclear whether the virus found in Chelyabinsk was the deadly H5N1
strain that has killed more than 50 people in Asia since 2003 and has hit
Russia's Siberia as well as neighboring Kazakhstan and Mongolia since
mid-July 2005.
Carried by flocks of wild birds migrating from Siberia to warmer regions,
the virus has been steadily moving westward through the regions of
Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Omsk, Kurgan and Altai.
Chelyabinsk, separated from European Russia by the Ural mountains, and
technically still in Siberia, is the westernmost region to have been struck
so far. It lies about 1000 km (600 miles) from the region where the 1st flu
outbreak was reported.
Although no humans have yet been affected, there are fears the disease
could spread to humans on the Eurasian landmass, possibly unleashing a
global influenza pandemic.
Media reported that roads leading to the infected village of Oktyabrskoye
in Chelyabinsk had been cordoned off to prevent the virus from spreading
further.
In other affected regions, police boosted road checks, and 400 domestic
birds were culled in Chelyabinsk alone to block the virus that has killed
more than 10 000 birds countrywide.
There was no word on Monday [15 Aug 2005] on the situation in Kazakhstan
and Mongolia, where bird flu has also been registered along their sprawling
borders with Russian Siberia.

2 large regions in Western Siberia hit hardest by bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
2 major regions in Western Siberia are conducting measures to localize bird
flu, a regional official said on Monday [15 Aug 2005].
More than 18 000 head of poultry have been slaughtered in the Tyumen
region, where bird flu was identified in 6 populated areas, an official
from the local Emergency Situations Ministry said. He added that other
measures were being taken to prevent the disease from spreading, such as
quarantining affected farms and stopping unauthorized personnel from
entering them.
A local official in the Altai territory said 10 regions had been hit by the
virus. However, he added that no new cases had been registered in 9 of the
14 affected villages. The official said migrating birds were thought to
have spread the infection, and so the source would disappear when they left
when cold weather arrived in fall. He said measures to eliminate the
disease and prevent it from spreading were continuing in the territory.
No cases of people falling ill with the virus have been registered.

[Russia's last follow-up report to the OIE on the HPAI outbreak there was
sent on 5 Aug 2005, notifying of cases in 3 villages in Novosibirsk. A new
update is due to assess the accuracy of the media news on the alleged
spread of the virus westwards into 5 additional regions (oblasts). - Mod.AS]
