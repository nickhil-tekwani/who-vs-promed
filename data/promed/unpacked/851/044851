Dead bantam chickens found on riverbank in Aichi
-----------------------------------------------------
6 dead bantam chickens were found Sunday on a riverbank in Shitara, Aichi
Prefecture, along with 5 live ones, officials said. The Aichi government is
checking the birds to see whether the deaths are related to bird flu.

The police and officials of Shitara found the birds on a bank of the Sakai
River, after a man who came to fish in the area reported to local police
that he had found some dead chickens, the officials said.

Japan finds 6th crow with deadly bird flu
-------------------------------------------
Local authorities in western Japan said Saturday that a 6th crow had been
found to have contracted the deadly bird flu amid worries the black birds
may become a new conduit for the disease.

The crow was found in the town of Tamba, near Japan's ancient capital of
Kyoto, about 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of Tokyo, said a prefecture
(state) official on condition of anonymity.

Since last week, 4 crows infected with the lethal H5N1 strain of the bird
flu virus have been found in and around the farming village. One more in
nearby Osaka prefecture (state) also tested positive for the disease.

Further tests will be done on the latest crow to determine whether it had
the H5N1 strain.

Officials are concerned wild crows could spread the virus, which has killed
22 people in Vietnam and Thailand and killed and forced the culling of 100
million birds throughout Asia.

2 poultry farms in Tamba suffered outbreaks of the avian flu during
February 2004. Officials believe at least some of the infected crows
contracted the disease after wandering into contaminated pens at Asada
Nosan, the larger of the 2 farms.

No humans have fallen ill with the disease in Japan, but it has led to the
deaths or extermination of more than 300 000 birds in the country.

Chickens die in Chiang Mai; Uttaradit hit by flu outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Fears of a resurgence of bird flu rose yesterday as more than 20 000
chickens died in Chiang Mai's Sansai district and avian flu was found in
Uttaradit.

Theera Adandworapanya, a Chiang Mai-based livestock officer, said that the
dead chickens had been buried at the back of a farm to prevent the spread
of avian flu.

Tissue samples have been sent for examination to the Upper Northern Animal
Forensic and Research Centre in Lampang, and results are expected to come
out in a few days, he said.

Reporters were denied access to the farm for fear that news would reflect
badly on the province.

In Uttaradit, the provincial authority has ordered chicken culling on farms
within one kilometre of the farm in Muang district where chickens tested
positive for avian flu. A provincial livestock official expected about 2900
to be culled

Jintana Yimyanyong, the owner of the flu-infected farm, said that 2209
chickens on her farm had been culled and she had received Baht 40 [USD
1.014]-a-head compensation. She has invested more than Baht 300 000 [USD
7608.17] in the farm, and the compensation was not enough to cover that
cost. "I will stop raising chickens for a while. What I have to do now is
take my husband and 2 sons to hospital for bird-flu tests," she said
