Danish officials have caught up with an outbreak of salmonellosis,
which has been spreading since February 2008. Danish food safety
officials have found salmonella in pork produced at the Horsens
slaughterhouse run by Danish Crown. The bacteria were found in a
consignment of meat that was intended for the Finnish and Swedish markets.

Britta Wiander, head inspector of the import and market supervision
unit of the Finnish Food Safety Authority (EVIRA), says that
legislation protects Finland very well against tainted imported meat.
"Before the meat is sent to Finland it must be checked for
salmonella. A laboratory statement has to come with the meat," Wiander says.

Finland has special permission from the European Union to implement
tighter regulations than the rest of the EU. There is little
salmonellosis in Finland, and most Finns who are infected with it
catch the disease during travel abroad.

The discovery at Danish Crown does not explain the whole epidemic,
nor does it mean that Danish Crown would be the original source of
the problem, it is most likely that the contamination occurred
already before the animal came to the slaughterhouse. Danish Crown
packs meats for export, so its meat cannot be responsible for the
epidemic raging in Denmark, where more than 1000 people have been
infected in 2008, and 6 have died.

Denmark is the world's largest exporter of pork, but the Typhimurium
U292 strain of _Salmonella_, which is the one that has been spreading
in Denmark, has not been detected in other countries. Danish
officials have been desperately looking for a source, going through
refrigerators of those who are ill, checking their credit card
records, and taking samples at various food processing plants.

[As noted in the posting, Danish Crown does not distribute meat in
Denmark so it is not the direct source of this large outbreak. It
seems reasonable that pork is the Danish source but only the "smoking
pork" was for export. - Mod.LL]
