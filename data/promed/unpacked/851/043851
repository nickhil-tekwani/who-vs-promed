From: Henry Wilde <fmedhwl@chulkn.car.chula.ac.th>

_Vibrio vulnificus_ infection is not uncommon in the warm waters of SE
Asia. The bacteremic form is often seen in compromised hosts, mostly
elderly with chronic liver disease. The hemorrhagic bullae are almost
diagnostic if local infection is present. Such patients are often treated
inappropriately with aminoglycosides and tertiary cephalosporins.
Doxycycline and chloramphenicol are often more effective in this region.
Mortality of the septicemic form is high.

[Two additional points: [1 A number of contributors have pointed out the
error in the specific epithet designation for this organism in the posting
cited above. The organism is _Vibrio vulnificus_, not _V. vulnificans_.
[2 Martin Hugh-Jones has pointed out that this organism may extend its
range as a result of global warming. - Mod.ES
