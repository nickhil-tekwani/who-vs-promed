Re:
>"How about the IVIG [intravenous immunoglobulin usage experience in
other countries (especially in Malaysia)"?
In the Sarawak cases, the following is the clinical impression of some of
the pediatricians who were involved with the acute management of the ill
cases; I hope it may be useful for those who need to know.
(No case control study was done under the circumstances to prove efficacy
of IG in preventing deaths. There is a need to review the records of all
the survivors given IVIG to see if they are different clinically from those
who died with or without IVIG).

The most useful intervention seem to be the use of Human Immunoglobulin in
high risk groups 1-2 gm/kg over 8-10 hrs.
High risk group defined as:
- young <2yrs (oldest death - 4yrs old)
- high fever
- poor oral intake
- vomiting (diarrhoea not important)
- subtle altered sensorium - tiredness, less responsive, less active
(mothers and nurses are good monitors!)
- aseptic meningitis
- acute flaccid paralysis +/- focal neurological signs.
The doctors use 1gm/kg first unless the child is very ill or have signs of
acute flaccid paralysis/aseptic meningitis.
In the ill cases 2gm/kg was started immediately.
Monitor for response - fever lysis and child becoming more alert and active.
If none, repeat 1gm/kg next day.
Lumbar puncture is recommended even in the absence of clinical signs of CNS
involvement.
Echo for heart function (LV especially) is vital as Immunoglobulin is found
to be most effective in cases BEFORE there is echo evidence of
decreased/abnormal contractility.
The clinical impression is that the virus affects the CNS and then the heart.
Tachycardia of >200 is ominous, but unstable /labile HR were noted (from
tachy to normal).
No other significant ECG changes were noted.
The terminal event seems to be sudden asystole.
BP is maintained till terminal.
The use of Dopamine, Dobutamine, (10mcro each), amidorone (vasodilator
effect) and Nitroprusside was tried by the cardiologist - seemed to prolong
life without improving mortality, i.e. patient still died once the cardiac
muscle failed.
Cardiac enzymes were raised in some deaths, as well as some of the
survivors, so are thought to be not predictive.
Blood gases - mean anion gap on admission 18.7 (9.3-37.3).
Ventilation is not a problem (high pressures were not needed), Pavulon was
used for paralysis only for those fighting the ventilator, unless pulmonary
edema develops.
IV fluids - care - danger of overload and pulmonary edema.
----------------
Please try to collect as much CSF/blood postmortem [as possible for
freezing for future studies - Professor Jane Cardosa of Unimas [University
of Malaysia, Sarawak found CSF (in the absence of heart muscle/brain
tissue) to be the most "productive" for viral culture/studies in the
outbreak in Sarawak.
Please consider dual infections, or a second virus infection acting
abnormally in the wake of a widespread HMD/entero virus outbreak in the
community [HMD = hand, foot & mouth disease.
