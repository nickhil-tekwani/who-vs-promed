LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS URGED TO CHECK HERDS FOR ANTHRAX
-----------------------------------------------------
BISMARCK - North Dakota's state veterinarian says the anthrax outbreak in
the northeastern part of the state is "a storm we will have to weather out.
Anthrax is a warm weather disease," said Dr. Larry Schuler. "Once we get
into fall and cooler temperatures, we will see the outbreak stop."
In the meantime, Schuler is urging livestock producers in the affected area
to frequently check their animals and to immediately report any sudden
deaths to their veterinarian. The center of the outbreak is in Griggs,
Steele, Traill, Grand Forks and Pembina counties in eastern North Dakota.
Schuler said, however, that a single case has been confirmed in Hettinger
County in southwestern North Dakota, and he said producers there should
also be checking animals closely and frequently.
The death toll from anthrax in North Dakota this year - an estimated 120 to
150 animals so far - is more than all the fatalities from the disease in
the past 10 years. Between 1989 and 1999, the state recorded a total of 24
anthrax cases. Schuler said most of this year's deaths have been in cattle,
but several horses and bison have also died.
Larry Shirley, state epidemiologist with the North Dakota Department of
Health said there is little concern about the chance of human exposure to
the disease. Isolated cases of anthrax in animals are reported almost every
year in North Dakota, but there has been no human case of anthrax here
since 1978.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other authorities have
emphasized that proper disposal of carcasses and surrounding soil is very
important in preventing further spread of the disease. Depending on
circumstances, carcasses should be buried or preferably burned.
Dr. Susan Keller, deputy state veterinarian, said livestock owners should
contact a local veterinarian to investigate any unexplained deaths in their
herds. She said dead cattle should not be moved until anthrax has been
ruled out in order to minimize the spread of infectious material. A vaccine
is available to minimize losses in high-risk herds, and has been approved
by the state veterinarian for use during this time.
The outbreak is not confined to North Dakota. Minnesota, South Dakota and
Nebraska have all reported livestock fatalities. Manitoba officials said
Monday that approximately 30 livestock deaths from anthrax have been confirmed.

[The reason for this large number of cases is still obscure. The area rains
& flooding will have floated spores up from old buried cases but until
someone can find a spore-positive cow grave in the area this can only be
speculation; Peter Turnbull found such a 60 year old grave in Dorset, UK, a
few years ago -- we are still looking. The claim of soil multiplication has
never been demonstrated except in sterile soil (by Minette & Dhanda in
1944) so present thinking is that there is spore persistence in the soil.
Presently burning has been forbidden in the area because of the risk of
forest fires.
We greatly appreciate Susan Keller forwarding this authoritative report to
us. -Mod.MHJ
