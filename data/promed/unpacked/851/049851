Comment on: "Influenza (31): USA (WA, NV, CO) surveillance"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Dr Wilson's comments on influenza outbreak [surveillance] pointed out the difficulty of an early warning system for influenza-like illness outbreaks. The Seattle Fire Department has attempted to track flu-like symptoms in real-time from contacts firefighters have with patients and compare those to other surveillance sources such as the UW Virology Lab weekly reports [University of Washington Laboratory reports: http://depts.washington.edu/rspvirus/].

We are also using a tool to give e-mail alerts to Fire Department upper management and public health when symptoms exceed certain thresholds. Again, this is done in real time as the symptom data is collected. We are not using a clinical case definition for the types of symptoms we are capturing because the intent is to detect novel events that may not fit a case definition. The system we used accurately detected and tracked the outbreaks of H1N1 in 2009.

14-day moving averages of symptoms are posted on our web site each day and might be another useful source for early detection of outbreaks. Here is the link to the daily reports:
http://www2.seattle.gov/fire/sitfound/default.asp.

The site also has background information and research that I have conducted on infectious disease early warning systems. If other sources -- like ED visit data -- could be combined with our field reports there might be better information for public health officials to be more proactive. It's not that hard or expensive to do -- it just requires the willingness to do it.
