-----------------------------------------------
The suspected foci in Jaraguari (Mato Grosso do Sul state) and Mosqueiro
(Para state) were of NDV, with a pathogenicity index of less than 0.7.
Regarding the cases in Manaus (Amazonas state) and Lambari d'Oeste (Mato
Grosso state), these were in non-commercial [domestically reared] poultry.
Up to the present, there has not been any outbreak of NDV in commercial
poultry.
