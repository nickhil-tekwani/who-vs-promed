In ProMED Digest Tue 17 Sep 2002 Volume 2002: Number 257,
Listeriosis - USA (Multistate) (02) (posting 20020917.5334),the
following statement appears as one of the recommendations [from the
FDA news release - Mod.LL] under "People at risk for listeriosis and
their family members or individuals preparing food for them should
take the following precautions:
"Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain
unpasteurized milk."
This implies that pasteurization inactivates _Listeria monocytogenes_.
While it is true that many organisms are killed during regular
pasteurization, not all are. Pasteurization inactivates tubercle
bacilli and was [originally - Mod.LL] the major reason for using it
to process milk. It does not result in sterile milk. An unopened
container of regular pasteurized milk placed in the refrigerator for
about 5-7 days will show this.
Perhaps some are mistaking regular pasteurization with "Ultra high
temperature (UHT) Processing Method" which, when properly done,
results in sterile milk which can be kept at room temperatures for
weeks and even months.
With the increased numbers of individuals with compromised immune
systems, it would seem prudent that all liquid milk for human
consumption be required by Public Heath Law to be "Ultra High
Temperature (UHT) Processed".
Bergey's Manual addresses strains of Listeria that survive regular
pasteurization or high temperature-short time (HTST) processing.

[ProMED-mail agrees with Dr. Hyde that pasteurization is not
equivalent to sterilization. Certainly, raw or inadequately
pasteurized milk can be a vehicle for a variety of pathogens
including species of salmonella, listeria, brucella, and yersinia as
well as _E. coli_ (1). It is also the case that _L. monocytogenes_
is considered to be more heat-resistant than many other bacterial
pathogens. However, it appears that the pasteurization process is
adequate to kill _L. monocytogenes_ (2). This reference from the CDC
summarizes the information is this regard and is reprinted below.
However, even if a large inoculum were present and some organisms
survived the process, pasteurized milk and cream products are
refrigerated and have a short shelf life, so that any
cold-temperature replication (which can occur with this pathogen) is
not likely to produce an adequate inoculum.
Be that as it may, Fleming, et al. (citation 6 in the CDC reference)
did report an outbreak of listeriosis in Massachusetts in 1983 for
which, despite no evidence of improper pasteurization in the plant,
pasteurized milk was implicated epidemiologically (no pasteurized
milk cultures were positive) as the source, albeit a "distinctly
uncommon one." Despite the rarity of cases of human listeriosis
linked to pasteurized milk, researchers in Spain (3) and Turkey (4)
have reported pasteurized milk samples from which Listeria was
isolated.
One cannot argue with Dr. Hyde's suggestion that all milk for human
consumption should be ultrapasteurized. It may be even more prudent
for the recommendation to be made that for individuals at substantial
risk for morbidity and mortality from this infection, such as the
cellularly immunocompromised person (i.e., organ transplant
recipients, those receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids) or the
pregnant woman consume only ultrapasteurized milk products.

Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Update -- Listeriosis and Pasteurized Milk
(MMWR 1988; 37: 764-766)
_Listeria monocytogenes_ can be cultured from approximately 5 percent
of raw (unpasteurized) milk samples, and case reports have shown that
disease in humans can be caused by consumption of unpasteurized
contaminated milk (1-4). Other reports suggesting that _L.
monocytogenes_ is relatively resistant to heat have raised concern
about the effectiveness of pasteurization for eliminating this
organism from milk (1, 5).
In an outbreak of listeriosis that occurred in Massachusetts in 1983,
pasteurized whole or 2 percent milk was implicated as the source of
infection (6). An inspection of the milk-producing plant detected no
apparent breach in the pasteurization process, thereby prompting
further interest in the effectiveness of pasteurization. Since then,
several studies have shown that _L. monocytogenes_ is inactivated by
standard pasteurization practices (4, 7-10). This report summarizes
information regarding the effectiveness of pasteurization in
eliminating _L. monocytogenes_ from milk.
Current state and local regulations throughout the United States
specify time and temperature conditions for pasteurization. These
regulations call for milk to be heated to at least 71.7 C for 15
seconds (i.e., high-temperature short-time (HTST) process) or to 62.8
C for 30 minutes (11). In one study using milk artificially
inoculated with _L. monocytogenes_, investigators found that 0.9
seconds at 71.7 C is needed for each one log10 reduction in the
number of _L. monocytogenes_ organisms (7). Other studies of
artificially inoculated milk have concluded that at the same
temperature, a period of 2.75 to 3.1 seconds is needed for each log10
reduction (4). Since the concentration of _L. monocytogenes_ likely
to be present in contaminated raw milk is estimated to be
approximately 10 organisms per mL, these data suggest that there is a
substantial margin of safety in the HTST pasteurization process (4).
Another study found that at 62 C, each log10 reduction in the number
of surviving _L. monocytogenes_ organisms could be achieved in 6 to
20 seconds, well within the 30 minutes required for pasteurization at
this temperature (8). Other investigators also have concluded that
_L. monocytogenes_ will not survive the normal milk pasteurization
process (9) and have questioned previously reported methods that
suggested _L. monocytogenes_ could survive pasteurization (8,9).
In a pasteurization study designed to simulate the natural situation
more closely, milk from cows that had been purposefully infected with
_L. monocytogenes_ was used, along with several different _L.
monocytogenes_ isolation procedures (12). Viable _L. monocytogenes_
could be recovered after minimum HTST treatment (71.7 C for 15
seconds), although not after treatment at 76.4 C-77.8 C for 15
seconds. This survival was attributed in part to protection of _L.
monocytogenes_ within leukocytes in milk (intracellular _L.
monocytogenes_ organisms are found in milk from infected cows but not
in artificially inoculated milk). Because this milk had L.
monocytogenes concentrations of 103 to 104 per mL, higher
concentrations than are usually found when _L. monocytogenes_ is
present in raw milk, these findings may not be applicable to usual
production conditions. In another study in which investigators
identified cows that had been naturally infected with _L.
monocytogenes_ (10), proper pasteurization was found to inactivate
_L. monocytogenes_ in milk contaminated through natural infection as
well as in artificially inoculated milk.
After reviewing these studies, a World Health Organization Working
Group on foodborne listeriosis recently concluded that
"pasteurization is a safe process which reduces the number of _L.
monocytogenes_ occurring in raw milk to levels that do not pose an
appreciable risk to human health" (4).

Editorial Note: Improperly performed pasteurization and the
occurrence of contamination after pasteurization are the most likely
explanations for the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ in pasteurized
milk. In a survey conducted during 1987 and 1988 as part of the Food
and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Dairy Product Safety Initiatives, 2
percent of pasteurized milk samples from more than 700 U.S.
milk-producing plants were culture-positive for Listeria species,
primarily _L. monocytogenes_, (13). Even when pasteurized milk is
proven to be contaminated by bacteria, the exact source and mode of
contamination may be difficult to identify. For example, in a recent
large epidemic of salmonellosis in Illinois, the epidemic strain of
_Salmonella typhimurium_ was isolated from patients and the
implicated pasteurized milk products they had drunk (14). However, an
inspection of the plant by a task force of FDA officials and other
experts could not prove how the milk was contaminated. Efforts to
ensure that milk is safe from _L. monocytogenes_ contamination should
focus on promoting proper methods of pasteurization and on
identifying and eliminating sources of postpasteurization
contamination.
