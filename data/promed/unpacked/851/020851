In Anzoategui state, 3 probable yellow fever cases were detected [in
monkeys]. This outbreak would be enzootic, as determined by the Ministry of
Health. These cases were reported by the [health] authorities in
Epidemiological Bulletin 42, corresponding to the week between 17-23 Oct
2010, released on 5 Nov [2010]. According to official information, this
probable outbreak of yellow fever has been reported in the Guaraguato
settlement, [Pedro Maria] Freites municipality in this eastern state.

The interpretation by Jose Felix Oletta, Ana Carvajal, and Saul Pena,
physicians of the Network of Medical Scientific Societies of Venezuela, is
that the possible outbreak "[is] evidence of the possible transmission of
the virus in the enzootic focus in Guayana," and added, in Epidemiological
Alert no. 157, that it is "the 2nd report of enzootic outbreaks in
Anzoategui state in the past 2 months."

[This area and the Guayana area in neighboring Bolivar state, are enzootic
for wandering foci of yellow fever virus in its sylvan (jungle or enzootic)
transmission cycle. Sylvan YF virus outbreaks in primates and humans across
Venezuela have occurred in several states in recent years (see ProMED-mail
archives below). It would be of interest to know if the monkeys were
laboratory tested for YF virus subsequent to the release of this report. It
would also be of interest to know the status of YF virus vaccinations in
the human populations in the municipality and state of the suspected
primate cases.
