[1] Expanded recall

A recall of nearly 2 million pounds of ground beef potentially tainted with dangerous _Escherichia coli_ bacteria has expanded to include distributors to restaurants nationwide -- but don't expect to know which ones. Federal officials aren't required to say which restaurants served the tainted hamburger linked to the largest recall of its kind in 6 years. And they don't have to tell consumers what type of restaurant dished up meat recalled by Detroit's Wolverine Packing Co, either, whether it was a sit-down diner or a fast-food joint, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

That means no one knows exactly where the approximately 1.8 million pounds of beef covered by the 19 May 2014 voluntary recall went after it was produced between 31 Mar and 18 Apr 2014. FSIS [Food Safety and Inspection Service] officials first said that the Angus Steak burgers and ground beef patties were sent to 4 states, but now they've expanded the recall to at least 12 states, which counts as a nationwide recall. As of Tuesday night, 20 May 2014, FSIS officials had not yet named the rest of the states.

And it's not yet clear whether there are more illnesses linked to the ground beef potentially contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, nasty bacteria that can cause bloody diarrhea and deadly kidney failure, particularly in children and the elderly. As of late Monday, 19 May 2014, 11 illnesses were reported in 4 states, including 5 in Michigan, 4 in Ohio, and 1 each in Massachusetts and Missouri, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Illnesses began between 22 Apr and 2 May 2 2014, CDC officials said.

"This strain of _E. coli_ is one of the most hazardous," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of Food Safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "It's infrequent that we have a major outbreak from _E. coli_ these days but when it happens, it's very serious, and it can land quite a number of its victims in the hospital." So far, 6 of 10 victims interviewed by CDC were hospitalized, officials said.

CDC officials said they're scouring their PulseNet system, which tracks the genetic fingerprints of infections, for more cases that may have been tied to the Wolverine recall. The ground beef was not used in federal Department of Defense programs, the National School Lunch Program or in catalog or Internet sales, officials said. It's past its use-by date, so there's little chance it's still in commerce anyway.

In a statement, Wolverine officials said their products did not test positive for _E. coli_ O157, but CDC and FSIS epidemiological and traceback data indicate that meat from the firm was the likely source of illness. The incident underscores the importance of cooking ground beef thoroughly, which kills the bacteria, health officials said. Consumers should make sure to order well-done burgers when eating out.

This is the largest recall of ground beef tied to _E. coli_ O157:H7 since the early summer of 2008, when 5.3 million pounds of meat eventually traced to the firm Nebraska Beef were pulled, followed by another 1.36 million pounds that August. As many as 79 people were sickened, CDC reports showed.

In 2007, Topps Meat Company recalled 21.7 million pounds of frozen hamburgers, the second-largest ground beef recall in USA history. The largest ground beef recall in USA history was in 1997, when Hudson Foods pulled 25 million pounds of potentially tainted meat.

[2] CDC report
Date: Mon 19 May 2014

http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2014/O157H7-05-14/index.html


CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, obtains DNA "fingerprints" of _E. coli_ bacteria through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE.

The type of bacterium responsible for this outbreak is among those referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, STEC or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). Some types of EHEC frequently cause severe disease, including bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a type of kidney failure. EHEC bacteria are divided into serogroups (such as, O157 or O121). _E. coli_ O157 is the EHEC serogroup found most commonly in USA patients.

A total of 11 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of EHEC O157:H7 have been reported from 4 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Massachusetts (1), Michigan (5), Missouri (1), and Ohio (4). Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 22 Apr 2014 to 2 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 19 years to 46 years, with a median age of 26 years. 54 percent of ill persons are male. Among 10 persons with available information, 6 (60 per cent) reported being hospitalized. No ill persons have developed HUS, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that ground beef produced by Wolverine Packing Company is the likely source of this outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 infections.

As of 16 May 2014, in interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 10 (100 per cent) of 10 ill persons interviewed reported eating ground beef prepared at a restaurant before becoming ill. Findings of multiple traceback investigations of the ground beef used at restaurants where ill persons reported they had dined identified Wolverine Packing Company as the source of the ground beef. On 19 May 2014, Wolverine Packing Company, a Detroit, Michigan firm, voluntarily recalled about 1.8 million pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with STEC O157:H7. The ground beef was shipped to distributors for retail and restaurant use nationwide. There was no distribution of the products to the Department of Defense, the National School Lunch Program, or catalog/internet sales. Products are regulated by USDA-FSIS and bear the establishment number "2574B" inside the USDA mark of inspection and have a production date code in the format "Packing Nos: MM DD 14" between "03 31 14" and "04 18 14." A full list of recalled ground beef products is available from the USDA-FSIS website [http://1.usa.gov/1gGNQI9].

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them about foods eaten before becoming ill. USDA-FSIS is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation to determine the source of contamination and identify any other potentially contaminated products still on the market. CDC will update the public when additional information is available.

The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department today, 19 May 2014, confirmed that there are 3 cases in Lucas County that are linked to a Michigan-based _E. coli_ outbreak. A 4th Lucas County resident, a 17 year old male, is suspected of also having _E. coli_ and undergoing tests, said health commissioner David Grossman.

A total of 7 cases [2 of the Michigan cases were linked to unpasteurized milk and are not linked to this cluster. - Mod.LL] have already been confirmed in Michigan, Dr Grossman said during a news conference at the health department.

Health officials would not release the names of the Lucas County residents affected, but did disclose their ages: 19, 23, and 42. The 19 and 23 year old ate at the same restaurant, which health officials have visited and investigated already. "We didn't find anything; there were no violations," Dr Grossman said.

[The FSIS website statement (http://1.usa.gov/1ggdJhh) has been modified from 2 days ago to reflect a broader distribution of the potentially tainted product: "Editor's Note added on 19 May 2014: Upon further investigation, FSIS now believes the product was sent to distribution centers nationwide."

To this point, it is unclear which restaurants were involved and, in addition, the other 8 states (or more) of distribution of the product are not stated. It is possible that a recent small cluster of HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome) cases in Kansas was linked to the outbreak strain as well. - Mod.LL
