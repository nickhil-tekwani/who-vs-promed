Queensland Health Minister Mike Horan says it is unlikely a Darling Downs
woman who died [on 10 Dec 1997 after being bitten by a flying fox had
contracted lyssavirus. The 48-year-old woman from Jandawae, in the State's
south, was found dead in her bath four days after being bitten on the arm
and ear by a sick flying fox.
Lyssavirus was discovered last year when a woman from the central
Queensland city of Rockhampton died after being bitten by a sick flying
fox. It has since been found in flying foxes and some bats in Queensland
and New South Wales.
Mr. Horan says he has asked for results from yesterday's autopsy to be
fast-tracked. The advice from the Queensland Health Department is it's
highly unlikely she died as a result of lyssavirus, because it's not known
for an incubation period of lyssavirus to have been any shorter than nine
days, whereas in this case it's four days," he said.
