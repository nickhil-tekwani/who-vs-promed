[The WOAH map -- to find it on the site given, click on the box in the top right corner to open the map -- shows the outbreak far south from the capital Kiev and on the provincial border, thus away from the fighting.

Anthrax is a persistent problem in the Ukraine but at a modest frequency. The present fighting must be doing nothing to help them have an efficient control and surveillance programme. And as laboratory confirmation was based solely on bacterial culturing, they must lack the current genomic tools to identify genetic strains. If a way can be found to get cultures out of Ukraine and to a willing laboratory with the necessary skills and equipment, it would be worthwhile to map the genomics of this pathogen in the country. Logically it will have spatial characteristics showing what one might expect where with future outbreaks as well as identifying any strangers. And when you know the genetics of an unexpected culture, one can then identify where it probably came from inside the Ukraine or elsewhere.

Goats are browsers and therefore very susceptible to secondary infections from a downed cow, for example, which has been fed upon by blow flies. After feeding, blow flies go to nearby shrubs and vomit their bloody meal onto the leaves and then eat the blood clots. The bloody residue will contain _Bacillus_ vegetative cells, which promptly sporulate. Once you know what to look for, the small black blood residues and spores are fairly easy to see, and sample. Unfortunately these leaves are choice browser food. In my experience, sheep and goats are too small to be tabanid "black-body" targets.

The sooner the fighting is over and the Ukrainians are rebuilding their country, we hope they will initiate an effective anthrax control and surveillance programme. But under the present circumstances, we can expect to see human cases from rural folk butchering sick livestock. We hope there will not be many, and limited to cutaneous infections among the butchers and meat handlers. With thanks to my colleague Mod.CRD. - Mod.MHJ
