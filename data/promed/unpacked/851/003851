Domestic pets and stray dogs are the main vectors of human rabies in the
southern Urals (Chelyabinsk Oblast)
-----------------------------------------------
The threat of human rabies has increased in the Chelyabinsk region. In
Russia annually, there are 12 deaths from rabies. This year [2006], an
increased risk has developed in 11 territories of the southern Urals [the
Chelyabinsk Oblast], especially in the Ashinskiy, Varenskiy,
Krasnoarmejsky, Plast, and Kyshtym regions. Despite this, only 60 per cent
of townspeople and 37 per cent of peasants have received post-exposure
vaccination in response to the increased risk. On average annually, about
13 000 attacks by animals on people are registered in the area, including
3500 attacks on children. Wild animals are responsible for only about 50-60
bites, whereas domestic pets and stray dogs are responsible for the vast
majority of bites.
