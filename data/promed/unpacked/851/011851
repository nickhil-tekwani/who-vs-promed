Tackling emerging fungal threats to animal health, food security, and ecosystem resilience
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Organizers: Professor Matthew Fisher, Professor Sarah Gurr, and Professor Neil Gow
https://royalsociety.org/events/2016/03/emerging-fungal-threats/
Location: The Royal Society, London, 6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London, SW1Y 5AG
Dates: 7-8 Mar 2016

This meeting is free to attend, but advance registration via the meeting webpage is essential.

An unprecedented number of new pathogenic fungi and variants of extant strains are emerging to cause disease in animals and plants, putting the resilience of wild and managed ecosystems in jeopardy. This meeting will unite researchers sharing a common aim -- to exploit advances in biology to understand the drivers causing the emergence of fungi and to forge a research agenda to mitigate their impact.
