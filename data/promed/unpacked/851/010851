Bird flu suspected at Japanese farm
---------------------------------------
Authorities have detected signs of bird flu at a farm in northern
Japan and plan to kill 82 000 chickens, local officials have said.
The farm in Ibaraki prefecture, just northeast of Tokyo, was already
inside a quarantined area because of past outbreaks, Kyodo News
agency reported on Monday [31 Oct 2005].
Kyodo said 1.5 million birds had already been culled in the area
because of bird flu fears. Authorities found signs of the disease in
7 farms in the area at the end of August 2005.
In Monday's [31 Oct 2005] case, antibody tests showed the chickens
may be infected with a virus from the H5 family, Ibaraki prefectural
officials said in a statement.
Signs of the antibodies means the chickens were infected in the past
but had survived.
Japanese officials said the strain involved in the recent outbreaks
is less virulent than the H5N1 variety that has ravaged poultry in
Southeast Asia since 2003 and killed more than 60 people in Viet Nam,
Thailand and Cambodia.
Bird flu hit Japan last year [2004] for the 1st time in decades,
killing or prompting the extermination of hundreds of thousands of
chickens. Japan also confirmed a human case of bird flu in December
2004, but no deaths have been reported.
An outbreak in June 2005 forced the culling of about 94 000 birds at
another farm outside Tokyo. It was caused by the H5N2 bird flu
strain, a variety not known to infect humans.

Bird flu antibodies found at Japan farm
---------------------------------------------
Chickens at a farm near Tokyo have tested positive for an antibody,
indicating that they were infected with a bird flu virus at some time
in the past, Kyodo news agency said on Monday [31 Oct 2005].
The strain of the virus had not been confirmed, but the farm in
Ibaraki, north of Tokyo, will destroy all of its 82 000 chickens, the
agency quoted local government officials as saying.
The farm is inside a zone where a ban had been imposed on the
movement of chickens and eggs because of previous outbreaks of bird
flu, Kyodo quoted the officials as saying.
Japan reported its 1st outbreak of avian flu in 79 years early last
year [2004], when it found chickens infected with the virulent H5N1
strain of the disease.
Ibaraki local government officials had been conducting tests in
preparation for lifting the ban on transferring chickens and eggs
after culling 1.48 million chickens in the area this year [2005], Kyodo said.

Ibaraki bird flu believed caused by vaccines
-----------------------------------------------
The weak strain of avian influenza that infected chickens on poultry
farms in Ibaraki Prefecture likely was spread by a mobile meat
processor that collected chickens from the farms, according to a
draft interim report compiled by a team studying the infection's
path. [The utilization of a mobile meat processor needs explanation.
Such a unit is known to enable farmers to market their meat directly
by the piece to local residents, stores, farmers' markets and
restaurants. Was that also the reasoning for the use of a mobile meat
processing unit in Ibaraki? - Mod.AS]
The team, chaired by Seiji Terakado, is an advisory body to the
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry.
Refuting suggestions that the virus was brought in by migratory birds
or imported poultry, the draft report -- to be released Monday [31
Oct 2005] -- says illegal vaccines brought into the country most
likely are responsible for the outbreak, sources close to the team said.
The strain of bird flu was detected in 30 poultry farms in Ibaraki
Prefecture and one poultry farm in Saitama Prefecture. The virus was
found to have a genetic makeup 97 percent identical to a virus
detected between 2000 and 2002 in Guatemala.
As well as inspecting farms in Ibaraki Prefecture, the team is also
conducting research on the virus in Central America.
According to the draft report, a meat processor visited all the
infected farms to collect chickens on the same day. The virus might
have spread to other poultry farms when he made his rounds to those
farms, causing cross contamination, the draft report says.
As it is unusual for the Central American virus, which has not been
detected elsewhere in Northeast Asia, to be found in poultry farms
only in southern Ibaraki Prefecture, the draft report says it is
highly likely the virus was brought into the country.

[Since 27 Jun 2005, Japan has sent 4 reports to the OIE on the
identification of a low-pathogenic H5N2 A influenza virus on poultry
farms. The 1st, an "immediate notification report," sent on 27 Jun
2005 and published by the OIE on 1 Jul 2005 (see 20050702.1870),
described the findings on the affected farm, in Mitsukaido city,
Ibaraki prefecture, as follows: "From April 2005, fowl in the
affected premises showed a decrease in laying rate and a slight
increase in the mortality rate. Subsequently, several tests for
specific bacteriological and viral diseases were conducted in a
private laboratory. The laboratory detected the possibility of AI
virus infection and notified the relevant veterinary authority on 24
June [2005]. National reference laboratories, National Institute of
Animal Health, identified a "Law pathogenic notifiable avian
influenza" (LPNAI) virus (H5N2) on 26 June [2005]." A map, which
accompanied the said report, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/JPN050701.jpg>.
Since then, 31 additional farms have been officially reported as
infected by the same LPNAI virus, as apparent from the 3 follow-up
reports to the OIE:
1. 28 Jul 2005, 7 farms in Ibaraki prefecture.
2. 23 Aug 2005, 2 farms in Ibaraki prefecture, one farm in Saitama prefecture.
3. 16 Sep 2005, 21 farms in Ibaraki prefecture.
The last follow-up report, No. 3, sent 23 Sep 2005, included the
following statement regarding the source of outbreaks or origin of
infection: "unknown or inconclusive. Epidemiological investigations
to elucidate the cause of these outbreaks are continuing."
An official report, including the results of the epidemiological
investigations regarding this -- apparently lingering since April
2005 -- epizootic, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
