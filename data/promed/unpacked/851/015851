A disease outbreak, which resulted in a ban on horse movements around
Argentina's capital, has been traced to semen imported from the
Netherlands.

The outbreak of abortion associated with equine arteritis virus (EAV)
infection occurred on a thoroughbred breeding farm in San Antonio de
Areco, Buenos Aires Province, in March [2010].

EAV is the virus which causes equine viral arteritis (EVA). The
disease was detected in testing of an aborted equine fetus and
placenta -- the 3rd abortion to have occurred on the premises.

The finding was reported to the National Health Authorities (SENASA)
in Argentina, and the farm was quarantined.

Pregnancy losses associated with the virus reached about 50 per cent,
including abortions at around 5 to 6 months of gestation and also
mares that had been previously identified as pregnant and were
subsequently found to have lost their pregnancies.

About 40 thoroughbred mares occupied the same paddock as 16
sport-horse mares that had been inseminated with semen from 5
stallions -- 4 standing outside the country and one domestic stallion.
2 of the 4 stallions' imported semen had been used on the farm for the
1st time this year [2010].

Evidence pointed to semen from one of these 2 stallions as the source
of EAV infection in the sport-horse mares, which in turn, were
believed responsible for spreading the infection to the pregnant
thoroughbred mares.

On 14 Apr 2010, straws containing frozen semen from the 5 stallions
were submitted for virological examination. EAV virus was isolated
from the imported semen of a stallion from the Netherlands.

Dr Maria Barrandeguy, writing in the latest Equine Disease Quarterly
[see at <http://www.ca.uky.edu/gluck/q_oct10.asp>. - Mod.AS], said
testing carried out by the Animal Health Authorities at time of the
semen's entry had given negative results for EAV.

Dr Barrandeguy, who works in the equine virus laboratory within the
National Agricultural Technology Institute, said 3 mares at the farm
had received semen from the infected stallion. The 1st was inseminated
on 7 Jan 2010, and it appears that this inseminated mare was the index
case.

On 5 Apr 2010, blood samples were taken from all 140 horses on the
farm -- 54 mares, 1 stallion, 34 yearlings, 14 foals, and 37 work
horses.

Tests confirmed a high prevalence of infection in the mares and foals
and a low prevalence in the yearlings that had been physically
separated from the mares.

The infected semen was traced and all straws still available from the
stallion were confiscated.

"Since 4 other farms had also used this semen, they too were put under
quarantine," Dr Barrandeguy said.

Testing showed all mares inseminated with the infective semen were
seropositive for EAV. "In addition, a very high prevalence of EAV
infection (97 out of 120 horses) was found in an equestrian club
located in downtown Buenos Aires, where 2 mares had earlier been
inseminated with the affected semen," she said.

"When the veterinarian to this facility became aware of the results,
he indicated that a few months previously several horses had developed
signs of respiratory disease accompanied by fever and limb oedema;
these signs were not associated with [suspected of being] equine viral
arteritis at the time."

Dr Barrandeguy said Argentina's Department of Agriculture notified the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 7 May 2010 with
confirmation of the outbreak [see commentary].

The department declared a health alert for horses throughout the
country. Movement of horses was prohibited in Buenos Aires Province,
where all the major equestrian clubs, horse breeding farms, and
racecourses are located. Since there had been significant movement of
horses off the 5 primary affected premises, all such movements were
traced from early January to 7 May 2010. A statistically
representative blood sampling was carried out at the main racecourses
and equestrian clubs in the country, with about 10 000 horses of all
breeds tested. 7 additional affected premises were identified as a
result of this surveillance, Dr Barrandeguy said.

"Dissemination of EAV had occurred as a result of the movement of
horses that were either incubating the infection or subclinically
infected with the virus. All the 12 affected premises identified -- 5
as a consequence of the use of infective semen and 7 because of the
movement of infected horses -- were located in Buenos Aires Province."

Testing revealed that apart from the involvement of thoroughbred mares
on the index premises, infection was limited to sport horses.
Thoroughbred, polo, criollo, Arabian, and other breeds evidently were
not exposed to EAV infection during this occurrence of EVA. About 30
stallions of a jumping breed, Silla Argentina, became seropositive
during the outbreak. "Investigations are ongoing to determine whether
any of them are semen shedders and carriers of EAV. The genetic
characterisation of the isolates is also being undertaken."

Dr Barrandeguy said the feasibility of applying preventive measures to
protect the country's valuable horse industry against the possible
risk of future introduction of this disease was considered, and on 13
Jul 2010 a vaccination programme for thoroughbred stallions was
officially approved. So far, about 100 thoroughbred stallions have
been vaccinated with a commercial modified live vaccine against EVA.
"Consideration is also being given to the need to include other breeds
in the vaccination programme," she said.

Dr Barrandeguy works in the Equine Virus Laboratory, at the Institute
of Virology, Investigation Centre for Veterinary and Agricultural
Sciences, at the National Agricultural Technology Institute, in
Castelar, Buenos Aires.

[In its immediate notification on the EVA outbreak, submitted to the
OIE on 7 May 2010, Argentina reported that the event had started on 9
Mar 2010 and was first confirmed on 31 Mar 2010 (see ProMED-mail
archive 20100510.1526). Since then, 5 follow-up reports have been
submitted. In follow-up report no. 5, submitted 20 Aug 2010, the
Argentinean authorities indicated that the outbreak was resolved on 11
Aug 2010.

This report included the following epidemiological comments: "The
National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA) extended the
application of the vaccine against equine viral arteritis in horses of
different breed, under strict controlled conditions supervised by this
official organism. The new legislation allows stallions of any breed
to be vaccinated with doses exceptionally imported, in order to have a
preventive tool to control this disease during the next covering
season. As for the origin of the disease, it is associated with the
importation of infected semen from which the virus was isolated."

All 6 reports, as well as an interactive map showing the 7 locations
of the 12 accumulated outbreaks (cases), is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9233>.

According to Argentina's annual reports to the OIE, EVA, a notifiable
disease, was previously reported in Argentina in 2006. According to
the Dutch annual report for 2009, EVA, not a notifiable disease in the
Netherlands, is present in the country, its reported status being
"suspected, not confirmed."
