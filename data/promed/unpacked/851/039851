[It is not clear why a vaccinated health worker would become infected unless the vaccine was administered too close to the date s/he contracted Ebola and immunity had not reached an optimum level. When this outbreak is over, it will be very helpful to review all the data from healthcare workers who became infected relative to vaccination status. - Mod.LK]

[The Observer, edited]
https://www.observer.ug/news/headlines/61277-no-single-case-of-ebola-in-west-nile-health-minister
[Byline: URN]

Uganda's health minister, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, says no Ebola-related death has been registered in West Nile region's Arua district.

The country has been on high alert since June [2019] following the 1st 3 confirmed Ebola cases and deaths from the same family who had travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and came back with the Ebola virus disease (EVD).

Death of another confirmed Ebola case from Ariwara health zone near Arua district in Uganda this week [week of Mon 1 Jul 2019] caused anxiety amongst the Ugandan population, with some mistaking it to have been in Uganda. The minister however says though the death was near the border, it was outside Uganda.

"I would like to inform the public that there is no case of confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda and no case of Ebola death in West Nile. The case of Ebola that travelled to Beni and died in Ariwara died in Ariwara, which is the western side of Beni and not in Uganda. But I want the population to take note that Ariwara is only 8 km [5 mi] from the border with Arua, and that is why we are concerned because of the proximity of Ariwara and also the fact that there is a big market in Ariwara where people from West Nile and DRC converge," Aceng said.

Aceng said Uganda already built capacity in the districts bordering DRC and that preparedness efforts were beefed following the reported death in DRC's Ariwara area almost 460 km [286 mi] north of DRC's North Kivu province. A team of Ebola vaccinators was dispatched from Kasese district to beef up the vaccination of the front-line health workers in Arua and neighbouring districts.

She says it is important the districts along the Uganda-DRC borderline, especially Arua, Maracha, and Yumbe, among others, mobilize and sensitize the communities about the latest Ebola threat from Congo.

The World Health Organization's latest report said no Ebola virus disease cases or deaths have been reported in Uganda since the previous deaths in Kasese district on 12 Jun [2019]. The report says as of 26 Jun [2019], 108 exposed contacts had been identified, and they were in the process of completing the 21-day follow-up period.

According to the WHO, all the contacts have not shown any symptoms of Ebola to date, and all of the 14 suspected cases tested negative for Ebola virus disease. Meanwhile, WHO says the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continued with a steady transmission intensity this week.

It said the current hotspots are the DRC's health zones of Beni, Mabalako, and Mandima, with some cases being exported from these hotspot areas into unaffected health zones.

The 1600 death toll from the Ebola outbreak was crossed on Thursday [4 Jul 2019] in 2 eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus caused a casualty in a new area bordering Uganda and Sudan South, said the Ministry of Health on Friday [45 Jul 2019]. "Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2382, of which 2288 are confirmed and 94 are probable. In total, there were 1606 deaths (1512 confirmed and 94 probable) and 666 people healed," reads the daily bulletin of the Ministry of Health dated Thursday [4 Jul 2019].

"A case has been reported in Ariwara, Ituri, since Monday [1 Jul 2019]. The people have even died," a spokesman for the Congolese Ministry of Health told AFP. The infected person, the mother of 5 infected children, 2 of whom died of Ebola, fled Beni (North Kivu) to neighboring Ituri to escape the epidemic response teams, health officials said in a bulletin dated Monday [1 Jul 2019].

"To date, 177 family contacts have been listed in Ariwara, and 40 contacts have already been vaccinated," according to health authorities. Ariwara is a locality in northern Ituri located about 10 km [6.2 mi] from Uganda, where a case from the DRC was reported in June [2019]. South Sudan is more than 60 km [37.3 mi] away.

- 5 Jul 2019. CIDRAP: Violence and 51 Ebola cases in recent days
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/more-violence-drc-officials-report-51-ebola-cases-recent-days
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded at least 51 new cases of the Ebola virus since the beginning of the week, while 2 screening tents in Kasese, a Ugandan village that shares a border with the DRC, were burned after Ugandan workers detected a high fever in a Congolese boy trying to gain entry into Uganda.

Since the outbreak started nearly a year ago in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC, neighboring countries have screened travelers through hundreds of points-of-entry (POE) screening sites.

On Wednesday [3 Jul 2019], officials quoted in a Ugandan newspaper said the fires started after a teenage boy entering Uganda from the DRC tested positive for a high fever and was taken to a hospital in DRC.

In June [2019], Uganda confirmed 2 cases of Ebola in a Congolese family that had traveled back and forth between the 2 countries to attend an Ebola victim's funeral. Since then, Uganda has increased border surveillance.

In a new update on the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no new cases of Ebola had been detected in Uganda among case contacts.

"As of 26 Jun [2019], 108 exposed contacts were identified, and they are in the process of completing the 21-day follow-up period. Contacts are visited daily for 21 days until the last contact completes follow-up on 3 Jul [2019]. All contacts remain asymptomatic to date," the WHO said.

According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, the DRC will likely confirm 7 new cases today [Fri 5 Jul 2019], raising the total to 2389. Yesterday [Thu 4 Jul 2019], officials said there were 1606 deaths, and 420 suspected cases were still under investigation.

Mabalako, Mandima, and Beni remain the most active virus hotspots, with Mabalako recording 30% of new cases in the last 3 weeks, and Beni recording 27%, according to the WHO.

The DRC also said yesterday [Thu 4 Jul 2019] that a vaccinated health worker in Beni was diagnosed as having the virus, raising the total number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 128, including 40 deaths.

Thu 4 Jul 2019. Update
[WHO: Disease Outbreak News (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/04-july-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continued with a steady transmission intensity this week [week of Mon 1 Jul 2019]. Indicators demonstrated the early signs of transmission easing in intensity in some major hotspots, such as Butembo and Katwa. The current hotspots are the health zones of Beni, Mabalako, and Mandima, with some cases being exported from these hotspot areas into unaffected health zones. There is a slight but notable increase in the number of new cases occurring in areas that previously had lower rates of transmission, such as the Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara/Bunia health zones.

On 30 Jun [2019], a case who had travelled overland from Beni was confirmed in Ariwara, more than 460 km [286 mi] north of Beni, towards the borders with Uganda and South Sudan. This is the 1st confirmed case in this health zone, and a response team was deployed from Bunia to investigate and implement public health actions in Ariwara. Uganda and South Sudan have mobilized quickly, building on the preparedness efforts during the last months. Arua district in Uganda shares a border with Ariwara health zone, with high volume of trade and population movement. The Arua District Task Force in Arua mobilized on 2 Jul [2019] to agree on a plan of action, the Ministry of Health (MoH) immediately dispatched the National Rapid Response Team for needs assessment, and the vaccination team from Kasese was also dispatched to Arua district on 3 Jul [2019] to start vaccinating the front-line health workers. In South Sudan, WHO and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) convened a joint meeting with implementing partners on 2 Jul [2019] to plan and coordinate field missions. Joint teams were dispatched to Kei State on 3 Jul [2019] to support operational readiness activities.

In the 21 days from 12 Jun through 2 Jul 2019, 73 health areas within 20 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 285 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (30%, n=85), Beni (27%, n=76), Mandima (8%, n=23), Lubero (6%, n=16) and Kalunguta (5%, n=14). As of 2 Jul 2019, a total of 2369 EVD cases, including 2275 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (Table 1). A total of 1598 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 68%), including 1504 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2369 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1334) were female, and 29% (691) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 130 (6% of total cases).

USAID pledges Ebola support as 15 new cases reported

A key US government agency pledged millions to support response efforts.

2/3 of patients die
---------------
Today the WHO released its latest situation report on the outbreak, which is concentrated in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Though transmission has eased in Butembo and Katwa, Beni, Mabalako, and Mandima have seen a spike of cases in recent weeks.

WHO also noted a "concurrent increase in the number of new cases occurring in areas that previously had lower rates of transmission, such as the Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara/Bunia health zones."

The case-fatality rate is 67%, 56% of patients are female, and 29% of cases have affected children.

As of 30 Jun [2019], more than 18 000 case contacts have been followed, representing an 89% follow-up rate, the WHO said.

Kenya today [Wed 3 Jul 2019] said it was stepping up its surveillance along the Kenya-Uganda border, according to a Standard story yesterday [Tue 2 Jul 2019]. Last week [week of Mon 24 Jun 2019], a Congolese boy and his family because the 1st international cases in this outbreak when their illnesses were detected in Uganda.

Yesterday [Tue 2 Jul 2019], USAID (United States Agency for International Development) announced it would give the DRC USD 98 million to help fight the outbreak.

"With this funding, USAID is providing lifesaving assistance, including infection prevention and control activities, training for healthcare workers, community engagement interventions, promotion of safe and dignified burials, and food assistance for people and communities affected by Ebola. This assistance is also bolstering preparedness efforts in Goma city for communities at risk of Ebola," the agency said in a press release.

No American personnel have been on the ground in DRC since last September [2018], when they were removed because of threats of violence.

[The State Department has restricted the CDC's Ebola experts to Congo's capital, Kinshasa, on the western side of the DRC, nearly 2000 mi [3219 mi] from the outbreak zone on the eastern side, for reasons of security. They are advising on the outbreak from this location. Other CDC staffers are helping DRC's eastern neighbors beef up their health security operations and prepare in other ways in case Ebola spreads across DRC's borders. Some have been detailed to the World Health Organization's Geneva headquarters. See https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/cdc-withdrew-ebola-experts-outbreak-zone/ 14 Oct 2018 - Mod LK]
