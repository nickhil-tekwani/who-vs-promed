State biologists have found an unusual disease among caribou in Southwest Alaska. The disease is called brucellosis, and the Department of Fish and Game recently detected cases in the Mulchatna Caribou herd; they discovered the 1st potential case about a year ago.

Biologists typically find the bacteria brucella, which cause brucellosis, in caribou herds to the north, not in in the southwestern part of the state. The disease is caused by the bacteria brucella; it can be lethal to caribou, and it can also lead to miscarriages.

"This was the 1st time we were having actual cases in the Mulchatna herd," Dr Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for Fish and Game, said. "It's such a low level in caribou throughout Alaska, we don't pick it up very often. Right now, we know there's an increase, because more caribou in the herd have brucella or are showing antibodies."

Biologists have detected those antibodies during routine sampling. They also found the bacteria in 2 dead caribou and have observed swollen knees and enlarged scrotums in others. A common sign of brucellosis in caribou is swelling in the knees, where most of the bacteria are stored.

In people, brucellosis can cause a high fever, similar to the flu. Beckman said people can stay safe by handling raw meat carefully and cooking it properly [People should wash their hands after handling raw meat. - Mod.TG]. "Freezing doesn't kill the bacteria," she said. "Smoking and drying are not extremely effective because there can be some pathogens and parasites surviving those (temperatures). So, it's really important to cook the meat to 165 F [74 C]." After handling game meat, wash your hands thoroughly, and clean utensils with hot, soapy water.

Biologists typically find brucella in caribou to the north, in the Western Arctic, Teshekpuk and Central Arctic herds. There aren't enough samples from the Mulchatna herds to determine how many cases are present. Beckman advises those who harvest Mulchatna caribou to report any signs of the disease to the state.

["Brucellosis is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria called _Brucella suis_ type 4 in caribou and reindeer. It is spread in the afterbirth and fluids during calving. _Brucella suis_ occurs naturally in caribou and reindeer and has also been seen in muskoxen and moose.

"Brucella is most common in the 4 arctic caribou herds (Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Central Arctic, and Porcupine herds). Predators, such as bears and wolves, are exposed when they feed on infected caribou. Humans can be infected by _Brucella suis_ type 4.

"Animals may appear healthy and not show any signs of disease. Brucellosis usually affects the reproductive organs and leg joints. Often, animals will have swollen leg joints causing limping or lameness (especially in the front legs).

"When butchering, you may find pus-filled swellings under the skin, in the meat, or in the internal organs. The testicles or womb may be swollen.

"In people, brucellosis often causes a high fever that frequently comes and goes. [Sometimes, the disease is called relapsing fever, because the fever occurs and vanishes then reappears very soon afterwards. - Mod.TG].

"Humans can get brucellosis through exposure to contaminated parts. The bacteria can enter through cuts or scratches in your skin or through your eyes, nose, or mouth. You can also get brucellosis by eating infected meat not fully cooked.

"Do not cut into diseased parts. Do not spill fluid from the womb onto the meat. Use extreme care when handling any fetal membranes or aborted tissues. Wash your hands, knives, and clothes with hot soapy water after handling the animal.

"Report any animals suspected of having brucellosis to your nearest ADF&G biologist. https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=contacts.main.

"Meat from animals with brucellosis should be thoroughly cooked. Freezing, smoking, drying, and pickling do not kill Brucella. Raw bone marrow from infected animals can contain the bacteria. Do not feed diseased parts to dogs.

"The Alaska Department of Fish and Game also provides the following resource: Brucellosis: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions by Center for Climate and Health (PDF 236 kB) Michael Brubaker MS, James Berner MD, Jay Butler MD, Michael Bradley DVM, CCH Bulletin No. 6, Nov 30, 2010."

The notes above were extracted from: https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=disease.general3.

"Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people. Most commonly, people are infected by eating raw or unpasteurized dairy products. Sometimes, the bacteria that cause brucellosis can spread through the air or through direct contact with infected animals.

"Signs and symptoms of brucellosis may include fever, joint pain and fatigue. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics. However, treatment takes several weeks to months, and the infection can recur.

"Brucellosis affects hundreds of thousands of people and animals worldwide. Avoiding raw dairy products and taking precautions when working with animals or in a laboratory can help prevent brucellosis."
