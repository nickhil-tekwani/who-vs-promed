A rise in the number of deaths from Japanese encephalitis (JE) is causing
concern among health workers in Nepal, who say more needs to be done to
combat the preventable disease.
JE mostly affects impoverished families, with many children and elderly
people among the victims. In the past 2 months alone at least 200 people
have died of JE, according to the Nepalese health authorities. A spokesman
for the health ministry said last week the mosquito-borne disease had
affected more than 800 people in the same period.
Annual outbreaks of the disease often occur near rice fields after
rainwater is left standing during the monsoon season, which is about to
end. A World Health Organization (WHO) report said that nearly 50 000 cases
of JE are recorded every year, mostly in Asia. India and Nepal are
particularly badly affected by the disease, which is preventable by
vaccination. According to medical reports, the disease is particularly
deadly because an infected person is very difficult to cure.
Blinding headaches, seizures, nausea and high fever usually precede death.
Those who manage to survive suffer from a series of disabilities, including
paralysis and mental retardation.
Most victims are from impoverished communities with poor housing, leaving
them forced to sleep out in the open where they can become infected by
mosquitoes carrying the disease. The Nepal Red Cross Society and other NGOs
are providing bed nets to help prevention, but, according to health
workers, the supply has not been enough.
Nepalganj, a border city 500 km west of the capital, is one part of Nepal
where the disease is at its worst. In less than 3 weeks, nearly 60 patients
have died from JE. Already 45 patients have died at Nepalganj's
government-run Bheri hospital. At least 15 others have died of the disease
in other medical facilities in the city.
Health workers say nearly 200 die every year from the disease in the area.
"It's really a tragedy for most of these people who often arrive late [at
hospital] as they are not aware of the disease until they become really
sick," said health worker Nandalal Shrestha from Bheri hospital. "The
government has to introduce strong measures to protect the vulnerable from
this deadly disease, but priority has not been given to it, unlike for
malaria and HIV/AIDS," said health worker Anju Rai in Nepalganj.
Awareness of JE is minimal in Nepal compared to other mosquito-borne
diseases like malaria, say health workers. A survey by a local NGO, the
Environmental Health Project (EHP), found that only a tiny percentage of
the vulnerable population in the southern plains of west Nepal were aware
of the disease and of measures to prevent it.
The only effective way to prevent the disease is vaccination. Although the
government does provide free vaccines in state-run hospitals, they are few
and far between in a country where a 9 year old Maoist rebellion has
restricted government health care to a few large towns and cities.

[The encephalitis outbreak currently spreading in Nepal and in the northern
Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has been confirmed as Japanese encephalitis
(JE). During the annual monsoon season, proliferation of mosquitoes tends
to entail immediate outbreaks of encephalitis, particularly Japanese
encephalitis -- a perennial problem.
As stated in the above article, JE is a preventable infectious disease. The
government of an endemic country is responsible for organizing a sound
preventive program prior to the onset of the annual epidemic season. Such a
program involves a rather standard public awareness campaign, such as
elimination of mosquito breeding grounds, avoiding mosquito bites, as well
as vaccination against JE.
Nepalganj, which has about a third of the national toll of JE, is the
largest town in western Nepal. Nepalganj, situated in the Tarai, a low,
fertile plain north east of Nanpara in India, is a trading centre for rice,
wheat, corn (maize), oilseeds, and hides produced in the surrounding area.
