Congo fever kills 14 in Iran over 2 years
-----------------------------------------
During the past 2 years, 14 people have died in Iran as a result of sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the Jam-e Jam Persian language daily reported. The importation of livestock to Iran from eastern borders has been the cause of the spread of the disease, which has [affected] 114 people so far, of whom 14 have died.

The highest number of [cases] has been reported in Sistan-Baluchestan Province. During 1999-2011, some 610 cases of the disease have been reported, which has led to the death of 60 people.

CCHF is a viral disease and it has [affected] Yazd, Fars, and Sistan-Baluchestan provinces so far, he said. CCHF is a widespread tickborne viral disease that affects domestic and wild animals and may also be transmitted to humans.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a member of the genus _Nairovirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_). Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia, and reflects the distribution of the tick vector _Hyalomma marginatum_.

In Iran it is most prevalent in the east of the country. Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues from infected livestock, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

Iran is subdivided into 31 provinces, each governed from a local centre, usually the largest local city, which is identified as the capital of that province. The provincial authority is headed by a Governor-General who is appointed by the Minister of the Interior subject to approval of the cabinet. A map showing the location of the 31 provinces can be accessed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Iran. Sistan-Baluchestan Province, the worst affected province borers the politically unstable northwestern region of Pakistan.
