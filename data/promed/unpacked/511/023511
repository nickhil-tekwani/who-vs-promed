Influenza Update No. 224
------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity remained low, with the exception of some Pacific Islands.
- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase slightly but remained low.
- In Europe overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza detections remained low, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing most influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) activity.
- In Africa and western and eastern Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity was low with influenza B predominant in Viet Nam.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low except in several Pacific Islands where ILI activity remained high.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 14 Nov 2014 13:40 UTC), during weeks 43 to 44 (19 Oct 2014 to 1 Nov 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 51 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 44 937 specimens. 1978 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1434 (72.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and 544 (27.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 60 (6.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 813 (93.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 87 (96.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 3 (3.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America, Europe, northern Africa and the western and central Asia region

In the countries in the northern hemisphere, overall influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels but began increasing slightly. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B were predominant.

In Canada, influenza-like illness( (ILI) activity has been above the historical average for the last 9 weeks. Influenza detections increased but remained low (2 percent positivity), following seasonal trends. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common influenza virus detected , and about half of the detections occurred in patients aged over 65 years. Rhinovirus predominated among all respiratory viruses detected.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to increase slightly (6 percent positivity) but was within expected levels for this time of year. ILI activity remained below the national baseline. 1116 laboratory confirmed cases of respiratory illness have been attributed to enterovirus D68 since mid-August [2014].

In Mexico, acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity increased but remained consistent with seasonal patterns, while the detection of influenza virus decreased slightly.

In Europe, influenza activity was low, and there was no indication that the influenza season had begun. From 27 countries in the European region, 2 percent of 459 specimens tested positive for influenza virus.

Eastern Asia

In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low.

In northern China, influenza activity was low and mainly due to influenza A(H3N2). In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. In Mongolia, ILI activity increased with no indication of influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall in this region, influenza activity was low.

Circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus was reported from several of the Caribbean and central American countries, such as Costa Rica, Cuba and Nicaragua, following a period of activity predominated by influenza B. However, in most central American countries, circulation of influenza has decreased over the recent weeks. In Puerto Rico, ILI activity was moderate but influenza detections were low. In Cuba, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated hospitalizations were high due mainly to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Tropical countries in South America reported ILI and SARI activity within the expected range for this time of the year. RSV continued to circulate but with decreasing trends. In Colombia, influenza activity was ongoing, with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B co-circulating.

In Brazil, activity continued and influenza B was the most commonly detected influenza virus.

Central African tropical region

In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle and western Africa was at low levels. In Madagascar, both influenza A and influenza B viruses were detected.

In most southern Asian and south-eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

In Viet Nam, activity decreased and was predominantly caused by influenza B viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America

In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

Number of specimens positive for influenza by subtype in the temperate South America influenza transmission zone

South Africa

In South Africa, ILI and SARI activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating among positive ILI samples.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained low.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable; high activity was reported in American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

[Currently seasonal influenza has not been a significant disease problem, apart from some island communities in the Pacific region. No novel viruses have appeared so far and the existing vaccines remain appropriate. Sporadic occurrences (mostly single cases) of the avian influenza virus H5N1 and H7N9 have been recorded affecting the human population, but so far only marginally. Some non-influenza viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus and the human enterovirus D68) have been associated with significant human seasonal respiratory illness. - Mod.CP]
