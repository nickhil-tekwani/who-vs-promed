New wheat rust identified
-------------------------
University of Sydney [UoS] disease experts have identified a new strain of the wheat leaf rust pathogen in northern New South Wales in August [2013].

Robert Park, UoS, said it was the 1st time a pathogen had been found which attacked both the Lr13 and Lr 24 resistance genes in wheat varieties. He said up until now, leaf rust pathogens had either virulence for the Lr13 or Lr24 genes, but not both.

Rust experts are now looking at wheat varieties carrying both the Lr13 and Lr24 rust resistance genes. Professor Park said further testing was needed to determine the extent of the resistance breakdown. He said it could be well into next season before the extent of the problem was known.

Park said growers who planted any of the above varieties should monitor their crops. Those saving their own seed to plant next season should be aware of the potential risk of disease spread.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ (synonym _P. triticina_). Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 percent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather.

Spores are produced as the crop ripens and are spread by wind and mechanical means. The fungus is not soil-borne. It needs living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, and control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring is important for early discovery of infection so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of leaf rust with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Both pathogenicity tests and molecular data are needed to confirm any new strains. Strains with double virulences, like the one reported above, are particularly difficult to combat.
