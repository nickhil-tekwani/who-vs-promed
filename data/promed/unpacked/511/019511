In Saudi Arabia, date palms (_Phoenix dactylifera_ L.) have been
affected by a disease called Al-Wijam. The main symptoms are leaf
stunting (Fig. 1), yellow streaking (Fig. 2), and a marked reduction
in fruit and stalk size, which progresses to no fruit production in
the final stages. A putative lethal yellowing like 16SrIV phytoplasma
has previously been reported in Al-Wijam diseased palms at Al-Hassa
oasis, Eastern Region (El-Zayat et al, 2002). [In a survey at
Al-Hassa oasis during 2003-2005, more than 30 leaf samples from palms
with and without Al-Wijam symptoms and 60 _Cicadellidae_ specimens
were collected.
Total DNA was extracted from plants and batches of 3 insects, and
indexed by a nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with phytoplasma
generic primers P1/P7-R16F2n/R16R2. PCR products were characterized
by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and direct
sequencing, and the 16S rDNA sequences were compared with those of
other reference phytoplasmas.
Phytoplasma rDNA was amplified from 28 symptomatic palms and 16
batches of insects. No PCR products were obtained from asymptomatic
palms. RFLP patterns for all the PCR amplifications were identical
following digestion with RsaI, HinfI, TaqI, HpaII, KpnI, DraI, HhaI,
and Sau3AI enzymes. The 16S rDNA sequences of the phytoplasmas
identified in date palm (DQ913090) and _Cicadulina bipunctata_
(Melichar) (DQ913091) were 100 percent identical and showed 98
percent homology to that of Aster yellows phytoplasma (AF322644) from
the 16SrI, _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group. This is the 1st
report of a _Ca._ P. asteris phytoplasma associated with a disease in
date palm in Saudi Arabia, and the identification of a potential
vector of Al-Wijam disease, which will contribute to the future
control of the disease in Al-Hassa. Further studies will be required
to know the factors involved in the epidemiology of Al-Wijam disease
throughout the country.

[Phytoplasmas are bacteria living as intra-cellular parasites and
therefore do not need a cell wall. They are members of the group of
mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs), which cannot be cultured in vitro.
Spread occurs by grafting, dodder (parasitic vines, such as,
_Cuscuta_ or _Cassytha_ spp.) and insect vectors, mostly
phloem-feeding leafhoppers. Symptoms often include yellowing,
stunting, and/or proliferations called "witches' broom." Phytoplasmas
have been found to cause diseases in crops such as grapevine, papaya,
rice, potato, citrus, pome, and stone fruit. They also cause the
devastating lethal yellowing (LY) disease and several other wilts of
coconut and other palms.
Previously, 2 other diseases of date palm were also associated with
phytoplasmas by P. Cronje et al, NDR vol 1 January-July 2000 (contact
<phil.jones@bbsrc.ac.uk>):
1. 'White tip dieback'
<http://www.bspp.org.uk/ndr/2000/2000-4.asp> and
2. 'Slow Decline'
<http://www.bspp.org.uk/ndr/2000/2000-7.asp>
A table of phytoplasmas related to these can be found in Marcone et
al, Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 54 (2004), 1077-1082
<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/54/4/1077>
There are still uncertainties in phytoplasma taxonomy reflected in
the genus name _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma. However, the date palm
phytoplasmas appear to belong to a different taxonomic group than the
LY phytoplasma.
