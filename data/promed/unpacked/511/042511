Draft Guidance for Industry: Purchasing Reef Fish Species Associated with the Hazard of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.

I. Introduction
---------------
This guidance is intended for primary seafood processors who purchase reef fish such as grouper, amberjack, snapper, lionfish, king mackerel, and barracuda. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is recommending that primary seafood processors take measures to minimize the risk of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) from fish that they distribute.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word 'should' in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
--------------
CFP is caused by consuming fish that have eaten toxic marine algae directly or that have eaten other fish containing the toxins. The toxins accumulate in the flesh of reef dwelling fish, particularly predatory species, which are then harvested either commercially or by recreational fishermen. Consumers who eat fish that contain ciguatoxins are at risk for getting CFP. It is important to note that not all fish within a given reef or common catch area are equally toxic; toxin levels of fish caught side by side may vary greatly.

Ciguatoxins are commonly found in tropical or subtropical areas worldwide between 35 degrees north latitude and 35 degrees south latitude, which includes the South Atlantic Ocean bordering the Caribbean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the South Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico (including the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary). Because ciguatoxic endemic areas are localized, primary seafood processors should recognize and avoid purchasing fish from established and emerging areas of concern.

CFP is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms of numbness and tingling of the lips and extremities (paresthesias), itching of hands and feet (pruritus), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), headache, reversal of hot and cold sensation, acute and extreme sensitivity to temperature, dizziness, vertigo, and muscular weakness (myasthenia). Cardiovascular symptoms may occur and include irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) including slow heartbeat (bradycardia) or rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), and low blood pressure. The onset of CFP usually occurs within 6 hours after consumption of toxic fish and generally subsides from several days to a few weeks. However, severe cases have been known to cause recurring neurological symptoms lasting for months to years.

III. Discussion
---------------
We have analyzed local fish populations in Florida, the USA Virgin Islands, and the Flower Garden Banks of the Gulf of Mexico and found unsafe concentrations of ciguatoxin, which could cause illnesses if consumed (1-6). Illnesses due to unsafe concentrations of CFP toxins have been linked to commercially caught fish such as: barracuda (_Sphyraena_ spp.), grouper (including _Epinephelus_ spp., gag (_Mycteroperca microlepis_), scamp (_Mycteroperca phenax_), and amberjack (_Seriola dumerili_). Other reef fish associated with unsafe concentrations of CFP toxins include, but are not limited to: grouper (Family _Serranidae_), snapper (Family _Lutjanidae_ and _Symphorus nematophorus_), jacks and trevally (Family _Carangidae_), wrasse (_Cheilinus undulatus_), mackerel (_Scomberomorus_ spp.), tang (Family _Acanthuridae_), moray eels (Family _Muraenidae_), and parrotfish (_Scarus_ spp.). In addition, we have also found CFP toxins in lionfish (_Pterois volitans_ and _Pterois miles_) collected in waters surrounding the USA Virgin Islands. However, as of January 2013, there have been no reports of CFP illnesses associated with the consumption of lionfish.

FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 123, Fish and Fishery Products, more commonly known as the seafood HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) regulation, require seafood processors to conduct a hazard analysis of the potential food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur with the seafood products they process and to have and implement written HACCP plans to control all hazards identified in the hazard analysis. Failure to meet the requirements of the seafood HACCP regulation will cause products to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(4)). We will continue to assess the hazard of CFP and the application of seafood HACCP controls by seafood processors.

In addition, FDA's guidance document, "Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance" (the Guide) (7), helps the seafood processing industry develop seafood HACCP programs. The Guide identifies food safety hazards, including CFP, that are associated with fish and fishery products, and provides examples of recommended preventive measures to minimize the likelihood of the hazard's occurrence. Table 3-2 [http://tinyurl.com/c9zlejz] in the Guide provides a list of fish species currently associated with CFP. The Guide recommends that primary seafood processors who purchase fish directly from fishermen obtain information about harvest locations to determine the potential for ciguatoxic fish based on knowledge of the regions where ciguatera occurs. Primary seafood processors should avoid purchasing fish species associated with causing CFP from established or emerging areas linked with CFP.

The 1st outbreak of ciguatoxin poisoning from fish in Germany has been confirmed, with scientists claiming the problem is on the rise as more exotic fish species are consumed around the world.

Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known. Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters. Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 percent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.

Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. 3 of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even non-contaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP. - Mod.LL]
