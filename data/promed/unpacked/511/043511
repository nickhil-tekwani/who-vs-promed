Re: the previous report on Anaplasmosis in Switzerland [see ref. below].
Anaplamosis is caused by blood protozoa and is transmitted by ticks and also
mechanically by biting insects [especially tabanids - Mod.TG], contaminated
needles, and through herd management procedures such as ear tagging.
Besides a foreign source, exposure via local wild ruminant source of
infection should also be considered. [Anaplasmosis is generally considered
to be a tropical/subtropical disease, and even the lowlands of Switzerland
would not qualify as subtropical. Although a wild source is possible, this
disease has not been reported in Switzerland for 18 years prior to this
case. - Mod.TG]
Unless the infection in the herd is extensive, a better alternative in
managing the disease would be to treat the infected animals with a course of
long-acting tetracyclines (which can eliminate carrier status) and control
the vectors (through dipping and application of insect repellents).
Infection can be detected by blood smears and serological tests.
I am wondering why there was no mention of mortality in the report,
[especially as] mortality can reach up to 50 percent among naive adult
animals.

[This moderator has been unable to obtain confirmation of the presence of
tabanids in Switzerland. ProMED-mail would be grateful for confirmation. -
