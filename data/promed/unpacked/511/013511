Brazilian Agricultural Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes has
ordered an investigation into an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the
south of the country on suspicion of sabotage, the daily Jornal do Brasil
reported Friday.
"It could have been (criminals). The minister does not rule out the
possibility of this outbreak having being caused by sabotage, criminals
inoculating the animals in that area. He thinks that could have happened,"
said the ministry's chief press spokesman Tito Matos de Souza, declining to
give further details.
While its origin is still being determined, officials have said the disease
did not come from either Uruguay or Argentina. Ministry scientists said on
Thursday that the viral type found in the Argentine antibodies was
different from that discovered in the infected Brazilian cattle. Uruguay
also was unlikely, as it had been free of foot-and-mouth for a long time,
they said.
Although Argentina is the world's fourth-largest beef exporter, Brazil has
the largest commercial herd with 170 million head. Uruguay now has blocked
the entry of animal products from both Brazil and Argentina. However, local
government officials in Rio Grande do Sul have said the disease may have
been caused by farmers importing cattle from a neighbouring country to help
herd reproduction.
Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states were internationally recognised
as free of foot-and-mouth with vaccination in May 1998. Santa Catarina has
closed its border with its southern neighbour to live animals and meat
products. The 2 states, which have a combined herd of 13 million head, have
now lost that status but the Brazilian government believes it may be
regained within 3 to 12 months.
The disease's resurgence is a nightmare for Brazil's government, which had
viewed the region as key to raising beef exports to lucrative markets such
as Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, which refuse to buy from countries with
infected herds.

[Bioterrorism or the more trendy agroterrorism, is certainly one
possibility accounting for the 2 FMD virus identifications recently
obtained from the Mercosur countries. The 28 infected animals in Brazil did
show clinical signs. The virus type was O. It is important to remember that
the cattle in Argentina never had clinical signs and were only
serologically positive to A24. Furthermore, our first reports were that
Brazil and Argentina had banned animal related commerce with Paraguay. We
have no good information yet on the virus type and clinical condition of
animals in Paraguay. Good explanations for what is going on are in short
supply and in such an environment, some may leap to agroterrorism as an
explanation. Let's look first and await the results of the Brazilian
investigation. - Mod.PC
