Anthrax - Kazakhstan (Chymkent)
-------------------------------
16 Sep 2000: In the Kazakhstan city of Chymkent, [a woman died with a
diagnosis of anthrax.

The 34-year old woman (citizen of the city) in serious condition and a
suspected diagnosis of the cutaneous form of the disease had been
hospitalized at the city infectious [disease hospital. According to the
information of the head of the Department of Special Pathogens of the
province Sanitary-Epidemiological service, Abay Berdikulul, the woman had
been infected at the meat department of the central market of Chymkent,
where she worked as an officer-cleaner. When she became sick she tried to
treat herself. As a result the cutaneous form developed into the septic
one, and death.

Today in the city all markets and commercial points which sell animal
products have been closed.

[Traditionally the case fatality rate for untreated cutaneous cases of
anthrax is 10%. Treated promptly with antibiotics the CFR should be close
to zero. As this woman would not have been involved in the skinning &
butchering of an infected animal, but merely using the central market to
buy meat, we can presume that there may well have been other cutaneous
cases and possibly some gastro-enteric cases. - MHJ
