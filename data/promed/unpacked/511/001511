In the past few weeks, US Army physicians have reported four cases of vivax
malaria resulting from exposures that took place in 1997 in the Republic
of Korea. Last year, I provided to ProMED-mail a notification of the
reemergence of malaria in the northern part of South Korea -- along the
DMZ. This is a repeat of that message directed at medical providers in the
US who might have the occasion to treat recently discharged members of the
US Army who may have been exposed to malaria in Korea in 1997. Last year,
one such case was diagnosed at a VA hospital.
The strain of malaria circulating in Korea is the temperate climate variety
which tends to have a prolonged incubation period. Hence, new cases (not
recurrent malaria) are now appearing from exposures that took place last
fall.
As per the discussion engendered by last year's message, this reemergence
is not thought to be a threat to tourists who might visit the DMZ area
during the day. Exposure should be limited to those military personnel,
both US and Korean Army, who occupy positions along the DMZ. Likewise,
there is NO indication that this reemergence is anything more than a
natural event, i.e., no entomological terrorism is suspected.
Notice of any such cases diagnosed in former military members can be made
to the accompanying e-mail address.

[As I've said before, we don't usually post on malaria any more, but this
falls into the category of a public service announcement like the ones we
post asking for contacts of rabid animals to come forward & get treatment -
