Molecular Characterization of Tomato and Chili Leaf Curl Begomoviruses from
Pakistan.

Smith, CABI Bioscience, Surrey, UK. Plant Dis. 87:200, 2003; published
on-line as D-2002-1204-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 18 Nov 2002.
Leaf curl or yellowing symptoms typical of those caused by begomovirus
infection are commonly observed in chili (_Capsicum annuum_) and tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) crops in Pakistan. A chili sample with leaf
curl symptoms was collected in 1998 in Multan (Punjab Province), and 2
tomato samples with leaf curl and yellowing symptoms were collected from
Islamabad and Dargai (North West Frontier Province) in 2000 and 2001,
respectively.
Virus DNA was first amplified by PCR using the degenerate primer pair
PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 (3). The expected 1.4-kb PCR products were obtained from
the 3 samples. Based on the sequences of these DNA products, specific
primers were designed to complete each of the DNA-A sequences. 2 primer
pairs, DNABLC1/DNABLV2 and DNABLC2/DNABLV2, were used for the detection of
DNA-B (2). The genome of the Islamabad tomato leaf curl isolate
(TLCV-Islamabad) contained a DNA-A of 2 739 nt (GenBank Accession No.
AF448059), a DNA-B of 2 728 nt (GenBank Accession No. AY150304), and had 94
percent nucleotide identity in the common region.
The genome of the Dargai tomato leaf curl isolate (TLCV-Dargai) contained a
DNA-A of 2740 nt (GenBank Accession No. AF448058), a DNA-B of 2 686 nt
(GenBank Accession No. AY150305), and had 96 percent nucleotide identity in
the common region. Each of the tomato isolates contained 8 predicted ORFs
(AV1, AV2, AV3, AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, and AC5) in DNA-A and 2 predicted ORFs
(BV1 and BC1) in DNA-B. The DNA-A nucleotide sequence identity of
TLCV-Islamabad and TLCV-Dargai isolates is 96 percent and that of DNA-B is
88 percent.
Sequence comparisons with begomovirus sequences available in the GenBank
sequence database showed that these 2 tomato virus isolates had the highest
sequence identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-Severe (GenBank
Accession No. U15015) from northern India (more than 95 percent for DNA-A
and less than 90 percent for DNA-B). The DNA-A of the virus associated with
chili leaf curl from Pakistan (GenBank Accession No. AF336806) consists of
2754 nucleotides, containing 6 predicted ORFs (AV1, AV2, AC1, AC2, AC3, and
AC4).
The chili virus was unrelated to the 2 tomato begomovirus isolates from
Pakistan, with which it shares less than 75 percent nucleotide identity.
Sequence comparisons show highest sequence identity (87 percent) with
Tomato leaf curl Bangladesh virus (GenBank Accession No. AF188481).
DNA-beta of 1.3 kb was detected in the chili begomovirus isolate using
Beta01/Beta02 primers (1). There was no evidence for the presence of a
DNA-B in the chili begomovirus isolate when tested by the 2 DNA-B specific
primer pairs.
Based on DNA sequence comparisons, the chili leaf curl virus from Pakistan,
to our knowledge, constitutes a distinct, new monopartite begomovirus.

[The literature suggests that the chili virus may be a strain of Tobacco
leaf curl virus. The chili virus is probably to be found in most tropical
and subtropical regions of the world where pepper is grown. In addition to
the chili virus from Pakistan, others have been recorded from China and
Japan. Disease management involves removal of infected plants and
application of chemical insecticides and/or oils to leaf surfaces to reduce
whitefly populations. In Pakistan, resistance to leaf curl virus has been
incorporated into tomato and chili cultivars. Interestingly, a chili
begomovirus from Vietnam showed considerable sequence identity (82 percent)
with a chili virus from Malaysia. It is becoming clear that new
begomoviruses are continually being generated in Asia.
