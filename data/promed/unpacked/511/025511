[The current summary of the event since its start (21 Aug 2015), as presented in WAHID's archive updated 11 Mar 2016, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 220 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 38 770 / 316 / 1 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2696 / 16 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep & goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; screening; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); disinfection/disinfestation; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; control of vectors; traceability.

It will be helpful to obtain information on the (voluntary?) vaccination figures as applied so far.

The above summary, and OIE's map showing the locations of the 220 accumulated outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019898_20160311_121148.pdf.

In view of the absence of data on the clinical aspects of the "cases", and particularly the strikingly low number of outbreaks in sheep flocks, ProMED-mail published RFI's in previous postings asking for the criteria according to which outbreaks are recognized and reported, as well as for clarification on the event continuing during the winter (previously regarded as a "non-vector season").

The following recent assessment published by researchers of the leading French animal health institutions addresses the mentioned queries. - Mod.AS]

Assessment of the number of households detected as infected by BTV-8 virus between 1 Sep 2015 and 25 Feb 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the confirmation of the 1st outbreak of bluetongue (BT) serotype 8 in central France, on 11 Sep 2015, monitoring of BT was initiated, the objective of which being the detection of infected flocks and the estimation of the distribution of the virus in France based on [the following] different ways:

1. Event monitoring (clinical suspects)

2. Performing scheduled surveys (initially performed in early September 2016 within 2 km [about 1.2 miles] around the 1st outbreak, followed by a national survey conducted between 8 Sep and 20 Oct 2015, and a 3rd, current survey, in progress since early January 2016).

3. Analysis conducted during/in relation to animal movements (between regulated and unregulated areas, for export or at gatherings of animals).

An entomological surveillance is also set up since 16 Nov 2015 to determine vector activity periods by geographical areas (program scheduled in an article at http://plateforme-esa.fr/node/35846, in French).

An infected flock (or household) is a farming unit in which at least one animal tested positive by PCR for BTV. Since the viral genome detection time of BTV-8 by RT-PCR is long, from 5 to 6 months (Refs 1 and 2), detection of new outbreaks may reflect viral circulation which had occurred within the last 6 months. It is therefore not surprising to detect outbreaks during the same period of the vector inactivity season. As of 25 Feb 2016, a total of 210 farms [as of 11 Mar 2016, 220] have been registered as infected with bluetongue virus serotype 8 [see map in Figure 1 at the source URL, showing the breakdown of households by mode of monitoring according to 6 criteria as indicated in colours].

From 18 to 25 Feb 2016, 16 new outbreaks have been detected, including 6 in 3 newly added departments: Vienne (3 households), Charente-Maritime (2) and the Gironde (1), leading to an extension of the regulated zone [see zones under regulation as of 25 Feb 2016 -- map/Figure 2 at the source URL]. The most affected departments are the Puy-de-Dôme and Allier with 120 infected farms. Among all households, 11 were detected during the 1st investigation within 2 km around the 1st outbreak of the Allier, 27 by the programmed national monitoring program in September-October 2015 by the programmed monitoring currently underway, 14 by the event-monitoring on clinical suspicion and 145 when tested on animals when they leave the restricted area (Figure 2). These outbreaks affected 198 cattle farms, 4 sheep farms, and 7 mixed farms with cattle/sheep or cattle/sheep/goat and sheep/goat. Few farms and animals (10 cattle and 4 sheep farms) were detected by clinical suspicion; these are located in the departments of Allier, Puy de Dôme, Cher, Creuse, Nièvre, and Lot.

[The above assessment provides a plausible explanation to the alleged spread and apparent incidence and spread of BTV-8 during the winter months, a season during which the culicoides vectors are considered to be non-active. As the authors state, if positive diagnosis within the survey is based upon RT-PCR test, "new outbreaks may reflect viral circulation which had occurred within the last 6 months." Such a situation may, thus, in some if not all cases, not reflect recent "spread" but rather a recording of spread which had taken place during late 2015. This may explain the apparent absence of clinical cases in cattle since the end of 2015 and the total absence of clinical cases in sheep since September 2015. - Mod.AS
