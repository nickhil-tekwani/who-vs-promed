Anthrax in Guinea Bissau: the OIE responds to the call for assistance
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Government of Guinea Bissau declared a human outbreak of anthrax in the
Oio Region, affecting over 80 patients, with 13 hospitalisations and 4 deaths.
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) were informed on 3 May 2005.
The Oio Region's economy depends, mostly, on animal husbandry by small
farmers. The impact of the anthrax epidemic could be disastrous both for
humans and the susceptible animal population if it is not quickly controlled.
The Authorities in Guinea Bissau have appealed to the international community
for urgent and strong support to control the epidemic. The OIE has been in
continuous contact with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the Veterinary
Authorities of Guinea Bissau in order to better assess the situation and to
initiate the proper actions. As an immediate step in response to the urgent
situation, the OIE has allocated a grant from its emergency fund to enable the
Veterinary Authorities to begin a blanket [cattle] vaccination programme in
the affected region, which contains over 50 000 cattle.
Since anthrax is a zoonosis, the OIE, together with the FAO and the WHO, are
strongly committed to jointly provide the best possible assistance in their
respective competencies to the Guinea Bissau Authorities in facing and
controlling this crisis.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, USA and several non-
governmental organizations have also proposed to provide support.ï¿½
