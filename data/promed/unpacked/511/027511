AFRICAN SWINE FEVER, LEGAL ISSUES: PUBLICATION
**********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

The Legal Office of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is pleased
to announce the online publication of "Institutional and Legal Measures to
Combat African Swine Fever" by Jessica Vapnek, Legal Officer with FAO's
Development Law Service.
Ms. Vapnek's article is the third installment in the "FAO Legal Papers
Online" series. It is available in PDF format at
http://www.fao.org/Legal/default.htm, or by opening the FAO homepage at
http://www.fao.org/, and following the links to the FAO Legal Office Legal
Studies page.

The article presents a systematic review of institutional and legal issues
relevant to the control of animal diseases, particularly, African Swine
Fever. It outlines and examines the elements countries should consider
putting into place before the appearance of African Swine Fever, including
emergency plans, funding mechanisms, legislation, and public awareness
campaigns. The section on legislation should prove particularly useful to
policy makers, as it highlights the many separate features that ought to be
included in an effective legal framework. The article then proceeds to
examine the actions that need to be taken after an outbreak has occurred.
The article is not intended to describe the current situation in at-risk
countries (although some boxed examples from countries affected by the
disease are included), nor to prescribe detailed measures all governments
should take (an unrealistic objective in any event since each country's
circumstances are different). Rather, the article is intended to provide a
checklist of issues and options for planners interested in improving their
capability to respond to an outbreak of African Swine Fever, a disease
which, if unchecked, can completely wipe out a country's swine population.
It is hoped that this article will trigger further discussions on the links
between animal health and legal issues, subjects which are too often
considered in isolation from one another.
For those without web access, e-mail or paper copies of the article may be
requested from the FAO Legal Office, FAO, 00100, Rome, Italy,
dev-law@fao.org.
FAO Legal Papers Online is devoted to the exploration of important
contemporary legal issues in the areas of food policy, agriculture, rural
development, environment, biodiversity and natural resource management.
Papers in this series are offered in hopes of provoking dialogue and debate
on complex and often controversial issues. Readers are encouraged to send
any comments or reactions they may have regarding a Legal Paper Online to
the above address. Future FAO Legal Papers Online will be posted on a
periodic basis.
The positions and opinions presented in FAO Legal Papers Online are those
of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
