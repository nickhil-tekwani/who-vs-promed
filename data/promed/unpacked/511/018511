In March 2019, FAO, OIE and WHO launched a guide for countries taking the One Health approach to address zoonotic disease. This guide was entitled "Taking a Multisectoral, One Health Approach: A Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries". As of October 2019, the guide is available in French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Chinese [in addition to English].

"Every day we hear about health challenges at the human-animal-environment interface. Zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza, rabies, Ebola, and Rift Valley fever continue to have major impacts on health, livelihoods, and economies. These health threats cannot be effectively addressed by one sector alone. Multidisciplinary and multisectoral collaboration is needed to tackle them and to reduce their impacts.

"As a way to support countries in taking a One Health approach to address zoonotic diseases, the guide 'Taking a Multisectoral, One Health Approach: A Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries' has been jointly developed by the Tripartite organizations (FAO, OIE and WHO). This guide, referred to as the Tripartite Zoonotic Guide (TZG), is flexible enough to be used for other health threats at the human-animal-environment interface, for example, food safety and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

"The TZG provides principles, best practices and options to assist countries in achieving sustainable and functional collaboration at the human-animal-environment interface. Examples and lessons learned from countries' experiences are also included.

"By using the TZG and its associated operational tools (which are currently being developed), countries can build or strengthen their national capacities in multisectoral One Health coordination, mapping country context, planning and preparedness, surveillance and information sharing, investigation and response, joint risk assessment, risk communication, and workforce development.

"Options for monitoring and evaluating the impact of these activities are included, allowing countries to make improvements in their zoonotic disease frameworks, strategies and policies. Moreover, taking the One Health approach presented in the TZG helps countries to make the best use of limited resources and reduces indirect societal losses, such as impacts on livelihoods of small producers, poor nutrition, and restriction of trade and tourism.

"By working together and collaboratively, our global health systems are improved in a sustainable way ensuring an efficient prevention of the global health risks".

["Controlling zoonotic pathogens at their animal source -- that is, pathogens that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa -- is the most effective and economic way of protecting people. Consequently, global strategies to prevent and control pathogens must be developed if we are to protect public health. These should be coordinated at the human-animal-ecosystems interface and applied at the national, regional and global levels, through the implementation of appropriate policies".
