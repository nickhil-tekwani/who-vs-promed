EPIDEMIOLOGISTS: REQUEST FOR INFO
=================================
Date: Fri, 9 May 1997 16:00:24 -0400 (EDT)
From: EpiMon@aol.com

The Epidemiology Monitor, a newsletter publication for epidemiologists, is
preparing to reissue Episource, a guide to resources in epidemiology. One of
the chapters in this guide is devoted to information on resources and key
contacts in epidemiology in various countries. (For example, the name and
locating information of the professional association to which most
epidemiologists in the country belong, the name and locating information for
the unit in the ministry of health that employs epidemiologists, etc).
We need to identify individuals who can work with us to collect this
information on the following countries:
Brazil
Greece
Netherlands
Nigeria
Republic of Cameroon
Saudi Arabia
Venezuela
Zambia.
If any readers of this list would be willing to volunteer to assist us,
please contact at the Epidemiology Monitor office. The number is
770-594-1613. Because of time differences, it may be best to communicate
through email.
Any readers who participate will be listed as contributors to Episource in
the credits for the book. Thank you for your time. I look forward to
hearing from you.
