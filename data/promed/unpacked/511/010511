The ministry of health (MOH) has confirmed an outbreak of meningitis in Adjumani and Arua districts [of Uganda]. A total of 31 suspected cases have been reported since the 1st case was registered late last month [January 2014]. However there have been no deaths.

In a press release issued by the MOH, Adjumani district has recorded the highest number of cases with 14 cases followed by Arua, which has so far registered 13 cases. The release reveals that the neighbouring districts of Koboko and Maracha have recorded 2 cases.

The release states that "the outbreak was reported after receiving confirmatory results from central public health laboratory (CPHL), which proved that 2 people had tested positive for the disease." The most affected areas in Adjumani district are the 3 districts hosting refugees who fled from South Sudan due to the current instability. The affected sub-counties include Dzaipi, Adropi, and Arinyapi, which share borders with South Sudan where a weekly market operates. This is likely to amplify transmission in the region and spill over the border.

According to the release the ministry has dispatched a team of health experts to strengthen the local team in the districts. "The necessary drug supplies have been mobilized; plans are under way to designate treatment centers in all the existing health facilities in the affected districts," states the release.

[Adjumani is a district in northwestern Uganda; it borders the district of Arua to the southwest and South Sudan to the north. Arua is also a district in northwestern Uganda, but it is separated from the border with South Sudan by the Ugandan districts of Koboko, Maracha, and Yumbe. For a map of Ugandan districts, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda.

South Sudan and Uganda are included in the WHO African meningitis belt, a region in sub-Saharan Africa where the incidence rate of meningitis is very high. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the African meningitis belt each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/images/map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis-large.png.

_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A is said to have been the most commonly isolated pathogen in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751). In March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://tinyurl.com/q3jm3jg), and other bacterial species such as, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ have also been implicated (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region 20131028.2024307). However, we are not told what pathogen is causing the current outbreak in northwestern Uganda, although the news release above implies that it is the result of "hosting refugees who fled from South Sudan due to the current instability."

In May 2013, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), in collaboration with the South Sudanese Ministry of Health, stemmed a meningococcal meningitis serogroup A outbreak and vaccinated against the disease over 130 000 people with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in South Sudan's Upper Nile state (see http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=6802). Starting in October 2013, WHO expected that South Sudan would complete vaccinating its 5.6 million at risk population with meningitis conjugate vaccines in 3 phases by 2015 (http://www.emro.who.int/surveillance-forecasting-response/surveillance-events/meningitis-south-sudan.html).

WHO reported (WHO Global Alert and Response, available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/index.html) that the number of cases reported from 1 Jan to 12 May 2013 (epidemiological week 19) was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20130606.1759273). The decrease in number of cases of meningitis was thought to be due to the progressive introduction of meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt since 2010. - Mod.ML
