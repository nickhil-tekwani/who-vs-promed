Almost 1000 double-crested cormorants and ring-billed gulls have died
on a western Minnesota lake from Newcastle disease, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said Friday [6 Aug 2010]. As of
Wednesday (4 Aug 2010), about 500 cormorants and 400 ring-billed
gulls had been found dead on Marsh Lake near Appleton in Big Stone County.

More testing is being done to determine the strain of the viral
disease, which most commonly infects cormorants, but also has been
found in gulls and pelicans. Clinical signs in wild birds are often
neurologic and include droopy head or twisted neck, lack of
coordination, inability to fly or dive and complete or partial
paralysis. Juveniles are most commonly affected.

Newcastle disease can sometimes affect people, generally causing
conjunctivitis, a relatively mild inflammation of the inner eyelids.
It's spread to people through close contact with sick birds.

Another die-off of 50 cormorants, meanwhile, has been discovered on
Wells Lake in Rice County, south of the Twin Cities metro area.
Samples are being tested, but the specific cause of the birds'
illness is unknown.

The DNR and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services
staff are cleaning up the sites and collecting swab and carcass
samples for lab analysis.

Newcastle disease is not new to Minnesota. The last outbreak covered
a 7-county area in 2008, when 2400 birds died. In 1992, several
outbreaks occurred across the Great Lakes, Upper Midwest, and Canada,
killing an estimated 35 000 birds.

[Newcastle disease is an acute viral disease of domestic poultry and
many other bird species. It is a worldwide problem that presents
primarily as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous
manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form.
Mortality is variable. Occurrence of a virulent form of the disease
is reportable and may result in trade restrictions.

Virulent NDV strains are endemic in poultry in most of Asia, Africa,
and some countries of North, Central, and South America. Other
countries, including the USA and Canada, are free of those strains
and maintain that status with import restrictions and eradication by
destroying diseased poultry. Cormorants, pigeons, and imported
psittacine species have also been sources of virulent NDV infections
of poultry. Low virulence NDV is prevalent in poultry and wild birds,
especially waterfowl. Infection of domestic poultry with low
virulence NDV contributes to lower productivity.

Infected birds shed virus in exhaled air, respiratory discharges, and
feces. Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical stage,
and for a varying but limited period during convalescence. Virus may
also be present in eggs laid during clinical disease and in all parts
of the carcass during acute virulent infections. Chickens are readily
infected by aerosols and by ingesting contaminated water or food.
Infected chickens are the primary source of virus, but other domestic
and wild birds may be sources of NDV. Transfer of virus, especially
in infective feces, by the movement of people and contaminated
equipment is the main method of spread between poultry flocks.

Onset is rapid, and signs appear throughout the flock within 2-12
days (average 5) after aerosol exposure. Spread is slower if the
fecal-oral route is the primary means of transmission, particularly
for caged birds. Young birds are the most susceptible. Observed signs
depend on whether the infecting virus has a predilection for
respiratory, digestive, or nervous systems. Respiratory signs of
gasping, coughing, sneezing, and rales predominate in low virulence
infections. Nervous signs of tremors, paralyzed wings and legs,
twisted necks, circling, clonic spasms, and complete paralysis may
accompany, but usually follow, the respiratory signs in neurotropic
velogenic disease.

Nervous signs with diarrhea are typical in pigeons, and nervous signs
are frequently seen in cormorants and exotic bird species.
Respiratory signs with depression, watery-greenish diarrhea, and
swelling of the tissues of the head and neck are typical of the most
virulent form of the disease, viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle
disease (VVND, also called exotic Newcastle disease), although
nervous signs may also be seen. Varying degrees of depression and
inappetence are observed.
