Epidemiological situation of FMD in Bulgaria (2nd outbreak in the
municipality of Stredets, Burgas region)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fax from Dr Yordan Voynov, Executive Director of the Bulgarian Food
Safety Authority (BFSA):

On 19 Mar 2011 we notified an FMD outbreak in a bovine farm located
in the west part of Strandja Mountain, municipality of Stredets,
Burgas region at a distance of 7 km [4.4 mi] from the Turkish border,
3 km [2 mi] from the closest village -- Kirovo and 42 km [26 mi] from
the outbreak as of 31 Jan 2011 in Gramatikovo, Malko Turnovo
municipality. In the farm there were 143 bovines. In the 3 km
surveillance zone there are 7 villages.

On 23 Mar 2011 in the framework of routine clinical examinations,
clinical signs of FMD were observed in a bovine herd in one of the
villages in the 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zone -- Granichar, at a
distance of 6 km [3.7 mi] from the infected farm and 3 km [2 mi] from
the border with Turkey. In the village there is only one herd with 133
bovines. No other susceptible animal species are kept there. Since
January 2011 the bovine herd was blood sampled in 5 rounds (8 Jan 2011
-- 50 bovines; 28 Jan 2011 -- 106 bovines; 7 Feb 2011 -- 48 bovines;
16 Feb 2011 -- 48 bovines; and 25 Feb -- 48 bovines blood sampled) and
all the laboratory tests were negative for FMD. Today, 24 Mar 2011,
the NRL (National Reference Laboratory) in Sofia confirmed the
diagnosis. BFSA immediately started the measures for eradication of
the outbreak and the organisation for killing and burial of the
animals. In the 3 km [2 mi] protection zone there are 2 villages and
in the 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zone there are 8 villages.

[The detailed information included in Bulgaria's reports to the EU is
indicative of the valuable combination of clinical and serological
surveillance and the importance of the systematic application of
protection and surveillance zones, as prescribed by the EU
regulations. The significant piece of information is the appearance of
clinical disease in animals which have been shown to be serologically
negative up to 25 Feb 2011.

Since the report does not include data on the estimated age of the
lesions observed, it is not clear if the apparently 2nd outbreak in
Stredets municipality above started after or rather before the one
detected on 18 Mar 2011. The appearance of those 2 new outbreaks is,
anyway, indicative of the continued circulation of the virus. Results
of the epidemiological investigation into the route of introduction
are anticipated with interest.

This outbreak has been reported to the OIE on 24 Mar 2011; according
to the report, there were 6 cases out of the 133 head in the affected
herd. For the report, including a map, see
