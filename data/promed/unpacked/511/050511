Meningococcal disease in India
------------------------------
Between 29 Mar and 10 am on 6 May 2005, 111 cases of meningococcal disease
have been reported in Delhi. To date 15 deaths have been reported.
Most of the cases and all deaths have occurred in the young adult
population. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) has
demonstrated the presence of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A in
cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 5 cases. Most cases have been reported
from Old Delhi.
The national authorities have established a coordination mechanism and an
experts group to provide support in investigation, adaptation of guidelines
and tools, response and to regularly review the disease situation as well
as to provide advice on appropriate strategies. This group is comprised of
MoHFW, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Committee
(NDMC), hospitals, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD),
the World Health Organization (WHO) and other relevant institutions. This
meeting is chaired by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Union
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Surveillance for early detection of cases, case management, and prevention
of spread of the disease has been stepped up. A 24 hour control room is
established in NICD. Technical guidelines are being distributed. A
Newsletter (CD Alert) focusing on meningococcal disease is being made
available to physicians. Media briefs are regularly released.
Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts and vaccination of high risk population
groups is continuing. Health professionals and workers are being oriented
on prevention, case management, and infection control practices.
WHO is working closely with the national authorities and providing
technical support to the health authorities in the form of guidelines and
tools, in monitoring of the situation, and epidemiological investigations.
Past outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in this region -- a brief overview:
Meningococcal disease is endemic in Delhi and sporadic cases of
meningococcal meningitis have been occurring in Delhi in previous years. In
addition, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in and around Delhi, India
have been documented during 1966 and 1985. During 1966, 616 cases of
meningitis were reported with a case fatality rate of 20.9 per cent. The
highest proportion of cases and deaths occurred in those under 1 year of
age followed by those aged 1-4 years. The male to female ratio was almost
3:1. Because of non-availability of reagents, grouping of _N.meningitidis_
could not be performed.
The outbreak in 1985 was bigger in magnitude, both in terms of cases and
the geographical area affected. 6133 cases with 799 deaths (13 per cent)
were reported. The male to female ratio of cases was 3:1. All the isolates
of _N. meningitidis_ belonged to subgroup A. Isolated cases of
meningococcal meningitis in 1985 were also reported from several other
parts of India namely Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Gujarat,
Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Chandigarh, Kerala, and Orissa. In 1985
Bhutan was also hit by meningitis and 247 cases with 41 deaths were
reported between Sep 1985 and Mar 1986.
From 1982 to 1984, 1475 cases occurred in Kathmandu valley, Nepal with the
highest mortality and morbidity in children less than 1 year of age.

Rare bacterial meningitis infections continue to rise in Indian capital
-----------------------------------------------
The number of rare bacterial meningitis cases in the Indian capital region
rose by 17 to 187 on Mon 9 May 2005, prompting the chief minister of Delhi
state to press health officials to devise ways to curb the spread,
officials said. Since the outbreak of the disease was reported earlier in
May 2005, 15 people have died, and new cases reported by hospitals have
risen almost daily to the current 187, a New Delhi Health Ministry official
said.
Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dixit, called a meeting of health officials
and municipal officers on Mon 9 May 2005 aimed at devising ways to curb
further spread of the disease, which has spread from the heart of the city
to outlying suburbs.
Newspapers reported 3 deaths due to suspected meningitis in Noida township,
adjacent to New Delhi. One death was reported from Chandigarh, the nearby
capital of the northern state of Punjab, also due to suspected meningitis.
On Fri 6 May 2005, New Delhi municipal health officer JN Banwarikar said 15
people had died due to the disease in the capital, which has a population
of about 14 million.
Earlier in May 2005, several cases were 1st reported from Old Delhi, the
heart and most congested part of the city, but bacterial meningitis has now
been reported from all parts of the capital, the spokesman said.

Meningitis spreads to Delhi's vicinity
--------------------------------------
The deadly brain fever meningococcal meningitis has started making its
presence felt in India's neighboring states. The Hindu reports that
neighboring localities such as Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Noida, and Faridabad
have also been affected by the dreaded disease.
The death toll from the disease has remained at 15, and no new deaths have
been reported in the past 24 hours. But what has alarmed health officials
is that the disease is not showing signs of slowing down, and the infection
has spread to various parts of the capital, and 33 fresh cases were
admitted to various city hospitals.
JN Banavaliker said that, although fresh cases were coming up, the disease
has not acquired epidemic proportions. He noted that patients from
Moradabad and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh also have been admitted to various
hospitals in Delhi.
Meanwhile, a high-level team from India's Health Ministry visited various
hospitals in the city to check whether directives it issued to stop the
spread of meningococcal meningitis were being complied with.
