Belgian health authorities issued a preventive call to the passengers arriving
in Brussels from Sierra Leone on 11 Jul [2006], or who flew on the morning of
that day to Frankfurt, Germany. Information from Germany indicated that a
Lassa fever case traveled that route.
Belgian health authorities were informed last night [21 Jul 2006] that a
person hospitalized in Germany arrived in Brussels that day [21 Jul 2006] in a
Brussels Airlines flight coming from Freetown, [Sierra Leone], where [the
passenger] contracted Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic viral fever, per the analysis
that was provided.
The patient, who arrived in Brussels a 03:35 GMT, took a flight to Frankfurt
with the same company at 04:30 GMT, according to the radio station Bel-RTL.ï¿½
Health authorities [Belgian?] who made the announcement concerning the case
request that passengers on those 2 flights contact the Ambres University
Hospital.
Lassa fever, which takes its name from the region in Nigeria where the first
case appeared in 1969, is very contagious and can be fatal. Lassa fever virus
is transmitted in blood, urine, saliva, and respiratory secretions, although
the patient did not manifest this [respiratory symptoms] during the trip from
Freetown to Frankfurt, according to the communication.

[Fortunately, the risk of aerosolized Lassa fever virus transmission via the
respiratory route is extremely low.
There have been sporadic cases of rodent reservoir-to-human transmission in
West Africa. Human-to-human Lassa fever virus transmission has been mainly a
hospital problem when medical staff, other patient care-givers, and persons
(especially family members) in intimate contact with Lassa fever patients have
been directly exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, usually in the absence
of barrier nursing. Early in the initial Nigerian epidemic, a nurse infected
and ill with Lassa fever virus traveled from Nigeria to New York by air
without transmission of the virus to other passengers or the airline crew. In
studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, there was no evidence of Lassa fever
virus transmission to airline passengers traveling with confirmed Lassa fever
cases (1). Similarly, in 2004, 19 passengers on a flight from London to
Newark, New Jersey, USA, with a Lassa fever virus-infected man returning from
Liberia, were considered at low risk of exposure, and none became infected
with the virus -- see ProMED ref. below. While awareness is indicated, care
should be taken not to engender fear among the passengers.
