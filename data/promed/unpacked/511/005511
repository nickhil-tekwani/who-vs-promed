An outbreak of illness is causing concern Monday [2 May 2022], at an East Lansing assisted living facility. Dozens of people have become sick with the norovirus at Burcham Hills. The assisted living facility in East Lansing has about 53 norovirus cases.

Ingham County Health Officer Linda Vail said it is pretty common to have this kind of outbreak in an assisted living facility. "Because of people living together in close quarters, oftentimes in the wintertime, just flu-like outbreaks happen in those kinds of facilities," Vail said. "Anything that's really highly contagious and can spread very quickly."

Norovirus is often compared to a bad stomach bug. It's not deadly, but it's highly contagious and can lead to dehydration. The most common symptoms are usually more annoying than painful. "It spreads easily between people," Vail said. "Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, fever oftn. It's very contagious, usually lasts 2 to 3 days."

Bad food handling and bad hygiene practices, like forgetting to disinfect your work station or wash your hands, can lead to norovirus outbreaks. Because of that, Burcham Hills closed down its dining room until further notice. Vail said, "They are basically placing what we call contact isolation so that they don't necessarily have that much contact with others. They're going to receive meals in-room trays with disposable dining wear."

People with active symptoms are isolated for 48 hours. Staff members are required to stay home 72 hours after symptoms have gone away.

There are about 2500 reported norovirus outbreaks in the US every year.

[It is unclear if the outbreak was person-to-person or foodborne or a combination. Morbidity may be more substantial in an assisted living facility.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it is about 1 in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for a smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL
