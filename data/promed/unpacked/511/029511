According to locals in Rangoon's New Dagon South Area and East Area,
foot & mouth disease [FMD] recently occurred in the area. Contact was
made with an official of the Livestock Veterinary Bureau via "Voice
of Myanmar," and the news was confirmed.
A total of 16 confirmed FMD cases and 67 suspected cases were found
in New Dagon South's X District [English place name not
identifiable]. A total of 3 cases of FMD and 40 suspected cases were
found in New Dagon East's X District [English place name not
identifiable]
Local veterinary agencies are closely monitoring the situation.
According to the veterinary agencies, it is easy for water buffalo
and cows to get infected with FMD during the rainy season. If penned
pigs become infected, this will cause the outbreak to spread rapidly.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver
[An official notification, including data on the virus serotype
involved, is anticipated.
According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, the
disease is endemic in Myanmar. The last reported serotypes are: O
(2006), Asia 1 (2005), A (1978).
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/asia/mya.htm>.
Myanmar sends monthly FMD reports to SEAFMD, the Regional
Coordination Unit for the control of FMD in Southeast Asia; see at
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php?reptype=table&state=MMR&month=07&year=2007>.
During June 2007, 4 outbreaks in bovines were reported, caused by an
untyped virus strain. In July 2007, one outbreak, caused by serotype
O, was reported from Ayeyarwaddy, Hinthbata, Ingapu, affecting 18 out
of 167 susceptible bovines. The location is indicated in a map,
available from the above SEAFMD URL.
Endemically infected countries are not required to report each
outbreak to the OIE, but have to provide semi-annual and annual
reports.- Mod.AS].
