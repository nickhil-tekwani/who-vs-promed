Details of the cases are as follows:

- A 91-year-old male from Riyadh city who developed symptoms on [4 Jan 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [6 Jan 2015]. The patient has comorbidities. He has neither a history of direct contact with camels nor of consuming raw camel products, but his sons have frequent contacts with camels. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition and remains in isolation. [reported as a confirmed case by MOH on 9 Jan 2015, and reported as having recovered on 14 Jan 2015. - Mod.MPP]

[reported as a confirmed case by MOH on 9 Jan 2015 and reported as recovered on 20 Jan 2015. - Mod.MPP]

- An 80-year-old male from Riyadh city who developed symptoms on [4 Jan 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [6 Jan 2015]. The patient has comorbidities. He travelled to Jeddah in the 14 days prior to symptoms onset. The patient has no history of exposure to any of the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms in either Jeddah or Riyadh. Currently, the patient is in ICU in critical condition. [reported as a confirmed case by the MOH on 8 Jan 2015 and a recovered case on 12 Jan 2015. - Mod.MPP]

- A 53-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city who presented to hospital with a history of cardiovascular disease and was admitted on [24 Dec 2014]. On [4 Jan 2015], the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV. He regularly visited a health care facility not associated with previous MERS-CoV outbreaks. He had no history of exposure to any of the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient was admitted to ICU but passed away on [5 Jan 2015]. [reported as a fatal confirmed case by the MOH on 7 Jan 2015. - Mod.MPP]

- A 61-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city who developed symptoms on [2 Jan 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [3 Jan 2015]. The patient has comorbidities but no history of exposure to any of the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in ICU in critical condition. [reported as a confirmed case by MOH on 6 Jan 2015, at which time was noted to be in the ICU. - Mod.MPP]

Cases are listed by date of reporting, with the most recent case listed 1st. Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 955 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 351 related deaths.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the above WHO report, there have now been a total of 955 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 351 deaths (case fatality rate 36.8 percent) reported to WHO. The WHO update provides more information and details than were available in the original confirmation reports, including the histories of possible indirect exposure to camels and camel products on the part of 2 of the cases.

A question that comes to mind is whether the son of the 91-year-old male has been tested for MERS-CoV infection and whether the camels that the son had contact with had also been tested for the MERS-CoV.
