A day after 5 government agencies met to discuss ways to combat an
outbreak of dengue fever -- which has already infected hundreds of
people -- officials from the mayoralty and the health affairs
department started blaming each other for the situation.

Over 200 people contracted the disease over the past 2 weeks. A total
of 750 cases over the past 16 weeks have been confirmed.

The Directorate General of Health Affairs in Jizan region launched a
campaign to raise awareness of dengue fever under the slogan "[the
fight] against dengue is everyone's responsibility" under the
auspices of the Emir of Jizan, Prince Muhammad ibn Nasser, who
inaugurated the exhibition of the campaign in the King Fahad Central
Hospital, and met with field teams to participate in the campaign.

This comes at a time when the number of cases of dengue fever in
Jazan as of the end of April [2010] was 156, which were distributed
equally between the 2 sectors Samtah and Jizan. The Assistant
Director of Health for primary care in the region of Jazan, Dr. Ahmad
Sahli, commented on the importance of awareness in the disease
campaign for dengue fever, pointing out that international experience
in combating the disease proved that control without the
participation of the community is not feasible because the mosquito
vectors of dengue fever [virus] are there in the home. He noted that
the campaign was launched through 2 main areas: 1st, a drive-through
from house to house to field visit homes and work on the distribution
of leaflets for awareness of dengue fever in ways that are simple for
all, and 2nd, to drive through the community for the 141 task force,
aimed at schools and social gatherings in the markets and clubs in
order to spread awareness of the disease.

Among the students, it is said that a number of them studying in the
province of Hadramout colleges of the University of Aden left there
and returned to their areas infected with dengue fever virus, where
they had visited the most populous districts of Aden.

In a statement to Change, one of the students said: "Dengue fever has
spread in the province of Aden and has produced unusual fear, which
led a number of students to leave the province." He noted that during
the 5 days he was lying in a hospital bed for medical treatment, his
condition has not improved yet due to the severity of fever [virus]
transmitted to him and to the weakness of hospital services.

From January to the 1st week of April this year [2010], 77 people
contracted dengue fever in the country. The number surpasses the 37
cases recorded for all of 2009, according to the Ministry of Health.

Senior Public Health Officer Kamaludin Mohamad Yassin from the
Entomology and Parasitology Unit under the ministry's Environment
Health Services, said the increase in the number of cases is
alarming. This marks a rise of 24 cases during the 1st week of April
alone this year [2010], as it was stated in an earlier report that
there were only 53 cases from January to the beginning of April 2010.
The report also stated that for the 1st time, Brunei has reported 2
cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever, which is a more virulent form of
dengue [disease] whereby a patient bleeds through his skin, nose or eyes.

"Even though this figure is small compared with some of our
neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, this is still a worrying
figure when taking into context the size of our population," said the
senior public health officer on the sidelines of the Ministry of
Health's briefing on dengue fever and environmental hygiene yesterday
[28 Apr 2010] at the Muhibah Hall, Brunei-Muara District Office. He
told the media that a majority of these cases were from Kampong Ayer,
where pools of stagnant water can be found due to poor sewage
management. "There are areas in Kampong Ayer with a lot of rubbish
floating in the water. This rubbish is not being cleared or taken
care of appropriately, which results in a breeding place for the
_Aedes_ mosquitoes," he said, explaining that the _Aedes_ mosquito is
a known vector for carrying the dengue virus. [Rubbish can collect
fresh water, the breeding sites for _Aedes_ mosquitoes. However,
sewage is not a breeding site. - Mod.TY]

Kamaludin added that other possible causes for the increase of the
disease, seen not only in Brunei but throughout the whole world,
included the unusually high rainfall experienced in the Sultanate
during the 1st 3 months of the year [2010] and also the storage of
water in homes. "We have to keep the water covered to prevent the
mosquitoes from breeding," the senior public health officer said.
With this in mind, Kamaludin added that the public cannot be
complacent in trying to prevent dengue fever.

During his presentation, the senior public health officer told
participants of the briefing that of the total 77 cases recorded this
year [2010], 67 were from the Brunei-Muara District. Kuala Belait had
5 cases followed by Tutong with 4 and Temburong, one case. As much as
86 percent of this year's infection was recorded from Kampong Ayer, a
change in trend compared to the previous 5 years when only an average
of 13 percent of the Sultanate's cases were from the water village.

Asked if there were any "serious" cases recorded recently, Kamaludin
recalled only one, which occurred in 2009. "But this person had
underlying chronic illnesses. ... The virus lowered his immunity,
which made him more susceptible to other illnesses," said the senior
public health officer.

Dr Narinrat Pichayakamin, a Public Health Doctor of Phuket, said that
the rising temperature in Phuket had made an increase of dengue fever
patients likely. From the beginning of the year [2010], there were
123 dengue fever patients admitted into hospitals on the island.
Consequently, it made Phuket the 11th province in Thailand for the
number of dengue fever patients.

May to December is the risky period, since it's the usual time for
the mosquitoes to breed. Therefore, Phuket Public Health Office asks
people to destroy any possible habitats of the mosquitoes around
their residences to stop them breeding.

The yearly dengue fever outbreak claimed the lives of 2 children at
Sanglah Hospital last week [week of 25 Apr 2010]. The 2 victims were
a 4-year-old from Badung regency who died Thursday [29 Apr 2010], and
an 11-year-old from Karangasem regency who died Friday [30 Apr 2010].
Both patients had only been treated for a day.

At least 6 people -- 4 of them children -- have died of the disease
at the hospital this year [2010]," Ken Wirasandhi, head of the
hospital's service department, said. "Both victims suffered from
dengue shock syndrome."

Ken said that the hospital's environment also posed a risk of
spreading dengue fever [virus] to relatives of dengue patients
staying at the hospital. Therefore, he said, the hospital management
would put in place strict measures to exterminate mosquitoes. "We
will use electric mosquito repellents [mosquito killing electrical
screens?] in all rooms and fumigate every week," he said. "We also
counsel patients' relatives every Tuesday and Thursday."

Many patients are still unaware of the need to immediately get tests
done if they experience persistent fevers, Ken said, adding that
these people wrongly believe they have only contracted a common fever
or influenza, he added.

Queensland Health has confirmed a resident from Wongaling Beach and 3
people from Tully have been diagnosed with locally acquired cases of
the mosquito borne-disease [virus]. Health officials believe the
cases are part of the Tully outbreak, which occurred in March [2010].
It was the 1st time Tully had a dengue outbreak in 20 years. The new
cases bring the total number of dengue victims in the Far North to 7.
It follows the worst epidemic of dengue in 50 years in North
Queensland last wet season, when a record 931 cases of dengue [virus]
type 3 were confirmed.

Dengue fever is spread by a species of mosquito [most commonly _Aedes
aegypti_ - Mod.TY], which breeds in and around homes and worksites.
Queensland Health Medical Director Dr Jeffrey Hanna said dengue fever
causes sudden fever with headaches, which can be severe, muscle and
joint pains, a rash and in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea. "It's
important that people with dengue symptoms are seen by their doctor.
This way we can target our mosquito control efforts and track the
outbreak," he said. Dr Hanna said although north Queensland has had a
relatively quiet dengue season so far, these new cases were a crucial
reminder for local residents to take action now and not to become
complacent. "There is a large amount of people movement across north
Queensland, including between Townsville and Cairns, where
historically we have had frequent dengue outbreaks," said Dr Hanna.
"With the recent rains and warm temperatures, I strongly urge all
Tully and Wongaling Beach residents to take preventive steps. It is
important that people -- individuals as well as businesses -- get rid
of mosquito breeding sites around the yard and workplace."

In the Bouches-du-Rhone [area], 150 oviposition traps were placed to
see if _Aedes albopictus_ is present. This refers to _Aedes
albopictus_, the mosquito that carries the chikungunya virus, but
also that of dengue. A man living in Marseille, came from Comoros 27
Apr [2010], developed symptoms of dengue 3 days later. "We have made
rapid tests that have identified a protein signature of the virus in
circulation. The diagnosis was confirmed by a molecular tests," says
Dr. Remi Charrel, Laboratory of Virology, Timone-Unit of emerging
viruses. This case was identified in Arles.

"This [is an] imported case," says Jean-Jacques Coiplet, the
territorial delegate from the Regional Health Agency (LRA) for
Bouches-du-Rhone. "In 2009, we then had 7 cases of chikungunya and
dengue," he added. "The risk now is that indigenous cases develop.
[One must] assume that _Aedes albopictus_ disseminates either of the
diseases here. And this hypothesis is not excluded because, since
2009, _Aedes albopictus_ is found in Italy, then in the Mentone area,
and has been seen in 2 neighborhoods of Marseille: the 11th and 12th
boroughs. Hence, the recommendation of virologists inviting the
population of these neighborhoods to be vigilant about using
repellents and not leaving water catchments. Jean-Jacques Coiplet
wants [to be] reassuring, however: "To develop indigenous cases,
there must be an encounter with an infected mosquito when it is
competent [for virus transmission]."

Since 1 May [2010], the prevention plan against the spread of dengue
[virus] has been active with mandatory reporting of the disease and
also intervention by the Interdepartmental Agreement for Mosquito
Control. 150 ovitraps, were placed in the Bouches-du-Rhone [area].
Mosquitoes lay eggs, but there are insecticides that prevent eggs
from developing. For now, _Aedes albopictus_ was seen in 2009 [but]
has not reappeared.

[Although no _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes have been detected so far
this year (2010) in the Bouches-du-Rhone area, it is prudent to carry
out surveillance and prepare for control measures in the area, as
this vector has been present in this part of the Mediterranean coast
recently, and likely is still present currently in coastal France and
nearby Italy.

A 34-year-old woman has died from hemorrhagic dengue in El Salvador,
raising the death toll from the disease to 11 [what time period? -
Mod.TY], Deputy Health Minister Violeta Menjivar said. More than 6500
cases of the classic type of the disease have been registered [in

destroy the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes that carry the disease.

The latest victim lived in the western province of Sonsonate and
received treatment when the disease was at an advanced stage, Menjivar said.

As of 10 Dec [2009], 98 hemorrhagic dengue cases had been registered
in El Salvador, compared to 41 as of the same date last year [2008],
marking a 139 percent increase in cases of the disease, the Health
Ministry said in a bulletin. The 6572 classic dengue cases registered

the regions suffering from a higher incidence of dengue are
metropolitan Panama, with 128, San Miguelito, 79, Cocle, 67,

The map of the central region of the country has been painted red,
and not exactly for political or electoral reasons. In the most
recent year, at least 15 states have had a dengue epidemic, with
Miranda and the Capital District 2 of the region heading the list of
the most cases. According to the epidemiological bulletin for
[epidemiological] week 16, obtained unofficially since the Ministry
of Health ceased to publish the information since 2007, between 18-24
Apr [2010], Miranda registered at least 204 dengue cases, compared to
20 which were reported for the same period in 2009. In 4th place on
the list, passing up Merida and Tachira, is the Capital District,
with 103 affected people during the same [epidemiological] week, a
difference of 14 cases from a year ago.

The cumulative total for 2010 for the whole country is 26 724 cases
(double that of 2009), of which 10.2 percent are DHF. If one analyzes
the statistics of the past 5 years, the number of cases [this year
2010] is totally atypical, especially taking into account the
[current] drought period. The historical average of dengue infected
people in the last week of April 2010 varies between approximately
500-700; however, in 2010, the number increased to 1504.

Jose Felix Oletta, former Health Minister, indicated that this
outbreak began in June 2009 and that measures to control the increase
in cases have not been taken. "During the past 40 weeks, the
cumulative total now adds up to 56 000 cases; up to 3000 cases weekly
have been registered in the country up to the end of October [2009],
which indicates that the investment necessary to control the disease
has not been made," commented the specialist. Along these lines,
Oletta recalled that there is no way to control an outbreak without
having the numbers that permit development of plans and strategies.
So he once again demands publication of the epidemiological bulletins
for study.

The only information which the government of Miranda [state] has
about dengue incidence is generated from the Francisco de Miranda
network. Dr. Miguel Viscuna, director of Epidemiology of the state of
Miranda, noted that in [epidemiological week] 16, the 52 "Friends of
Health Houses" that are distributed throughout the state registered
just 34 cases, a difference compared to the 200 shown in the report
of the ministry of that state.

In the judgment of Viscuna, the abandonment of fumigation and
environmental cleanup by the Ministry of Health, as well as water
storage which the population has been obliged to do with the
rationing of this service, has helped to increase the [dengue] cases.
Valles del Tuy, Altos Mirandinos and Guarenas-Guatire are the most
affected regions in Miranda.

the beginning of May [2010], 11 deaths due to the disease have now
been confirmed by SESAU, with 4 in January, 2 in February, 4 in March
and one in April 2010. Before this year [2010], the most lethal
dengue epidemic in history was in 2007, when there were 2 deaths. The
[current] number of deaths could increase, since there are 9 deaths
under investigation that could be due to the disease. The number of
