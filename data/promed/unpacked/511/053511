At lease 15 nursery school children contracted [salmonellosis after
playing with chickens and ducklings, health officials in Newcastle upon
Tyne confirmed last night.
Some of the children have been admitted to hospital suffering from fever
and severe diarrhoea as a result of infection by the bacteria, but all are
said to be recovering.
The outbreak of the disease has been linked to a batch of chickens and
ducks hatched from eggs supplied by a local farm to schools in the Gosforth
area as part of a nature study project. The birds were apparently infected
with the _Salmonella_ bacteria, which was then passed on to the children, a
spokesman for Newcastle and Tyneside Health Authority said.
The three nursery schools where children have been infected have not been
named, but parents of the pupils have been told of the outbreak and advised
about the symptoms of _Salmonella_.
These usually appear 12 to 72 hours after contact with the bug, and the
disease lasts for four to seven days. Healthy adults can usually recover
without treatment, but children and the elderly may need antibiotics.
The health authority's spokesman said: "We are investigating the cause of
the infection, but it is being linked at this stage to duck and chick eggs
which were
brought into the nurseries."

_Salmonella_ infection linked to baby chicks, Oregon
As Easter approaches, health authorities in Oregon and Southwest Washington
are urging parents to protect their children from potential _Salmonella_
infection related to handling baby chicks.
Since February, seven confirmed cases of _Salmonella Montevideo_ infection
associated with exposure to baby chicks have been identified in Oregon and
Southwest Washington, according to public health officials in the
Department. Of those cases, five were children younger than five years and
two were adults.
Dr. Emilio De Bess, Oregon's state public health veterinarian says that
"Chicks, ducklings and other young fowl may not be appropriate pets for
children younger than 5 years or for persons with a weakened immune system."
