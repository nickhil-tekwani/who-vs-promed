Thai authorities said on [Tue 11 Jan 2022] that African swine fever [ASF] had been detected in a surface swab sample collected at a slaughterhouse in Nakhon Pathom province, marking the country's first official confirmation of the disease.

Authorities launched a probe at the weekend, after growing speculation in recent weeks that the disease was already decimating Thai pig herds and amid accusations of a cover up.

One sample had tested positive for ASF out of 309 collected, including blood samples from pigs at 10 farms and surface swabs at 2 slaughterhouses in swine-raising provinces, said Sorravis Thaneto, director-general of the Department of Livestock Development.

"We found one sample that tested positive for African swine fever," Sorravis told a news conference on [Tue 11 Jan 2022], where he vowed to trace the source of the disease.

The confirmation came after Thai authorities had denied for years a local outbreak of the fatal disease that has swept through Europe and Asia in recent years and killed [many] millions of pigs.

It also came days after Kasetsart University said its laboratory had last month found the disease in a dead pet pig, the first such report in Thailand.

Authorities will declare a disease outbreak zone within a 5 km [approx. 3 mile] radius of where the sample was found, limit pig movements, consider culling animals suspected of being infected, and pay compensations to affected farms, Sorravis said.

Thailand would also notify the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the official discovery of the disease, he said.

The cabinet on [Tue 11 Jan 2022] approved 574 million baht (USD 17.15 million) in compensation to smallholder farms in 56 provinces where pigs had been culled last year [2021] to prevent ASF and other viral pig diseases.

Nearly 5000 farmers are yet to be compensated for the more than 159 000 pigs culled between March and October last year [2021], a government spokesman said.

[According to the above report, nearly 5000 smallholders of pigs, in 56 (out of 76) of Thailand's provinces, are yet to be compensated for the more than 159 000 pigs culled between March and October 2021 due to control/prevention measures. This may be indicative of a possible widespread of (suspected) cases, and, on another hand, on delayed payment of due compensations to smallholders for their killed animals. As experience has shown, such delays lead to less-than-optimal reporting rates; animal owners may prefer to sell suspected or in-contact animals for market prices rather than report them to the authorities.

An interactive map presenting ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs in Asia, including all of Thailand's surrounding countries, is available at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-China/?dossier=35415&widgetid=0. To view outbreaks along Thailand's borders, in particular with Laos and Myanmar, it is suggested to zoom in.

The above report mentions one positive sample out of 309 tested, including 3 slaughterhouses (swabs) and 10 pig farms (blood samples). It is anticipated that Thailand's official notification to the OIE will include detailed information about the location(s) of the suspected or confirmed presence of the ASF virus, where and around which the disease control measures have been applied according to the above report. - Mod.AS
