Cases of chikungunya and dengue are being registered in the provinces
of Upper Gabonese Ogooue and Ogooue lolo. According to the Director
General of Health of Gabon, Mr. Khouilla. "Out of 616 samples
analyzed by the International Centre for Medical Research (CIRMF),
303 cases were positive for chikungunya virus and 15 cases of
co-infection with both diseases [viruses]. So far, no deaths have
been reported since the declaration of these epidemics in April
[2010]."

To provide a response to these 2 outbreaks, health experts have been
dispatched to the country to strengthen the management of patients
through an allocation of medicines and emergency training for health
care staff working in those areas where the epidemics exist.

Dr. Khouilla has also said that awareness campaigns are carried out
actively on the risks people face by these epidemics and how to fix
them. He also recommended spraying houses with insecticide in order
to fight against mosquitoes, the main vectors of these 2 diseases
[viruses].

Chikungunya is manifested by fever, severe joint pain and rashes.

In 2008, an outbreak of chikungunya was reported in the estuary,
particularly in Libreville and in the provinces of Woleu-Ntem,
Ogooue-Maritime. According to figures from the Ministry of Health,
more than 16 000 cases were registered during the epidemic which had
appeared for the 1st time in the country.

[The number of chikungunya virus infections has increased by 5 since
the 28 May 2010 ProMED report, indicating that the outbreak is
ongoing. Spraying houses with insecticides in the absence of
elimination of water catchments in which the vector mosquitoes breed
will provide only temporary reduction of the mosquitoes.
