[1] Sierra Leone: medical supplies blocked at docks for 2 months
Date: Sun 5 Oct 2014
Source: The New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/world/africa/sierra-leone-ebola-medical-supplies-delayed-docks.html?_r=0


It has been sitting idly on the docks for nearly 2 months: a shipping container packed with protective gowns, gloves, stretchers, mattresses, and other medical supplies needed to help fight Sierra Leone's exploding Ebola epidemic. There are 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens, 100 cases of protective suits, 80 cases of face masks, and other items -- in all, more than USD 140 000 worth of medical equipment locked inside a dented container at the port since 9 Aug 2014. Hundreds of people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone since then, and health workers have endured grave shortages of lifesaving supplies, putting them at even greater risk in a country reeling from the virus.

"We are still just hoping (!!!) -- which sounds like begging -- that this container should be cleared," one government official wrote in a frantic email to his superiors, weeks after the container arrived. In many ways, the delay reflects what some in the growing ranks of international officials pouring into this nation to fight Ebola describe as a chaotic, disorganized government response to the epidemic.

Many health care workers in Sierra Leone have died of Ebola. "It's a mess," said one foreign official working alongside the Sierra Leone government agency set up to deal with the crisis. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain vital relations with the government, said that nobody appeared to be in charge at the agency, known as the "emergency operations center," and that different factions made decisions independently. "It's the only body responsible," the official said. "What is it doing?"

In the case of the shipping container, the desperately needed supplies seem to have been caught, at least in part, in a trap that is common the world over: politics, money, and power. The supplies were donated by individuals and institutions in the United States, according to Chernoh Alpha Bah, who organized the shipment. But Mr Bah wears another hat, as well. He is an opposition politician from President Ernest Bai Koroma's hometown, Makeni -- a place that clearly showed the government's inability to contain Ebola.

Mr Bah said he thought the equipment would be welcomed by the struggling authorities, and he said he expected the shipping fee of USD 6500 would be a small detail for Sierra Leone. According to the official, the government has already received well over USD 40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola. The shipping company, as a good-will gesture in a moment of crisis, had agreed to send the goods without being paid first, Mr Bah said. But no more. 3 other containers of similar value await shipment from the United States, he said, halted by the government's long refusal to pay... -- more

[2] Liberia: home disinfection kits for Monrovia
Date: Thu 2 Oct 2014
Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) report [edited]
http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/ebola-massive-distribution-home-disinfection-kits-underway-monrovia


Teams from Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) have begun distributing more than 50 000 family protection and home disinfection kits in Monrovia, Liberia, as part of the organization's Ebola response. The kits are designed to give people some protection should a family member become ill and also allow them to disinfect their homes, reducing the chance that others in the household could become infected.

"We know these kits are not the solution to the Ebola crisis in Monrovia," said Anna Halford, coordinator for the distribution. "But the scale of the epidemic, and the inadequacy of the response so far, means that we are forced to take unprecedented and imperfect measures.

"In order to get the epidemic under control, all infected people must be able to have a bed in a treatment center, but until the facilities that have been promised materialize, this will be impossible. In the meantime, these kits offer people some protection from an infected family member until they can get the medical care they need in an Ebola management center."

The kits, which are distributed in 2 buckets, contain chlorine, soap, gloves, a gown, plastic bags, a spray bottle, and masks. The kits also contain health promotion messages and instructions for their safe use. MSF started the distribution by giving the kits to people who were turned away from MSF's treatment center when it was full, to contacts of patients at the center, to those working at the center, and to those living nearby.

"Our kits are not designed to allow people to care for an Ebola patient in their homes," said Laurence Sailly, MSF head of mission in Monrovia. "To do this safely, people need intensive training and support, but it will allow people to protect themselves from a sick family member for a short time until they can be admitted to a treatment center."... -- more

[4] Liberia: US military will have 7 Ebola testing labs throughout country
Date: Tue 7 Oct 2014
Source: Stars and Stripes [edited]
http://www.stripes.com/news/dod-to-set-up-7-ebola-testing-labs-throughout-liberia-1.307144


The US Defense Department [DOD] will operate 7 mobile testing labs in Liberia to fight the spread of Ebola, the head of US Africa Command said Tue [7 Oct 2014] at the Pentagon. Hundreds of DOD personnel are in Liberia laying the groundwork for a US military mission to fight the outbreak that the World Health Organization estimates has killed more than 3400 people. Thousands of US soldiers are scheduled to arrive this month [October 2014] to build treatment centers and oversee logistics. The humanitarian mission is likely to cost about USD 750 million over the coming 6 months, Gen. David Rodriguez said.

Defense officials have repeatedly said troops have no contact with disease sufferers, but Rodriguez said Tue [7 Oct 2014] that a few military infectious disease specialists would be working with contaminated blood samples in the mobile labs. "This is not just medical guys trained to do this [particular task], this is what they do for a living," he said. One such lab has been operational in Liberia for years, while 2 more were recently deployed. DOD now is working to send 4 more labs, he said -- each operated by 3 or 4 technicians -- needed because Ebola symptoms can mimic other tropical diseases, such as malaria. "The testing really focuses on whom you need to treat and whom you don't need to treat, because malaria shows a similar problem with the symptoms," he said.

Making sure US personnel don't catch Ebola is priority no. 1, Rodriguez said. "By providing pre-deployment training, adhering to strict medical protocols while deployed, and carrying out carefully planned reintegration measures based on risk and exposure, I am confident that we can ensure our service members' safety, and the safety of their families and the American people," he said.

While deployed, troops will use safety clothing and equipment and wash constantly to prevent the virus spreading. They'll also be checked for symptoms throughout the day, Rodriguez promised. Should anyone come down with the virus, they'll be evacuated to the United States for treatment on a specially equipped medical transport plane.

[5] Liberia: cremation brings problems
Date: Tue 7 Oct 2014

http://time.com/3478238/ebola-liberia-burials-cremation-burned


Overwhelmed by the increasing number of dead, and faced with community fears that the buried bodies may also transmit the disease -- which, if interred properly, they won't -- Liberia's government declared in August [2014] that all those who died of Ebola should be cremated.

With international help and advice, the government established a Dead Body Management program to pick up Ebola's victims and dispose of them safely. But testing for Ebola is difficult and time consuming. What little testing resources do exist are reserved for the living, says assistant health minister, Tolbert Nyenswah. With hospitals closed and doctors overwhelmed, it is almost impossible to prove that the cause of death is anything but the deadly virus. "These days, if someone dies, it's Ebola," says [a coffin-maker]. "There is no testing, no questions. Just Ebola, and they take the body away. No one has time for coffins." He hasn't sold a coffin in 2 months, ever since the Liberian government declared, in an effort to tackle the Ebola crisis, that all of the country's dead should be burned and not buried.

The government directive, while logical from an epidemiological aspect, has taken a toll on a society already traumatized by Ebola's sweep. It denies communities a final farewell, and has led to standoffs with the Dead Body Management teams who must pick up the dead even as the living insist that the cause of death was measles, or stroke, or malaria -- anything but Ebola. "We take every body, and burn it," says Nelson Sayon, who works on one of the teams. Dealing with the living is one of the most difficult aspects of his job, he says, because he knows how important grieving can be. "No one gets their body back, not even the ashes, so there is nothing physical left to mourn."

Monrovia's mass cremations, which take place in a rural area far in the outskirts of town, happen at night, to minimize the impact on neighboring communities. For a while the bodies were simply burned in a pile; now they are placed in incinerators donated by an international NGO. There are so many that it can sometimes take all night, says Sayon.

In a country where distrust between the people and the government runs deep, the mass cremations have caused a deeper rift, says Kenneth Martu, a community organizer from the Westpoint area of Monrovia. "In west Africa we don't cremate bodies at all. So when the government takes away our bodies, and can't even tell us if they died of Ebola or not, it breeds resentment." Liberians, he points out, are no strangers to mass casualties: 2 civil wars, from 1989 to 1996 and 1999 to 2003, saw nearly half a million die. "Even with mass graves, people can bring flowers. They know where to find the dead. But here we don't even know where the ashes are." [It seems insensitive not to identify the burial places of the ashes. - Mod.JW]

There are exceptions to the cremation directive. If a family can get a signed death certificate from the Ministry of Health stating that the cause of death was not Ebola, they can take the body to a funeral parlor for embalming and eventual burial. There are even dispensations for those who do die of Ebola; under certain circumstances the dead can be buried in a cemetery, if the Dead Body Management team conducts the preliminary steps of laying the body 6 feet [2 m] deep and soaking the next 4 feet [1.2 m] of earth with chlorine solution. But those dispensations are impossible to get without connections. One recent Saturday, a funeral cortege down one of Monrovia's main thoroughfares drew questioning comments and glares of resentment from bystanders. "Haven't seen that in a while," exclaimed one woman. "Must be related to a minister," muttered a man... -- more

[6] Liberia: anti-corruption program
Date: Tue 7 Oct 2014

http://allafrica.com/stories/201410071860.html


In an effort to ensure transparency, accountability and integrity in the management of Ebola resources, the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) has embarked on a program to monitor and make sure that adequate internal controls and systems are instituted in the administration of said resources.

The LACC has therefore requested the National Ebola Taskforce to furnish the list of all monetary contributions and payments made to the National Ebola Trust Fund, along with information of all other related resources. Additionally, the Commission has entreated the National Ebola Taskforce to provide a full list of all administrators of Ebola resources.

7 Oct 2014: (Heritage) The Government of Liberia (GoL) through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) has commenced the process for the selection and appointment of an independent "Fiduciary Agent" to assist the government with the financial management of the Ebola Trust Fund. An MFDP release says the decision to contract an independent financial management firm was intended to uphold government's commitment to full transparency and accountability as announced recently by Liberia's Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara M Konneh.

According to Minister Konneh, the firm selected to provide the fiduciary service would manage the fund and supervise accounting related services, under the direction of the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, under the multi-donor governance structure. The release says it would be required to set up a sound financial management system to accurately record and report on all funds received and disbursed from the Trust Fund and providing regular fund management report.

The Firm would also provide oversight of all procurement functions to ensure compliance with established guidelines of the government as well as those of development partners ... The GoL in response to the Ebola Virus epidemic established the Ebola Trust Fund (ETF) at the Central of Bank of Liberia (CBL) in a bid to attract resources from the government, private citizens and international donors. The Fund was created with an initial USD 5 million injection through a loan facility from the Central Bank of Liberia. To date, the fund has raised over USD 10 million, with more donations expected from foreign partners and friendly governments in coming weeks. Recently, the Liberian government announced it needed USD 375 million to effectively fund its National Ebola Response and Restoration of Basic Health Services strategy.

[7] Sex after Ebola
Date: Tue 7 Oct 2014
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://uk.news.yahoo.com/male-ebola-survivors-told-condom-171414262.html#wuBlTys


Sex could keep the Ebola epidemic alive even after the World Health Organization (WHO) declares an area free of the disease, one of the discoverers of the deadly virus said on Tue [7 Oct 2014].

The WHO is hoping to announce later this week that Nigeria and Senegal are free of Ebola after 42 days with no infections -- the standard period for declaring an outbreak over, twice the maximum 21-day incubation period of the virus. However, it appears the disease can last much longer in semen.

"In a convalescent male, the virus can persist in semen for at least 70 days; one study suggests persistence for more than 90 days," the WHO said in an information note on Mon [6 Oct 2014] [see item [1] WHO Ebola situation assessment - 6 Oct 2014 in ProMED-mail posting Ebola virus disease - West Africa (188): international cases, Liberia, clinical 20141007.2837773 - Mod.JW]

"Certainly, the advice has to be for survivors to use a condom, to not have unprotected sex, for 90 days," said Peter Piot, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a discoverer of Ebola in 1976. "If we would apply the rule for double the time, that would be 180 days -- 6 months. I think it (90 days) is probably a compromise, for practicality," he told a news conference in Geneva.

"Evidence of Ebola virus was detected by reverse transcription -- polymerase chain reaction in semen specimens up to 91 days after disease onset; however, these and all other non-blood body fluids tested negative by virus isolation. Among 81 initially antibody negative HHCs [household contacts] , none became antibody positive."

Also note:
"Blood specimens of 5 HHCs not identified as EHF [Ebola hemorrhagic fever; now Ebola virus disease] patients were initially antibody positive. No direct evidence of convalescent-to-HHC transmission of EHF was found, although the semen of convalescents may be infectious. The existence of initially antibody-positive HHCs suggests that mild cases of Ebola virus infection occurred and that the full extent of the EHF epidemic was probably underestimated."

[8] OIE experts review current knowledge on Ebola reservoir
Date: Mon 6 Oct 2014
Source: OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) press releases [edited]
http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/oie-experts-review-current-knowledge-on-ebola-virus-disease


The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has issued a technical information sheet on Ebola virus disease outlining epidemiological observations and scientific knowledge of the disease including the animal reservoir.

The OIE technical information sheet on Ebola virus disease has been prepared and reviewed by internationally regarded scientific experts, including experts from OIE global Reference Centres and Working Group on wildlife, and was subsequently endorsed by the OIE Scientific Commission on Animal Diseases.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever is a severe contagious disease affecting humans and non-human primates, such as gorillas, chimpanzees and some other monkeys. It mainly occurs in the Central and West African regions and can be transmitted to humans from an infected animal or human. Hence, Ebola virus disease is a zoonosis and poses significant threats to public health by causing hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in humans with a high case fatality rate. At present, there is no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for humans. Experimental drugs and vaccines are being developed.

The virus was reported again in humans at the beginning of 2014 in Guinea and then Liberia. It has since then spread to Sierra Leone and most recently to Nigeria to become the largest Ebola outbreak in history and the 1st in West Africa. In August 2014, the WHO declared the outbreak as an international health emergency. An unrelated outbreak was also reported in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Although the strain causing the current outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented number of fatalities, the initial source of the virus remains unclear. However it is likely that the initial introduction to the human population was from a wild animal source to a single person. The disease is now being transmitted between humans and there is no evidence that animals continue to play a role in spreading the virus.

Field studies and epidemiological surveys demonstrate that the natural reservoir hosts for this virus may be fruit bats, without showing clinical signs. These results still need to be further investigated.

Ebola is most likely initially transmitted from animals such as bats and non-human primates to humans through hunting and collection of sick or dead wild animals and handling or consumption of uncooked bush meat. In rural areas fruit bats are a popular source of forest meat for humans and are prepared by hand to be dried, smoked, and/or cooked. Infection could also be transmitted to humans by handling or consumption of forest fruits contaminated with bat saliva or faeces in affected areas.

Therefore the OIE is in full accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to avoid contact with wild animals, including bats, monkeys, and rodents, in affected areas.

The OIE encourages the national Veterinary Services of the countries affected to remain vigilant and develop their involvement towards wildlife. In collaboration with OIE experts, it will continue to work and regularly update guidance to its Members and the public on this disease.
