[ProMED-mail does no ordinarily post messages about hepatitis A virus
outbreaks but made an exception in reporting such an outbreak in the State
of Washington and I commented on cost of a community vaccination program.
In response to my comment that the Larimer County, Colorado, health
department is charging $70 per dose of hepatitis A vaccine for each of the
two doses in the series, C.J. Hinkle <HinklC@mail.health.state.mo.us>
indicated that the cost of the vaccine had decreased to between $16-17 per
dose (Public Health price). We then posted a Request For Information
regarding the cost of hepatitis A vaccine in various locations. The
responses are summarized here; I did not include the cost of IG as it seems
it is not used as often as previously because of scarcity. Thanks to all
of you who took the time to participate in this very informal survey. -

I a PROMED report dated March 8, 1997 [970308151613 it was reported that
the Department of Defense was paying $32.59/dose for Havrix(R). I checked
with the Immunization Division, Texas Department of Health (TDH). As of
March 12, 1998, the "CDC cost" (I assume that is what TDH is paying also?)
for adult VAQTA(R) is $32.08/single dose vial/syringe, with the
contract price good thru 3/10/98 from Merck (we're past that date, so the
price may have already changed?)...pediatric VAQTA(R) is $11.08/dose for
the 5 X 1 dose syringe 0.5ml, with the contract price good thru 10/26/98.
Texas (with a population of 19 million +) will report close to
4,000 cases of hepatitis A with onset during 1997 (we close 1997
surveillance on March 30, 1998), the largest annual total reported to date,
up from 3,460 in 1996 and 3,001 in 1995. We have been making an effort to
improve surveillance and reporting, so the increase in "reported" cases may
not reflect quite so great a real increase as increased recognition.

The cost of hepatitis A vaccine at the Cobb County [Georgia Board of
Health is $45.00 per dose for adults.

William Mannheimer <ihc@swipnet.se>
Hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix) is approximately $35 US per dose in Sweden.

Frederic Shaw <Frederic_E_Shaw@compuserve.com>
The key point is to separate the private market price from the public
market price. These are often confused.
The public market price, available to health departments, for HAVRIX
(SmithKline Beecham) is a little over $11 per dose for pediatric and a
little over $16 per dose for adult. The private market price for adult
HAVRIX depends on what the distributor charges, since HAVRIX is sold
through distributors. A price in the low $50s is common.
The price of VAQTA, the Merck product, is similar.

Hepatitis A vaccine cost at our travel clinic, at sizeable discount below
usual, is $51/dose.

Director Public Affairs
Merck Vaccine Division
Merck & Co., Inc. manufactures and sells one of the two hepatitis A
vaccines available in the United States. The catalogue price for VAQTA is
in the $45-$47 range -this is the price a private physician would pay per
dose if purchasing directly from Merck with no applicable discounts.
Distributors of vaccines may add handling fees to the cost of vaccines.

[So, there you have it. Looks as though county health departments would be
wise to shop around for the best price.
When I visited Morocco last year it was suggested that I get immunized
against hepatitis A; I did so at a cost of $140. My health insurer (an
oxymoron relative to "health provider"?) does not pay for such voluntary
vaccinations. They would rather pay the considerable bills should I
acquire hepatitis A virus infection. Given the cost of this disease,
vaccination is cheap, no matter the cost. - Mod.CHC
