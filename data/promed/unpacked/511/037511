BABESIOSIS, POSSIBLE - BOSNIA
=============================
I have received (from marty@email.afip.osd.mil) a request for information
about the possible occurrence of babesiois in Bosnia. The writer understands
that there has been a high incidence of _Babesia_ infection in military
animals in Bosnia and wants to know whether anyone is looking at the
incidence of babesiosis in military troops, ostensibly U.N. Peacekeeping
forces? As the sender is affiliated with the military, I find the question
strange. However, if any among the subscribers of ProMED have information on
this subject, please let us know.
