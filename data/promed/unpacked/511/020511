Pork products from China hidden in 2 containers that were seized at the Manila port in October [2019] tested positive for African swine fever [ASF], the Department of Agriculture [DA] said [Mon 4 Nov 2019].

The pork products, disguised as tomato paste, were tested by the Bureau of Animal Industry, the DA said in a statement.

The cargo was consigned to Jeniti International Trading in Binondo, Manila, Agriculture Secretary William Dar said earlier.

Fresh frozen meat imported from Canada, USA, and France, meanwhile, tested negative, the DA said.

The Philippines has banned the entry of pork from countries affected with the hog disease including China.

Locally, samples of longganisa [Spanish sausage] and hotdog from meat processing company Mekeni Food Corp also tested positive for ASF, the DA and the Department of Health said [see item 3 below].

[2] Australia ex Viet Nam: ASF-contaminated food products

A man who failed to declare pork products after touching down in Australia has been fined and refused entry as the government continues its "zero tolerance" approach to the risk of African swine fever.

The fatal disease has decimated pig herds across Europe and Asia and could cost the Australian pork industry AUD 2 billion [about USD 1.38 billion] if a local outbreak occurred.

The 60-year-old Vietnamese man had arrived in Sydney with close to 4 kilos [about 9 lb] of pork-filled savoury mooncakes in his luggage but failed to declare it.

Authorities fined him before he was sent home.

Nearly half of all pork products taken from air travelers have tested positive for African swine fever.

"That's why I have a zero-tolerance approach to those who intentionally do the wrong thing and lie about what they're carrying," Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie said on [Mon 4 Nov 2019].

"If pork products carrying the virus get past our border, are eaten by family and friends and the leftovers fed to pigs then we'll be in a world of pain."

The incident comes just weeks after a Vietnamese woman was deported after being found with 4.5 kilograms [about 10 lb] of pork at Sydney airport.

There's no vaccine or cure for the disease, which has wiped out a quarter of the world's pigs.

There is estimated to be up to 24 million wild boars across Australia, sparking fears the disease could spread quickly if it gets into the wild.

It can be spread when pigs eat infected meat products and through direct contact.

Samples of Mekeni Food Corp skinless longganisa [Spanish sausage] and hotdog tested positive for African swine fever [ASF], agriculture and health officials confirmed Monday.

In a press conference, Agriculture and Health officials confirmed that processed meat samples from Mekeni Food Corp tested positive for ASF.

A "set of samples of longganisa and picnic hotdog tested positive for ASF" based on an [25 Oct 2019] test by the Regional Animal Disease Diagnostics Laboratory in Central Luzon and was validated by 2 tests conducted by the Bureau of Animal Industry Veterinary Laboratory Division (DA-BAI-VLD), the Department of Agriculture said in a statement.

"With these developments, the DA and the Department of Health through the Food and Drug Administration (DOH-FDA) have agreed to disclose jointly said test results, and name the manufacturer, which is Mekeni Food Corporation," the statement said.

News about ASF-contaminated processed meat spread after a passenger from Manila brought home-made and branded processed meat to the Calapan Port in Occidental Mindoro on [6 Oct 2019], Department of Agriculture Asec. Noel Reyes earlier told DZMM [Radio/ABS-CBN].

Mekeni Food Corp has voluntary recalled pork products on [26 Oct 2019], even before the test results were released. It earlier promised "transparency" while validating reports of ASF contamination.

[The described and earlier similar incidents deserve a wide dissemination by the international media channels, with Australia's severe policy serving as an effective warning sign. The fact that ASF is not pathogenic to humans should not lead to neglecting the prescribed elementary requirements to prevent its wide-scale and rapid dissemination. Introducing ASF-infected pork and its products into hitherto unaffected countries, and the uncontrolled movement of such products within infected countries, lead to further spread of this devastating pig disease, against which no vaccine is available to date. - Mod.
