[Deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an
X-linked recessive red cell genetic disorder, which is endemic in
Southern China. Universal screening of newborn is done in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Singapore, and in Hong Kong, 4.8 percent of males are affected.

Primaquine can induce haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. The
report contains too few details to determine whether G6PD deficiency
can account for the present outbreak of symptoms in the treated
persons. However if 104 out of 145 developed side effects, it is too
many to be explained by G6PD, and the most probable course is a
quality problem with the medications containing toxic substances. - Mod.EP]
