About phone calls between the Deputy Head of Rosselkhoznadzor EA Nepoklonov and the Director, Veterinary and International affairs, EC Health & Consumers (SANCO), Bernard Van Goethem
-------------------------------------------
The talks took place at the initiative of the Russian side. Eugene Nepoklonov expressed very serious concern about the spread of the bluetongue virus serotype 14 in Baltic States and Poland and Russia's needs for complete information from the EU Commission on regarding the results of monitoring of the disease.

He recalled that Rosselkhoznadzor has identified positive serological tests -- both serotypes 8 and 14 -- in animals imported from EC. Similar cases have been reported by the Belarus Veterinary Service. Bluetongue serotype 14 was, according to Rosselkhoznadzor information, detected by the Spanish veterinary service in a calf from Poland. Nepoklonov said that the Russian serological results were supported by the reference OIE laboratory at Pirbright, UK. In case the said BTV-14 is a vaccine strain, as reportedly suggested, this is concerning as well -- indicative of uncontrolled use of vaccines.

Van Goethem assured Nepoklonov that updated information on the spread of bluetongue in the EU has already been sent to the Rosselkhoznadzor, and that the European Commission is ready to carry further negotiations on this issue.

[The report above includes a new piece of information, the suggestion that the BTV-14 strain in question is probably a vaccine strain. It will be interesting to obtain science-based data on the issue.

Subscribers may recall that in late 2008, BTV-6 (Germany and Netherlands) and BTV-11 (Belgium), which were found to have circulated in cattle, without clinical disease, were in fact closely related to South African vaccine strains. For details, see ProMED-mail posting 20090304.0888.

Russia's initial OIE report on BTV-14, submitted 30 Dec 2011, mentioned positive serology (ELISA and CFT) in cattle, sheep, and goats, serotyping pending, without clinical disease. Follow-up report no 1, submitted 14 Mar 2012, mentioned virus isolation and serotyping as BTV-14. No clinical disease has been reported. Further data have been reviewed in (commentary) to posting 20121123.1422112.

Information on Russia's own BT situation is rather scarce.

Bluetongue disease was 1st registered in Russia in July 1993 on the territory of the Buryat Republic, diagnosed by the All-Russian Scientific-Research Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Pokrov (Vladimir oblast). Testing of organ or blood samples taken from sheep by solid phase (SF) ELISA using monoclonal antibodies (MA) revealed presence of bluetongue virus antigen. Then, the virus was isolated in Siberian ibex kidney (SIK) cell culture and newborn mice, identified by using SF ELISA and fluorescent antibody (FA) methods and compliment fixation test (CFT). Typing made by neutralization test (NT) showed it belonged to the BTV-16 serotype. (Ref 1).

A serological survey in Kazakhstan, 1997-1998, showed seroprevalence for BT virus in cattle, sheep, and goats. Seropositive animals were found to be widespread, suggesting endemicity. No serotyping has become available (Ref 2).

Details on other scientific papers on BTV in Russia will be appreciated, if available.

Some questions come to mind:
- Have sero-surveys in local ruminants been conducted on Russian territories since 2000?
- Have there been additional clinically suspected cases in sheep, the species known to be most susceptible to BTV, after 1993?
- Have samples been submitted for laboratory investigations from such cases? Could figures/locations/results become available?
