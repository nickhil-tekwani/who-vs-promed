Republic of the Congo: Ebola Fever Outbreak Death Toll Now 75
-------------------------------------------------
The toll from the Ebola outbreak in Congo has risen to 75 deaths among 93
cases, but is believed to be under control, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Tue 25 Feb 2003. The outbreak in the Kelle and Mbomo
districts near the central African country's border with Gabon is thought
by scientists to have been caused by the consumption of infected monkey
meat. The WHO last Wednesday put the death toll at 64.
Ebola killed at least 73 people in Congo and Gabon in an epidemic from
October 2001 to February 2002. It is passed on by infected body fluids, and
certain strains can kill between 50 and 90 percent of its victims through
massive internal bleeding.
The number of victims in the current outbreak exceed those reported from
Congo and Gabon a year ago and came from an investigating team of WHO and
government experts deployed in the remote northwest area. "It would be
unrealistic to say that we've seen all the cases, but it is realistic to
say that we have seen most," WHO spokesman Ian Simpson told Reuters. "An
isolation ward has been set up in Kelle hospital where people are coming to
be treated. That is real progress," he added. "Up to now it was a question
of trying to persuade people that they needed medical intervention." Local
officials said last week that many villagers believed occult forces were at
work, leading some to stone and beat to death 4 teachers accused of casting
an evil spell to cause the outbreak.

[These figures represent an increase in 7 deaths since the last Reuters
report dated Fri 21 Feb 2003, and 20 cases since the last WHO update dated
Thu 13 Feb 2003. It may be premature to suggest that the outbreak is being
contained. - Mod.CP]
