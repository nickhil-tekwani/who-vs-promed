It now appears an outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) has been
detected in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, 1300 sheep were slaughtered in the
Republic after confirmation that animals from the Armagh farm under
suspicion crossed the border.
The Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture Mrs Brid Rodgers said tonight
"It is now our belief we are looking at an outbreak of this disease in
Northern Ireland." She said while testing on the animals was not complete,
some of the slaughtered sheep "displayed signs consistent with FMD". She
also revealed another sheep from a farm in Castlederg has also shown signs
of FMD.
Mrs Rodgers announced a series of measures including a ban on the movement
of farm animals other than for slaughter, a ban on the holding of livestock
auctions and on the movement of horses.
