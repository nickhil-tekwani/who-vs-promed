Local authorities said [Tue 14 Aug 2018] that 20 people have been confirmed to be infected with cutaneous anthrax in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Cases of cattle deaths from unknown causes in Shengli Village, Horqin district in the city of Tongliao, have been reported as of last week [week of 6 Aug 2018]. Cutaneous anthrax is usually contracted when a person with a cut or sore on their skin comes into direct, unprotected contact with anthrax spores on a sick or dead animal. As of 5 pm on [Tue 14 Aug 2018], 54 cattle have been found infected and a further 29 dead cattle have been disposed of, according to the Tongliao government.

In addition to the infected, another 66 people in close contact have been placed under medical observation. [Presumably on oral antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ]

Local government and epidemic control headquarters have carried out epidemic control efforts, blocking affected and high-risk areas, setting up animal supervision checkpoints, and strengthening inspection of the flow of livestock and products. Vehicles, trading markets, and livestock pens have been sterilized. Local hospitals have also provided free drugs and guidance for livestock farmers.

The city industry and commerce department, and food and drug watchdog have carried out inspections of local butcher shops and restaurants. No infected meat or products produced in the affected areas have been reported.

[We are still awaiting veterinary confirmation of the cause(s) of the cattle deaths. With 83 animals affected sampling should not be a problem. This is important because the diagnosis of the human cases appears to be only clinical based on the appearance of the cutaneous lesions. While the anthrax cutaneous lesion is clear -- acute inflammation at the site, itching, no pain, enlarged draining lymph nodes, initially small vesicles about the infected cut, later followed by ulceration, and blackening of the ulcer (that is, "charbon") -- mistakes can be made and a positive bovine culture will narrow the medical response.

This is a fair number of infected cattle. But it is mid-summer with heat and plenty of flies feeding on the sick and dead animals, thus facilitating spread. It is significant that no accounts to date have mentioned livestock vaccination. This is long overdue. If biting flies are spreading this infection it is vital to get the neighbouring herds vaccinated as soon as possible.
