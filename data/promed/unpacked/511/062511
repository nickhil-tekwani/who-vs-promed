From: Malcolm.Anderson@dhs.vic.gov.au

In the latest posting regarding this major outbreak it states that "the
Chief Minister......has asked the collectors of the affected districts to
swing into action on a war-footing"
Can anyone explain to me what is a collector and what is their role under
these cirumstance and others.

[These could be tax collectors, body collectors, body parts collectors,
cigar band collectors, stamp collectors or barbed wire collectors. People
collect all sorts of things. Could be that the collectors themselves do
not know what they are supposed to be doing, which may be the prime reason
they are not doing it. If someone in India or elsewhere can provide a
proper definition, we would appreciate it. - Mod.CHC
