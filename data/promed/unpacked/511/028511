Officials say that norovirus is what caused 33 children to fall ill at a summer camp in Lake Placid, Florida.

Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in closed environments like summer camp.

"Our epidemiology team has notified health departments in the home counties of all campers, and appropriate follow-up will be done," said Mary Kay Burns, Highlands County Health Officer. "Camp officials have already started the process of disinfecting the camp, and re-inspection will be done once cleaning has been completed. We will also provide information on proper hand-washing and food preparation techniques, to help avoid further incidents."

Water tests were done and came back negative for any illness-causing bacteria.

Officials say that over the course of 2 days, campers began falling ill with reports of nausea, vomiting, headaches and fever.

Highlands County Fire Rescue and EMS responded to 4-H Camp Cloverleaf in Lake Placid around 8 pm [Thu 21 Jun 2018]. The campers are between the ages of 8 and 13. Camp officials say that 33 of the 120 campers reportedly fell ill. Highlands County Fire and Rescue officials said that none of the illnesses appeared to be serious. Officials tell ABC Action News that all patients have been discharged as of [Fri 22 Jun 2018] afternoon.

Fire officials say that children from Charlotte, Desoto, Sarasota, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami Dade Counties are attending the camp. Additional children are being evaluated.

The Highlands County Health Department has determined that Lake Placid is clean, and the food served to children was not contaminated.

Following the incident, the camp released the following statement:
"4-H Camp Cloverleaf is maintained and cleaned on a regular basis to ensure the health and safety of campers. All camp staff are trained to respond to medical emergencies, and they are certified in first aid and CPR. The UF/IFAS Extension 4-H youth development program is cooperating with the Highlands County Department of Health to determine the cause of the illness and necessary steps to prevent future occurrences. The health and safety of all campers is the primary concern of UF/IFAS Extension staff, and we hope that those experiencing discomfort will quickly return to good health."

The remaining 87 campers who did not fall ill all returned home as they normally would have on this final day of the camp. Officials say that the camp will be thoroughly disinfected in anticipation of a new group of campers arriving on [Mon 2 Jul 2018].

[According to the CDC, each year on average in the United States, norovirus:
- causes 19-21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both)
- leads to 1.7-1.9 million outpatient visits and 400 000 emergency department visits, primarily in young children
- contributes to about 56 000 to 71 000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly among young children and the elderly.

You can get norovirus illness at any time during the year, but it is most common in the winter. Also, there can be 50 percent more norovirus illness in years when there is a new strain of the virus going around.

Outbreaks of norovirus illness happen when infected people spread the virus to others. But, norovirus can also spread by consuming contaminated food or water and touching things that have the virus on them.

Norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States. About 50 percent of all outbreaks of food-related illness are caused by norovirus. Food can get contaminated with norovirus at any point when it is being grown, shipped, handled, or prepared. (https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reported-outbreaks.html)

Most common outbreak settings include healthcare facilities, restaurants and Catered events, cruise ships, schools and other institutional settings. (excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/trends-outbreaks.html)

It appears the cause has not yet been identified, but the water has been ruled out. Most likely the source was food. It is interesting that diarrhea is not mentioned as a symptom the children experienced, yet that is a common symptom of norovirus. - Mod.LK
