Beijing has reported 10 human H7N9 avian flu cases so far this year [2017], the capital's Center for Disease Prevention and Control said yesterday [Tue 18 Apr 2017]. The latest cases were reported on April 5 [2017]. Both patients are said to have had contact with live poultry. One patient died from the infection on April 8 [2017] while the other is still being treated in hospital and is said to be in a stable condition.

According to the report on Beijing CDC website, 3 additional human H7N9 AIV cases have been confirmed from 17 to 19 April [2017]. Those 3 were all local cases. Beijing has reported 7 local cases and 6 imported cases since the beginning of 2017.During the epidemiological investigation of those 7 local cases, all had previous live poultry contact or live poultry market exposure history (3 had dead/sick poultry contact history), 5 cases had purchased live poultry from vendors.

[5] Increased Pathogenicity
Date: Thu 13 Apr 2017

A new strain of avian influenza that has high pathogenicity in poultry, and which can be deadly for humans, has resurfaced in China with pandemic potential -- prompting calls for a quick and thorough response to halt its advance and contain the changing H7N9 virus.

Until recently, H7N9 has shown low pathogenicity, meaning that it may cause mild or no illness in poultry. Evidence from China's Guangdong province suggests that the new strain has shifted to high pathogenicity in poultry while retaining its capacity to cause severe problems in humans. This is said to be a genetic change that could lead to high mortality for birds within 48 hours of infection and cause high economic losses for those engaged in poultry production and sales. "China has embarked on intensified surveillance and results are awaited to better assess the epidemiology and potential spread of this new, highly pathogenic virus."

Meanwhile, human cases of the H7N9 virus, 1st detected in China 4 years ago have been increasing since December 2016. An update in March reported 20 human cases in 8 Chinese provinces: Hunan, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Fujian, Guizhou, Chongqing, Shandong and Zhejiang, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the latest update [Wed 12 Apr 2017], the FAO reported additional 16 human cases and 2 detected in birds. As before, most patients mentioned visiting live bird markets or coming into contact with infected birds. There is, however, no indication that the news strain has spread to wild birds.
"China has embarked on intensified surveillance and results are awaited to better assess the epidemiology and potential spread of this new, highly pathogenic virus," Sophie Von Dobschuetz, animal health officer at FAO, tells SciDev.Net. "FAO, through its office in Beijing, is in regular dialogue with the ministry of agriculture and providing recommendations for surveillance and control."

The H7N9 strain currently circulating in China has not been noted in poultry populations in other countries, Matthew Stone, deputy director general of the World Organization for Animal Health, tells SciDev.Net.

"However, these countries (with poultry farms) remain at risk and need to be vigilant for a potential incursion of the virus, in a low or highly pathogenic form," Stone adds. "Constant surveillance of domestic poultry as well as wild birds by national veterinary services is essential to reduce the risks associated with virus spread and protect both animal and human health, as well as livelihoods."
According to Stone, live bird markets remain the main source of virus spread among poultry and from poultry to humans and South-East Asian countries need to implement targeted and widespread monitoring to detect and respond to the virus.

Prevention measures should include laboratory testing, increased hygiene at live-bird markets and on-farm biosecurity to reduce exposure, he says.

[The increased pathogenicity of Influenza A/H7N9 in poultry is a new and alarming change with serious economic implications. However, this also indicates options for quick detection of disease in poultry as compared to the earlier 3-4 years, when the effected poultry was largely asymptomatic or showed mild disease. The majority of human cases reported contact with birds and also visits to wet markets, and perhaps the absence of severe disease in the birds facilitated transmission to humans.

Furthermore, the number of reported human cases has been much higher in 2017 than previous years, which highlights the need for enhanced surveillance as well as better diagnostic preparedness, so that prompt control and containment measures can be instituted. - Mod.UBA
