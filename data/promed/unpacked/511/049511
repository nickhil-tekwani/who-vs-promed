Sweden's Infectious Diseases Institute Reports Doubling of Tick-borne
Encephalitis Cases
-------------------------------------
STOCKHOLM: The number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases more than
doubled last year [2000. This is seen from statistics issued by the
Infectious Diseases Institute. Altogether, it is reported that there were
134 cases of TBE over the past year. This is 80 more cases than the year
before, and the highest figure registered since the voluntary laboratory
reporting of TBE to the Infectious Diseases Institute was started in 1989.
"Even if the reporting is voluntary, and some of the last year's increase
might therefore be attributed to increased willingness to report the
disease, it is clear that the number of TBE infections in the country
increased significantly last year," commented Malin Arneborn, an
epidemiologist.
TBE virus infection can produce fever, discomfort, vomiting, cramps,
paralysis, which sometimes can be prolonged, and unconsciousness. In very
rare cases, the infection can lead to death. However, no cases of death from
TBE occurred in Sweden last year.
