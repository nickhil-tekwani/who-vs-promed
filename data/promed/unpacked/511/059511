Finnish authorities have issued a warning after a number of _E. coli_ infections were linked to hamburger patties. The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) were made aware of several _E. coli_ infections earlier in 2021 after people ate burgers. Municipal inspectors investigated cases locally and took food samples.

_E. coli_ may be present in raw ground (minced) meat and medium-cooked ground meat, so patties should always be eaten fully cooked, said the agency. When handling raw meat, care must be taken to wash hands, utensils and surfaces to prevent the transfer of bacteria to ready to eat foods such as salads.

Advice in Finland is that meat must be appropriately cooked. Pork, all ground meat foods, such as hamburger patties and meatballs as well as meatloaf, should always be served cooked through. There is a trend to serve medium-cooked hamburger patties in some restaurants, but most of the large fast-food chains only serve them thoroughly cooked.

Some people don't understand there is a difference between medium-cooked ground meat and medium-cooked whole steak. The USDA advises cooking beef, veal and lamb steaks to 145 degrees F (62.8 degrees C) and allowing it to rest for at least 3 minutes. For ground meat, the temperature is 160 degrees F (71.1 degrees C). For outlets that serve medium-cooked patties, Finnish authorities advise telling consumers about the _E. coli_ risk, asking adults how they want their burgers and always serving fully cooked products to children.

Since 2016, an average of 200 infections have been reported to the Infectious Diseases Register each year. More than half of these come from abroad. Between 2001 and 2020, 5% of those infected with _E. coli_ in Finland and interviewed mentioned they had eaten raw or undercooked meat before becoming ill.

[Although not specifically stated, the _E. coli_ strain or strains involved in these Finnish cases are ones related to enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and O157:H7 is the prototypic one. A zoonotic infection spread primarily from contamination of food or water with cow feces, the vehicle may be undercooked meat (usually ground beef as here) or produce. Cases may also occur related to direct or indirect contamination with the animals at a petting zoo and person-to-person spread can occur.

True to these cases, historically, the illness was first described in 1983 related to an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis from undercooked ground beef related to a fast-food restaurant chain in the US states of Michigan and Oregon, which occurred in 1982. Prior to these clusters, O157:H7 was almost unheard of in the USA.

Abstract
--------
"We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of 3 sandwiches containing 3 ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat."
