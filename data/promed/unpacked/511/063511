The [Landmark] hotel's leisure club and spa have been off limits
since [17 Mar 2011] after staff and guests reported feeling unwell
with flu-like symptoms that sparked testing for _Legionella_
infection. As of last night [5 Apr 2011] a total of 112 people who
work in or have visited the Landmark are known to have had a flu-like
illness with respiratory infection. One person remains in Ninewells
Hospital, the only confirmed case of legionnaires' disease in a person
who visited the hotel's leisure club. There are no further confirmed
cases.

While legionnaires' disease is potentially fatal, Pontiac fever is a
milder illness caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. It [Pontiac fever]
causes a flu-like illness, which lasts just a few days. An NHS
[National Health Service] Tayside spokeswoman said last night [5 Apr
2011] it was "very likely" a number of the respiratory infections
reported at Landmark could be caused by Pontiac fever, but it would
take some time to establish if that was the case. "No one has yet been
confirmed as having Pontiac fever because it is difficult to diagnose
and can require up to 3 separate blood tests over a period of several
weeks," she said.

While samples have been taken from the spa and leisure facilities for
testing, the spokeswoman confirmed the source of the infection has not
been formally identified. "NHS Tayside, Dundee City Council
environmental health officers (EHO) and the Health and Safety
Executive continue to work closely with the hotel to advise of all the
appropriate steps which need to be taken at the leisure club," she
said.

A spokesperson for the hotel said, "The health and safety of staff
and guests are our number one priority at all times and we have been
working closely with the NHS since the investigation started to
co-operate with the appropriate health and environmental tests. At
this time our thoughts are very much with the individuals concerned.
We are doing all that we can to resolve the situation and are
continuing to work with the NHS and EHO to follow all appropriate
directions. We encourage members of the public to follow guidelines
issued from the NHS. We closed the leisure facilities at the onset of
the situation on [17 Mar 2011] and these will remain closed until all
necessary steps have been taken as directed by the NHS and EHO.

Dr Christopher McGuigan, NHS Tayside Consultant in Public Health
Medicine, is not recommending that people should stay away from the
hotel as the focus of the investigation is on the leisure club.
Outwith the leisure facilities closure, the hotel is open and in
operation."
