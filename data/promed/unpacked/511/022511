The owner of an Australian organic food company said she was in shock after an unpasteurized milk product sold by her business was associated with the death of a toddler. The 3-year-old, from the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, died after consuming Mountain View Organic Bath Milk, which the owner said was labelled as being "not for human consumption" and "for cosmetic purposes only".

Health authorities issued a warning on Thursday morning, 11 Dec 2014, about consuming the products, saying 4 other children had become seriously ill recently after drinking unpasteurized milk products sold as "bath" or "cosmetic" milk. 3 of the children developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, associated with a strain of _E. coli_ bacteria and which can lead to kidney failure, while the others developed cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection commonly associated with gastroenteritis.

Victoria's minister for emergency services, Jane Garrett, said she had urgently raised the issue with the federal minister for small business, Bruce Billson, calling for an investigation into raw milk labelling. She said regulators from around Australia were meeting to consider whether the product should be recalled, or even banned.

"I have asked Consumer Affairs Victoria to begin a statewide education campaign, alerting consumers and parents to the dangers of unpasteurized milk," Garrett said. "This information will be distributed through maternal and healthcare centers, hospitals, day care centers and all other health outlets."

Since the 1940s it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia, which involves heating it for a very short time to kill pathogens. The sale of unpasteurized milk for human consumption is illegal in Victoria, but it is sold in health food shops for cosmetic purposes.

The owner defended her product, saying it was "very good" for treating skin conditions and was never meant to be consumed. "I don't know what consumers do with the milk when they take it home," she told Guardian Australia. "But I know there has been a big movement in support of raw milk for consumption. The health department has now been in contact with us, and we've told them we'll do whatever they recommend, including adding extra labelling to the product."

The owner said a series of tests had since been carried out on the product and they all came back with undetectable levels of the pathogens. She said the product had been sold for about 4 years and this was the 1st time she'd heard of it causing illness.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, warned only a small number pathogens were needed to cause illness. "Everyone is vulnerable to illness caused by the pathogens present in raw milk, but the risks are even greater for young children and for the elderly, those with underlying health problems, immunocompromised or pregnant," Lester said.

The family of the dead child had suffered a "terrible loss," she told reporters on Thursday. It was important to re-emphasise the dangers of ingesting products labelled not for human consumption, she said. "There is pasteurisation of milk for a good reason," Lester said. "Raw milk is not healthy and wholesome and good for you. The risk of consuming it is too great and this cluster [of sick children] highlights that."

Health department spokesman Bram Alexander said it was unknown whether the labels had been deliberately ignored, or whether consumers had mistakenly thought the milk was for drinking. He also could not say why there had been a sudden spike in cases involving toddlers. But there was a notion among the public that "pure" equated to "healthy". "Unpasteurized milk is not pure," he said. "It contains pathogens and parasites. We also want to emphasise that milk is an excellent source of nutrition, vitamins and minerals and we would want people to continue to drink appropriate milk, that is, pasteurized milk."

He said he did not know what other brands of unpasteurised milk were involved in making the other children sick.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand is reviewing whether to allow soft cheeses to be made with raw milk, with farmers arguing pasteurization takes away from the flavor. An infectious diseases physician and microbiologist, Professor Peter Collignon, said that argument may be true but consumers and farmers needed to be aware that the cost of allowing raw milk to be used was an increased risk of infections. "The problem is milk comes from the udder, essentially the rear end of the cow," he said. "You run a big risk that milk gets contaminated with bugs from the bowels of cow."

No matter what precautions are taken by dairy farmers during milking, there could be no guarantee the milk would be free from harmful bacteria, making pasteurization essential, Dr Lester said. He said an animal could go from having undetectable levels of pathogens in their milk to being contaminated very quickly. "One of the things we know is cows may have these organisms present depending on everything from what they eat [to] how much rain there has been, and a cow with no problems one week can show pathogens in their milk the next."

Pasteurization had been so successful at eliminating disease-causing agents that some members of the public mistakenly thought it was no longer necessary, he said.

Unpasteurized milk is a well known source of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either O157 or non-O157, as well as a large selection of other pathogenic microbes including zoonotic organisms such as:
_Brucella abortus_,
_Brucella melitensis_,
_Mycobacterium bovis_,

_Streptococcus pyogenes_,
_Salmonella_ Typhi,
_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,
