Late last week, an adult, calico cat found on Route 50 near the
border of West Ocean City and Berlin tested positive for rabies. A
young kitten in its company later tested negative. These are the
latest casualties of rabies in Worcester County.

Since health officials did not know where the cats came from or
whether any people came in contact with the rabid animal, the
Worcester County Health Department and Emergency Services activated
the Reverse 911 Calling System in a limited area close to where the
cats were found. Residents in the vicinity of the 11800 block of
Ocean Gateway received a brief automated message notifying them of
the rabid cat incident and providing a public information number to
call. If an untended, domestic animal is found with rabies in your
area, you may receive such a call too.

Responsible care for animals, whether kept indoors or outside,
includes keeping vaccinations up to date. Any animal that is
unvaccinated for rabies is at risk for contracting this deadly virus,
and places you and other animals at risk.

The 6th case of rabies for 2010 has been reported by the Davidson
County Health Department.

A feral cat in a neighborhood near the Davidson County Fairgrounds on
Greensboro Road bit a resident Monday [12 Jul 2010]. The cat was
taken to the animal shelter and died Tuesday. It was sent to the
State Laboratory for Public Heath for rabies testing.

The adult, female cat, which was a black and white domestic short
hair, was reported positive for rabies Wednesday [14 Jul 2010]. The
person bitten has been referred to a doctor for medical follow-up.

[3] Skunk - Vermont

A skunk that attacked a pre-schooler in Brattleboro last week remains
at large. Efforts to find the animal by Brattleboro animal control
officer Cathy Barrows and the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department
have been unsuccessful.

According to police reports, the skunk bit a 3-year-old boy on the
leg during a pre-school program at All Souls Church in West
Brattleboro, but the bite wasn't deep because his socks partially
protected him. As a precaution, the child is undergoing a round of 7
shots of post-rabies-exposure vaccines.

According to Dr. Bob Johnson, the public health veterinarian for the
Vermont Department of Health, there has not been confirmation that
the skunk was rabid, although the behavior of the animal was
consistent with rabies.

"We don't want to cause panic," said Johnson, "but if people make
sure their pets are up to date with their shots, keep their distance
from wildlife, and make sure they have a plan if an attack happens,
they will be safe from rabies."

The Westchester County Department of Health is issuing a Rabies Alert
to residents who may have had contact with a rabid cat in the
vicinity of Crest Hill Road, Oakland Avenue, LaSalle Drive or Hampton
Avenue in Yonkers prior to today [15 Jul 2010]. The black cat was a
stray that was tested after it bit and scratched 4 people on 13 Jul
2010. Test results confirmed today that it was rabid.

"Anyone who believes that he may have had contact with this cat
should contact the Westchester County Department of Health
immediately," said Westchester County Acting Commissioner of Health,
Dr. Cheryl Archbald. "Anyone bitten by a rabid animal, or having
contact with its saliva, may need to receive immediate rabies
vaccination."

A fisherman from Blaine County is receiving a series of shots after
getting too close to a rabid bat over the weekend.

The man, whose name was not released by Health and Welfare, was
fishing when a bat started swooping erratically around his head. The
man swung his cap at the bat and thought it flew away. Later, he
discovered it clinging to his life vest.

According to the agency, he captured and killed the bat and put it in
his home freezer in a Ziploc bag. He then called Idaho Department of
Fish and Game officials who sent the bat to a Health and Welfare
laboratory in Boise. A day later, the lab confirmed the bat had
rabies.

Experts warn people not to touch wild bats because they are the main
carriers of rabies in Idaho. But because the bat could have bitten
the man while swooping, capturing it in this case meant officials
could confirm the rabies, Health and Welfare Epidemiology Manager
Mary Jensen said.

Very few bats carry the rabies virus, and even fewer get sick from
it. In a 2010 Colorado study, only 15 percent of bats tested positive
for rabies. Last year [2009], 8 bats found in Idaho tested positive
for rabies. The 1st bat this year [2010] was discovered in Shoshone
County.

A child in Killeen is receiving medical treatment after getting
scratched by a stray cat with rabies.

Animal Control Officers responded to a home in the 4200 block of
Mustang Drive on Saturday [10 Jul 2010] after receiving a call that a
stray cat had come into the resident's backyard and scratched their
child. Killeen police say the caller caught the cat, and animal
control officers returned it to the shelter.

It was then sent to the Texas Department of State Health Services in
Austin where it was confirmed on Monday [12 Jul 2010] that the cat
was infected with rabies.

Campers and staff at the D.A.R.E. camp were vaccinated for rabies
after bats were found in cabins earlier this week.

At least 60 people have been vaccinated for the disease after bats
were found in cabins at Camp Pinnacle, where members of the Drug
Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) camp had been sleeping. The
newspaper reports that more than 3 dozen people gathered at Pardee
Urgent Care Services to get the vaccinations, and it took some as
long as 5 to 6 hours.

[10] Bat, feline - Oregon

A bat found last week in the Madras area of Jefferson County has
tested positive for rabies, Jefferson County health officials said
Thursday [15 Jul 2010]. The bat had contact with several cats, they
said, but no human contact took place.

The Jefferson County Public Health Department said this is the 1st
bat to test positive for rabies in this county since 2003. In 2009,
Oregon had 11 bats test positive in other counties. Thus far in 2010,
3 foxes, one goat and 4 bats have tested positive for rabies in other
counties, mostly in southern Oregon.

De Bess said vaccination is especially important for cats, which are
bats' natural predators and most likely to be attracted by a sick bat
and aren't required by law to be vaccinated as dogs are. An
unvaccinated cat that comes in contact with a rabid bat may have to
be euthanized or quarantined at the owner's expense for up to 6
months.

Anyone who finds a bat flopping on the ground or in their house
should not pick it up or handle it, keep it away from pets, and
contact local animal control officials. More information can be found

[This last article mentions cats, but it does not mention the outcome
of the cats. Did they find the cats? Were they euthanized? Tested? If
not, then it is possible we will be hearing about feline rabies later
in this town.

Rabies is a constant threat. While not all wild animals or all bats
carry rabies, it can affect any of them. Unusual behavior may be an
indication that there is something wrong with the animal. It is best
to call animal control to handle such a situation. They are trained
for handling these situations and likely are already vaccinated
against the disease.

Rabies is almost always fatal in humans and most other domestic
animals. There are a very few human survival cases, but the chances
are slim, and post exposure vaccination can be expensive, but not as
costly as a life. Prevention is clearly the key. Vaccinate your
animals, and don't take chances when something is clearly out of the
ordinary. - Mod.TG]
