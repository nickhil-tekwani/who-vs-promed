China denied on Thursday reports that an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
was sweeping China and said there had been no recurrence of the disease
since May. "The disease is under control," said an official from the Animal
Husbandry and Veterinary Department in the Ministry of Agriculture in
Beijing.
The ministry received reports of foot-and-mouth disease that affected
cattle and pigs in the provinces of Fujian and Hainan as well as in the
Tibet Autonomous Region and had reported the problems to the Food and
Agricultural Organisation in Rome. Steps had been taken to keep it under
control, the official said. [Covered in the ProMED-mail reports listed
above. - MHJ
Foreign media reported an outbreak earlier this week, causing a steep drop
in pork prices.
An official from Shanghai Animal Husbandry Bureau said there were no recent
[sic reports of the disease in the Shanghai area. He said heavy rains in
recent weeks had flooded some farms, which might have caused concerns over
an outbreak of the disease, but the bureau had tightened sanitary
inspections, especially on the disposal of dead animals. Asked about the
slaughter of milk cows in May at a local dairy farm, he said: "Some of the
cows were infected by a lung disease." [Lung lesions are not seen in FMD. -

Feed grain and meat industry sources said China had never been able to wipe
out the disease, and scattered incidences were found in remote rural areas.
"There's always a trickle of reported occurrences, but there's never been a
widespread epidemic," a meat industry source said. Local sanitary officials
in the major meat-producing provinces of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Guangdong were usually quite active in controlling the disease, if
detected. On small family farms, where most of the pigs are raised in
China, the problem is less serious than on commercial cattle and pig farms.

[It should be noted that after many years of international silence China
has recently begun to report outbreaks of animal diseases, thus revealing
the realities of their domestic situation. This is a matter of some courage
on their part and to be commended. Obviously until their reporting becomes
routine and everyday, there may be oscillations in completeness and in the
appreciation of the Chinese reality. And as we see here there will be those
wishing to take advantage of real or imagined outbreaks. To date FMD has
only been confirmed in Tibet, Fujian (facing Taiwan), and Hainan (South
China); those in Shaanxi (central China), Gansu (west, north of Tibet), and
Henan (eastern China) have not. Further and informed information is being
sought. - MHJ
