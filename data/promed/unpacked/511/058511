A coming winter surge and the spread of omicron have made it clear that COVID is everyone's problem.

Even before the arrival of omicron, the winter months were going to be tough for parts of the United States. While COVID transmission rates in the South caught fire over the summer, the Northeast and Great Plains states were largely spared, thanks to cyclical factors and high vaccination rates. But weather and the patterns of human life were bound to shift the disease burden northward for the holidays, and that was just with delta. Enter a new variant that appears better able to evade immunity, and that seasonal wave could end up a tsunami.

Back in July [2021], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced that COVID had become "a pandemic of the unvaccinated," an unfortunate turn of phrase that was soon picked up by the president. Now the flaws in its logic are about to be exposed on what could be a terrifying scale. Unvaccinated Americans will certainly pay the steepest price in the months to come, but the risks appear to have grown for everyone. The pandemic of the vaccinated can no longer be denied.

The 60% of Americans who are fully vaccinated could soon find their lives looking very different. For much of the summer and fall, those who had received 2 Pfizer or Moderna doses or one Johnson & Johnson shot were told that they were essentially bulletproof, especially if they were young and healthy. But preliminary data from South Africa and Europe now suggest that 2 vaccine doses alone might still allow for frequent breakthrough infections and rapid spread of the disease, even if hospitalization and death remain unlikely. Getting 3 shots, or 2 shots plus a previous bout of COVID, seems to offer more protection. For Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, that's enough evidence to justify changing the CDC's definition of full vaccination. "With omicron and the data emerging, I think there is no reason why we shouldn't have a pretty strong push for everyone to have boosters," he told me.

At this point, the CDC has recorded that less than a quarter of adults who are fully vaccinated under the existing definition have gotten a 3rd shot. That leaves about 150 million people who are vaccinated but unboosted. Given that the people in this group are less protected against infection, they're at greater risk of passing on the disease to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated kids, as well as to unvaccinated or immunologically vulnerable adults. They will also pass the coronavirus more readily among themselves. Settings that might have previously seemed safe for vaccinated folks -- say, a restaurant or performance venue that strictly checks vaccination status -- could become fertile ground for transmission, because the people inside them are more likely to catch and spread the virus. Indeed, anecdotal reports already suggest that large indoor gatherings of fully vaccinated people can become super-spreader events in the age of omicron.

Population-level immunity could suffer in another way, too, Omer said: people who were previously protected because of a prior infection could now be quite vulnerable to getting reinfected and passing on the disease. In fact, it's possible that the only parts of the country where community transmission might be blunted are those that faced devastating early waves of the virus and subsequently had strong vaccination rates, mostly a handful of areas in the Northeast. "It's really very, very challenging to consider how those differences might play out," Joshua Schiffer, a disease-modeling expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told me.

Here's the upshot: Each fully vaccinated person might still be at minimal risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID this winter, but the vestiges of normalcy around them could start to buckle or even break. In the worst-case scenario, highly vaccinated areas could also see "the kind of overwhelmed hospital systems that we saw back in 2020 with the early phase in Boston and New York City," Samuel Scarpino, a network scientist at the Rockefeller Foundation's Pandemic Prevention Institute, told me. If only a small percentage of omicron infections lead to hospitalization, the variant is still spreading with such ferocity that millions of people could need a bed.

Such a scenario would be especially dangerous if those millions of people all needed a bed at the same time. Omicron is so transmissible that cases could peak across the country more or less in tandem, Schiffer and Scarpino both said, which would make it harder for the US to shuffle personnel and ventilators to particularly hard-hit regions. ICU capacities in some states are already stretched thin, and health-care workers are resigning en masse, so the harms could be even worse. "If we don't get serious, if we don't get the masks on, if we don't get testing up, we're going to be back into lockdown again because people will be dying in the hallways of hospitals," Scarpino said. The prospect of such a surge in hospitalizations is "keeping me up nights, to be honest," Schiffer told me.

This all would be mitigated if omicron turns out to cause significantly milder disease than delta -- still a possibility, but far from confirmed -- and if the vaccines' protection against severe disease holds strong. But even in that sunnier version of the future, cases are almost certain to increase in highly vaccinated areas and undervaccinated ones alike, and bring with them a host of disruptions to daily life. Schiffer suggested that in areas with sufficient political will -- mostly highly vaccinated ones -- high case rates could spur local leaders to institute new shutdowns. In any event, fully vaccinated people are still required to isolate for at least 10 days after a positive test, and anyone they've been in contact with might have to stay home from school or work. A positive test in a classroom could send dozens of kids into quarantine, and keep their parents out of work to care for them. Jon Zelner, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, told me that massive disruptions caused by surging omicron cases this winter could force Americans to reconsider these sorts of procedures.

Whatever the effects on vaccinated Americans, the omicron fallout is going to be much more severe for everyone else. In places with low vaccine coverage and strong anti-shutdown politics, inconvenience could be replaced by mass death and even greater grief. And the devastation will almost certainly be greater, on average, in rural communities, poor communities, and communities of color. "It's unvaccinated people who are going to be at the worst risk for the worst outcomes. And it's also going to be the folks who don't have the ability or the luxury to quarantine or just kind of hide out when it looks like the numbers are getting too high," Zelner said. People working multiple jobs might not have time to get a booster or sick days to use while recovering from side effects. People who live in areas that are underserved by hospital systems will have more trouble finding a bed and receive worse care if they do get sick.

None of these futures are yet written in stone. The scope of the coming hardship will depend on how capable omicron is of causing severe disease and death. And though omicron seems likely to overtake delta, "cases are still low enough with omicron that we can have a big effect if [we] act early," Scarpino said, though "acting early was last week." A month ago, one could still pretend that burden fell on those who lived in some other place, far away from vaccinated people in vaccinated communities. Now that delusion looks shakier than ever.

[2] Nasal vaccine
Date: Fri 10 Dec 2021
Source: Yale News [edited]
https://news.yale.edu/2021/12/10/nasal-vaccine-may-aid-fight-against-new-viral-variants


The emergence of COVID-19 variants such as delta and omicron have sent scientists scrambling to determine whether existing vaccinations and boosters are still effective against new strains of SARS-Cov-2.

A new response to the rapidly mutating virus might be found right at the door to our lungs, says Yale's Akiko Iwasaki, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology. In a new study, she and her colleagues found that intranasal vaccination provides broad-based protection against heterologous respiratory viruses in mice, while so-called systemic immunization, which uses an injection to elicit body-wide protection, did not.

Their findings are published 10 Dec [2021] in the journal Science Immunology [citation below].

"The best immune defense happens at the gate, guarding against viruses trying to enter," said Iwasaki, senior author of the study.

Mucous membranes contain their own immune defense system that combat air- or food-borne pathogens. When challenged, these barrier tissues produce B cells, which in turn secrete immunoglobin A (IgA) antibodies. Unlike vaccines, which elicit a system-wide immune response, IgA antibodies work locally on mucosal surfaces found in the nose, stomach, and lungs.

While the protective role of IgA-producing cells had been well established in combatting intestinal pathogens, Iwasaki's lab wondered if triggering IgA response might also produce a localized immune response against respiratory viruses.

Working with researchers at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, they tested a protein-based vaccine designed to jump start an IgA immune response, administering it to mice through injections, as is commonly done with systemic immunizations, and also intranasally. They then exposed mice to multiple strains of influenza viruses. They found that mice that had received vaccine intranasally were much better protected against the respiratory influenza than those that received injections. Nasal vaccines, but not the shot, also induced antibodies that protected the animals against a variety of flu strains, not just against the strain the vaccine was meant to protect against.

The Yale team is currently testing nasal vaccine strains against COVID strains in animal models.

While both vaccine injections and nasal vaccines increased levels of antibodies in the blood of mice, only the nasal vaccine enabled IgA secretion into the lungs, where respiratory viruses need to lodge to infect the host, Iwasaki said.

If the nasal vaccines prove to be safe and efficient in humans, Iwasaki envisions them being used in conjunction with current vaccines and boosters that work systemwide in order to add immune system reinforcements at the source of infection.

Nasal vaccines (BRSV/PI3) are used for cattle with good success, so I am wondering why it took them so long to explore the possibility.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
--------
Antibodies secreted at the mucosal surface play an integral role in immune defense by serving to neutralize the pathogen and promote its elimination at the site of entry. Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a predominant Ig isotype at mucosal surfaces whose epithelial cells express polymeric Ig receptor capable of transporting dimeric IgA to the lumen. Although the role of IgA in intestinal mucosa has been extensively studied, the cell types responsible for secreting the IgA that protects the host against pathogens in the lower respiratory tract are less clear. Here, using a mouse model of influenza virus infection, we demonstrate that intranasal, but not systemic, immunization induces local IgA secretion in the bronchoalveolar space. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found a heterogeneous population of IgA-expressing cells within the respiratory mucosa, including tissue-resident memory B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells. IgA-secreting cell establishment within the lung required CXCR3. An intranasally administered protein-based vaccine also led to the establishment of IgA-secreting cells in the lung, but not when given intramuscularly or intraperitoneally. Last, local IgA secretion correlated with superior protection against secondary challenge with homologous and heterologous virus infection than circulating antibodies alone. These results provide key insights into establishment of protective immunity in the lung based on tissue-resident IgA-secreting B cells and inform vaccine strategies designed to elicit highly effective immune protection against respiratory virus infections."]

[Also see a July 2021 publication:

"A microbiologist and an immunologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham have published a Perspective piece in the journal Science [see citation below] outlining the possible benefits of developing COVID-19 vaccines delivered in an intranasal mist rather in the arm as an injection. In their paper, Frances Lund and Troy Randall suggest that nasal applications provide a host of benefits that injections do not.

The researchers begin their arguments by noting that the SARS-COV-2 virus is transmitted through the air and infects the nasal passages and then lungs, which raises the question: Why are only 7 of the 100 vaccines currently under development or in use delivered intranasally? They note that intranasal vaccines have 3 obvious advantages: They are needle-free, they can deliver drugs directly to infected sites, and they can elicit mucosal immunity in the lungs.

The researchers note that use of nasal vaccines is not new; flu vaccines have been administered intranasally for decades. They also point out that prior research has shown that both nasal infections and vaccinations can instigate an immunoglobulin A (IgA) response in both serum and in the respiratory system; intramuscular administration, on the other hand, can only do so for serum fluids. They also note that CD8+ T cells can be primed by nasal vaccines to express receptors, making them ready to fight an infection. They note also that IgA and T and B cells in the respiratory system can provide a barrier of sorts against infections when stoked by an intranasally administered vaccine.

Lund and Randall also argue that some of the nasal vaccines in development have been shown to set off long-lasting virus-neutralizing responses in immune system cells; some have also been shown to help protect against weight loss and pneumonia associated with viral infections. And they note that during testing, animals given an intranasally administered vaccine versus an intramuscular vaccine had reduced levels of viral shedding and replication, both in nasal passages and in the lungs.

The researchers acknowledge that prior research has shown that intranasally administered vaccines do suffer from a couple of flaws. First, intranasally administered vaccines involve the use of live attenuated viruses, which carries some risk of infection. Second, they do not provide the same degree of immune longevity as those administered in the muscle. They conclude that, ultimately, the best solution may be to use both types of vaccinations: one to give the body immediate protection, the other to keep the body safe longer."

[3] Three vaccine doses needed for protection
Date: Fri 10 Dec 2021
Source: BBC News [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59615005


Early analysis of UK omicron and delta cases showed the vaccines were less effective at stopping the new variant. But a 3rd booster prevents around 75% of people getting any COVID symptoms.

Meanwhile, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, who chaired a meeting with first ministers of the devolved nations this afternoon [Fri 10 Dec 2021], warned the UK faces a "deeply concerning situation."

Speaking after the meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, he said measures taken so far were "proportionate," but ministers were "absolutely" keeping everything under review.

"Action is absolutely required, and as new data comes in, we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data," he added.

It comes as another 448 cases of omicron were confirmed in the UK, taking the number reported so far to 1265. The total number of COVID cases recorded on Friday [10 Dec 2021] was 58 194, the highest figure since 9 Jan [2021].

The government has said it is updating its guidance for care homes in England, limiting the number of visitors allowed per resident, and increasing testing "in order to balance the current COVID-19 risk."

One of the main concerns since the heavily mutated omicron variant first emerged was that it would make vaccines less effective. The UK Health Security Agency report analysed data from 581 omicron cases and thousands of delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines were against the new variant. The analysis is based on limited data but showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for 2 doses of Pfizer.

The 75% protection against COVID symptoms after a booster is not as high as against previous variants.

There was not enough data to analyse the Moderna or Janssen vaccines, but there is no reason to think they would have different results.

However, the UK Health Security Agency said vaccines were still likely to offer good protection against severe COVID that needed hospital treatment.

So far, around 22 million people have received a booster dose, but even if everyone was boosted, the lower vaccine effectiveness would still leave millions of people susceptible.

The real-world data backs up laboratory studies that showed a 40-fold reduction in the ability of antibodies from double-vaccinated people to take out the virus.

There is optimism that vaccines will still keep many people out of hospital even if more do get COVID. Data on severity could be published next week. However, an omicron wave could be problematic even if it were milder. A large and sudden wave could lead to everyone who is still vulnerable needing hospital care at the same time.

The rapid surge in omicron cases was already hinting that the variant was getting around some of the protection given by vaccines.

It is estimated that the number of omicron cases is doubling every 2-3 days. The UKHSA estimates that more than half of all cases in the country will be omicron by mid-December [2021], and that if growth continues unabated, there will be more than 100 000 cases a day by the end of the month.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: "These early estimates should be treated with caution, but they indicate that a few months after the 2nd jab, there is a greater risk of catching the omicron variant compared to delta strain.

"We expect the vaccines to show higher protection against the serious complications of COVID-19, so if you haven't yet had your 1st 2 doses, please book an appointment straight away."

The research comes amid concern about the growing numbers of omicron cases in the UK. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned of a "tsunami" of cases as she tightened COVID isolation rules and encouraged people to cancel Christmas party plans.

Under the new guidance for care homes in England, residents will only be permitted to receive visits from 3 people, plus one essential caregiver. The Department of Health and Social Care said testing would also increase for fully vaccinated residents making outside visits and for staff, and their vaccination teams were being expanded to increase the take-up of the booster jab.

[4] Boosters
Date: Sat 11 Dec 2021
Source: Forbes [edited]
https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/12/11/in-the-face-of-an-imminent-omicron-wave-public-health-officials-seek-to-optimize-timing-of-covid-19-vaccine-boosters/?sh=34da0a544c24


In the face of an imminent wave of cases of the omicron variant, the vaccine debate in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe has turned to boosters for adults. Boosters are considered key to contain omicron, as 3rd doses offer 75% efficacy against symptomatic disease.

Public health officials are seeking to optimize timing of COVID-19 vaccine boosters. Specifically, they're trying to figure out what's optimal in terms of spacing between the 2nd and 3rd doses of vaccine. Differences in scheduling across countries suggests that there isn't a consensus yet.

The UK is already offering boosters to all adults just 3 months after their 2nd dose. Belgium, Israel, and Singapore are also shortening the booster interval to less than 6 months. Other countries, such as the US, Germany, and the Netherlands still recommend an interval of at least 6 months.

In the early days of vaccinating adult populations in different countries, we encountered an analogous lack of agreement on dosing schedules for the 2 mRNA vaccines and the viral vector Astra Zeneca/Oxford University vaccine.

Since December of last year [2020], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 3-4-week spacing between the 1st 2 doses of mRNA vaccines, regardless of age group. To this day, this policy remains in effect.

Nevertheless, there isn't a consensus on what the most optimal period should be between the 1st doses. According to a Wall Street Journal article, for the 1st 2 doses there should be more time between shots than the CDC-recommended 3- or 4-week period. Studies suggest that waiting longer between the 1st and 2nd doses of the COVID-19 vaccine builds better immunity. Specifically, a longer gap between the 1st 2 doses of both mRNA vaccines and the viral vector Astra Zeneca/Oxford University vaccine leads to significantly higher levels of receptor binding domain antibodies with the 8-12-week dose spacing compared with 3-6 weeks. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-covid-19-vaccine-doses-should-there-be-more-time-between-shots-11638194400?mod=e2tw]

The UK, Canada, and most European nations delayed 2nd doses of mRNA vaccines and the Astra Zeneca/Oxford University vaccine by approximately 12 weeks in most instances. This also enabled authorities to stretch the limited supply of 1st doses over a larger population.

There is the problem, however, of less protection in the short term, namely during the period between doses. There's a greater risk of falling ill during the longer interval between jabs. While it's clear unvaccinated individuals are the most vulnerable to coronavirus, partially vaccinated are susceptible too. In terms of protection, the difference between being partially and fully vaccinated is significant. And so the timing of the 2 shots can matter.

The delta variant has been shown to cause 2.26 times more hospitalizations than older variants. Importantly, the results were roughly similar whether unvaxxed or just one-dose or partially vaccinated. A single dose just isn't effective against delta. Israeli data show that of those who contract coronavirus, the partially vaccinated are 2-3 times more likely to be critically ill than the fully vaccinated. Similarly, from UK data compiled in June of this year [2021], the unvaccinated accounted for the highest percentage of hospital admissions (60%), followed by the partially vaccinated comprising 27% of hospitalizations. And, at the time, only 13% of hospitalizations were fully vaccinated.

It's still uncertain which interval is optimal for the 1st 2 doses. There are pros and cons to both shorter and longer intervals.

But, what is apparent is that a combination of significantly waning vaccine immunity and the ascendance of the omicron variant is altering how scientific experts and public health officials view the exigency of boosters, but also the spacing between both the 2nd and 3rd dose, and the 1st and 2nd dose of vaccine.

Vaccine immunity begins to wane significantly 3 months after the 2nd dose. We can tell this is happening, as the ongoing delta wave is increasingly affecting the vaccinated, especially vulnerable sub-populations who haven't been boosted. Waning vaccine immunity among these sub-populations -- the elderly and immunocompromised, for example -- is a primary reason why accelerating booster campaigns is so important.

Furthermore, as the omicron variant gains traction in its bid to outcompete delta, boosting will become even more important. This is because there's a significant degree of vaccine immune escape with omicron. Moreover, virologist Akiko Iwasaki suggests that it is prudent to maintain a short interval of 4 weeks between 1st and 2nd shots for children 5-11 years old. She argues that it's "better to elevate the immune response quickly when omicron is spreading."
