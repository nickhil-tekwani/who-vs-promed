Spanish salmonella outbreak infects 900, linked to one death
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of salmonella in Spain has affected 921 people who ate
infected pre-cooked roast chicken in recent days, the health ministry
said. It added, on Wed 3 Aug 2005, that it was investigating reports
linking the death of one man with the outbreak.
Authorities in the eastern region of Valencia were trying to
establish whether the 90-year-old man had died as a result of eating
chicken from the Sada SA firm, producer of 2 chicken products, of
which 150 000 units have been withdrawn since the illnesses came to
light on Fri 29 Jul 2005.
A health ministry spokesman said the man "did consume this kind of
chicken." A total of 141 people were still in the hospital on Wed 3
Aug 2005 after eating the chicken, but "the great majority of cases
are not serious," the spokesman said.
The outbreak has affected people in 13 of Spain's 17 provinces and
communities, cases surfacing as far apart as the northern Basque
region and the Balearic Islands. The health ministry said the
authorities in the central region of Castilla La Mancha, home to Sada
SA, had opened an investigation.

43 might have salmonellosis in the Basque Autonomous Region and
Navarre. 9 out of 21 ate the associated product in the Basque region
of Bizkaia, whereas the remaining 12 ate it abroad. The number of
affected stands at 790.
The number of people affected by salmonellosis in the Basque
Autonomous Region, possibly linked with the consumption of chicken,
stands at 21. The food poisoning could be connected with "Pimpollo"
and "Sada" branded vacuum-packed roast chicken, the health councilor
Gabriel Inclan reported.
9 out of 21 ate the product in the Basque region of Bizkaia, whereas
the remaining 12 ate it abroad. One of those 12 is a 76-year-old man
who is out of danger. He is the only one of the 21 who remains in the
hospital. The rest of the poisoned "progress satisfactorily," sources
said.
This type of salmonella causes "basically diarrhea," Inclan stated,
trying to calm the citizens, saying that, due to the "incubation
period, new cases could come up."
The batch was withdrawn from the market, the Basque government said.
However, "if anyone has "Pimpollo" or "Sada" branded chicken at home,
throw it away," the person in charge of the health department
advised. Likewise, those who develop symptoms of being intoxicated
should be in contact with the regional minister.

More than 400 cases of salmonella after eating pre-cooked chicken
-----------------------------------------------
The 9 communities affected have confirmed a total of 417 cases.
Murcia is the community with the higher number of affected people
(113), followed by Andalucia (78), Castilla-La Mancha (68), Comunidad
Valenciana (55), Cataluna (42), La Rioja (20), Baleares (20), Aragon
(14) and Madrid (9) (The contributor notes that these represent most
of peninsular Spain other than the northern Atlantic coast. -
Mod.LL). Although the Spanish Ministry of Health has recognized 30
outbreaks so far, with 120 confirmed cases, it is awaiting
epidemiological investigations before issuing final figures of
affected cases.
The infections are linked to pre-cooked chicken Pollo Asado Sada y
Pollo Asado Pimpollo. The products were recalled by the manufacturer
Grupo Sada.
Jose Ignacio Arranz, Director of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety
(Agencia Espanola de Seguridad Alimentaria, AESA), has said that the
pipes of the sauce dispenser used to season the chicken were the
original source. Grupo Sada has corroborated this information in an
official statement.
