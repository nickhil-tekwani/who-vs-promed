From: Cecilia Carmem Araujo Nicolai <cnicolai@pcrj.rj.gov.br>

I would like [to make clear that in Brazil [the yellow fever vaccine is
FREE for all, even those not travelling to transmission areas. The vaccine
is not available at private clinics.

[This is what we understood, but the class of secondary school teachers I
taught in Rio last week were convinced that they had to pay for it unless
they were travelling. Perhaps the media have now clarified this. - Mod.JW
