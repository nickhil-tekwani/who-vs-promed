Cause of pneumonia outbreak in south China identified
--------------------------------------------------
Guangzhou (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Chlamydia has been identified as the cause
of a pneumonia outbreak that hit 6 cities in south China's Guangdong
province recently, experts said Tue, 18 Feb 2003.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in cooperation with
the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, found Chlamydiain
2 specimens taken from the lungs of patients who died from the strain of
pneumonia. The particles of chlamydia in the lung cell plasma were also
very typical, the 2 centers said in a report.
Center experts said chlamydia could spread through secretions from the
respiratory tract, aerosols, or exposure to patients and birds infected
with the pneumonia.
Clinical symptoms of patients infected with chlamydia were pneumonia and
bronchitis, said the experts.
Guangdong provincial government officials said that by 12 Feb, a total of
305 patients had been infected with the atypical pneumonia, with 5 deaths
reported.
They said the epidemic has been brought under control, with no cases
reported since last Mon, 10 Feb.

[Previously, mycoplasma had been reported to have been the cause of this
outbreak of respiratory disease with a slightly less than 2 percent
mortality. This posting suggests that another cause of atypical
pneumonia,_Chlamydia sp._ could be the etiology.
The two best recognized causes of respiratory disease related to these
organisms are _C. pneumoniae_ and _C. psittaci_ . The former organism is a
common cause of community-acquired pneumonia which is usually endemic but
clusters may occur. The latter is a zoonosis, usually spread to man from
infected birds (also called psittacosis or ornithosis), and may be
associated with a biochemical hepatitis and/or neurological abnormalities.
Even though histological evidence of chlamydial infection is suggested,it
is possible that the chlamydia represented co-infected with chlamydial
organisms along with the true cause of the outbreak. Serological
confirmation of the cause, if chlamydial, ought to be able to be made.
More information regarding the histological findings as well as well done
serological testing is needed. -Mod. LL]
