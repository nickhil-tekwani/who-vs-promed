Cases of elephantiasis (lymphatic filariasis) are increasing in Zambia
---------------------------------------------------------------
Elephantiasis cases are on the increase in various parts of Zambia with prevalence rates estimated between 1 and 53 per cent, the Ministry of Health has disclosed. The Ministry of Health has put up control measures to tackle the disease, however, which is incurable but preventable. Elephantiasis is a disease characterised by massive swelling of the legs and private parts of both male and female human beings.

It is caused by a worm [_Wuchereria bancrofti_ or _Mansonella perstans_] which disturbs the flow of fluids in the legs and private parts, leaving victims with swollen body parts. Ndola district principal clinical care officer Lillian Nyendwa said the disease, which was highly prevalent in the past, could be contained through mass drug administration to adults and children above the age of 2.

Drugs commonly administered in the treatment of elephantiasis include albendazole and diethylcarbamazine. Dr Nyendwa said the drugs could not be administered to pregnant women, however; they would only access treatment upon child delivery. She was speaking in Ndola yesterday [2 Jun 2015] during a stakeholders meeting ahead of the week-long elephantiasis drug administration campaign between 8 and 16 Jun [2015]. The campaign will run side by side with the child health week.

"In Ndola, the prevalence rate of elephantiasis is only about 10 per cent of the population. We will conduct a drug administration exercise for Ndola next week when adults and children will receive treatment to curb the spread of the disease," she said. Dr Nyendwa said adults and children should visit their nearest clinics and health posts to receive treatment free of charge. "Some of our officers will be going around companies, schools, and churches to ensure that everyone receives treatment," she said.

[A recent study mapping lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Zambia concluded that "LF was found to be surprisingly widespread in Zambia, although in most places with low prevalence" (Mwase ET, et al. Mapping the geographical distribution of lymphatic filariasis in Zambia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014 Feb 20;8(2):e2714). The blood samples were analysed by the Binax rapid antigen detection assay, detecting a _Wuchereria bancrofti_ antigen, and whether this test is cross reactive to _Mansonella perstans_ is not known. - Mod.EP
