[I have just returned from a field trip and missed all the messages about
"The Coming Plague". This does not appear to be altogether unfortunate.
What follows are some more comments, which I am posting for completeness. I
believe this string has cut itself. -- Mod CHC]

I noticed an error in the first installment - the narrator said that Ebola
made human victims' cell _walls_ dissolve.

Television and videotape standards
With respect to the recent postings on videotapes of "The Coming Plague", my
recollection is that TV around the world has different technical standards
(lines scanned per inch differ, for example). That is, to view an American
or Canadian programme taped directly to videotape, I think one will need a TV
made for that market. I don't remember if that is also true of the videotape
machine. I believe that it is possible to convert between formats, but that
this in essence requires making a new tape. Subscribers outside the US or
Canada may wish to verify this before purchasing videotapes intended for sale
here. Perhaps someone with more technical expertise can clarify, as my
experience is somewhat dated.

Good idea! And would they be made in the PAL format so those of us who
aren't in the US can watch them?

From: P.K. Bains <pkb20@cus.cam.ac.uk>
I am a medical doctor, graduated from New Zealand, currently undertaking an
M.Phil. in International Relations at the University of Cambridge in the UK.
As part of this course I have chosen to write my M.Phil. thesis on the
institutional responses to the emerging infectious diseases, in particular
looking at international cooperation on the issue. Unfortunately as I am in
graduate accomodation and in the UK I have not been able to see the below
mentioned documentary, but would be absolutely fascinated to do so.
Could you please be so kind as to assist me on how I could obtain a copy of
the report, or if it will be screened on British television in the near
future.

More on the phone number which Phyllis found: They identified themselves as
a clearing house and referred me to a second number, 1-800-672-6202, which is
answered as Warner Home Videos; WHV told me they do not ship outside the US,
and they do not have a standard 'you-pay-the-charge' phone number. (My
previous experience is that, at least from Germany, you can't direct-dial a
US toll free (800 or 888) number.) Maybe some embassy/consulate health
officers in the US will volunteer to help their compatriots?

[Phyllis Williams had said: "There are two ways to order the Coming Plague:
1. Call 1-800-887-3737 for a phone order. The video costs $29.98 plus
$5.95 shipping.
2. If you order by a Purchase Order, send it to: Warner Home Videos, 8240

[This self-cuts the string. Although it is a great deal more profitable than
what we are doing, Promed-mail is not in the video business. Yo, Celso! E-
mail me directly <ccalisher@vines.colostate.edu> and I will get you the
information. For anyone else, see archives above. The information is all
there. -- Mod. CHC, who is going home, having had enough for today.]
