Avian influenza in Siberia, Russia
----------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 4 Aug 2006 from Dr Evgueny A
Nepoklonov, head of the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture
and Food, Moscow:
Precise identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
subtype H5N1.
During 2006, in Siberian Federal District, avian influenza was reported in
private backyards in Altaj, Tomsk, Omsk and Novosibirsk regions. In Tomsk
region, 2 outbreaks were registered, one of them in domestic pigeons. On 31
Jul 2006, one outbreak of avian influenza was still active in Tomsk region.
No new outbreaks of the disease have been reported since 5 Jul 2006. In
Tyva Republic, wild birds were found dead due to avian influenza.

[It would be very useful to have more details on the testing results cited
here, particularly those in the Tyva Republic. It is to be hoped that the
Weekly Disease Information Report due for issue next Thursday will have it.
The Tomsk region, which seems to be the only place with an active outbreak,
is located near one of last year's hotspots in Novosibirsk. You can see a
