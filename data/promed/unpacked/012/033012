Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) raised its travel alert for Beijing on Sunday [19 Oct 2014] after 2 human infections of H7N9 avian influenza virus were reported there. The MAC upgraded its epidemic travel advisory for Beijing and Xinjiang from a level one "watch" to a level 2 "alert," which advises travelers to maintain a high degree of caution and take strong protective measures. It raised the travel alert on the recommendation of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Other than Beijing and Xinjiang, all Chinese cities and provinces (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, for which there are no travel alerts) are still under a level one advisory issued by the MAC in light of reports of other H7N9 cases. The MAC warned that the H7N9 situation in China could worsen in autumn [2014] and cautioned people traveling to the country to avoid direct contact with birds or poultry, avoid eating uncooked meat and eggs or feeding wild birds, wash their hands frequently, and see a doctor immediately if they develop a fever and cough.

Under the CDC's 3-tier warning system, a level one advisory urges vigilance and health precautions when traveling to listed areas, while a level 3 warning advises against travel to the specified destination.

[Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) raised its travel alert after 2 human infections of H7N9 avian influenza virus were reported from Beijing and Xinjiang. These cases may be indicative of the beginnings of a winter outbreak of avian H7N9 virus infection in the human population. The MAC upgraded its epidemic travel advisory for Beijing and Xinjiang from a level one "watch" to a level 2 "alert," which advises travellers to maintain a high degree of caution and take strong protective measures. It raised the travel alert on the recommendation of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Recent reports from China have reported an expansion of avian H7N9 virus in the poultry population and 2 human cases of severe illness in Xinjiang province (see recent prior ProMED-mail posts below). - Mod.CP
