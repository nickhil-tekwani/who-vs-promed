An outbreak of non-tuberculous mycobacterial skin infections in Florida was traced to contaminated tattoo ink and tap water, according to findings published in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1].

Officials launched an investigation after a dermatologist in Miami-Dade County reported 3 patients with skin infections to the state health department.

"In recent years, a number of non-tuberculous mycobacterial outbreaks associated with tattoo studios have been reported in the literature," Isabel Griffin, MPH, epidemiologist and biological scientist at the Florida Department of Health (DOH) in Miami-Dade County, and colleagues wrote. "These outbreaks have been associated with poor infection control practices at tattoo studios and contamination of graywash ink at the point of manufacture."

Interviews with the 1st 3 patients revealed they all received a tattoo from the same studio and artist in February and March of 2015. The source of the infections was determined to be a bottle of graywash ink -- a diluted ink used to create a greater range of gray colors within a tattoo -- which had been opened when purchased, Griffin and colleagues reported.

Investigators interviewed a total of 226 clients and identified 38 as outbreak-associated cases. According to Griffin and colleagues, individuals whose tattoos had gray tattoo ink were 8.2 times more likely to report a rash (95 percent CI, 3.07-22.13). Genetic analysis of environmental samples and skin biopsies uncovered 2 _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ isolates in the graywash ink and one skin biopsy and 11 _[Mycobacterium] abscessus_ isolates, 5 from the bottle of graywash ink, 2 from tap water and 4 from skin biopsies. Griffin and colleagues observed that these isolates were indistinguishable, leading to a national recall of the implicated ink. Investigators also discovered that 5 unopened bottles of graywash ink obtained from 2 other Miami-Dade tattoo studios contained _[Mycobacterium] chelonae_ isolates.

According to the authors, CDC and FDA sterilization recommendations for tattoo ink manufacturers vary. The CDC advises manufactures to ensure sterilization of tattoo ink and recommends against dilution with nonsterile water, such as tap water.

"Tattoo patrons should be made aware of the infection risks associated with tattooing, not only those that result from bloodborne pathogens, but also bacteria in contaminated inks and nonsterile water," Griffin and colleagues wrote. "The community would benefit from additional safeguards regarding tattoo ink manufacturing, guidelines for the dilution of tattoo ink, improved consumer information, and education on reporting adverse reactions and tattoo-related outbreaks to FDA and DOH."

Abstract
----------
"BACKGROUND. On 29 Apr 2015, the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County (DOH-Miami-Dade) was notified by a local dermatologist of 3 patients with suspect nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection after receiving tattoos at a local tattoo studio.

METHODS. DOH-Miami-Dade conducted interviews and offered testing, described below, to tattoo studio clients reporting rashes. Culture of clinical isolates and identification were performed at the Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories (BPHL). Characterization of NTM was performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), respectively. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses were used to construct a phylogeny among 21 Mycobacterium isolates at FDA.

RESULTS. 38 of 226 interviewed clients were identified as outbreak-associated cases. Multivariate logistic regression revealed individuals who reported grey tattoo ink in their tattoos were 8.2 times as likely to report a rash [95 percent CI: 3.07--22.13]. Multiple NTM species were identified in clinical and environmental specimens. Phylogenetic results from environmental samples and skin biopsies indicated that 2 _M. fortuitum_ isolates (greywash ink and a skin biopsy) and 11 _M. abscessus_ isolates (5 from the implicated bottle of greywash tattoo ink, 2 from tap water, and 4 from skin biopsies) were indistinguishable. In addition, _M. chelonae_ was isolated from 5 unopened bottles of greywash ink provided by 2 other tattoo studios in Miami-Dade County.

CONCLUSIONS. WGS and SNP analyses identified the tap water and the bottle of greywash tattoo ink as the sources of the NTM infections."

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM are a group of mycobacteria outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, which cause tuberculosis, and _Mycobacterium leprae_ and _M. lepromatosis_, which cause leprosy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex includes: _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, _M. africanum_, _M. microti_ and _M. canetti_. NTM, which include over 150 different species, are commonly found in municipal tap water and are characterized on the basis of their rate of growth in vitro and pigment production.

Rapidly growing NTM (RGM) produce mature, non-pigmented growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include _M. fortuitum_ and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. The other NTM require more than 7 days to produce mature growth on agar plates and include pigmented _M. marinum_, _M. gordonae_, and _M. kansasii_, and non-pigmented _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex and _M. ulcerans_.

ProMED-mail has previously reported outbreaks of infection associated with tattooing and body piercing caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and RGM, as well as blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. RGM infection associated with tattooing could be caused by RGM-contaminated instruments or inks or other injected materials that are diluted with contaminated tap water in the tattooing parlor. However, RGM infection due to premixed ink in sealed containers contaminated with _M. chelonae_ has also been reported, which suggests that tattoo ink production facilities were at fault (1). Also, nosocomial RGM infection has followed use of contaminated skin marking solutions (2).
