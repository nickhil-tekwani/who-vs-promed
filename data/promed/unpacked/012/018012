REPORT NOTES DIFFICULTIES IN ELIMINATING E. COLI O157:H7 FROM
FOOD SUPPLY
September 25, 1997
(from an Institute of Food Technologists news release)
FACTS ABOUT E. COLI O157:H7
E. coli O157:H7 is one of the most virulent (highly infectious) pathogens
known to enter the world food supply. It causes diarrhea, abdominal pain,
and in some cases, intestinal bleeding and kidney failure.
The initial symptoms of E. coli O157:H7 illness generally occur within two
days after eating contaminated food, though three to five days have been
reported. Symptoms increase in intensity during the next 24-48 hours,
lasting from four to 10 days.
Less than ten E. coli O157:H7 cells may be enough to cause foodborne
illness in humans. A low infectious dose of two to 2,000 cells has been
associated with outbreaks.
E. coli O157:H7 can survive in acidic environments that are lethal to other
pathogens, such as in fermented foods like sausage and apple cider.
Though potentially deadly to humans, E. coli O157:H7 is not pathogenic to
cattle. A single cow, or cattle within the same herd, may contain more than
one strain of E. coli O157:H7. Some strains are thought to have greater
acid tolerance than others.
The source of E. coli O157:H7 contamination on carcasses is likely due to
fecal contamination during animal production and slaughter operations.
Carcasses may become contaminated during hide removal or by
cross-contamination with equipment and workers' hands.
HACCP [Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point] systems in processing
plants cannot eliminate E. coli O157:H7 from foods unless a treatment is
added that will kill the pathogen, such as heat pasteurization or irradiation.
Current research shows that competitive exclusion has the potential to
eliminate E. coli O157:H7 from cattle before slaughtering. Competitive
exclusion involves the use of non-pathogenic microorganisms to outgrow
pathogens in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals.
If swallowed, fecally contaminated water in freshwater swimming areas may
cause E. coli O157:H7 infection in both cattle and humans.
Fresh manure used to fertilize garden fruits and vegetables may contaminate
them with E. coli O157:H7.
The largest reported E. coli O157:H7 outbreak, which caused thousands of
illnesses, occurred in Japan in 1996. Radish sprouts were implicated as the
source of infection.
CONSUMER FOOD SAFETY TIPS
Wash hands well before handling food and after handling raw meat or
poultry, petting animals (especially cattle, deer, or dogs), changing
diapers, providing day care to children or adults, etc.
Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly prior to handling or eating.
Do not use fresh manure to fertilize garden fruits or vegetables.
Drink only pasteurized milk and apple juice.
Cook ground beef, venison, poultry, and pork thoroughly (minimum 160 F)
before eating.
Avoid cross-contaminating food with raw meat or poultry.
Avoid swimming in lakes or ponds used by cattle.
Avoid drinking surface water that has not been treated to eliminate pathogens.
