USA: Restaurant-associated Suspected Norovirus Outbreak in Colorado
--------------------------------------------------
More than 240 people have contacted health officials in the past 2 days to
complain they became ill after eating at a Fort Collins restaurant. The
outbreak is so large that 10 Larimer County employees have been assigned to
the investigation of what happened at the Texas Roadhouse, part of a
national chain based in Louisville, Ky. The restaurant has been closed
temporarily, and the company has hired a private contractor to disinfect
the restaurant, health officials said on Thu 17 Jun 2004. People who ate at
the popular steak house say they experienced cramps, nausea, chills,
diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms within 48 hours of their meals. Some
were treated at Poudre Valley Hospital, said Ann Watson, spokeswoman for
the county health department.
In 2003, the restaurant was rated "good" in food inspections. In 2002, it
was declared "excellent," according to county records. The problems appear
to involve people who ate at the restaurant Saturday, Sunday, and Monday,
said Ed Shemm, the county's assistant director of environmental health.
Health investigators are asking people what they ate and when they ate it
and have taken samples from people for testing. Based on interviews,
officials say the virus appears to be a norovirus, which is fairly common
and easily transmitted, Shemm said.

USA: Norovirus Outbreak Closes Restaurant in Colorado
-----------------------------------------------------
The Texas Roadhouse [in Fort Collins, Colorado] reopened on Fri 18 Jun
2004, 2 days after it shut down for "top-to-bottom" cleaning in the wake of
viral outbreak like none ever witnessed by the chain. Larimer County health
officials say about 270 people complained of [having been affected by
severe viral gastroenteritis virus] on Sunday and Monday after eating at
the Fort Collins steak house on Sat 12 Jun 2004.
County health officials confirmed that norovirus infection was responsible
for the outbreak: [confirmatory results] were returned by the state's
health department Friday. Noroviruses have been linked to massive outbreaks
[of viral gastroenteritis] on cruise ships and are spread easily,
especially by people who fail to wash their hands after using the bathroom.
The viruses can be transmitted to other people and surfaces, such as
plates, glasses and silverware. Restaurant officials, who said as many as
20 employees might have had the illness, are not exactly sure how the
outbreak began.
When asked why the restaurant waited until Wednesday to close, even though
county officials investigated the outbreak on Monday and Tuesday, Hart said
the county had given the restaurant the OK to continue serving food. He
added that noroviruses are especially difficult to control, but pointed to
Texas Roadhouse's recent food-safety inspections -- "good" last year and
"excellent" in 2003 -- as an indicator of the restaurant's commitment to
cleanliness. County health workers are entering information into a computer
database that could yield more specific information about the outbreak's
origin, but data wasn't available Friday.
The symptoms of norovirus illness usually include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Sometimes people additionally have a
low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a general sense of
tiredness. The illness often begins suddenly, and the infected person might
feel very sick. The illness is usually brief, with symptoms lasting only
about one or 2 days. In general, children experience more vomiting than
adults. Most people with norovirus illness have both symptoms.

Australia (NSW): Institution in Quarantine Following Gastroenteritis Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Bilyara is under strict quarantine due to an outbreak of [viral]
gastroenteritis, a common but highly infectious condition affecting the
stomach and intestines that results in vomiting and diarrhoea. Bilyara
administrator Ray Harris said the outbreak began with several cases late
last week and grew to 16 cases by yesterday, precipitating the decision to
quarantine the village [location of a health-care institution?]. Access to
Bilyara is restricted to essential services only, with general visitors
unable to access the Centre. This weekend's Salvation Army fashion parade
at Bilyara has also been cancelled. Mr Harris said he had notified the
Public Health Unit as required and staff were taking all necessary precautions.
Gastroenteritis has appeared at other regional institutions, including
Canowindra, Molong and as many as 300 cases in Dubbo.
The main symptoms of viral gastroenteritis are vomiting and watery
diarrhoea, though other symptoms may include nausea, fever, abdominal pain,
headache, and muscle aches. There is no specific treatment for viral
gastroenteritis except rest and drinking plenty of fluids, and most people
recover without any complications.

[4] Norovirus, community & hospital based - New Zealand (Dunedin): suspected

Media Release 23 Jun 2004
----------------------
There have been an increased number of cases of vomiting and diarrhoea in
the Dunedin district over the past month. Other parts of the country have
also experienced similar illnesses recently. Norovirus has been found in
faecal specimens tested from some of these cases.
Norovirus is a reasonably common viral illness which typically affects
places where large numbers of people are in close contact, such as schools,
rest homes or cruise ships.
The infection can be spread from person to person by inhaling airborne
particles of virus released during vomiting. The virus can survive for long
periods on surfaces such as toilets and tap fittings. It also survivesin
contaminated water and on food.
People should be careful when cleaning up after ill people. Vomit or faeces
should be cleaned up using a solution of household bleach. Hands should be
thoroughly washed with soap and water and dried after cleaning up, going to
the toilet and before preparing food.
Recently 3 wards in Dunedin Hospital and one from the Mental Health area
have reported cases among patients and staff. At least 19 patients and 26
staff have so far been affected. "We are still waiting for confirmation of
Norovirus. However the symptoms suggest the cases in Dunedin Hospital could
be a Norovirus infection" says Dr John Holmes, Medical Officer of Health,
Otago.
Three people today had their surgery postponed due to shortage of staff and
the risk of possible infection.
Mr Dick Bunton, Chief Medical Officer says "The Otago DHB regrets the
inconvenience to people who have had their surgery postponed. We believe
the decision to delay these procedures is the safest approach to take"
Dr Holmes says "Most people will experience discomfort for about 36 to 48
hours and make a good recovery. Treatment is not necessary but fluid intake
must be kept up."
Dr Roy Morris, Primary Care Advisor, ODHB advises "Children and the elderly
are most at risk of dehydration. If people are concerned they should phone
their general practitioner or the Dunedin Urgent Doctors and Accident
Centre first, advising of their symptoms."
Information has been sent to all ODHB staff, general practitioners, rest
home and private hospitals in Otago.
Dr Holmes comments "Any health care worker, food handler or child-care
worker with vomiting or diarrhoea should not be working. They should be
remain away from work until they have been symptom free for 48 hours."
People with diarrhoea or vomiting should not visit patients in hospital or
rest homes.

[These 3 incidents illustrate 2 contrasting modes of spread of viral
gastroenteritis caused almost certainly by norovirus infection: the former
a localized outbreak with presumptive food-borne transmission, and the
latter 2 a regional outbreak, and a community and hospital based outbreak
with person-to-person transmission, probably fomite-enhanced in
institutional settings. - Mods.MPP/CP]
