An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been reported in Elgeyo Marakwet county. The outbreak has affected more than 100 livestock. A total of 2 animals have reportedly died.

Speaking to the press on Wednesday [8 Jan 2014] at his office, County Director of veterinary services Dr Stephen Chumba said several animal selling yards have been closed.

"We, as the ministry of livestock, have been forced to shut down several livestock yards in Kapchemutwa division to prevent people from buying sick animals," Chumba said. He said the ministry is planning to vaccinate all livestock in Kapchemutwa division and Sergoit location.

Residents have been warned against drinking milk and eating meat. They have also been urged to isolate the sick animals from the healthy ones to avoid spread of the disease. Chumba said the disease was last month [December 2013] reported in parts of Uasin Gishu county.

[Elgeyo Marakwet county, one of the 47 counties of Kenya, is located in the former Rift Valley province; see map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elgeyo-Marakwet_location_map.png. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/9LCc.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Kenya; the circulating serotypes are A, O and SAT 2. The disease is also endemic in the neighboring countries.

It may be assumed that the sale of meat and milk from affected farms has been based upon animal health considerations, to prevent the spread of disease to other farms. The virus is generally not considered harmful for humans; human (mild, local, dermal) infections are very rare and mostly restricted to laboratory personnel.

Separation of diseased animals from other susceptible animals is not likely to prevent the spread of the extremely contagious FMD virus to other animals in the vicinity; timely application of an efficacious, trivalent vaccine is the recommended measure in an endemic situation. - Mod.AS]
