Source: The following information was extracted from GIDEON software:

- O'nyong nyong [fever is caused by an RNA virus (Togaviridae -
alphavirus) transmitted by mosquitos (Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae).
The reservoir is unknown [probably man - Mod.JW. Following an incubation
period of three to twelve days, the patient experiences myalgia and severe
arthralgia; a maculopapular rash (often pruritic); leukopenia;
conjunctivitis; and cervical lymphadenopathy. Although fever resolves
within seven days, arthralgia may persist.
- 'O'nyong nyong' means 'weakening of the joints' in the Acholi dialect.
The virus was first isolated during an epidemic in Acholi, Uganda. Several
million subsequent cases were reported in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi
and Mozambique during 1959 to
1961. [It then spread west clear across the malaria belt of Africa to
Senegal - Mod.JW
- The virus was not subsequently isolated until 1978. [Reference please -
Mod.JW
A rural epidemic due to the related Igbo Ora virus was reported from the
Ivory Coast during 1984 to 1985.
An outbreak beginning in June 1996 involved southwest Uganda (Mbarara,
Masaka and
Rakai districts), spreading to northern Tanzania (Bukuba District)[when I
was there it was called "Bukoba," after the port on the northwest shore of
Lake Victoria, notorious as an early focus of HIV. This is the outbreak
being reported currently on ProMED-mail - Mod.JW
