Rabbit fever on Martha's Vineyard
----------------------
Health officials suspect they have identified 2 cases of tularemia,
or rabbit fever, on Martha's Vineyard, an island off of the
Massachusetts coast.
It would be the third consecutive year that the bacterial disease,
which can be fatal if not caught early, has appeared on the island.
The 2 men being treated for the disease, age 22 and 35, are both
landscapers.

[Tularemia, a bacterial infection due to _Francisella tularensis_,
has become more noteworthy due to its inclusion in the list of highly
significant potential biowarfare pathogens. In that scenario, it
would present as a respiratory infection, either tularemia pneumonia
or oropharyngeal infection. Usually, natural infection presents as
an ulceroglandular form with prominent lymph node infection.
However, many earlier Martha's Vineyard cases were pneumonic (e.g. 11
of 15 cases in 2000) and appear related to gardening activities.
Sometimes called rabbit fever, and often related to exposure from
hunting and/or skinning wild rabbits, infection can also spread by
tick or deer fly vectors. Originally described by Francis in Tulare
County, California, USA, the infection is found in rural areas of
many Midwest and western USA states and in parts of Europe. More
suburban locales can harbor the bacillus, as is demonstrated by this
persistent focus on Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of
Massachusetts. Infections are usually described in those with
significant high tick-risk behaviors. Urban tularemia can occur,
however, as demonstrated by a fatal case of tularemia pneumonia seen
in Brooklyn, New York several years ago thought to have been acquired
in a neighborhood park. - Mod.LL]
