A low-pathogenic strain of the H5N1 avian influenza virus has been
discovered in wild migratory birds in the central province of
Manitoba, Canadian officials announced over the weekend [19-20 Nov
2005].
The virus was *not* the same strain that killed more than 60 people and
prompted the culling of millions of birds in Asia since 2003, said
Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
"Canadians can rest assured that we have not detected the Asian
strain of avian influenza of animal or human health concern," Evans
said. "The strain detected in Manitoba is completely distinct from
the strain currently present in Asia."
"None of these results, based on our assessment to date, are of
significant animal or human health concern," he said.
Tests revealed low pathogenic strains of H5N9 in 2 birds and H5N2 in
5 birds in the western province of British Columbia, H5N1 in 2 birds
from the central province of Manitoba and H5N3 in 2 birds from the
eastern Quebec province, officials said.
All of the viruses analyzed were "low pathogenic types," "very mild"
and "non-virulent" and would produce "only mild disease if any at all
if introduced into domestic birds," Evans said.
A lethal subtype of H5, H5N1, is blamed for the deaths of 67 people
in Asia since late 2003.
The samples were gathered by the Canadian Wildlife Services as part
of a cross-country testing of viruses carried by wild waterfowl,
coordinated through the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre.
The samples were taken from migratory birds, mostly mallards [ducks], in 7
provinces and sent to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases in
Winnipeg for testing.
Evans said Canadian public health and food inspection agencies would
expand their survey of wild birds, implement national testing of
domestic birds at slaughter facilities, and remind bird owners to
follow strict bio-security measures to restrict exposure of their
flocks to wild birds.
These results should not prompt other countries to restrict the
import of Canadian fowl or eggs, Evans added.
On Friday [18 Nov 2005], Canadian officials announced the discovery
of the H5 avian influenza virus in a single [domestic] duck from a
farm in British Columbia.
Officials said there was no risk to human health and the duck showed
no signs, but Canadian Food Inspection Agency personnel quarantined
the farm as a precaution.
In 2004, an outbreak of the H7 strain of bird flu hit the area, about
an hour east of Vancouver, forcing the culling of millions of
domestic birds.
Officials speculated that the duck may have contracted the disease
from migratory birds.

Canada duck has non-lethal avian virus: cull proceeds
-----------------------------------------------------
Tests have confirmed a farm duck in British Columbia has a
non-lethal, North American strain of avian influenza, but health
officials will still cull about 60 000 poultry as a preventive
measure, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said on Sunday
[20 Nov 2005].
Health officials around the world have been on the watch for the
Asian strain of the H5N1 virus that experts fear may mutate so it is
easily transmitted among humans and possibly cause a pandemic. There
are 9 known N strains of the H5 virus.
Initial tests last week found an H5-type strain in the duck during
routine tests. Health officials immediately quarantined the farm,
located in the Fraser Valley, east of Vancouver.
"This morning, test results ... confirmed that the H5 virus found in
a domestic duck in British Columbia is the low pathogenic, North
American strain," Cornelius Kiley, a CFIA veterinarian, said in a
briefing on Sunday [20 Nov 2005]. "This confirmation means that we
are looking at a virus capable of causing only mild disease, if any
at all. It also means that we are not dealing with the virus current
in Asia and Europe," Kiley added. "This particular subtype is unique
to this part of the world, and we have previously seen it throughout
North America."
Kiley said that while there is no immediate risk to domestic birds,
the agency will proceed with a cull of about 60 000 ducks and geese
on the infected duck's farm. In addition, the CFIA has also
quarantined 4 other "high risk" farms and expects test results within
days, he said.
The commercial farm where the latest case of bird flu was found also
faced a cull in 2004.
An outbreak of an H7 type of bird flu in the Fraser Valley last year
[2004] spread quickly among farms and eventually caused officials to
cull 16 million poultry in the area.
On Saturday [19 Nov 2005], the CFIA said it had detected the H5N1
virus in 2 wild ducks in Manitoba, but it was not the same deadly
strain affecting Asia.
The study also detected versions of the H5N3 virus in Quebec birds
and the H5N9 and H5N2 strains in British Columbia birds. None is seen
as a public health threat.
