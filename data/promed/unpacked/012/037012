MOSQUITO TRANSPORT IN GOODS SHIPMENTS

Recently, our personnel intercepted a shipping container from China with a
large number of live adult mosquitoes. The species was thought to be _Aedes
aegypti_, though I am still waiting for confirmation.
Regardless of the identification, this incident illustrates an important
point. The container held plastic goods that had obviously been left outside
and had enough collected water to provide oviposition sites. Shipment over 7
to 10 days placed the container in a new area just before (and during) adult
emergence.
There are [several] scenarios where equipment, product, or raw materials are
stored outside before shipment. [This] usually occurs when the goods can
be subject to weather with little damage (or degradation), when there is no
interior storage, and/or when the value of the goods falls below the
economic justification for warehousing.
The ability to protect goods from the weather also depends on economic
factors during operation of a production plant. During economically slow
times, there may be an accumulation of goods from overproduction and order
cancellation; overproduction may also occur during economically good times,
before the logistics change to compensate for increased production.
Additionally, old production equipment may be stored outside before it is
re-sold.
Many of the recent ProMED discussions mentioned birds as responsible for
east-to-west movement of WNV, but I think that containers and trailers may
play a far more important role. Container movement of oviposition sites has
the potential to translocate not just one or 2 adults, but hundreds to
thousands of mosquitoes. If you consider the potential, with a daily
movement of 3000 or more 20-foot-equivalent containers through any one of 5
or more major ports, the potential for mosquito movement is impressive, both
between and within countries.
When goods are placed in an area where suitable oviposition sites can form,
and if the geographic area and season are conducive to container breeding
vectors, I suspect there is potential for multiple-foci establishment of
mosquitoes in new geographic areas. Once in the new area, the local climate
and the number and quality of new hosts and oviposition sites would affect
this establishment. Apart from mosquito movement, I think container shipment
is an important factor when we consider any disease with the potential to
vertically transmit to the progeny from the parent vector.

[Many thanks to Dr. Kells for this perspective on mosquitoes in shipping
containers containing water. Used automobile tires, usually stored in the
open, have long been known to transport _Aedes aegypti_ & _Ae. albopictus_
when moved. Containers brought vector mosquitoes from East Timor to
Australia during a dengue outbreak in 2000. The origin of the aberrant case
of West Nile virus in California, in the absence of any evidence of bird or
horse infection, could well have been infected mosquitoes escaping from a
container coming from east of the Rocky Mountains, as previously suggested
by Mod.MHJ. - Mod.JW]
