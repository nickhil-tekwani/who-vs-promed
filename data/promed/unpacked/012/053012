New anthrax risk
----------------
DPI [Victoria Department of Primary Industries] is urging extra
vigilance by farmers after the 2nd anthrax case in a week ended up at
a Stanhope knackery before it was diagnosed. DPI is concerned further
properties could be at risk and people could also be at risk if
infected carcases are moved.

DPI supervised the destruction of 7 carcases at the Stanhope knackery
on Friday [4 Sep 2009] that had been in contact with the dairy cow
that had been unwittingly brought in for processing. A new
high-temperature incinerator, 1st trialled last year [2008], was used
to burn the carcases.

The department is emphasising the importance of reporting sudden
deaths either to a private vet or DPI. Producers who report suspected
anthrax cases to DPI or a veterinarian and request an anthrax test on
a carcase that has not been moved, will receive 1000 CAD [927 USD] if
anthrax is confirmed. DPI will also pay for vaccination costs on
affected and neighbouring properties. Vaccination subsidies are
available for non-neighbouring farmers.

DPI acting senior veterinary officer David Champness said in the
latest case, a dairy cow, died on a property without any anthrax
history in the Tatura-Stanhope area after being moved about 8 days
earlier from a farm that was previously affected by anthrax. Dr
Champness said anthrax had an incubation period of between 4 and 10
days. Cattle on both properties and neighbouring properties have been
vaccinated.

DPI is in the process of vaccinating all properties connected with
the 2007 anthrax outbreak [which killed about 20 cattle across 10 properties.]

The 1st case was reported on Monday last week [31 Aug 2009] and state
veterinary laboratories confirmed the diagnosis on Tuesday morning [1
Sep 2009]. The carcase was burned on Tuesday and other cattle
vaccinated the same day. DPI vet John Ryan said the property had
previous cases of anthrax and the yearling heifer had been vaccinated
last year, but vaccination was not a 100 per cent guarantee of
immunity. "The vaccination may not have been taken properly or there
was so much infection that it overwhelmed the animal's immune
response," Dr Ryan said. He said the area had a history of anthrax
cases and occasional anthrax cases were expected. "The anthrax
bacterium is known to naturally occur in the soil in parts of
northern Victoria."

Asked about the case being so close to winter, Dr Ryan said it had
occurred before and urged farmers to be vigilant and report any
unexplained or sudden deaths to the DPI or their vet. Humans are
rarely infected but in February 2007 a Stanhope knackery worker was
hospitalised after handling an infected carcase and later recovered.

Countrywide Pet Foods managing director Michael Scales said the
carcass in the latest incident had not been processed and the company
was following its own procedures and DPI and Department of Health
protocols. "We've given them all the details and we are following a
series of instructions," he said.

[It is not clear if this 2nd case, which ProMED reported earlier
[Anthrax, bovine - Australia (02): (VI) 20090907.3151], had come
from the same farm as the index case or had been moved from another
farm involved in the 2007 epidemic. The report can be interpreted
either way but I would suspect the latter as why else would they be
specifically mentioning the 2007 series of outbreaks, and normally
stock cannot be moved off a quarantined farm until 14-21 days after
vaccination [conditions vary].

The DPI has a wise policy of diagnostic and vaccination
subsidization. The Canadians have a similar policy and over the years
it has served them well. However latterly they have begun to
seriously consider limiting their 500 CAD [463 USD] payment to farms
which had vaccinated their stock prior to the diagnosis; i.e., during
the spring working. This is because they are finding that the
ranchers on the Canadian prairies are getting slack in preventative
vaccination and depending on the government for retroactive
vaccination after an outbreak has been diagnosed.

And the herds in and about the 2007 epidemic should have been
vaccinated this year anyway because of the ongoing risk. 3 to 5 years
of routine vaccination after an outbreak should be the minimum
considered by the veterinary authorities.
