Officials at the Health Unit and Bethammi Nursing Home, located at 63 Carrie Street, have declared an outbreak of a respiratory illness (non-COVID-19) affecting the 3rd floor only.

The Health Unit is urging people to stay at home and refrain from visiting hospitals and long-term care facilities when feeling unwell to avoid spreading infections to those most vulnerable: young infants and children, the elderly and those with other chronic illnesses.

The Health Unit reminds the public that they can prevent getting and spreading infections by:
- Keeping up to date with influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations.
- Washing hands often, for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water, or by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Covering coughs/sneezes with the upper sleeve if no tissue is available.
- Staying at home when sick to avoid spreading infections to others.

[Bethammi Nursing Home is a 112-bed long-term and palliative care facility that provides a variety of rehabilitation, mental health, addiction, and long-term care services for individuals 18 years and older in the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada (https://www.northwesthealthline.ca/displayservice.aspx?id=140962).

The above news article reports an outbreak of a respiratory illness that has affected an unknown number of individuals, housed on the 3rd floor of the Bethammi Nursing Home. We have not been told descriptions of the affected individuals, the acuity of the illnesses, patients' symptoms, physical, laboratory or radiologic findings, or the time course over which the outbreak occurred. Other than not being caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), the specific cause of the outbreak has not as yet been identified.

Nursing homes provide an ideal environment for spread of contagious pathogens because the residents are usually elderly and debilitated, at greater risk for respiratory infections and their complications; they share sources of air, food, water, and healthcare in an often crowded institutional setting, with some residents, visitors and staff potentially bringing in pathogens from both hospitals and the community (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/36/7/870/318878). Outbreaks of respiratory illnesses could be due various pathogens, such as influenza (https://bit.ly/37ocgai), respiratory syncytial virus (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19187415/), _Legionella_ (https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/legionnaires-case-being-investigated-at-quincy-veterans-home/2401692/), pneumococci (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199806253382601), or even _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.

In February 2021, a COVID-19 outbreak was declared at Bethammi Nursing Home, 3rd floor, when one staff member was confirmed to have COVID-19 (https://www.tbdhu.com/news/covid-19-outbreak-declared-bethammi-nursing-home-3rd-floor) and again in December 2021, with 3 individuals with COVID-19 (https://sjcg.net/aboutus/news-media/headlines/2021/2021-12-23_COVID-19-Outbreak-Declared-at-SJHOSP-5-North.aspx).

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The city of Thunder Bay (pop., 108 843 in 2021) is located on the shore of Lake Superior and is the largest city in Northwestern Ontario; its port forms an important link in the shipping of grain and other products from western Canada through the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to the east coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay).
