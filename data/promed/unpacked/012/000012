A resident of Bariloche, currently a patient in the Zonal Hospital, is progressing favorably after having contracted [a] hantavirus [infection].

This case was officially confirmed by the hospital director, who said that the patient was treated preventively before the symptoms of the disease occurred and, therefore, the advance of the virus was halted.

[Although the virus involved in this case is not specified, it is likely to be Andes hantavirus. Presumably, the supportive treatment is credited for preventing the development of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is common with Andes virus infections.

"Hantavirus infections [produce] a disease seldom present [in this area]. We do not have many cases each year in Rosario. Anyway, if there are cases, this is the 1st [this year, 2012?]. But in this situation, we are not in an outbreak status. This [current situation] is what is expected for this time of year in the city and in the region." With these words, the Director of Information of the Rosario Secretariat of Health, Analia Chumpitaz, attempted to bring calm to the populace after recognizing a fatal case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in an area southwest of Rosario.

The official stated that today [24 May 2012], they are carrying out awareness and preventive activities in the school where the 15-year-old boy who died of this disease [was a student].

Chumpitaz stated that, in relation to prevention and the presence of trash dumps, the disease [virus] is transmitted by rodents. "These are not those [rodents] that we find in the city. It is a long-tailed rat that occurs mostly on the island. However, all rodents can transmit many diseases, and in this situation, the trash dump is not directly [involved]. The hantavirus infection is acquired through respiration of particles of feces or urine. In general, this situation is produced when one sweeps out a place where there are [rodent] feces and urine. In any event, trash dumps generate a proliferation of rodents that produce many diseases," stated the official.

[Although the virus involved in this case is not specified, cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2011) and this year. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified.

As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case, or which rodent species were implicated as reservoirs.
