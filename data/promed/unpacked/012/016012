A mystery illness, possibly a bacteria, lurking in lunch and dinner buffets
made 71 guests and eight employees of Embassy Suites Denver Tech Center
sick last week. The sick people suffered nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for
about 24 hours from what health officials suspect is some kind of
food-borne illness. After several days of tests, they still don't know just
what the pathogen is.
Initial tests conducted by the state public health department have told
health officials that [the illness] is not _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, or
_Shigella_. The fact that the bacterium haven't been identified "means it
could be a virus, which takes much more time and is much more difficult to
isolate, or could be a less common bacterium," said Chris Wiant, executive
director of Tri-County Health Department, which serves Adams, Arapahoe and
Douglas counties.
"It's not at all unusual" to be unable to identify the specific bacterium,
Wiant said. "In about 95 percent of cases of suspected food-borne illness,
we never isolate the specific bacterium or virus that causes it."
But in this case, health officials were hopeful initially because a lot of
people got sick, they got sick right away, and the hotel notified the
health department immediately. That meant samples for testing could be
collected from the sick people at the height of their illness, Wiant said.
"It's a sizable outbreak and it's unusual because we're not finding the
obvious link," Wiant said. But Tri-County Health Department officials
continue sleuthing. They have interviewed 124 people so far, which they
believe is the total number who ate at the buffets. All who got sick have
recovered, Wiant said.
