The Sanitary-Epidemiological Service (SES)has registered 1952 cases of suspected measles cases in Ukraine between 1 and 25 Jan 2012. Between 24 and 25 Jan 2012 a total of 154 cases were identified. In particular, in the Lviv region between 1 and 25 Jan 2012 a total of 967 cases of suspected measles virus infection have been recorded with 64 cases reported between 24 and 25 January. The corresponding figures for Ivano-Frankivsk are534 (42), for Rivne - 124 (14), for Carpathian - 103 (12 ), for Ternopil - 54 (7), and for Volyn - 40 (3). In Kiev, between 1 and 25 Jan 2012 there were 12 cases, including one case between 24 and 25 Jan 2012.

In other administrative territories of Ukraine only sporadic cases of suspected measles (totalling 118) have been registered since the beginning of 2012. Between 1 and 16 Jan 2012 the SES has registered 983 cases of suspected measles cases in Ukraine. By contrast during the whole of 2011 throughout the whole of Ukraine only 1513 suspected cases of measles were registered. In the Lviv region in mid-December 2011 a single measles fatality was recorded, the first in the region during the past 5 years. The current outbreak is being attributed to to the significantly increased measles morbidity throughout Europe in general.

Health Officials Investigate Measles Outbreak In Finney County
----------------------------------------------------
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), along with the Finney County Health Department, have confirmed six cases to date, [in Garden City], up from four cases this weekend. KDHE said the outbreak began in early January after two people living in the same household [in Garden City] were diagnosed with the virus [infection]. Secondary cases are now appearing outside the initial family, officials said.

KDHE urges people who are ill or exhibiting measles-like symptoms to stay at home, unless they are seeking medical attention. â€œIn some cases, measles can result in secondary illnesses, such as bronchitis, pneumonia and encephalitis," said Robert Moser, M.D., KDHE Secretary and State Health Officer.

Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus. It causes fever, runny nose, tiredness, cough and a blotchy rash all over the body. Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. It is so contagious that any person who is exposed to it and is not immune will probably get the disease. Measles can be spread to others from four days before to four days after the rash appears. An average incubation period lasts from 10 to 14 days.

Children receive two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The first dose is administered at 12 to 15 months, the second between 4 to 6-years-old. KDHE is not recommending any changes to the routine schedule at this time.
