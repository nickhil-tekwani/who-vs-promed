The spread of bird flu has accelerated in the past weeks in France, the European Union's 2nd largest poultry producer, the farm ministry said on Wednesday [21 Dec 2022], raising concern of further shortages.

France had already detected a rise in bird flu outbreaks over the summer [2022] after seeing its worst wave of the disease last season that led to the culling of about 20 million chickens, ducks and turkeys and a sharp fall in poultry and foie gras output.

"The health situation with regard to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in France has deteriorated since August [2022] and has worsened in recent weeks," the farm ministry said on its website on Wednesday [21 Dec 2022].

By 20 Dec 2022, 217 bird flu outbreaks had been detected on French farms, up from 100 on 2 Dec 2022, and the number of cases has also risen sharply in wildlife, the ministry said.

French Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau is due to travel to the region on Thursday [22 Dec 2022] to put forward a vaccination strategy to fight the disease.

More than half of the outbreaks on farms are concentrated in the Pays de la Loire region with a high density of poultry.

France has been testing vaccines in web-footed birds such as ducks and geese. It hopes to convince other EU member states to have a common approach as poultry producers fear trade restrictions often imposed on meat from vaccinated animals.

Bird flu has been spreading globally, ravaging flocks, with the toll at more than 100 million birds in Europe and the United States alone.

[WOAH's most recent HPAI situation report, covering the 3-week period 11 Nov to 1 Dec 2022, includes 'Figure 1' which presents the seasonal trend in global HPAI incidence in poultry. Based on data reported to WOAH, between 2005 and 2019, from 76 affected countries and territories, the spread is lowest in September, begins to rise in October, and peaks in February.

The curve in Figure 1 shows the curve of global seasonal pattern of HPAI in poultry; the red rectangle indicates the 3-week period covered in the current situation report. Considering the updated figures presented in the media report above, an increased number of outbreaks from 100 on 2 Dec to 217 on the 20th, the curve may present a steep sequel.

In reference to the use of HPAI vaccine in France, please refer to 20220531.8703589 and 20211117.8699732. - Mod.AS]

Avian influenza of the H5N1 strain has been discovered in a coop at a broiler farm, near Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon in the Emek Hefer Regional Council. In the poultry complex where the virus was detected, there are 4 buildings containing approximately 128 000 poultry.

The veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture handled the destruction and burial of the birds and continues to carry out active monitoring of all the poultry farms in the area. All the chicken coops within a range of up to 10 km [6.2 mi] from the new focus are under quarantine.

The Ministry of Agriculture operates in accordance with the established work procedures in order to prevent the spread of the disease. The Ministry of Health and the Nature and Parks Authority have been updated on the issue and the Ministry of Agriculture is in contact with them regarding increased vigilance for the transmission of the disease by wild birds.

The Ministry of Agriculture emphasizes that one can continue to consume chicken meat and eggs, but must make sure to purchase eggs only at organized sales and marketing points. The eggs must be marked and packed in cardboard or plastic on all sides. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture emphasizes that eggs and chicken meat should be consumed only after they have been cooked, baked or fried well.

Also, the Ministry of Agriculture calls on the breeders of ornamental birds and backyard poultry as well as free-range chickens, to keep the birds inside buildings, and to prevent them from wandering in the open, thereby reducing the risk of infection from wild birds.

This is the 5th case of bird flu detected in a farm since the beginning of the migration season. The Ministry of Agriculture has completed the treatment of the foci of the disease that were discovered last month [November 2022] in Kibbutz Shlouchot, Moshav Beit-Herut, Moshav Beit Halevi and Moshav Kfar Monash. Three of the previous 4 outreaks were located in Emek Hefer and its surroundings, near water reservoirs and fish ponds that attract thousands of wild birds during the migration season.

[3] Hungary: poultry (turkeys)

Hungary has reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus at a turkey farm, the National Food Chain Safety Office (Nebih) said on Tuesday [20 Dec 2022].

Authorities said that they have begun the slaughter of more than 25 000 turkeys on the farm where the virus was detected. The outbreak was reported in the county of Hajdu-Bihar.

Last month [November 2022] Nebih reported H5N1 outbreaks at 3 farms in Bacs-Kiskun and Bekes counties.

[EC map presenting HPAI detections during the period 1 Oct 2022 to 16 Dec 2022 in EC member countries is available at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-12/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2022-23_map_1.pdf.

Since 16 Dec 2022, 3 new immediate notifications have been reported to WOAH; from Hungary, Spain and Denmark. It remains to be seen if the extent of the 2022/2023 season will match last season's (2021/22) dimensions, briefly presented in the following EFSA report.

EFSA has published its 4th quarterly report on Avian influenza for 2022 on 20 Dec 2022 (approved 15 Dec 2022). The abstract follows:

"Between October 2021 and September 2022, Europe has suffered the most devastating highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic with a total of 2520 outbreaks in poultry, 227 outbreaks in captive birds, and 3867 HPAI virus detections in wild birds. The unprecedent geographical extent (37 European countries affected) resulted in 50 million birds culled in affected establishments.

"In the current reporting period, between 10 Sep and 2 Dec 2022, 1163 HPAI virus detections were reported in 27 European countries in poultry (398), captive (151) and wild birds (613). A decrease in HPAI virus detections in colony-breeding seabird species and an increase in the number of detections in waterfowl has been observed. The continuous circulation of the virus in the wild reservoir has led to the frequent introduction of the virus into poultry populations. It is suspected that waterfowl might be more involved than seabirds in the incursion of HPAI virus into poultry establishments. In the coming months, the increasing infection pressure on poultry establishments might increase the risk of incursions in poultry, with potential further spread, primarily in areas with high poultry densities. The viruses detected since September 2022 (clade 2.3.4.4b) belong to 11 genotypes, 3 of which have circulated in Europe during the summer months, while 8 represent new genotypes. HPAI viruses were also detected in wild and farmed mammal species in Europe and North America, showing genetic markers of adaptation to replication in mammals".

Since the last report, 2 A(H5N1) detections in humans in Spain, one A(H5N1), one A(H5N6) and one A(H9N2) human infection in China as well as one A(H5) infection without NA-type result in Vietnam were reported, respectively. The risk of infection is assessed as low for the general population in the EU/EEA, and low to medium for occupationally exposed people. - Mod.AS
