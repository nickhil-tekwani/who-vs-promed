----------------------------------------------------------------------
As noted by ProMED, deaths are relatively rare in _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. In fact, the outbreak in Nigeria is more suggestive of enteritis necroticans (pigbel).

Enteritis necroticans was initially described in northern Germany (Darmbrand) [Darmbrand means burnt bowels - Mod.LL] and Denmark following World War II. Initially, most patients had eaten a large meal following prolonged starvation. In 1961, the disease was first reported in Papua New Guinea in association with large pork feasts -- the condition known as "pigbel" in a local dialect. During 1985 to 1986, an outbreak (62 cases, 34 fatal) of enteritis necroticans was reported among Khmer children on the Thailand-Kampuchea [present-day Cambodia] border, and sporadic cases have been reported in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the United States.

Most cases of necrotizing enterocolitis due to the beta toxin of _Clostridium perfringens_ type C have been reported in Papua New Guinea. Ingestion of yams with contaminated meat may result in inhibition of intestinal enzymes, which normally destroy the clostridial toxin. Coexisting intestinal parasites may also contribute to the severity of disease.

This condition is characterized by abdominal distention, pain, and hypotension. Dilated, thickened loops of bowel exhibiting segmental necrosis are found at laparotomy. Published case-fatality rates vary from 12 percent (treated) to 58 percent.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for pointing out that the entity here may well be the infamous pigbel. Necrotic enteritis (pigbel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis (pigbel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

The following is a paper regarding a case of pigbel:
Gui L, Subramony C, Fratkin J, Hughson MD: Fatal enteritis necroticans (pigbel) in a diabetic adult. Mod Pathol. 2002; 15(1): 66-70; http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v15/n1/full/3880491a.html

Abstract
--------
Enteritis necroticans is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, type C. The disease occurs sporadically in parts of Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific, where it primarily affects children with severe protein malnutrition. The disease is extremely rare in developed countries, where it has been seen primarily in diabetics. 2 cases have previously been reported in the United States, one in a child with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. A 66-year-old woman with a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus developed severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after eating a meal of turkey sausage. She died unattended at home. An autopsy showed peritonitis and segmental necrosis of the jejunum and ileum. Microscopic examination showed Gram-positive club-shaped bacilli consistent with Clostridia coating a necrotic mucosa. Products of cpa and cpb genes of _C. perfringens_, type C were identified in the necrotic jejunum by polymerase chain reaction amplification.
