In your post on HFRS in Bashkortostan, at the end you had the
following comment. The last unfortunate sentence must be an accident.

[According to Heikki Henttonen of the Vantaa Research Centre,
Finland, in 1997, "Classically, HFRS in Bashkiria has been Puumala
infection (carrier species is the bank vole, _Clethrionomys
glareolus_), and recent personal communication from Bashkiria
suggests the same." -- see ProMED archive 19971029.2206." On a fine
point of mammalogy, voles are not rodents, like rats and mice, but
are insectivores. - Mod.JW]

Voles are among the most beautiful rodents, belonging to the
subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Cricetidae. Moles are insectivores.

There is a serious error in the comments of Mod JW, saying that "fine
point of mammalogy, voles are not rodents, like rats and mice, but
are insectivores."
If that were true, then virtually all hantavirus infections in Europe
and Russia would be insectivore-borne, a curious situation for an
infection worldwide considered so far to be only rodent-borne.
Voles belong to the subfamily of _Arvicolinae, which together with
_Murinae_(Old World rats and mice) and _Sigmodontinae_ plus
_Neotominae_ (New World mice), constitute all the subfamilies of the
family of _Rodentiae_(rodents) which transmit hantaviruses to humans.
Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) is the only hantavirus so far isolated
from a non-rodent, hence its peculiar place on the genotypic tree of
hantaviruses. TPMV was isolated already in 1964 (i.e. long before all
other known hantaviruses) from a shrew _Suncus murinus_ (an
insectivore, not a rodent) near Vellore in Southern India.
Moreover, according to the latest edition of "Mammal Species of the
World" by Don E. Wilson & DeeAnn M. Reeder, the new scientific name
for _Clethrionomys glareolus_ should be from now on _Myodes
glareolus_, due to its new place in a new classification.

[It was a serious accident, for which I hang my head in shame. I was
confusing voles with shrews, not moles. See an image of the bank
vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_) at:
