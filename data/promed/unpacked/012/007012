Outbreaks of measles virus infection have been reported from 3 municipalities in the Chelyabinsk Region. The 1st measles case was reported in October 2013 in Korkino. According to Novii Regio, the Regional Epidemiology Authorities as of today [8 Nov 2013] have recorded 55 cases of measles. In Troitsk during September-October 2013, a total of 46 people became ill, including 39 children aged 7 months to 17 years. 11 of those infected had been vaccinated against measles, and 9 were diagnosed in September 2013 within 72 hours of the detection of the 1st cases.

The measles outbreak in Troitsk began among the Roma population, and now the infection has spread to other communities. In addition to the Troitsk outbreak, measles has now been recorded in Korkino. In October 2013, 4 people, 3 of them were Roma children, became infected. The youngest patient was one month old at the time of diagnosis. In Chelyabinsk [city], 3 children who came with their parents from Kyrgyzstan fell ill with measles. Then, 3 of their relatives (a woman and her 3 children) and some health-care workers became ill. The children had not been vaccinated. According to epidemiologists, one in 4 measles patients is more severely infected than the others. 14 people have been hospitalised in the infectious department. In 4 of the children, measles was complicated by pneumonia.

Currently, medical surveillance is in progress to identify contacts and to vaccinate those not already vaccinated. So far, 640 children and 1000 adults have been vaccinated. However, not all those in contact with the patients have agreed to be vaccinated.

The last outbreak of measles in the South Urals occurred in 2006. Measles infection is dangerous because of its complications, which include severe pneumonia, otitis media [middle ear infection], meningitis, and encephalitis. Measles remains a major cause of death among young children worldwide. It is estimated that in 2011, measles killed 158 000 people, most of them children under the age of 5 years. Immunization against measles is the only effective defense against the infection. In the Chelyabinsk region, over 2400 children aged 2 to 17 years old have not been vaccinated against measles, mainly due to the intransigence of their parents, and 6500 adults aged up to 35 years have still to be vaccinated according to the national schedule.

[As elsewhere in Russia, recent outbreaks of measles, mainly in border areas, are being attributed to migration of unvaccinated communities into these regions of Russia. Previously, Russia has had a good record in containment of measles virus infection.

Physicians, nurses, surgical staff, and patients at the Alexander and Mary Hospital in Astrachan are at risk of exposure to measles virus infection. As of today [13 Nov 2013], the building housing the Regional Surgery Clinic of the Alexander and Mary Hospital has been placed under quarantine. It is expected that the quarantine will last 21 days. According to the deputy chief physician, Dmitry Zakharov, 3 doctors and 4 non-medical staff of the Regional Surgical Unit are now confined in the Infectious Diseases Hospital with suspected measles virus infection. However, none of the 7 suspected cases have yet been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis.

There are about 100 bedridden patients under treatment in the Regional Surgery Department, and there have been no new admissions since 5 Nov 2013.

A total of 64 cases of measles have been recorded in the Astrachan Oblast (Region) since the beginning of the year [2013]. Previously, the outbreaks of infection have been reported among foreign students in the Astrakhan State Medical Academy, as well as in the Volga and Volodarsky districts.

A measles epidemic in Ukraine is not imminent, according to the Director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases. "The peak of the last epidemic occurred in 2012. Now, we are seeing the so-called "tail" of the recovery. This will persist up to the end of this year [2013] and most likely into the following winter, due to the usual seasonal increased morbidity," stated aid Zadorozhnaja.

According to the specialist, measles is a cyclical disease, which means that there is a so-called epidemic phase, when the incidence increases dramatically. "The last 2 occurred in 2000-2002 and 2005-2006, and another rise began in late 2011 that has not yet ended. It peaked in 2012, when measles affected more than 12 000 people," she said.

Zadorozhnaja also noted that today the main problem in the fight against measles is the low level of immunisation. "Prior to 2005-2007, the level of coverage was more than 95 percent, and this year [2013] so far, it is about 30 percent, and in Kiev it is only a little over 50 percent. In this case, the threat of an epidemic according to experts begins when the vaccination rate falls below 90 percent.

According to the ForUm news agency, between 23 Oct and 8 Nov 2013, there was an outbreak of measles in the Tseptsevichi Sarnensky area affecting stage I-III students at a secondary school, which, as of 8 Nov 2013, had affected 53 children. All the patients had a mild form of the disease.

[The attitude of the Ukrainian Health Authorities seems rather complacent in view of the fact that uptake of vaccine in Kiev City has fallen from 95 percent to 50 percent. The reason for this decline remains unexplained. Further information would be appreciated.

Four children who visited a holiday camp in England caught measles and later caused an epidemic which infected more than 1200 people. The insight into the measles outbreak which swept across an area of Wales last winter [2012-13] is contained in a new report into the epidemic which was published yesterday [12 Nov 2013]. The report makes 13 separate recommendations which together are designed to stop the spread of the disease in future. It also reveals that the epidemic, which took 8 months to stamp out and claimed one life, consisted of 4 separate simultaneous outbreaks.

The report calls for an aggressive drive to stamp out measles in Wales and recommends launching a campaign to target still unprotected teenagers. It suggests using sexual health clinics to deliver the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to those who remain unprotected. But it warns that with more than 30 000 people aged 10 to 18 still unvaccinated, new outbreaks of the potentially deadly virus could occur.

As of Wednesday morning [14 Nov 2013], there are 28 cases of measles confirmed in the province, and Alberta Health Services (AHS) is turning its attention to 2 new communities in hopes of containing the outbreak. Vaccination clinics have been set up in 2 Hills and Lacombe for children aged 6 months to 17 years old and for those aged 4-17 who have not had a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine.

The Chief Medical Officer of AHS told Global News that the outbreak is expected to spread from the South Zone communities of Coaldale and Fort Macleod to other low immunization communities. "We know that in the south, there are a number of communities that have ties -- and they're low immunisation rates -- and they have ties with other areas of the province," explained Dr. Martin Lavoie. "Depending on how low those rates are, how close the ties are, we're expecting a spread from the south. It's just a matter of time to spread from there to those other low immunization communities."

Both post-secondary institutions in Lethbridge have confirmed they are working with AHS to inform students of the extremely contagious virus before they head home for the holidays.

Five Victorians have been diagnosed with measles after returning from Bali over the past 5 weeks, prompting warnings for people to be vaccinated before travelling to Indonesia. Victoria's acting chief health officer Michael Ackland said the 5 people diagnosed following their travels had passed on the disease to a further 3 people in Victoria. Dr Ackland said young people who had not been vaccinated were most at risk of contracting measles, as well as adults aged between 33 and 47, because many people in that age group had not been vaccinated as children. He said doctors should recommend 2 doses of measles vaccine to patients planning to travel to Bali who had not previously had measles or been vaccinated. If patients were travelling within the next month, they should have one dose before departure and a 2nd dose upon return to Australia, he said.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause serious illness including pneumonia, with people diagnosed often requiring treatment in hospital. Dr Ackland said measles usually began with common cold symptoms including fever, sore throat, red eyes and a cough. A rash usually begins 3 to 7 days after the 1st symptoms, often starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body.
