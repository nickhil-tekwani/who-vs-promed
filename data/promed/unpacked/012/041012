In Germany, grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma (EPPO A2 List) was first recorded in one grapevine plant (_Vitis vinifera_) in 2014 [ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025] and declared eradicated in 2017 (EPPO RS 2014/202, 2017/135). The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Germany informed EPPO that the pathogen was found again at the end of 2020 in one plant (_V. vinifera_) in a vineyard in Rheinland-Pfalz. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by molecular methods.

Due to the advanced age of the vines, it is excluded that the planting material could be the source of the infestation. It is assumed that the source is an _Alnus_ [alder] stand near the vineyard. The vector _Scaphoideus titanus_ is not present in Germany, but the pathogen may be transmitted from alders to grapevines by cicadas. Official eradication measures will be taken. The whole plot (1 ha, approximatively 3000 plants) will be destroyed. Intensive surveys for flavescence doree and its vectors will be conducted.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the United States, the home of its primary vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. Until recently, the only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced, and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in the mid 1990s. The 1st report of FD from Germany in 2014 was suspected to have been due to a quarantine incursion from infected Italian rootstocks (ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025) and was the 1st report of FD north of the Alps. FD has since then also been detected north of the Alps in Switzerland (ProMED-mail post 20190107.6246980) and Austria, where it was also detected in ornamental _Clematis_ species (see link below). The _S. titanus_ vector has been reported in Madeira (see links below) and Russia (ProMED-mail post 20200909.7763574), but so far not the phytoplasma. The spread of FD in central Europe is considered another example of "warm climate diseases" moving into cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).

"Eradication" of pathogens or diseases, particularly once they are established in the field (as had been claimed in Germany for FD above), has hardly ever been successful in the past and should never be relied on as a tool for disease management. Furthermore, proof of absence of a pathogen is principally and practically impossible, because it would require that each and every known or potential host, symptomatic or not, as well as all known and potential vectors or pathogen reservoirs are tested with a method that has a 100% rate of reliability.
