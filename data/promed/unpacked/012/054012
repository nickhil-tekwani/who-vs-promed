Concern over apparent increase in incidence of new cases of nvCJD
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Deaths from the human form of "mad cow" disease have increased by about 33
percent each year in Britain since 1994, new research has found. According
to the study, published this week in The Lancet , the incidence of [new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or nvCJD, has risen by an average of 23
percent every year. Scientists believe people contract [nvCJD by eating
beef [from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE,
but the fatal brain-wasting disease can be confirmed only by examining the
brain after the victim has died. As of 30 Jun 2000, a total of 75 confirmed
or suspected cases [of nvCJD have been documented. 69 of those people have
died. The research, conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine and the National CJD Surveillance Unit, said 14 people already
have died from the disease in the first 6 months of this year, compared
with 18 deaths for the whole of 1998. "Although absolute numbers remain
low, there appears to be a real increase in the incidence ... in the U.K.,
which is a cause for concern," said Dr. Hester Ward of the surveillance
unit, based in Edinburgh, Scotland. "Until it is known whether this
increasing trend is maintained over time, it is difficult to predict future
numbers of cases," she said.
The incubation period is unknown, but one victim became a vegetarian 20
years before dying of the disease, which means the infection could lie
dormant for decades, scientists say. The uncertainty has made it difficult
for scientists to assess the scale of the problem and when it might peak.
The disease first surfaced in the mid-1990s, a decade after a vet
discovered Britain's first BSE-infected cattle herd. Since the onset of the
British outbreak, which affected some 180,000 cattle, about 200 cases [of
BSE have been [reported from Portugal and smaller numbers [from Ireland,
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and Switzerland. A
European Union report concluded Tuesday that cases of "mad cow" disease
[BSE are unlikely to occur in the United States and Canada, but cannot be
ruled out.
Last month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ordered the slaughter
of 376 sheep originating from Belgium on suspicion they may have a "mad
cow"-type disease.
