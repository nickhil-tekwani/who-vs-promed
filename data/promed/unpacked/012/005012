A Canadian friend from school informed me that this is not unusual. It is a
result of the change in food handling practices, using plastic air-tight
containers to store the whale or seal meat and blubber which is considered
a delicacy by native people in parts of the Far North. In the old days, the
meat and blubber was stored in an underground "safe", covered with skins
and dirt which allowed some air to penetrate. The recent trend is to store
it in plastic containers indoors, which provide a perfect environment for
botulism toxins.
[The incorporation of new technologies in food handling is one the reasons
why new forms of disease emerge. While the planned application of new
technologies may actually INCREASE food safety, ad hoc changes in the way
food is handled (as occurred in this case) can be dangerous. - Mod. pc
