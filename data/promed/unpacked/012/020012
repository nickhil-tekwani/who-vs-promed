In a proposal intended to curb tuberculosis [TB, _Mycobacterium bovis_
sweeping through cattle in the West County and the Midlands, producers have
told ministers that it might be better to abandon areas of farm land to
badgers instead of provoking protests by killing the badgers. In return,
farmers expect compensation from the government for loss of income, says
the National Farmers' Union.
Brian Jennings, Chairman of the NFU's Animal Health & Welfare Committee,
said: "The idea would be to create a kind of disease control set-aside
[area where cattle would be removed from 'high risk' zones containing
large populations of badgers. I already have a couple of areas in mind
where the idea could be tried out."
Parts of Devon, Cornwall, Herefordshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire and
Gloucestershire are the most likely candidates for these areas that may be
"off-limits" to cattle. TB cases in dairy cattle soared from 500 to 5,000
in the 4 years. Likewise, the number of badgers found to be carrying TB has
increased by 240 percent over the past 4 years. Although badgers are blamed
for carrying the infection the government has refused to sanction an
intensive culling program of the badgers to help eliminate TB in cattle. It
is relying instead on a series of limited trial culls to assess their
impact.
The first of these culling trials was completed in Devon before Christmas
when more than 250 badgers were killed. The trial provoked protests from
wildlife experts who say that culling the animals is barbaric and
ineffective.

[It seems the farmers are offering to create several areas that are
essentially a segregated "badger town" where cattle are prohibited. With
this allow TB and the badgers to be contained, thereby decreasing the
cattle TB or will it have no effect on the TB cases except to frustrate the
farmer because of less usable land. Only time will tell. - Mod.TG
