[It is not specified what tinned products led to the cases of botulism.
Often in Russia, botulism is reported with home canned vegetables and dried
or smoked fish. Toxin types A, B, and E are usually found in Russia. Such
poisoning can also take place with canned meat, cured pork, ham, and salty
bacon.
Dagestan is located in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, adjacent
to the Caspian sea. The republic borders Kalmykia in the north, the
Stavropol region, the Chechen republic and Georgia in the west, and
Azerbaijan in the south. - Mod.NP
