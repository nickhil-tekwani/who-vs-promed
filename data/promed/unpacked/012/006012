Re:
[Corridor disease should not be confused with East Coast Fever which is
caused by an infection with _T. parva parva_ which is transmitted from
cattle to cattle by the same tick. This parasite is less pathogenic to
cattle, with a lower mortality rate and recovered animals become
carriers. This disease has the additional presence of piroplasm
parasites, small cigar-shaped intra-erythocytic (inside the red blood
cells) forms together with a higher (50-75 percent) of schizonts in the
lymphoid cells, which Corridor disease does not have.
My grateful appreciation to Dr. Johann Neser, a veterinary pathologist
at Onderstepoort, South Africa, for his assistance is clarifying the
differences in these two diseases - Mod.TG
and
[According to the 1998 revision of the US Animal Health Association's
Foreign Animal Diseases manual, "some previously recognized ...
subspecies have been combined with _T. parva_ as a result of recent
studies on their DNA." Therefore there is, according to them, no
difference between East Coast fever & Corridor disease. However,
I defer to the African expert, Dr Johann Neser - Mod.JW

[In the Merck Veterinary Manual eighth edition, the following is listed:
"Although three subtypes of _Theileria parva_ are recognized on the
basis of clinical and epidemiological parameters, they are probably not
true subspecies. _T. parva parva_, transmitted mainly between cattle,
and _T. parva lawrencei_ transmitted mainly from buffalo to cattle, are
both highly pathogenic. _T. parva bovis_, transmitted between cattle,
is much less pathogenic. In some endemic areas, indigenous cattle
have a degree of resistance to the virulent subtypes. Mortality in such
stock is relatively low, but introduced cattle are particularly vulnerable
and may suffer mortality of greater than 90 per cent.

Our comment:
When one looks at the early reports of the two diseases referred to as
East Coast Fever (ECF) and Corridor Disease (CD), one should also
consider the epidemiological differences between East Africa and
southern Africa. ECF was introduced into southern Africa from
East Africa.
With regard to _T. parva bovis_ (particularly the Boleni isolate) and
perhaps true of other isolates of _T. parva bovis_ in Zimbabwe:
It has been found to be quite pathogenic under laboratory conditions
in tick naive cattle [cattle not previously exposed to ticks.
Some isolates of _T. parva parva_ (ECF) will cause the same high
mortality as _T. parva lawrencei_ (Corridor disease). Severe ECF
is characterised by the acute nature of the disease but with very
high schizont parasitosis and piroplasm parasitaemia.
With regard to the genomic differences between _T. parva lawrencei_
(the etiological agent of Corridor Disease) and _T. parva parva_
(cause of East Coast Fever), we would very much like to have
the original reference or the statement "DNA studies
show no difference between _T. parva parva_ and _T. parva
lawrencei_". A recent study carried out by Drs. Nicola Collins and
Basil Allsopp in the Molecular Biology Department of the
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa, found ribosomal
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) differences which they considered
were sufficient to justify the subspecies status of these 2 organisms.
The results are currently in press (Collins N.E. and Allsopp B.A. 1999,
_Theileria parva_ ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences
exhibit extensive polymorphism and mosaic evolution: application to
the characterization of parasites fro... [rest of title missing -
Mod.JW
It would seem to be incorrect to equate East Coast Fever with mild
Corridor Disease. These diseases differ etiologically,
epidemiologically and clinico-pathologically as I have mentioned
in my first posting Re: Corridor Disease. The clinical distinctions
are not, of themselves, sufficient to justify subspeciation, but when
taken together with the genomic information it would appear that the
subspecies distinction is valid.
Sub-species of protozoa are commonly described on the basis of
differences in host range, geographical distribution, pathological
effects and epidemiological features. For example, _Trypanosoma
brucei_ is divided into three subspecies spread across different
geographical areas, as well as across different sympatric hosts.
The situation with _T. parva_ is similar, with a continuum of types
spread across different sympatric hosts (cattle and buffalo) rather
than being geographically separated. The divergence is limited by
sexual recombination of _T. parva_ genotypes in the shared tick host,
and as a result the two gene pools are not completely separate.
Most, but not all, samples taken from the two pools are distinguishable
one from the other on the basis of their ITS sequences, which appears
to justify the subspecies designation.
