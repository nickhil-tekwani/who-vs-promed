From: Abul Kalam Azad <akazad@medinet.agni.com>

I am excited seeing how generously the international community responds to
the need of nations with problems such as epidemics, disasters, etc.
I am also excited seeing the power of the ProMED-mail mailing list and also
of the recently introduced "mignet" mailing list in accomplishing such
effective collaboration.
As a reader from Bangladesh, I noticed [the offers to help Bangladesh in
identifying the cause of above epidemic. I took it as a duty to pass the
messages of positive intentions from Keith Sabin at CDC, Atlanta and Col.
Bruce L. Innis of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington DC
to the Director, Primary Health Care of Bangladesh and I already did so.
Being in responsible positions, it is now his/their duty to explore the
possible field of collaboration.
