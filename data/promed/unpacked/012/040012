Update on Anthrax in Manitoba
-----------------------------
Since 25 Jul 2005 the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba
has identified anthrax in 4 separate cattle herds in south central Manitoba.
The herds are all within 5 km or less of each other.
The highest mortality was 10 in one herd; the remainder has had one or 2
animals to date. In all herds at least one of the mortalities was a mature
bull and in 3 herds was the 1st death noticed.

In 2000, 2001 and 2003 anthrax was diagnosed in cattle herds in southeastern
Manitoba, but this present area has not had a previous diagnosis of anthrax to
our knowledge. The source of this outbreak is unknown. This area, along with
much of Manitoba, underwent extensive flooding this spring which was followed
by hot often humid weather.
Anthrax is a federally reportable disease in Canada, and follow-up quarantine,
trace-backs, clean-up, vaccination and confirmation for indemnification are
under the authority of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

[The index outbreak suffered the highest mortality. The latter outbreaks were
called in 2-5 Aug 2005 and would seem to follow from biting flies flying out
from the index herd. In this, it echoes the recent outbreaks in SE South
Dakota where the primary outbreak involved some 155 deaths and single-digit
deaths in the secondary outbreaks.

Why bulls are so prominent is hard to determine -- Valerius de Vos of South
Africa's Kruger National Park and I have had many arguments over this over the
years, and he has not seen sexual preferences there -- but recalling the
severe loss of cattle we had a few years ago in south Louisiana from a massive
mosquito hatch that similarly picked on bulls, we came to the conclusion that
the bulls, being essentially solitary, did not have the collective benefit of
switching tails in deterring flying insects as cows do when the latter bunch
up together. Possibly the same applies here.
How and why this series of outbreaks occurred where it has is a mystery. It is
some 400 km to the west of the known enzootic area in SE Manitoba. The most
likely explanation, while we await the results of Dr. Copeland's
investigation, is to suspect an old forgotten anthrax grave on the primary
ranch. With the heavy rains, spores might have been forced to the surface,
unless the rancher had been earth moving (clearing ditches, trenching,
bulldozing, scrub clearing).

Our thanks to Shelagh for updating us on this interesting outbreak. - Mod.MHJ]
