The bird flu virus spread further Friday [8 May 2015], as Iowa officials announced that 2 more farms that hold a total of 4 million chickens tested positive for H5N2.

Since March 2015, the virus has led to the loss of well over 30 million birds in 13 states.

Iowa has 44 cases of bird flu in 12 counties. In Wright County in northern Iowa, the 2 farms saw an unusual number of chickens dying and sent samples for a preliminary test, which was positive for the H5N2 virus. If confirmed, the 4 million birds will be euthanized, and Iowa's chicken loss will approach 25 million, more than 40 percent of the state's egg-laying flock.

State officials on Friday [8 May 2015] also announced the detection of the virus on 5 more turkey farms but only provided a number for one farm, 42 000 birds. That raises the turkey losses in Iowa to more than 750 000 birds.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is responding to 7 probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry farms in Osceola and Cherokee counties. These 7 new cases would join 37 cases of the disease in Iowa that were previously announced. State officials have quarantined the premises, and once the presence of the disease is confirmed, all birds on the property will be humanely euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease.

Farms affected:
--------------
Wright 2 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 2.9 million birds that has experienced increased mortality. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Wright 3 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 1.1 million birds that has experienced increased mortality. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Buena Vista 11 - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Buena Vista 12 - Turkey farm with an estimated 42 000 birds that has experienced increased mortality. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Cherokee 5 - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Sac 3 - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

Palo Alto - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

As the Department receives final confirmations of the disease, updated information will be posted to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship's website at http://www.iowaagriculture.gov/avianinfluenza.asp.

Two new outbreaks of avian flu were confirmed officially in US poultry on 7 May 2015, with at least 4 more suspected. Portable incinerators have been authorized in Iowa to help dispose of the millions of carcasses safely, while a new study confirms what many have started to think, that the virus is spread not only by wild birds but also on the wind.

The official count of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza has increased to 135 following the confirmation of 2 new cases by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on 6 May 2015:

Iowa, O'Brian County - backyard ducks (number pending) Minnesota, Kandiyohi county - 65 000 commercial turkeys.

In both of these outbreaks, the cause has been confirmed as the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of mixed Eurasian and American origin.

The outbreaks are in the area of the Mississippi flyway for migrating birds.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported on 7 May 2015 that it is responding to 2 probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry farms:

Osceola county 3 - 100 000 layer pullets
Cherokee county 4 - turkey farm (number pending).

Both farms experienced increased mortality, and initial testing showed them positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

With avian influenza continuing to wreak havoc in northwest Iowa, poultry producers may get some help disposing of more than 20 million chickens, turkeys, and ducks infected by the deadly virus, officials told the Des Moines Register.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has issued 3 temporary permits to a Massachusetts company that would allow it to set up large portable incinerators in Sioux, Kossuth and Cherokee counties to help in the disposal of several million infected birds that have died from the disease or have been destroyed to prevent its spread.

On 7 May 2015, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced there were 2 new presumptive virus-positive flocks:

Kandiyohi county 32 - turkeys (number of birds pending)
Swift county 6 - turkeys (number pending).

A total of more than 5.59 million poultry on 84 farms in 21 counties have been affected in the state.

With no new outbreaks reported by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture on 7 May 2015, the state's total remains at 10 farms in 4 counties.

The total number of birds affected is over 1.76 million, comprising more than 1.11 million chickens and 652 000 turkeys (41 760 hatching eggs).

Researchers, led by Marcel Jonges at the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control, have modeled the spread of avian flu viruses in the wind from infected poultry farms:

Jonges M, J. van Leuken, I. Wouters, G. Koch, A. Meijer and M. Koopmans. 2015. Wind-mediated spread of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus into the environment during outbreaks at commercial poultry farms. Plos One. Published: 6 May 2015, 2015DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125401.

The following information is based on published USDA APHIS outbreak reports:

The latest cases bring the total number of confirmed high-pathogenic avian flu outbreaks since December 2014 to 135. Outbreaks have occurred in poultry in 13 states.

Three of the early outbreaks were caused by the H5N8 sub-type of the virus, but in all those since mid-February 2015, an H5N2 variant of mixed Eurasian and American origin has been confirmed.

The majority of outbreaks have been in commercial turkeys (101); 19 have been in commercial chickens, one in a mixed commercial flock, and 14 in backyard flocks.

The number of poultry affected by these outbreaks now exceeds 25.78 million. This figure includes more than 20.32 million commercial chickens and 5.38 million commercial turkeys as well as 7173 backyard poultry.

The disease has also affected 5 captive wild birds.

[There are so many infected sites and plenty of birds on those sites who deposit plenty of litter. The number of virus particles in the litter must be huge. So maybe it is carried by the wind. It would make a case for houses to be closed with HEPA-filtered air. While that would be an expensive operation for the producer, in the long run, with healthy living birds, one has to wonder whether it would be more expensive to depopulate, clean, dispose of litter, and go through the whole process of cleaning and paying for an outbreak of this type.

Overall, this has reached a nightmare state, especially for the producers. If the economic forecasters are correct, it could also be painful for the consumer. - Mod.TG
