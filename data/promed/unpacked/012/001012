New outbreak in Al-Santah
-------------------------
SUMMARY: Western general veterinary services has officially announced
about the mortalities of dozens of livestock animals in a farm
located in Al-Santah city. Samples of the animals were found foot and
mouth disease [FMD] positive in a Cairo laboratory. In addition the
veterinary services had quarantined a shipment of live camels
suspected to be infected with FMD from Sudan to Al-Shalateen city.

[As-Santa, in Egypt's Delta area, is situated in the Al Gharbiyah
governorate; see map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?name=As%20San%C5%A3ah,%20Al%20Gharb%C4%AByah,%20Egypt&g=359849&v=30.747,31.131,11http://healthmap.org/r/00uf>.

The full Arabic text further mentioned other governorates and the
possibility that available vaccines may have failed protecting the
affected animals against the strain involved. Information on the
identity of the serotype involved in the current outbreaks is
requested. According to the genotyping data provided by the World
RFeference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, 2 FMD virus strains have
already been recognized in Egypt during 2009: FMDV O, topotype ME-SA,
strain Sharquia 72; and FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, strain
Egy-06. The previous A virus in Egypt, observed in 2006-2007, was of
the topotype Africa. Has it disappeared? see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm>.

It will be interesting to note how close, genetically, is the
Egyptian FMDV-A strain Egy-06 related to the FMDV-A strain
circulating in Libya, Egypt's western neighbour, since the beginning
of 2009 -- designated by WRLFMD as topotype Asia, strain Iran-05 (BAR-08).

The possible presence in Egypt of other serotypes should be excluded;
in view of the information concerning camels introduced from Sudan,
this refers in particular to the virus strains circulating there. The
most recent information from Sudan on the WRLFMD website dates back
to 2008, when serotypes O and SAT2 were identified. For Lybia's OIE
notification, including a map, see
