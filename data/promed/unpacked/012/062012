Marburg hemorrhagic fever, imported case Â­ United States 2008
------------------------------------------------------------
On Wed 22 Jan 2009, CDC's Special Pathogens
Branch retrospectively diagnosed a case of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever in a U.S. traveler, who
returned from Uganda in January 2008. The patient
developed illness 4 days after returning to the
U.S., was hospitalized, discharged, and fully
recovered. Initial testing of samples collected
during the patient's acute illness in January
2008 did not initially show evidence of Marburg
virus infection. Testing of a convalescent sample
indicated a possible previous infection, and more
detailed testing of both samples at CDC confirmed
that the patient's illness was due to Marburg hemorrhagic fever.

The recovered patient had visited the "python
cave" in Maramagambo Forest, Queen Elizabeth
Park, western Uganda. This is a popular
destination among tourists to see the
bat-infested cave; a fatal case of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever occurred in a Dutch tourist in
July 2008 who had entered this cave. Both
patients likely acquired their infections as a
result of contact with cave-dwelling fruit bats,
which are capable of harboring Marburg virus.

Marburg virus is a zoonotic virus that occurs in
tropical areas of Africa, and causes a severe,
often fatal, hemorrhagic fever in humans and
non-human primates. It can also be transmitted
through direct contact with a symptomatic patient
or materials contaminated with infectious body
fluids. The Ugandan Ministry of Health officially
closed the cave to visitors in August 2008, after the Dutch case.

The state and local health departments are
working with CDC's Special Pathogens Branch and
Traveler's Health and Animal Importation Branch
to further investigate the circumstances of this
patient's case. This include an assessment of any
persons who may have been at risk of exposure at
the time the patient was ill, and an
investigation of travelers potentially exposed
when visiting this or other caves in Africa.
There is no evidence of apparent transmission as a result of this case.

Travelers should be aware of the risk of
acquiring Marburg hemorrhagic fever and other
potentially fatal diseases such as rabies after
contact with bats. Health care providers should
be aware of the risk of viral hemorrhagic fever
among travelers returning from endemic countries,
and should report any suspected cases immediately
to their health department and to CDC's Special
Pathogens Branch Branch (Tel. 404-639-1115;
404-639-2888 after hours) for diagnostic testing and further guidance.

Travelers' Notices (11): Marburg Case in US Traveler to Uganda
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has recently determined that a US citizen
who became ill in January 2008 contracted Marburg
hemorrhagic fever after a trip to Uganda. Marburg
hemorrhagic fever is caused by Marburg virus. The
traveler has since recovered. No other cases have
been identified in the United States at this
time. There is no evidence that this traveler infected other people.

Travelers should be aware of the serious health risks associated with
visiting caves in the Maramagambo Forest in Uganda and in other areas
of Africa. CDC advises people not to enter any caves or mines where
bats may live. These risks include infectious diseases spread by bats,
such as Marburg, rabies, and histoplasmosis.

Recommendations for U.S. travelers
----------------------------------
The main ways that travelers may get Marburg
virus are through direct contact with a patient
suffering from Marburg hemorrhagic fever or
through direct contact with infected bats,
monkeys, or other wild animals that may be
infected. The risk of Marburg virus infection for
travelers is very low. However, travelers should
take the following steps to protect themselves:

- Avoid contact with bats and other wild
animals. Travelers should not enter caves or mines where bats may live.

- Go to a doctor right away if you have a fever
AND you had contact with animals or sick people,
or visited bat-infested caves in Africa during the past 3 weeks.

If you are bitten or scratched by an animal or if
body fluid (such as saliva) from the animal gets
into your eyes, nose, mouth, or a wound, take these steps:

- Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.
- Go to a doctor or hospital right away.
- Consider buying medical evacuation insurance
if you are visiting a country where there may not
be good access to medical care.

Travelers can contact the local U.S. Embassy or
Consulate for assistance in finding a doctor.
U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad and in the
U.S. are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
to provide emergency assistance to U.S. citizens.
To contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate, dial 00
1 202-501-4444 if calling from overseas.

Recommendations for health care providers
-----------------------------------------
Health care providers treating returning
travelers should be aware of the risk of Marburg
and other viral hemorrhagic fevers in patients
who have visited endemic countries within 3 weeks
of symptom onset. Report all suspect cases to
your state health department and CDC Special
Pathogens Branch immediately (404-639-1115 and after-hours 404-639-2888).
