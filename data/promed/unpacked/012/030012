[1] Mutations

During those terrifying early days of the pandemic, scientists offered one piece of reassuring news about the novel coronavirus: it mutated slowly. The earliest mutations did not appear to be consequential. A vaccine, if and when it was invented, might not need regular updating over time.

This proved overly optimistic.

The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has had billions of chances to reconfigure itself as it has spread across the planet, and it continues to evolve, generating new variants and subvariants at a clip that has kept scientists on their toes. 2.5 years after it first spilled into humans, the virus has repeatedly changed its structure and chemistry in ways that confound efforts to bring it fully under control.

And it's not showing signs of settling down into a drowsy old age. Even with all the changes so far, it still has abundant evolutionary space to explore, according to virologists who are tracking it closely. What that means in practical terms is that a virus that's already extremely contagious could become even more so.

"This virus has probably got tricks we haven't seen yet," virologist Robert F Garry of Tulane University said. "We know it's probably not quite as infectious as measles yet, but it's creeping up there, for sure."

The latest member of the rogue's gallery of variants and subvariants is the ungainly named BA.2.12.1, part of the omicron gang. Preliminary research suggests it is about 25 percent more transmissible than the BA.2 subvariant that is currently dominant nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC said the subvariant has rapidly spread in the Northeast in particular, where it accounts for the majority of new infections.

"We have a very, very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America. That's not even a policy goal," President Biden's new COVID-19 coordinator, Ashish Jha, said in his inaugural news briefing Tuesday [26 Apr 2022]. He was answering a question about Vice President Harris, who recently tested positive for the virus and went into isolation. Harris had recently been boosted for the 2nd time -- her 4th shot of vaccine.

Her case highlights what has become painfully obvious in recent months: no amount of vaccination or boosting can create a perfect shield against infection from SARS-CoV-2. What the vaccines do very well, however, is greatly reduce the risk of severe illness. That is hugely consequential as a matter of public health, as is the wider use of therapeutics, such as the antiviral Paxlovid.

The vaccines currently deployed were all based on the genomic sequence of the original strain of the virus that spread in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. They essentially mimic the spike protein of that version of the virus and trigger an immune response that is protective when the real virus shows up.

But the variants that have emerged can evade many of the neutralizing antibodies that are the immune system's front line of defense. "It's evolving at a fairly rapid rate," said Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. "I do think we need to aggressively consider whether we should update vaccines, and do it soon."

BA.2.12.1 brings the novel coronavirus up another step on the contagiousness scale. Its close relative, BA.2, was already more transmissible than the 1st omicron strain that hit the country in late 2021.

And omicron was more transmissible than delta, and delta was more transmissible than alpha, and alpha was more transmissible than earlier variants that did not have the glory of a Greek alphabet name.

Most mutations are not advantageous to the virus. But when a mutation offers some advantage, the process of natural selection will favor it.

There are 2 fundamental ways that the virus can improve its fitness through mutation. The 1st could be described as mechanical: it can become innately better at infecting a host. Perhaps it improves its ability to bind to a receptor cell. Or perhaps the mutation allows the virus to replicate in greater numbers once an infection has begun -- increasing the viral load in the person and, commensurately, the amount of virus that is shed, potentially infecting other people.

The other strategy involves the workaround of immunity. The human immune system, when primed by vaccines or previous infection to be alert for a specific virus, will deploy antibodies that recognize and neutralize it. But mutations make the virus less familiar to the immune system's front-line defense.

The subvariants keep coming: scientists in South Africa have identified BA.4 and BA.5, which have mutations that were seen in earlier variants and could lead to immune evasion.

"The evolution is much more rapid and expansive than we initially estimated," said Michael T Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert. "Every day I wake up, I fear there will be a new subvariant that we will have to consider.... We're seeing subvariants of subvariants."

Garry, the Tulane scientist, points out that mutations in the virus do not change its appearance dramatically. In fact, he said, even the heavily mutated variants don't look much different from the original Wuhan strain, or different from other coronaviruses that cause common colds. These are subtle changes.

Garry has a software program that allows him to create a graphic image of the virus, and even rotate it, to observe the locations of mutations and draw inferences for why they matter. On Friday [29 Apr 2022], asked about BA.2.12.1, and why it is spreading, he noted it has a mutation, named S704L, that probably destabilizes a portion of the spike protein on the virus's surface. That essentially loosens up part of the spike in a way that facilitates infection.

This S704L mutation distinguishes this subvariant from BA.2. The "704" refers to the 704th position for an amino acid on a chain of roughly 1100 amino acids that form the protein. The S is one type of amino acid ("serine") seen in the original strain of the virus, and the L ("leucine") is what is there after the mutation. (The mutation is caused by a change in one nucleotide, or "letter," in the genetic code of the virus; three nucleotides encode for an amino acid.)

The virus is spreading today in the United States on an immunological landscape much different from the one it first encountered in early 2020. Between vaccinations and infections, there aren't many people entirely naive to the virus. The latest CDC data suggest the virus has managed to infect nearly 200 million people in the nation, which has a population of about 330 million. Among children and teenagers, about 3 out of 4 have been infected, the CDC estimates.

For the new CDC study, researchers looked at blood samples from thousands of people and searched for an antibody that is found after a natural infection but not found after vaccination. The CDC concluded that the omicron variant managed to plow through the United States population during the winter [2021-2022] almost as if it were an entirely new virus. The country by then was largely vaccinated. And yet 80 million people, approximately, became infected for the 1st time in that omicron wave.

On the family tree of this coronavirus, omicron is a distant cousin of delta, alpha, and the other variants that had spread earlier -- it came out of virologic left field. No one is sure of the origin of omicron, but many disease experts assume it came from an immunocompromised patient with a very lengthy illness, and the virus continued to use mutations to evade the immune system's efforts to clear it.

Omicron was mercifully less likely to kill a person than previous variants. But infectious-disease experts are clear on this point: future variants could be more pathogenic.

As if mutation wasn't enough of a problem, the virus has another trick up its sleeve: recombination. It happens when 2 distinct strains infect a single host simultaneously and their genes becoming entangled. The recombination process is the origin of what's known as omicron XE. That recombinant probably emerged from a person co-infected with the original omicron variant and the BA.2 subvariant.

It was always possible in theory, but the identification of actual recombinants provides "proof of concept," as Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, puts it.

The worst-case scenario would be the emergence of a variant or recombinant that renders current vaccines largely ineffective at blocking severe disease. But so far, that hasn't happened. And no "recombinant" has spread like omicron or other recent variants and subvariants.

This is the 1st catastrophic pandemic to occur in the age of modern genomic sequencing. A century ago, no one knew what a coronavirus was, and even a "virus" was a relatively new concept. But today, with millions of samples of the virus analyzed at the genetic level, scientists can track mutations virtually in real time and watch the virus evolve. Scientists across the planet have uploaded millions of sequences to the database known as GISAID.

Genomic sequencing has a major limitation in that, although scientists can track changes in the genome, they don't automatically know what each of those changes is doing to the virus. Which mutations matter most is a question that can be discerned through laboratory experiments, modeling or epidemiological surveillance, but it's not always simple or obvious.

Erica Saphire, president of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, speculates that omicron has mutations that have changed the virus in ways not yet understood but which make it more resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization. "It may have acquired some new trick that we haven't uncovered yet," Saphire said. "It's harder to neutralize than I would have expected, based on the number of mutations alone."

A reality check comes from Jeremy Kamil, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport: "These are all SARS-CoV-2." What he means is that these are all variations of the same virus, despite what seems like a tremendous amount of mutation. Correspondingly, someone who gets infected with one of these new variants has the same disease as people who got infected previously. "They got COVID," he said.

Citation: COVID-19 pandemic: what's next for public health? Lancet Public Health. 2022; 7(5): e391; https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00095-0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two years after SARS-COV-2 was declared a public health emergency, global estimates of excess deaths from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation indicate that 18.2 million people died due to the pandemic by 31 Dec 2021 -- 3 times higher than official records suggest. 100 million people have been plunged into extreme poverty by the pandemic, according to World Bank estimates. While the true burden of COVID-19 is being unravelled, is a mental health crisis being unmasked? The pandemic has exposed long-standing gaps and a global underinvestment in mental health care and prevention, disproportionately affecting young people and women. According to WHO's Mental Health Atlas, the global median spending on mental health is still hovering at around 2% of government health expenditure. However, cases of anxiety disorders rose by 25.6% and cases of major depressive disorder increased by 27.6% globally in 2020. Immediate action is needed to strengthen mental health services to address this steeply increasing demand and to meet peoples' needs.

Adverse mental health outcomes and psychiatric morbidity have been documented in patients with COVID-19, and concerns persist regarding the long-term health effects of COVID-19. Post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID and its potentially considerable psychological sequelae is still poorly understood. About 1.7 million people in the UK had self-reported long COVID, as of 5 Mar 2022, according to the latest figures by the Office for National Statistics. In this issue of The Lancet Public Health, Ingibjörg Magnúsdóttir and colleagues report that acute COVID-19 disease severity (indicated by the number of days bedridden) is associated with long-term impact on mental health. Individuals bedridden for 7 days or longer were 50-60% more likely to experience depression and anxiety symptoms.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions, physical distancing, and lockdown measures have been important public health tools to suppress COVID-19 transmission, but they also disrupted people's daily lives. School closures and confinement affected the wellbeing of children and adolescents, who showed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, according to UNICEF. The loss of schooling and the effects that might have on mental health -- directly, because the loss of education could be a permanent deficit for human capital, and indirectly, because of the fractured social networks among children and young people -- should be a cause of concern.

In an effort to disentangle the impact of lockdowns on mental health from the direct effects of the pandemic, Peter Butterworth and colleagues used a quasi-experimental approach, enabled by the localised lockdown in the state of Victoria, Australia, and found that lockdowns had a small, but independent, effect on population mental health. However, the study also suggested that mental health impacts could be worse for some groups and thus widen existing inequalities.

Countries have used different levels of policy stringency to curb the spread of COVID-19. Lara Aknin and colleagues report, also in this issue, the association between COVID-19 policy restrictions and mental health during the pandemic. More stringent COVID-19 policies were associated with poorer mental health -- higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction. Such findings should be important in informing future pandemic response strategies, and the enhanced support that is needed to balance the potential negative effects of necessary public health measures.

The content in this issue of The Lancet Public Health and research published elsewhere have made a start in documenting the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated policy responses, but the full public health implications of the pandemic are broad and much remains to be understood. The pandemic has affected all areas of health and wellbeing and is not only a public health crisis but also a social, economic, and political one. Lessons must be learned to ensure that future public health crises are met with resilience, unity, and equity. We invite submissions [https://www.editorialmanager.com/thelancetpublichealth] (Viewpoints or Essays) to reflect on the public health challenges and opportunities in the post-COVID-19 age. We encourage authors to be critical and visionary. We welcome submissions from early-career researchers, frontline public health workers, academics, and policy makers. The deadline for submission is 1 Jul 2022.

[3] China: COVID hot spots, South Africa, South Korea, USA
Date: Mon 2 May 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/chinas-covid-19-battle-continues-2-key-hot-spots


With Shanghai's lockdown in effect for about a month, cases are slowly declining, but health officials are alarmed about more infections reported outside of quarantine facilities. Meanwhile, cases are still rising in Beijing, where health officials continue to tighten measures.

Meanwhile, in the United States, cases continue to grow, especially in the Northeast, though the level of hospitalizations and deaths are still low.

Shanghai continues lockdown; Beijing tightens steps
---------------------------------------------------
In Shanghai, cases have been declining since the middle April [2022], raising hopes among frustrated residents. After going 2 days with no new cases outside of quarantine settings, the city reported 58 such cases, signaling a setback for control efforts, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/world/china/setback-shanghais-covid-battle-beijing-focus-mass-testing-2022-05-02/].

City officials have had an aggressive policy about quarantining people and their contacts, sometimes separating parents from children, which resulted in pushback from citizens.

Meanwhile, authorities in Beijing imposed restrictions over the Labor Day 5-day holiday celebration, which is typically a busy travel season. Over the weekend, restaurants were barred from indoor dining, and workers and students will be required to be tested for COVID-19 before returning to work or school after the holiday, according to CNN. The holiday started on 30 Apr 2022 [https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/china/beijing-covid-labor-day-holiday-intl-hnk/index.html].

China's National Health Commission (NHC) today reported 7741 new local cases, 6895 of them asymptomatic. Of the symptomatic cases, 85% are from Shanghai, and, of the asymptomatic ones, 95% are from Shanghai.

Beijing recorded 36 new symptomatic cases, along with 5 asymptomatic ones. The country reported 32 more deaths, all in Shanghai.

Other global developments:
--------------------------
- South Africa's COVID-19 test positivity rate rose to 22% yesterday [1 May 2022], as officials are assessing whether a steady rise over the past 2 weeks marks the start of a 5th wave or a temporary blip due to the recent Easter holiday [15-18 Apr 2022] gatherings, according to News24, a South African news source based in Cape Town. Scientists in South Africa are tracking rising proportions of 2 new omicron subvariants -- BA.4 and BA.5 -- which appear to be somewhat more transmissible than the BA.2 subvariant [https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-rise-in-infections-as-sa-positivity-rate-hits-22-20220502].

- South Korea recently relaxed its outdoor masking mandate, but many people are still wearing them because of persistent omicron spread, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/skorea-drops-outdoor-mask-rule-many-prefer-keep-them-2022-05-02/].

US cases climb 25%, but deaths fall
-----------------------------------
In the United States, the 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 58 280, with 337 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week, new daily cases rose 24%, hospitalizations rose 9%, and deaths fell 12% [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) COVID-19 Community Levels map shows that 90.3% of US counties have low COVID-19 levels, 8.0% have medium levels, and 1.7% have high levels [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view].

Despite the increase in cases, deaths and hospitalizations remain low. According to the New York Times, fewer than 400 deaths per day are being recorded, a decrease of 20% over the past 2 weeks.

The most dramatic case increases continue to be seen in New England, with Vermont, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts reporting 30% or more increases in the past 2 weeks.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 66.2% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 77.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 45.8% of those eligible have received their 1st booster dose [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total].

[4] Paxlovid
Date: Mon 2 May 2022
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/02/paxlovid-as-covid-19-prevention/


Pfizer released news late Friday [29 Apr 2022; https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-shares-top-line-results-phase-23-epic-pep-study] that Paxlovid, the antiviral currently subject to a big push from the US government, failed to prevent people living with COVID patients from catching the infection.

The news is one of several bad headlines for the new COVID pill, but one experts say doesn't affect the medicine's primary use: treating people who are already sick.

Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said he would "absolutely" prescribe Paxlovid to people at high risk of severe disease who have COVID. "Without hesitation," he said. "Because the net benefit in the high-risk study was extremely high."

And some experts said the results, while disappointing, are not a surprise. "Traditionally it's been difficult to use small molecule antivirals for true prophylaxis because the biology of treating infection is different from the biology of preventing infection," said Daniel Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

In the new study, Paxlovid or placebo was given to 2957 adults who had a negative rapid antigen test and were asymptomatic, but who were living with someone who had COVID. The medicine (or the placebo) was given within 96 hours of the infected individual becoming infected. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either a 5-day course of Paxlovid, a 10-day course, or placebo.

Patients who received the 5-day course tested positive 32% less often for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, than those who received placebo. Those who received the 10-day course tested positive 37% less often than those who received placebo. But both of those results were not statistically significant and may have been due to chance.

The results contrast sharply with those for monoclonal antibody drugs earlier in the pandemic, where roughly similar studies showed Regeneron's REGEN-CoV, Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab, and AstraZeneca's Evusheld all reduced rates of infection by 80%.

Figuring out why may be difficult, especially until more data are available.

"I would be very hesitant to draw a lot of conclusions from a press release," said Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina Medical School. Cohen helped conduct the Regeneron and Lilly studies.

Eli Lilly conducted a prophylaxis study of its monoclonal antibody in nursing homes before vaccines were available. Receiving the antibody reduced the risk of contracting COVID by 80%. Regeneron's study was in household contacts and separated those who tested negative via PCR and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from those who were positive. The 1st group was protected by 80%; the 2nd had milder symptoms than they otherwise would. But both of those antibodies are not effective against newer variants. The Evusheld study was the most recent but still occurred before the omicron wave [Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab (Evusheld) for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. JAMA. 2022; 327(4): 384-385; https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.24931].

One possibility, Cohen said, is that the study failed the drug: that is, Paxlovid would have been effective if it had been given earlier, or that people who tested negative on antigen tests were already infected with the virus but did not yet have symptoms.

It's also possible that Paxlovid didn't perform differently than a monoclonal antibody would, said Barouch, who also worked on the Regeneron and Lilly studies. The studies of prophylaxis with monoclonals were done before the omicron strain was prevalent, and omicron is more infectious. "That hyper-infectiousness probably makes it more difficult to prevent infections," said Barouch.

But it also could have to do with differences between the way Paxlovid and the monoclonals work. It could be, Cohen said, that the drug doesn't get to the mucosa of the nose, where infection occurs, fast enough.

Or it could be because monoclonals work by preventing the virus from entering cells, whereas Paxlovid works by inhibiting the virus' replication, blocking an enzyme known as a protease.

"I think it may have to do with the mechanism of action of the drug, which acts relatively late in viral replication," said Sax. "So perhaps once the virus has established infection, blocking the protease enzyme is too late to prevent infection from taking hold."

Barouch echoed this idea. He also connected it to another hot issue with the drug when it is used for treatment, not prevention: anecdotal reports that some people have initial success being treated with Paxlovid but then see their virus levels rise and symptoms return. It is as if, he said, the drug is not eradicating the virus, but just suppressing it.

He emphasized that this would not give him any pause in treating a positive patient who has risk factors for severe COVID. "If someone who is moderate-to-high risk acquired SARS-CoV-2," said Barouch, "these new data would not make me less enthusiastic to prescribe Paxlovid for therapeutic purposes."

Sax has written about the relapses after Paxlovid treatment. Most people who are given the drug, he emphasized, are not relapsing, and that means they are getting a benefit with regard to their own health and may also be less likely to spread the virus to other people. But he said more data are needed on how often relapses occur with treatment. It's not clear, he said, whether they should get a longer treatment course, something that might need to be tested in a clinical trial, or, in some cases, a 2nd course of treatment. For mild recurrences, though, retreatment may not be justified, because people get better [https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/yes-relapses-after-paxlovid-happen-now-what/2022/04/25/].

Sax emphasized that these concerns don't change his willingness to use the drug when it has been shown to lower hospitalization and death. Most anti-infective drugs won't show that in a clinical trial of healthy people, he noted, simply because people generally do get better. Another benefit of using the medicine could simply be to help people recover more quickly.

Cohen said that he is more concerned about people who, perhaps because they are immunocompromised, might not be able to recover entirely even with Paxlovid. He said there is a need to try the drug in combination with monoclonal antibodies, with Merck's molnupiravir, or with other potential treatments in those patients.

So far, clinical trials of Paxlovid have not included vaccinated patients, but all 3 doctors said that they were comfortable prescribing the drug to people who had risk factors for severe disease, such as age, diabetes, or obesity, who had been fully vaccinated.

[*There is a discrepancy in the WHO numbers for 2 May 2022for the African region, with lower figures when compared to 1 May 2022, so the higher figure is being maintained and will be updated in the next post.

Data by country, area, or territory for 2 May 2022 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAY2_1651603807.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 14.9% of cases and 26.9% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 153.17 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. Brazil reported 15 194 cases in the last 24 hours, followed by Argentina, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Chile, all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, and Barbados reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. The USA, Canada, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 40.3% of cases and 40.2% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 215.21 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 9 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours -- with no countries reporting more than 100 000 cases, 2 reported more than 10 000, and 7 reported over 1000 cases -- and 2 reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported no cases and deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.69 million cases. Overall, the reporting from the region has declined considerably over the last few days; whether this is attributable to reduced reporting on account of Ramadan and Eid-ul Fitr or an actual reduction should become clear in the coming weeks.

- The African region reported 0.10% of daily cases and no deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.81 million cases. Zambia (139) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours. Most of the remaining (12 reporting) countries reported 50 or fewer cases.
