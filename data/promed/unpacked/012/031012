Health authorities in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany
have reported 3 cases of wound infections with the bacterium _Vibrio
vulnificus_ so far this summer. The patients had typical symptoms of
vibrio wound infections, and these developed after bathing in the
Baltic Sea. All of them had underlying chronic illnesses. One patient
was a 57-year-old diabetic, one was a 72-year-old man with coronary
heart disease and chronic leg edema, and one was a 76-year-old man
with a chronic skin ulcer. All were treated with antibiotics and are
recovering. Samples taken from the wounds of 2 patients tested
positive for _V. vulnificus_.
Since the end of Jul 2006, water samples taken from 9 out of 10
bathing places along the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Baltic Sea coast have
consistently tested positive for _V. vulnificus_ (testing is done
every 14 days at these locations). _V. alginolyticus_ and _V.
parahaemolyticus_ have also been detected, but so far, there have
been no reports of human infections with these species (1).
In summer 2003, 2 cases of wound infections with _V. vulnificus_ were
also reported in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (2). In both cases, the
patients also had underlying illnesses. One of the patients, a
50-year-old man, suffered from diabetes mellitus. The other patient,
a 62-year-old woman, suffered from liver cirrhosis and died after
developing the wound infection. Both had had open wounds on the legs
when they bathed or waded in the sea before illness onset.
Other vibrio infections in Europe linked to Baltic Sea
-------------------------
In recent weeks, 3 people in southeast Sweden were reported to have
developed mild to severe wound infections caused by non-agglutinating
(not O1 or O139) and non-toxin-producing _V. cholerae_ bacteria after
bathing in the Baltic Sea, and possibly an irrigating pond. All 3 had
skin breakages, and 2 had other underlying diseases (3). In Denmark
this year, there have so far been reports of 2 children (both
immunosuppressed) with wounds infected with _V. alginolyticus_ and
_V. parahaemolyticus_, and a fatal case of _V. vulnificus_ wound
infection in an adult. All of these cases were linked to bathing in
the Baltic Sea (4).
Discussion:
_Vibrio_ are facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli from the
_Vibrionaceae_ family, which are medium to highly halophile
(requiring salt). Several different species belong to the genus
_Vibrio_: _V. vulnificus_ and _V. cholerae_ among others. _Vibrio_
bacteria can multiply in salty water, especially at temperatures over
20 degrees C, which is currently the case in many areas of the Baltic
Sea. No German coastal sea water samples have yet tested positive for
_V. cholerae_.
Seafood containing vibrio bacteria can cause diarrhea if eaten raw.
If open wounds come into contact with sea water, vibrio bacteria can
infect the wounds. Elderly and immunosuppressed people (e.g., with
diabetes mellitus or liver disease) are at particular risk of
infection. Without medical attention, superficial wounds can spread,
necrotise and cause septicaemia. For this reason, prompt diagnosis,
wound care, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important, even if
a vibrio infection is only suspected.
It should be stressed that people with open wounds and underlying
chronic illnesses or who are immunologically compromised should not
have contact with sea water. _Vibrio_ infections should be considered
in the differential diagnosis if there are supporting clinical
symptoms. Patients presenting with wound infections should be asked
whether they have had contact with sea water and if so, appropriate
therapy needs to be prescribed.

[Related to the recent heat waves in Europe and the USA, more areas
are reporting infections due to pathogenic _Vibrio_ species in
usually cooler climates. Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark
have all reported cases.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative,
opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and
associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish
(oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors
responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and
in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of
dissolved organics.
Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with
sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body
on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.
The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals
with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The
organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals,
the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock,
rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70
percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions
(shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/sym_2_photo.jpg>). - Mod.LL]
