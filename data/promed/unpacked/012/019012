MERS-CoV - summary and literature update as of 20 Jun 2013
----------------------------------------------------------
Since April 2012, there have been 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); 72 percent have been male. 38 of the confirmed cases have died. Affected countries in the Middle East include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar. Cases have also been reported by 4 countries in Europe, France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and Italy, and by one country in North Africa, Tunisia. All of the European and North African cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East. However, in France, the UK, Tunisia, and Italy, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East.

Among the new laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported since the last update on 31 May 2013, 3 have been reported by Italy. In this cluster, the index case, a 45-year-old Italian resident, travelled to Amman, Jordan in mid-April [2013]. He developed mild respiratory symptoms one day before returning home to Italy in late May [2013]. He was admitted to hospital with pneumonia 3 days after returning home. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs taken on the day following admission were positive for MERS-CoV. He had no underlying chronic medical conditions, but was noted to be obese. He recovered and was discharged home after a week in hospital. Contact monitoring was conducted in Italy, and 2 developed respiratory symptoms: a 42-year-old co-worker and a 14-month-old close relative. Both tested positive for MERS-CoV. The 2 contacts had each been exposed to the 45-year-old man on a single day, and their illnesses began 3 and 4 days, respectively, after that exposure. Both had mild illnesses and recovered uneventfully. Follow up was also done on close contacts in Amman, Jordan. 4 symptomatic and 6 asymptomatic contacts had NP swabs collected for testing; all were negative for MERS-COV.

The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has also notified WHO of additional laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with onset in late May [2013] and early June [2013]. These include cases from the Ta'if Governorate, Wadi Al-Dawaser, and Hafar Al-Batin; the 1st reported from these areas. The more recent cases were similar in age and sex to previously reported cases, except for a 2-year-old from Jeddah with chronic pulmonary disease.

Although the exact timing and nature of exposures that result in infection is usually unknown, for those cases for which exposure is known or strongly suspected, the incubation period for laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV is generally less than one week. However, in at least one case the known exposure occurred 9 to 12 days prior to onset of illness. Further evidence in cases exposed over a range of time suggests that, at least in a minority of cases, the incubation period may exceed one week but is less than 2 weeks.

Evidence is also accumulating to suggest that nasopharyngeal swabs are less sensitive for detecting infection with MERS-CoV than specimens taken from the lower respiratory track. Currently, no head-to-head comparisons are available on the 2 approaches to diagnosis. However, in a number of patients, NP swabs have been negative at one point during the course of illness while lower respiratory specimens were positive at another time during the same illness. In addition, in several clusters, patients who were strongly suspected of having MERS-CoV infection because of direct exposure and severe respiratory illness had NP swabs that tested negative, while other confirmed cases in the cluster had lower respiratory track specimens that tested positive.

Recent papers/guidelines published since the last update
--------------------------------------------------------
On [5 Jun 2013], WHO published updated guidance on travel recommendations for MERS-CoV (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20130605/en/index.html). The document does not provide specific guidance for preventing MERS-CoV infection as the source of the virus is still unknown. However, it does provide general infection prevention recommendations for travelers along with recommendations for clinicians who care for travelers returning from the affected area who develop respiratory illness.

Summary assessment
------------------
The newest cases reported indicate that the source of infection, which has still not been determined, remains active in the Middle East and is present throughout a large area, including new regions in Saudi Arabia. The Italian case with history of travel to Jordan, suggests the continued risk of infection within Jordan, where no confirmed cases have been identified over 1 year despite ongoing surveillance. This cluster also represents the 1st time that a co-worker has become infected in a work setting other than a health care facility.

Two recent cases also represent the 1st documentation of infection in children, although one previously unconfirmed probable infection occurred in a Saudi teenager. While the virus continues to infect predominantly those who are middle aged or older, this demonstrates that children are also at risk of contracting MERS-CoV. In the 2 confirmed cases in children and the previous probable case, the illness was relatively mild.

WHO is currently reviewing surveillance recommendations based on recent observations that the incubation period may exceed 10 days in some patients. In addition, WHO now strongly recommends the collection of lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when possible. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen or a repeat upper respiratory specimen, with an additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory specimens are not possible. The addition of acute and convalescent serology should be considered as an additional diagnostic test when results of PCR testing of respiratory specimens are inconclusive.

As reported in previous updates, human-to-human transmission has not been observed to persist beyond small clusters of individuals with close contact. However, it is likely that more sporadic cases with subsequent limited transmission will occur in the near future. The large number of cases with reported co-morbidities suggests that persons with underlying medical conditions may have increased susceptibility to infection. Health care facilities dealing with patients suspected of being infected with MERS-CoV should exercise appropriate infection control measures. Clinicians should be aware that MERS-CoV infection may present atypically, and initially without respiratory symptoms, in immunocompromised individuals.

WHO continues to request that Member States report all confirmed and probable cases along with information about their exposures, testing, and clinical course to inform the most effective international preparedness and response.

[These global summaries are helpful recaps of the current status of knowledge of the situation with respect to MERS-CoV. While the information base on the epidemiology of the MERS-CoV continues to grow, what eludes the scientific community is information on the means of transmission in the community, resulting in the infection of the index cases in the clusters and of the sporadic cases without known contact with other cases.

As the virus is closely related to known bat coronavirus(es), one of the speculations put forth (early on by ProMED-mail subscriber Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People, and later on by other subscribers and seen in newswires) is contamination of dates by infected bat secretions, which are then ingested by people in the area.

Within the framework of the ongoing monitoring and epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 4 confirmed cases of this virus have been recorded and all of them have recovered, bringing the total number of recovered cases to 14 patients.

The 1st case was a 42-year-old Saudi female in the Eastern region, who left the hospital. This case is to be added to the 3 female cases of health practitioners in Taif governorate, ages 45, 39, and 29, all of whom have recovered.

The MOH has pointed out that within the framework of the ongoing monitoring and epidemiological surveillance by the competent committees, they have tested 308 samples over the past 3 days , all of which have proved negative, except what we have published.

New England J Med 2013 (epub ahead of print)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
In September 2012, the World Health Organization reported the 1st cases of pneumonia caused by the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We describe a cluster of health care-acquired MERS-CoV infections.

Methods
-------
Medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic information and determination of potential contacts and exposures. Case patients and contacts were interviewed. The incubation period and serial interval (the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) were estimated. Viral RNA was sequenced.

Results
-------
Between [1 Apr 2013 and 23 May 2013], a total of 23 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Symptoms included fever in 20 patients (87 percent), cough in 20 (87 percent), shortness of breath in 11 (48 percent), and gastrointestinal symptoms in 8 (35 percent); 20 patients (87 percent) presented with abnormal chest radiographs. As of [12 Jun 2013], a total of 15 patients (65 percent) had died, 6 (26 percent) had recovered, and 2 (9 percent) remained hospitalized. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 14.7), and the serial interval was 7.6 days (95 percent CI, 2.5 to 23.1). A total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units, or in-patient units in 3 different health care facilities. Sequencing data from 4 isolates revealed a single monophyletic clade. Among 217 household contacts and more than 200 health care worker contacts whom we identified, MERS-CoV infection developed in 5 family members (3 with laboratory-confirmed cases) and in 2 health care workers (both with laboratory-confirmed cases).

Conclusions
-----------
Person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV can occur in health care settings and may be associated with considerable morbidity. Surveillance and infection-control measures are critical to a global public health response.

[This publication represents the 1st information on results of the epidemiologic investigations into the outbreak in the Eastern Province, providing details on the routes of transmission within the affected healthcare facility. The full article is free and available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1306742?query=featured_home#t=article,

One interesting fact mentioned in the methods section is that surveillance for MERS-CoV was implemented in September 2012 when the Saudi MOH requested that all admissions to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia should have specimens tested for the MERS-CoV.

Figure 1 in the article shows an epidemic curve of the outbreak and includes laboratory confirmed cases (23) and other probable cases that were not laboratory confirmed (11). Figure 2 is a transmission map of the outbreak and it shows there was one superspreader in the beginning of the outbreak who was responsible for 7 more cases directly, and another 13 cases in 2nd and 3rd generation spread. Hence, this one individual was responsible for spread of the MERS-CoV to 20 individuals -- a very similar situation as observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

The supplemental information includes a line listing of the cases and presents the likely source of exposure including location of contact and duration of contact for person-to-person transmitted cases. (see http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1306742/suppl_file/nejmoa1306742_appendix.pdf). Transmission occurred in 4 healthcare facilities; within the healthcare facilities, transmission occurred in the hemodialysis units, the ICU, and in the general wards.

[4] Saudi Arabia: outbreak details, newswire
Date: Wed 19 Jun 2013
Source: The New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/health/fast-spreading-virus-under-inquiry-in-saudi-arabia.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&


A man in a Saudi hospital has pneumonia. The patient in the room next door gets sick, and before anyone realizes what is happening he infects 7 others, each of whom infects at least one more. An outbreak is born.

A detailed investigation of the viral illness first detected last year [2012] in Saudi Arabia has revealed the chilling ease with which the virus can spread to ill patients in the hospital -- and its ability to infect some close contacts like hospital staff and family members who were in good health. A report on the investigation published Wednesday [19 Jun 2012] in The New England Journal of Medicine pinpointed the time it takes for a person to get sick after being exposed to the virus, a median of 5.2 days.

The disease has now infected 64 people [now 72] and killed 38 in 8 countries. Saudi Arabia has had the most cases. The United States has had none.

The disease was first recognized in Saudi Arabia last September [2012], and was later named MERS, for Middle East respiratory syndrome. It is caused by a coronavirus, a relative of the virus that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which originated in China and caused an international outbreak in 2003 that infected at least 8000 people and killed nearly 800.

MERS has not spread as rapidly or as widely as SARS did. The 1st few MERS cases seemed to pop up sporadically and mysteriously, and at first doctors did not think the disease was contagious. But over time it became apparent that patients in hospitals could infect one another, and that family members and health workers could sometimes contract it, too.

The apparently high death rate from the disease has worried health experts. More than half of the confirmed cases have been fatal. However, it is possible that milder cases have gone undetected and that the disease is not as deadly as it may initially appear, said Dr Trish M Perl, an author of the new report, and a senior hospital epidemiologist and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, who traveled to Saudi Arabia to investigate the outbreak.

But Dr Perl added: "I'm very concerned about the amount of transmission we've witnessed in health care facilities, and the severity of disease we witnessed. And you're helpless. There's nothing to offer these patients."

Dr Perl, who also helped track the SARS outbreak in Toronto, said the new disease was very much like SARS, "almost scarily close."

One patient infected 7 others, somewhat reminiscent of the SARS phenomenon in which some patients were "superspreaders" who infected dozens of other people. But it is too soon to tell whether that kind of transmission will continue to occur with MERS, Dr Perl said.

Doctors are trying antiviral drugs, but there is no proven drug treatment and no preventive vaccine. There is no rapid diagnostic test for people with symptoms; testing must be done at specially equipped labs. Nor is there a reliable test to determine whether people were exposed in the past, something that would help determine how widespread and severe the infection is.

Although many experts say global health authorities have gotten much better than in the past at detecting and investigating sudden disease outbreaks, Dr Perl said they still were not responding quickly or effectively enough.

"It's deja vu," she said. "How many times do we have to do this before we start having surveillance strategies to protect ourselves? Have we lost our way? This has been dragging on since September [2012]. There's been a lot of wringing of hands. We haven't learned from our past mistakes."

So far, according to the World Health Organization, all the cases have originated in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates. 4 other countries, Britain, France, Italy, and Tunisia, have found cases in returning travelers and their close contacts.

In May [2013], Saudi health officials invited Dr Perl and a team of international experts from Britain, Canada, and the United States to help study the outbreak. The team focused on 23 cases that occurred from [1 Apr 2013 to 23 May 2013] in 4 hospitals in Al-Ahsa, an eastern province of Saudi Arabia. So far, 15 of the patients have died.

Team members visited the hospitals and pored over medical records to map the path of the virus. Most of the cases occurred in people who had other underlying illnesses and shared hospital rooms or wards with patients who had MERS. But several cases occurred in relatives who visited them, or hospital workers caring for them.

Although the new disease spread in hospitals, it did not arise there. The 1st cases came from people who were exposed elsewhere, perhaps through foods or animals. But researchers still do not know the source of the MERS virus or how the 1st patients contracted it -- information essential for telling people how to avoid it.

The SARS virus is thought to have originated with bats, and scientists suspected that the same might be true of MERS, and that people might have contracted it from eating dates that had been contaminated by bats. But so far, no bats or any other animals have been found to be infected, according to Dr Alimuddin I Zumla, an author of the study and a professor of infectious diseases and international health at University College London Medical School.

"They have looked at over 200 animal species in the kingdom, thousands of samples from bats, cats, camels, other animals," Dr Zumla said. "Unfortunately, at the moment there is no link." He said air-conditioning systems and water supplies were also being checked.

More than twice as many men as women have contracted the disease. Researchers do not know why.

"I don't think the virus prefers any gender," Dr Zumla said, adding that he suspected that Saudi women might be protected by their veils, which cover their mouths and noses and might help keep the virus out.

Health officials are not recommending travel restrictions, but Dr Zumla said that Saudi health officials had begun screening visitors for symptoms of the disease, like runny noses, coughs, and fever.

He said health experts would be increasingly concerned as the time nears for the annual pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca. "4 million pilgrims from 182 countries are coming to Saudi Arabia in 2 months' time," Dr Zumla said. "I am worried, as a physician."
