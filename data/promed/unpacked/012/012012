On 11 Dec 2012, the Norwegian newspaper 'Aftenposten' reported a disease outbreak at the Klekken Hotel in Ringerike, Norway. An estimated 170 individuals reported illness after attending a company Christmas party. As a consequence, Klekken Hotel's kitchen closed days after initial reports of illness were received. All food products were discarded, and the kitchen facilities were disinfected.

Patients have presented with stomach aches, other associated pains, diarrhea, vomiting, and some febrile illness. The County Doctor is working with hotel officials as well as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) to identify the source of the outbreak. Currently, it is not known if the outbreak was caused by contaminated food products, and/or transmission of pathogens among attendants. (See http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/170-personer-syke-etter-julebord-7067706.html for the original article, in Norwegian).

[Maps of Norway can be seen at http://www.questconnect.org/images/map_of_norway.png and http://healthmap.org/r/4uHH. Ringerike is a municipality in Buskerud County, Norway. The administrative centre of the county is the town of Honefoss. A map of Buskerud County, showing the location of Ringerike, can be accessed at http://www.gonorway.com/norway/counties/buskerud/.

The circumstances and the time of year suggest that this may be an outbreak of norovirus infection ('winter vomiting disease"), which could be mediated either by contaminated food or through social contact such as at a Christmas party. The outcome of the current investigation by the County Doctor is awaited. - Mod.CP]
