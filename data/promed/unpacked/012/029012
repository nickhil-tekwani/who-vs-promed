Indonesia: first avian influenza deaths confirmed
-------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: Indonesia confirmed on Wednesday [20 Jul 2005] its first deaths
from avian influenza, saying tests on a father and his 2 young daughters
who died recently showed they had contracted the virus. Avian influenza,
which arrived in Asia in late 2003, has so far killed 40 people in Viet
Nam, half of them since December [2004], 12 in Thailand and 4 Cambodians.
"Test results from a Hong Kong laboratory which I received this morning
confirmed they were positive for the H5N1 virus," Indonesian Health
Minister Siti Fadillah Supari told reporters. Asked if the 3 died from
avian influenza, Supari said: "Yes. It is not yet known how they got
infected, but we continue to conduct an investigation on the ground," she
said. "The results show (the virus is) a conventional one, and not a new
virus. Therefore, there is no need to worry about human-to-human transmission."
Authorities have taken samples of more than 300 people who had contact with
the family on the outskirts of Jakarta. They also plan to carry out
extensive tests on animals within a 20 km (12 mile) radius of the family's
house and slaughter those infected.
The World Health Organisation representative Georg Petersen told the
British Broadcasting Corporation that an in-depth investigation was needed,
adding that in other countries the source of infection was often not known
straight away. However, chicken sellers and residents in Jakarta appeared
unconcerned. "I heard about bird flu. It doesn't affect our sales. Moreover
we have a shortage of chicken supply," said Leo, a vendor in the capital.
Last month, Indonesia reported its first human case in a poultry worker,
but the man did not develop symptoms and is healthy.
The Agriculture Ministry has reported sporadic H5N1 virus outbreaks killing
more than 9 million fowl in 21 provinces, out of a total of 33, across the
archipelago since late 2003. Indonesian policy favours vaccinating animals
rather than culling to stop the spread of bird flu, due to lack of funds to
compensate farmers. The World Health Organisaton has questioned the
effectiveness of vaccines and say culling is the best weapon. The virus has
already jumped species in Indonesia and was discovered in pigs in May on
densely populated Java island. Pigs can carry human influenza viruses,
which can combine with avian viruses, swap genes and create virulent new
strains, health experts say. However, pig farming in Indonesia, the world's
most populous Muslim country, is not widespread. Islam regards pigs as
unclean animals.

Indonesia: first deaths linked to avian influenza confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: Indonesia confirmed its first human deaths from avian influenza on
Wednesday [21 Jul 2005] after a man and his 2 daughters died, bringing
Asia's toll from the disease to at least 57 people. Health Minister Siti
Fadilah Supari told reporters that lab tests from Hong Kong showed the 38
year old man and his 2 young girls, who died earlier this month, had the
deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza. The family lived in a Jakarta suburb.
Though there is no evidence yet that the three had contact with infected
poultry, Supari said human-to-human transmission of the disease appeared
unlikely at this stage. The virus strain that killed them had not mutated
to ease such transmission, she said. "I don't think we have to worry about
that now," she said.
Avian influenza has swept through poultry populations in large swaths of
Asia since 2003. Tens of millions of chickens have either died or been
slaughtered. Avian influenza has killed 38 people in Vietnam, 12 in
Thailand, 4 in Cambodia, and now 3 in Indonesia. Experts say most of the
deaths so far have resulted from an animal passing the virus to a human.
But WHO has long cautioned that the virus could mutate to allow easy
transmission from person to person, which could cause it to spread rapidly
around the world. Dr Georg Petersen, a WHO representative in Indonesia,
said it appeared to be good news that the virus found was the H5N1 strain
of avian influenza virus, not a new form. While it was too early to rule
out human-to-human transmission, Petersen said he was not too concerned
that the 3 victims had no known contact with sick birds. "We know the
source of infection is very often very hard to find, at least immediately,"
he said, adding that a more thorough investigation was needed.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono earlier this week vowed transparency in
dealing with Indonesia's outbreak, and the Agriculture Ministry said it has
already taken steps to curtail the disease's spread.

Indonesia: first human deaths from avian influenza reported
-----------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia received confirmation of its first avian influenza deaths after
tests proved an Indonesian man and his 2 daughters died from avian
influenza, Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said. A 1 year old girl died
2 days after being admitted to a hospital in Tangerang, about 25 kilometers
(15.5 miles) west of Jakarta, on 7 Jul 2005, for high fever and respiratory
problems. Her father died on 12 Jul and her older sister, aged 8, died on
14 July.
The Indonesian authorities were concerned the deaths may have been the
world's second case of transmission of the disease between humans, which
increases the possibility it has mutated into a form capable of starting a
global epidemic. Fifty-four people in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Cambodia have
died from the virus since 2003 catching the virus from poultry. "It's the
conventional H5N1 virus and not a new strain," Supari told reporters in
Jakarta today. "Don't worry it's not a human-to-human infection." The World
Health Organization laboratory in Hong Kong confirmed the victims had
contracted the H5N1 avian influenza virus, she said.
The Indonesian authorities have kept 300 people who came in contact with
the 3 victims under observation, George Petersen, the WHO's representative
in Indonesia said in an interview. None has developed symptoms. Of the 15
avian influenza viruses, the H5N1 mutates rapidly and can acquire genes
from viruses infecting other animal species, WHO said on its website.
Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and
in feces, spreading the virus at live poultry markets. Migratory birds also
can spread the virus. The first case of probable human-to-human infection
was in Thailand last year, when a mother and her daughter died. After the
young Thai girl developed a fever on 2 Sep, her mother, aged 26, came from
another town to care for her. She didn't wear a mask or gloves. The girl
died on 8 Sep 2005 and her mother developed a fever on 17 Sep, leading to
pneumonia and her death on 20 Sep, according to the New England Journal of
Medicine. The mother and daughter were infected with the same H5N1 virus
strain and the mother hadn't had contact with infected chickens, the study
said.
There's a lot of "ifs" until clinical, epidemiological and laboratory tests
are concluded to determine whether the case is human to human transmission,
Somchai Peerapakorn, divisional staff at WHO in Thailand, said in reference
to the Indonesian case. Human-to-human transmission has not been proven
"anywhere in the world" yet.
In Indonesia initial tests by the Health Ministry found no trace of avian
influenza [virus] in the blood samples from father and the elder daughter,
although "further tests showed signs of avian flu," Supari said on 15 Jul
2005. The Indonesian Health Ministry has also taken samples from the 315
people who may have had contact with the family, including health workers
and relatives and is monitoring them, Supari said. Supari also said none
has developed symptoms.
In June, the government detected its first case of bird flu in a human, a
farm worker in South Sulawesi province, Agence France-Presse reported. In
May, the government found a strain of bird flu in some pigs in Banten
province, the Jakarta Post reported.

[The previous dispute regarding the confirmation of the initial diagnosis
of the illness now seems to have been resolved, but the origin of the
infection remains unexplained. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
