South Waziristan measles outbreak kills 5 children
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 children in South Waziristan have died from measles during the past week, an official said. "Non-availability of measles vaccines has become a big problem and if the desired vaccines were not made available, the situation could slip out of control," Dr. Azmat Hayat Khan, agency surgeon, told Central Asia Online on Fri 3 Aug 2012.

Measles has affected about 400 children, of whom about 100 were hospitalised, he said. He warned of an outbreak throughout the agency if medics failed to immunise children immediately. Letters regarding the unavailability of measles vaccine have gone to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) directorate of health, he said, expressing hope the vaccine would become available in a few days.

The Taliban have refused to allow polio vaccination in areas of South Waziristan they control, endangering more than 157 000 children below age 5, he said.

The directorate has received the agency surgeon's letter and is sending vaccines to South Waziristan, FATA Health Director Dr. Fawad Khan said. "We have also started vaccination in Mohmand, Bajaur and Khyber agencies, where measles had killed several children besides sending hundreds to hospitals," he said.
