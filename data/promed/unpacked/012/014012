[These reports complement the information published in the ProMED-mail post 20161221.4712786.

Given the rapid spread of HPAI H5N8 in the region, there is a high likelihood that these outbreaks reported by Bulgaria are also associated with this subtype.

Regarding H5N5, the Netherlands recently reported that subtype in wild birds. See posting 20161216.4701594.

"Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds, however the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.

"The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.
Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

"Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans". http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/about-ai/
