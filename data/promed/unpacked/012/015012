Agriculture officials have warned farmers not to panic over the
appearance of small brown plant hoppers in the northern provinces of
Hung Yen, Hai Duong, Thai Binh, and Bac Ninh. According to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the new planthopper,
known as _Laodelphax striatellus_, was found densely scattered over
35 hectares [86.5 acres] of rice fields, sometimes up to 6000 insects
per square metre. The highest density in some areas is 18 000 to 20
000 insects per square metre.

The insect has infested several other countries like mainland China,
Japan, and South Korea, according to Ngo Tien Dung, head of the Plant
Protection Division of the Department of Plant Protection.

Another type of plant hopper is multiplying in northern provinces,
damaging some 20 000 ha [49 400 acres] of winter-spring rice crop, of
which some 3000 ha [7400 acres] is seriously affected. More than 30
000 ha [74 000 acres] of summer-autumn crop in southern areas have
also been affected by this insect.

The brown plant hoppers are the most serious of rice pests. They suck
rice plant sap and transmit rice diseases, leaving fields susceptible
to the ragged stunt rice disease, rice stripe virus, and maize rough
dwarf disease. Brown plant hoppers have destroyed 730 ha [1800 acres]
of paddy fields in the central province of Phu Yen.

[The small brown planthopper, _Laodelphax striatellus_ is an
important vector of virus diseases of graminaceous plants and is the
most important vector of _Rice stripe virus_ (RSV; genus
_Tenuivirus_). It is often responsible for epidemics of rice stripe
disease, which causes severe losses in many rice-growing regions. RSV
detection in this vector is used for disease forecasting since the
virus is transmitted in a persistent manner (propagative in the
insects, passed on to progeny through eggs). _L. striatellus_ also
transmits _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus
_Fijivirus_) and _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV; genus _Fijivirus_).
Besides rice, all 3 viruses can also affect wheat and other cereal crops.

The other virus mentioned above, _Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV;
genus _Oryzavirus_), is transmitted by the brown planthopper
_Nilaparvata lugens_, which is also a vector of several other rice
viruses. Additional rice viruses are transmitted by green rice
leafhoppers (_Nephotettix_ species). Disease management of rice
viruses generally includes cultural techniques (for example planting
time, reduction of inoculum), vector control, and use of resistant
crop cultivars.

_N. lugens_ and _Nephotettix_ spp. have been reported to be
associated with rice virus epidemics in Viet Nam before, and either
of these may be the 'other' plant hopper referred to above. However,
it appears from this news report that _L. striatellus_ is considered
a new incursion in the country. RSV epidemics and southward spread of
the disease and its vector have been reported from China in recent
years (ProMED-mail post 20080825.2650). The presence of _L.
striatellus_ carries an extremely high risk of rice stripe for Viet
Nam and further increases the virus disease pressure on national rice crops.
