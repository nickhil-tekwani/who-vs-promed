Bird flu still present in Viet Nam's poultry: official
-----------------------------------------------
An avian flu virus that hit Asia a few months ago is still present in
Vietnamese poultry, and might be a potential danger, a veterinary official
said.
Nguyen Van Thong, a deputy director in the agriculture ministry, told AFP
that samples from 10 000 poultry throughout Viet Nam had been tested
recently. He added that "lots of these samples were positive for H5 virus."
Scientists could not identify the precise strain of the virus, he said.
Viet Nam, with 16 people killed, was the worst hit, in human terms, of the
8 Asian countries recently struck by the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
Authorities declared, on 30 Mar 2004, that bird flu had been eradicated,
after a 90-day infection period, despite warnings from United Nations
health experts that it was acting prematurely.
There had been no major recurrence of the virus. In May 2004, the
government announced another outbreak but stressed that it had been brought
under control.
"Avian flu can come back very easily if we don't take all the necessary
measures," Thong said.
He asked authorities to keep testing samples regularly, to kill all
suspected chickens, to make sure prevention committees remained on high
alert, and to insure that these committees were transparent with
information. He also said that imports of poultry from China should be
strictly controlled.
Anton Rychener, country head of the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization, said that he had been informed about the situation.
"It is no surprise. I understood, from other sources as well, that the
virus has continued to live on at a low-pathogenic level in millions of
poultry," he said, adding that UN agencies had long ago warned the
authorities of such a risk.
Hanoi was widely criticized for its lack of cooperation with the World
Health Organization (WHO), and other agencies, in tackling its bird flu crisis.
The WHO has warned that it could take months, probably years, to eliminate
H5N1 and recommended that farmers wait 3 months from the last infection
date before restarting production.
But farmers began to restock immediately, and all provinces in the country
have already restarted production.
More than 44 million poultry died, or were slaughtered, across Viet Nam as
a result of the disease, which was detected in 57 of its 64 provinces.
