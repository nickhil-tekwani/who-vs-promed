I re-read my message [ref. (02) below] and discovered a small error. It
should read:
"All 7 are alive, and their blood samples tested negative at NIV for Ebola
and Marburg by PCR." - instead of "All 6...".
Neither the 6 suspect cases from Doruma nor the one from Dungu were real VHF
[viral hemorrhagic fever] cases.

[Re: "real VHF cases", I suppose they were all clinically compatible with
VHF, it's just that the actual etiological agent couldnÂ´t be identified.
This could be due to one or more of several factors, ranging from the only
blood specimen available being in poor condition, or taken after the end of
viremia & before a rise in antibody titer, to it being a new microbial
agent. - Mod.JW]
