Health officials have this year [2010] reported a significant
increase in cases of chikungunya, a little-known viral disease with
symptoms similar to dengue fever. While rarely fatal, there is no
vaccine or cure for chikungunya [virus infections] and treatment
focuses on relieving the symptoms, which can last for several months.

In 2010, the virus has become significantly more common in Ayeyarwady
Division, Yangon Division, Rakhine State and Shan State, officials
and residents said. "We believe that it has been transmitted from
Thailand. It is now commonly found in people in Ayeyarwady Division.
As it has similar symptoms to dengue, most people who come to
hospital with chikungunya think they have dengue fever," Dr Khin Nan
Lone, a divisional malaria control officer at Pathein General
Hospital in Ayeyarwady Division, said last month. She said
chikungunya [virus] is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying
_Aedes_ mosquitoes, which also spread dengue fever [viruses].

Dr Khin Nan Lone said the disease is most commonly found in adults
aged 20 - 40 and symptoms include a fever of up to 40 Celsius (104
Fahrenheit), intense headaches, rash and arthralgia, or arthritis
affecting multiple joints. The effects can last from weeks to several
months depending on the age of the patient.

"It is rare to see fatal cases but it is infectious. If someone
suffers chikungunya, the disease [virus] will usually be transmitted
to others (in their family)," she said.

A health official based in Taunggyi said residents of some townships
in Shan State were also suffering from chikungunya [virus infection].
"Starting from the 2nd week of June, I have treated nearly 100
patients who were suffering from chikungunya," she said.

Professor Chit Soe, a consultant physician and rheumatologist, said
chikungunya was 1st reported in Yangon in 2009. "But it has become
more common in the early part of this year's rainy season," he said.
"Older people should be careful not to contract the disease because
they will be affected much more than a younger person." He said that
people who suffer from chikungunya [virus infection] are likely to
spend 3-7 days recovering in bed but they can suffer from joint pain
and aches for up to 2 months.

To reduce the likelihood of contracting the virus, people are
encouraged to keep their water tanks clean and covered and to clean
out their plant pots.

According to the World Health Organisation, chikungunya was 1st
described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952 and occurs
in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in Southeast Asia, including Myanmar.
This report provides no information supporting the statement that the
virus came into Myanmar from Thailand. Chikungunya virus infections
in Myanmar were reported earlier this year (2010), and the outbreak
apparently has continued.
