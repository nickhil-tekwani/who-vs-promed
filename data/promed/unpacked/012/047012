I believe the correct term for a human disease transmitted to animals is an
anthroponotic disease, or anthroponosis [sounds reasonable, but the term is
not widely known. Some workers use the term "zoonosis" to describe diseases
passed between humans and other animals in either direction. - Mod.SH.
Wildlife are often reservoirs for zoonotic or domestic animal diseases.
However, pathogen pollution has only been recognized relatively recently as
a source of emerging infectious diseases that "spill-over" into wildlife.
(See review in Science 2000; 287:443-9
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/5452/443>).
I work on marine mammal diseases, a field in its infancy. We have recently
discovered _Giardia_ sp. in pinnipeds (phocid seals). How a directly
transmitted terrestrial protozoan causes chronic infections in pelagic
marine mammals is a mystery. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we have
further established that it is _Giardia duodenalis_ assemblage A (that is,
the human genotype) in these seals. How this parasite got into seals is
unknown -- human sewage or agricultural manure getting into the coastal
marine environment is our best guess for now. This work will be published
soon. Incidentally giardia and cryptosporidium have been reported in
coastal molluscs like the eastern oyster; again human sewage and
agriculture manure are the likely source.
The true host of _Giardia duodenalis'_ is still being debated. In some
cases the original host of a pathogen is not clear -- for example, new
pathogens discovered in marine mammals in the marine environment include
viruses like morbillivirus (phocine and cetacean distemper), influenza A
and B, bacteria like _Brucella_, protozoons like _Toxoplasma gondii_,
_Sarcocystis neurona_, _Giardia duodenalis_, and cryptosporidium. It is not
clear yet whether these organisms have always been present in marine
mammals (unknown due to lack of study) or whether they have recently or
distantly invaded the marine environment from the terrestrial environment.
Some anthroponotic pathogens come from indirect human activities such as
sewage outfall, agricultural activities, translocation of domestic and wild
animals, and from direct contact with humans in captive situations such as
zoological parks or so-called "wildlife rehabilitation" centers.
