At least 126 people have developed intestinal illnesses believed to be
caused by a rare waterborne parasite after eating basil and pesto from four
stores of a local chain of gourmet markets, health department officials
around the region said yesterday.
The outbreak of Cyclospora disease has affected people who attended 19
separate events where basil products were served, Alexandria Health
Department officials said. No one had to be hospitalized, although one
person was treated with intravenous fluids, they said.
The events ranged from small dinner parties and baby showers to corporate
gatherings, and the food came from stores in Northwest Washington, Bethesda
and Alexandria, officials said. Thirty members of the National Symphony
Orchestra became sick after they ate box lunches provided by the chain
stores at Wolf Trap Farm Park, said Rob Pritchett, Alexandria's
director of environmental health. Alexandria officials began tracking the
disease which is caused by the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis, after
hearing that 52 people had become ill after attending two events on June 21
and 26...
The chain buys basil from several sources, so FDA investigators are trying
to track the contaminated batch to a specific producer...

The Cyclospora parasite is found in developing countries where produce may
be irrigated or washed with contaminated water, health officials said. But
it is possible that the basil became contaminated with it touched other
infected produce, Pritchett said. Cyclospora can live a long time and may
not be removed by washing or cooking.
The illness, which often includes diarrhea, bloating, fever and fatigue,
takes a day to two weeks to incubate and can be treated with antibiotics...
This is the second consecutive summer with multiple outbreaks in the United
States of Cyclospora disease. Last year, 1,465 people got the illness,
mostly from Guatemalan raspberries, according to U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
[Ray, thanks very much for abstracting this report and posting it to us at
ProMED-mail. This emerging disease has occurred in approximately 10
outbreaks this year in the US. It goes to show what awareness and better
diagnostics can reap. It's it always interesting to speculation how new
such emerging diseases actually are. Also, I wonder if we are getting to
the point where we will eventually begin to develop good estimates for
causal distributions on relatively mild diarrheal cases. - Mod. pc]
