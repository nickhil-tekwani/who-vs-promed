The total suspected and confirmed cases near 660 000, up from nearly 590 000 last Friday [22 Aug 2014]. About 59 000 additional cases were reported from the Dominican Republic, which now tallies at 429 000 cases.

In Central America, El Salvador's chikungunya case count increased by 3000 cases, bringing that country's total to more than 8000.

[3] Chikungunya modeling challenge
Date: Sat 23 Aug 2014
Source: Digital Journal [edited]
http://www.digitaljournal.com/science/chikungunya-challenge-project-announced/article/398849


A challenge has been laid down for scientists. The contest aims to identify models that accurately forecast outbreaks of the mosquito spread viral disease chikungunya.

Models that can calculate the spread of chikungunya virus in the Caribbean and North, Central, and South Americas are being sought in a contest for scientists. The contest has been organized by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Accurately predicting the next chikungunya outbreak could help prevent the spread of the vector-borne infection. It is thought that chikungunya virus is transmitted through a 3-way interaction that relates to viral strain, mosquito genotype, and ambient temperature.

This is the 1st health-related challenge announced by DARPA's new Biological Technologies Office division; awards of USD 150 000 and 100 000 have been announced for the top 2 solvers, with 4 honorable mention awards of USD 50 000 each.

Discussing the project, DARPA program manager Matthew Hepburn told ScienceInsider that the US Agency is seeking technologies that can be used to make decisions if an outbreak occurs. "It's one thing to know what's happening on the ground currently," he said. "But really to design your response decisions, you need to know what's going to happen next."
