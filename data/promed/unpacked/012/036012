New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks (2)
Outbreak location 1: Rutshuru territory, Rutshuru, [North Kivu]
Started: 10 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Hippopotamus (_Hippopotamus amphibius_): Hippopotamidae-Artiodactyla / 50 / 10 / 10 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: These are hippos found dead in the river in Virunga Park between Ishasha River and Lake Edouard in Rutshuru territory. Rutshuru territory is a deconcentrated administrative entity in the eastern part of the province of North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the borders of Rwanda and Uganda.

Outbreak location 2: Rutshuru territory, Rutshuru, [North Kivu]
Started: 9 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Water buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_): Bovidae-Artiodactyla / 80 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The [water buffalo] were affected by the same disease in Luilimbi in the Virunga Park, where the law forbids the intervention in medicine of these animals, which must live in their natural state in the water. We cannot count these animals in the water. We can only make estimates. Rutshuru territory is a deconcentrated administrative entity in the eastern part of the province of North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the borders of Rwanda and Uganda.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Anthrax is a zoonosis. Awareness of the risk of anthrax contamination should be high. The population should avoid drinking the water of the rivers that cross the park and should avoid picking up any dead domestic or wild animal. Hippos have been found dead in the water as well as on the riverbanks. There is a great risk of contamination for the population living in the vicinity of Virunga Park who use the water of the rivers for their basic needs; that is why the communication of risks is essential.

Control measures at event level
Wild control measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; ante- and post-mortem inspections; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Goma Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Hippopotamus, water buffalo / smear evaluation / 15-22 Apr 2021 / positive

[The location of the 2 outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. Unfortunately, it does not indicate where the water buffalo carcass was discovered.]

[Anthrax is infrequently reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The affected water buffalo seems to have been an incidental event, while the hippo was affected in 2 widely separated sites. The different "start" dates indicate that the single dead water buffalo noted on 9 Apr 2021 triggered a search, which found the dead hippos on the following day. Logically there is a background wildlife incidence in this park and unfortunately rarely noted. The 2011 bovine outbreak was in a different part of the country from North Kivu. - Mod.MHJ
