Increased disease risk from ticks in UK
---------------------------------------
The potential for being bitten by a diseased tick is becoming more common
in the UK, scientists have found. They also say that people in the UK are
often unaware that they can contract Lyme disease and other serious
infections without going overseas. Scientists from the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine blamed increased foreign travel and a relaxation of the
quarantine laws for more exotic ticks being imported into the UK. Those
ticks bring with them diseases like encephalitis and typhus.
Dr John McGarry, of the Division of Parasite and Vector Biology at the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said campers and walkers in areas
like the Lake District had always run the risk of getting ticks, which can
spread Lyme disease. But he said many people were oblivious of the risks
and some failed to visit their GP, even though they knew they had been
bitten by a tick, waiting until their condition became more serious. Dr
McGarry said: "We see a few hundred cases of Lyme disease in the UK each
year, but if the GP gets to see it early then there are usually no
problems. "The false perception that native tick infestations do not
represent any potential threat may be widespread. With the relaxation of
quarantine regulations for imported dogs, the potential for the
introduction and transmission of the new tick-borne diseases has increased.
There is the potential for new diseases through infected animals."
Dr McGarry and his colleagues examined the records of patients transferred
to their travel clinic over the last 7 years and found that two-thirds of
the 73 [arthropod dermatoses originated in the UK. Overall there were 27
ticks, 24 myiases (infestation of the skin by fly larvae); 15 ectoparasitic
insects (parasites that live on the skin of their host) and 7 mite
infections [infestations. Ticks predominated in the UK with 41% of cases,
whereas myiasis was more common in travellers returning from abroad.

[This study is published in The Lancet. Volume 357, Number 927, 2105-2106n
2001 (Arthropod dermatoses acquired in the UK and overseas; W McGarry, P J
McCall, S Welby).
The text of the Abstract reads: "International tourism to tropical and
sub-tropical areas, both to resource-poor and developed countries, has
almost trebled within the past 20 years. We examined the records of
patients referred to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine over 6
years. 46 (63%) of infestations originated in the UK. Ticks were most
common in the UK (19 cases, 41%) whereas myiasis was most common in
travellers (18 cases, 67%). These records suggest that whereas many
overseas acquired infestations are potentially dangerous if infections are
transmitted, ticks constitute the greatest risk, and both domestic and
exotic species may act as disease vectors. - Mod.CP
