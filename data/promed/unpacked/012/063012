The Public Health Ministry has issued a warning of the need to take precautions against dengue fever, which has claimed 50 lives so far this year [2012].

Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, director-general of the Disease Control Department, said the Bureau of Epidemiology reported that a total of 52 008 people had fallen ill with dengue fever between from [1 Jan 2012 to 16 Oct 2012], and 50 of them died.

Of the total, 20 600 of the patients were in the Central Region, 14 347 in the Northeast, 9076 in the North, and 7985 in South.

Dr Pornthep said the dengue situation in the South is now of concern because of the rain and water-holding areas could become a breeding ground for stripe mosquitos, the carrier of the disease.
