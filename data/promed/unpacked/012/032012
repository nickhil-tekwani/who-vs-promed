Previous surveys for viruses in sweet potatoes (_Ipomoea batatas_) in
Africa did not assay for the presence of begomoviruses such as sweet potato
leaf curl virus (SPLCV), which have been found recently in the Americas and
Asia. Symptomatic sweet potato plants, including some with leaf curling
symptoms similar to those observed in SPLCV-infected sweet potato plants
(2), were collected from a germplasm collection plot at Kakamega Research
Station in Western Kenya during February 2005. Whiteflies, the vectors for
begomoviruses, were observed in the same plots.
_Ipomoea setosa_ plants graft-inoculated with scions from the symptomatic
sweetpotato developed leaf curl, leaf roll, interveinal chlorosis, and
stunting symptoms similar to those caused by infection with SPLCV alone or
in combination with sweet potato feathery mottle virus. Total DNA was
isolated from 10 I. setosa plants using the GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich Inc, St Louis, MO). Sweet potato cuttings from 39 clones,
selected from the Kenyan germplasm collection for their resistance or
susceptibility to sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), were sent to the Plant
Germplasm Quarantine Office of USDA-ARS. The cuttings were planted in a
greenhouse. Total DNA was extracted from sweet potato leaves 1 month later
using a cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) extraction method (1).
Degenerate primers SPG1/SPG2, developed for PCR detection of begomoviruses
(1), amplified a 912-bp DNA fragment from 3 of 10 DNA extracts from _I.
setosa_ and 5 of 39 sweet potato plants held in quarantine. The primers
anneal to regions of open reading frame (ORF) AC2 and ORF AC1 that are
highly conserved in begomoviruses infecting sweet potato. SPLCV-specific
primers PW285-1/PW285-2 (2) amplified a 512-bp DNA fragment of ORF AC1 from
seven samples (2 from _I. setosa_ and 5 from _I. batatas_). Amplicons from
3 independent PCR assays of 2 samples and single PCR assays of 4 additional
samples were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Clone inserts were
sequenced, and compared with sequences deposited in GenBank using the basic
local alignment search tool (BLAST). Sequences were closely related to
SPLCV (GenBank Accession No. AF104036) with nucleotide sequence identities
varying from 93 per cent (GenBank Accession No. DQ361004) to 97 per cent
(GenBank Accession No. DQ361005). The presence of the virus poses a
challenge to the dissemination of planting materials in the region because
begomovirus-infected plants often do not show symptoms. To our knowledge,
this is the first report of a begomovirus infecting sweet potato in Kenya
or the East African Region.

[The crop plant sweet potato,_Ipomoea batatas_, develops symptoms of the
disease leaf curl when infected by sweet potato leaf curl virus (family:
_Geminiviridae_, genus: _Begomovirus_, SPLCV). Sweet potato is ranked 7th
in worldwide food production.
SLCV or sweet potato with leaf curl symptoms has been detected or reported
in Taiwan, Japan, Brazil, China, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the United
States. The causal agent is the whitefly-transmitted SPLCV. Viral genomic
ssDNA can be detected in plant samples using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) with SPLCV-specific primers. SPLCV-like isolates cluster into 3
groups, and all of them might have evolved from the same common ancestor
possibly from the Old World.
This article describes the 1st detection of SPLCV in sweet potato in East
Africa in samples collected in Kenya in 2005. Plants with leaf curl
symptoms were identified in the germplasm collection plot at Kakamega
Research Station in Western Kenya. Of 49 samples, 8 were positive for a
begomovirus and 7 of these were the source of an amplified product of
expected size using a SPLCV specific primer pair. Sequence data was nearly
100 percent identical with that of published sequences for SPLCV.
The authors note that the presence of the virus poses a challenge to the
dissemination of planting materials in the region because
begomovirus-infected plants often do not show symptoms.
This is yet another report pointing out the significance of
whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses in worldwide agriculture. There are
about 100 previous postings on begomoviruses in ProMED-mail archives
(search term: begomovirus). The posting included in "see also:" is for
begomoviruses of sweet potato.
