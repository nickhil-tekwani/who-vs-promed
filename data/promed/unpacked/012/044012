Suspected cutaneous anthrax cases at Bolpur, India
----------------------------------------------------
One person died and 2 persons have been admitted in Beliaghata Infectious
Diseases Hospital among 25 other suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax in a
tribal area of Sukhbajan village at Bolpur of Birbhum District, West
Bengal, India. The disease started after intake of meat of a dead cow in
the evening of 24 Jun 2003. They were suffering from vesicular swellings
and ulcers of the skin along with swollen draining lymph nodes.
Experts from School of Tropical Medicine are investigating about this. All
affected persons are rapidly improving after treatment and the condition is
now well controlled.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Das for this report of suspected anthrax in West Bengal.
We await the formal diagnosis in these cases.
The lesions of cutaneous anthrax begin as insect bite-appearing pruritic
papules. The location of the affected skin is not described but the
typically appear on the exposed skin areas such as the arms, hands, face
and neck. Within several days, the lesion develops into an ulcer
surrounded sometimes by vesicles before developing a 1-3 cm black
eschar/ulcer that is painless with surrounding prominent edema. There may
be regional lymphadenitis and adenopathy although I am not sure how often
the nodes drain. Specific antimicrobial therapy does not seem to alter the
natural progression of the local lesion but does assist in minimizing
systemic symptoms and/or bacteremic spread.
More information about the cases, the course and treatment would be useful
in confirming the diagnosis. If the exposure was ingestion of meat from
the cow, we might expect cases of gastrointestinal anthrax as well.
It should be noted that the recent posting regarding possible anthrax in
Koraput is a separate focus. Koraput is in the Orissa State and these
cases are in West Bengal. The 2 states share a border with West Bengal
being east of Orissa but Koraput is located on the west side of Orissa. -
