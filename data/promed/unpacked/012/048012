A veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) warns we
could potentially see cases of anthrax for the rest of the summer in parts
of northeast Saskatchewan. Dr. Sandra Stephens can't explain it, but in
past instances, there are usually clusters of outbreaks, followed by a lull
. . . and then more cases.
There was a bit of a lull over the weekend, with only one new quarantined
farm and 7 suspicious animal deaths. The total is now 28 farms and 113
deaths, with 26 producers in the Rural Municipalities of Kinistino and
Willow Creek, north and west of Melfort. The other 2 are in the Rural
Municipalities of Rose Valley and Spalding, south and east of Melfort.
There have been media reports of vaccine shortages. Dr. Stephens says the
C.F.I.A. maintains a stockpile to use on farms with positive cases. The
supply problems have occurred for farmers wanting preventative
vaccinations. Private veterinary clinics did not carry a large supply of
anthrax vaccine because the disease was relatively rare in the region until
the heavy rain last fall and this spring disturbed the bacteria in the
soil. The vet clinics have been busy vaccinating thousands of animals and
have been using the vaccine as quickly as it comes in. Dr. Stephens says
there are no supply shortages on the manufacturing side and shipments are
expected by Wednesday.
The vaccine usually takes 7 to 10 days before it provides full
protection. A booster shot is required about 3 weeks later.

[Booster shots with the Sterne vaccine for cattle are not necessary unless
you started with a mixed treatment of antibiotics and vaccine. In that
case the antibiotics will have neutralised the live vaccine. For cattle,
one injection of vaccine is sufficient to provide some 9 months coverage. -
