The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is confirmed in the state's wild bird population according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

The disease was identified in free-ranging Canada geese and tundra swans from St Clair County, snowy owls from Macomb County, and a mute swan from Monroe County.

The mute swan was identified as a positive case on [15 Mar 2022].

Then, on [24 Mar 2022], the DNR received confirmation that 6 geese, 2 tundra swans, and 2 snowy owls were positive for HPAI.

This comes after the state's 1st HPAI detection from a non-commercial, backyard poultry flock in Kalamazoo County in late February [2022].

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) has continued to urge poultry owners to "step up their own biosecurity precautions by minimizing the number of people coming in contact with birds, isolating birds from wild birds whenever possible, and disinfecting hands and clothing after coming in contact with poultry."

"This confirmed positive finding of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds prompts several steps that are informed by Michigan's Surveillance and Response Plan for HPAI in wildlife," said DNR Director Dan Eichinger. "The DNR and MDARD are working that plan with other experts and stakeholders and taking advantage of every available resource that aims to limit the spread of HPAI."

Eichinger also said the state's ongoing focus is to prevent the disease's spread.

According to the state's wildlife HPAI plan, the DNR has already canceled the roundup and relocation of Canada geese for the year, and will only make limited exceptions in approved situations. The DNR is also refunding application fees for sites that have received roundup permits.

Due to the cancellation, the DNR is also encouraging nest and egg destruction to resolve conflicts. There is no eligibility requirements for nest and egg destruction in 2022, nor is there any charge for permits for this activity.

MDARD, the DNR, Michigan State University, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the US Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Services and Wildlife Services are working together to conduct avian influenza surveillance and to monitor health of poultry, livestock, wildlife, and residents in Michigan.

As of right now, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider the risk to people from HPAI viruses to be low since there are no detections of infections in people within the US.

DNR is asking Michiganders who notice the death of 3 or more free-ranging birds to report it to the DNR either through the Eyes in the Field app [https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home?utm_campaign=avian%20influenza%20wild%20birds%203counties&utm_medium=pr&utm_source=govdelivery] or by calling 517-336-5030.

And if your domestic poultry is experiencing severe illness or multiple death losses they are asking for you to contact MDARD at 800-292-3939.

[2] Colorado (Sedgwick County): wild goose

The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, known as HPA, in wild Snow and Ross's geese in Sedgwick County.

The confirmation comes after testing done by CDA, the Colorado Department of Parks and Wildlife, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

The birds were collected by CPW [Colorado Parks and Wildlife] [17 Mar 2022] after several sick and dead geese were found at Jumbo Reservoir. The birds were necropsied at the CPW Wildlife Health Laboratory and samples were submitted to the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The samples tested positive and these results were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on March 24, 2022. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in wild birds in Colorado.

According to a release issued Friday [25 Mar 2022], there have been no detections of HPAI in commercial or backyard poultry flocks in Colorado. The USDA publishes all detections of HPAI in wild and domestic birds on its website.

Dr Maggie Baldwin, Colorado State Veterinarian, said it's not surprising to find cases of HPAI in northeast Colorado.

"With the number of cases of HPAI we have seen across many eastern and Midwest states, it is not unexpected to have a detection in wild birds in Colorado," Baldwin said. "However, this detection emphasizes the importance for all poultry and bird owners to increase their biosecurity to protect the domestic poultry in the state. While our primary goal is prevention, we are also working to increase preparedness in the event that we do have a domestic poultry detection of HPAI in the state to respond quickly and eliminate the virus. Rapid detection and response is the best way to protect and safeguard animals and the food supply."

HPAI is a reportable disease. It is important for veterinarians and producers to report any suspicious disease events in poultry flocks to the State Veterinarian's office at 303-869-9130. If it is after hours, the voicemail message will indicate which veterinarian is on call.

HPAI is a highly contagious and fatal foreign animal disease in domestic poultry. Wild birds can spread this virus to domestic poultry and certain strains of avian influenza can be transmitted to humans. This does not present a food safety risk; properly prepared and cooked poultry products and eggs are safe for human consumption.

Poultry producers and bird owners should increase biosecurity measures to help prevent HPAI from occurring in Colorado's domestic poultry flocks. The most important biosecurity practices include limiting exposure of domestic birds to wild birds and other poultry flocks and limiting introduction of new birds into flocks. People, equipment, vehicles, and other objects can also serve as a mechanism for transmission of disease and are important considerations when implementing biosecurity measures.

[3] South Dakota: wild goose

City officials say a case of avian flu has been detected in a goose near the Mitchell cemetery.

According to Parks and Recreation Director Kevin Nelson, the investigation began after a city official noticed a goose acting strange Thursday [24 Mar 2022].

Nelson said a wildlife biologist confirmed the suspected goose that was roaming around the cemetery near Lake Mitchell tested positive for avian flu, more commonly known as bird flu.

"They contacted a wildlife biologist, and they were able to do some testing with a mask and gloves. It turned out that it had avian flu," Nelson in an interview with the Mitchell Republic. "There were droppings in the area by the cemetery that they were able to identify."

According to the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks, the state's 1st case of avian influenza was confirmed in 2015 at a commercial turkey farm in Beadle County, which is about 50 miles [about 80 km] north of the Mitchell area.

The latest cases of bird flu were detected in several snow geese and Canada geese in early March [2022] at 2 commercial turkey plants in Charles Mix County, GF&P [Game, Fish and Parks] officials say.

"As in past outbreaks, significant impacts to commercial poultry operations and backyard poultry flocks have been seen. We have also seen confirmed and suspected mortality several migratory waterfowl and raptor species in SD over the past several weeks," said Rocco Murano, a senior waterfowl biologist with GF&P. "Common symptoms are lethargy, tremors, inability to walk/fly and a twisted neck."

Luckily, Murano said, the migration of arctic geese is progressing extremely rapidly this year [2022]. While the state could expect low levels interspecies transmission, Murano hopes the mortality rate will remain low.

"It is generally thought that the avian influenza virus doesn't tolerate warm conditions as well which should slow spread as spring weather warms into summer," Murano said. "It remains to be seen if this outbreak fizzles out over the summer or re-emerges in the fall. It is likely that a cooperative monitoring effort involving state and federal agencies will begin prior to fall migration."

State GF&P has been working with the South Dakota Animal Industry Board (AIB) and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to monitor and respond to additional outbreaks of avian influenza.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza is transmissible from birds to humans. The virus can be transmitted to humans through a person's eyes, nose, and mouth. Mild symptoms of the bird flu can range from upper respiratory sickness such as coughing, sore throat, fatigue, and headaches. More severe symptoms in humans include pneumonia, vomiting, fevers, and seizures.

While bird flu is transmissible to humans, the CDC says the spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to another "is very rare." According to the CDC, bird flu in humans can only be detected through lab testing, meaning doctors are not able to clinically diagnose a human with the virus.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission announced on Friday [25 Mar 2022] that a bald eagle found dead near Philadelphia tested positive for the highly contagious virus, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1).

This is the 1st known case of HPAI H5N1 in the state since the disease was first discovered in the United States in late 2021, according to the commission.

Another 5 deceased birds from Kahle Lake on the border of Clarion and Venango Counties are being tested for the flu as well.

The virus can be deadly for multiple species of birds, including but not limited to turkey, hawks, eagles, gulls, ducks, and geese.

Birds can be experiencing the virus while seeming totally healthy, but some symptoms include losing control of flight or other obvious signs of neurological dysfunction.

"While this HPAI outbreak does not appear to have significantly impacted wild bird populations, it has the potential to significantly affect the commercial poultry industry and international trade," the Pennsylvania Game Commission said.

Earlier this month [March 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low but that they are continuing to monitor the situation.

The HPAI H5N1 Eurasian variant first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. During the 1st weeks, the propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to have been associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, but it has been showing up in western states.

It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB]
