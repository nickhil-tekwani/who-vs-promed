The following information was prepared by FAO Animal Health Service and
circulated to FAO EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary
Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases) livestock circulation lists, and to
the Veterinary services in member countries of the FAO EUFMD Commission.
Foot and mouth disease type Asia-1 in China
-------------------------------------------
Special disease analysis report (Information compiled by EMPRES working
with the EUFMD Commission Secretariat, FAO). The confirmation of FMD virus
type Asia-1 infection in 2005 in cattle in Hong Kong Special Administrative
region (Hong Kong SAR), and subsequently from widely dispersed location on
the Chinese mainland, represents a major eastwards shift in the known
distribution of this virus type.
Extensive spread within the country may increase risk to neighbouring
countries. One [clue] that this may already have occurred was the receipt
on 15 Jun 2005 by FAO of a report of Asia-1 infection in an area of the
Russian Federation in the Amur region, close to the Chinese border,
subsequently reported to the OIE on 16 Jun 2005.
The reservoir of FMDV type Asia-1 is generally considered to be in south
Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, countries with very high bovine and
buffalo population densities. This virus type has often been associated
with epidemic spread out of these reservoir animal populations into west
Asia as far as Turkey, and even in 2000 to Greece, but eastwards spread to
involve dispersed, possibly widespread outbreaks on the Chinese mainland
appears to be a new and worrying development.
Where entry into naive animal populations occurs, epidemics can be severe.
As part of the EMPRES and EUFMD activities, FAO has tracked the reports of
severe FMD outbreaks from central Asia and western China between 2003 and
the present, and actively engaged with the countries concerned to improve
reporting and follow-up actions.
The development in China appears to be the consequence of a failure of the
disease reporting system in a number of countries, mostly in central Asia,
resulting in country-to-country spread, and it would appear, spread from
western China to eastern China in 2005.
In 2003, FAO received media reports and unofficial reports from field-based
projects and organisations of a serious change in the FMD situation in
several central Asian countries. FAO provided encouragement to the
authorities of the countries concerned to confirm or refute the reports,
and offered assistance for field or laboratory epidemiological investigations.
The sequence of reports would suggest infection in Tajikistan was followed
by outbreaks in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and at some point in 2003, in
Kazakhstan. 3 of these countries share borders with Xingjian Province of
western China.
In December 2003, Tajikistan reported FMD to the OIE, and Kyrgyzstan
reported FMD to the OIE Regional FMD Reference Laboratory in Vladimir,
Russia. In January 2004, this laboratory confirmed Asia-1 type in samples
from Tajikistan. A summary of the information received concerning Asia-1
infection in China, or dramatic disease events that might indicate Asia-1
incursion, is given below.
Reported situation in 2005
--------------------------
23 Mar 2005: The authorities of the Hong Kong SAR reported to the OIE the
detection of Asia 1 virus infection, in cattle. [see 20050323.0842]. The
infection was confirmed in samples submitted to the FAO World Reference
Laboratory at Pirbright.
13 May 2005: China reported to the OIE that outbreaks caused by Asia-1 type
occurred in April (first observed 24 Apr 2005) in Wuxi in Jiangsu Province,
and Tai'an in Shandong Province.
26 May 2005: China reported to the OIE that further Asia-1 outbreaks were
detected at
- Daxing in Beijing Municipality, and Sanhe in Hebei Province, both in
eastern China;
- Hebukesaier in Xingjian Uygur Province, located in western China, near
the Kazakhstan border.
Media reports
-------------
26 Oct 2004: FAO analysed media reports which suggested a serious situation
in western China, close to the Kazakhstan border (Yili prefecture in the
Xingjian Province), [where] FMD outbreaks were reported to be occurring
with a different character from usual ("the virus had mutated"). The same
report indicated that this region usually exports meat to other provinces
in China, and that the situation had provoked aggressive control measures
including slaughter. The outbreaks and virus type involved were not
reported to OIE or FAO. [see 20041026.2897].
24 May 2005: media reports were received of an FMD outbreak in Sichuan
province, type unknown. They reported that the initial outbreak was on 15
Apr 2005.[This outbreak had been reported by ProMED-mail on 22 Apr 2005;
see 20050422.1122].
15 Jun 2005: Media reports were received of Asia-1 infection in cattle in
Russian Federation (Busse, Amur Province, 120 kilometers northwest of
Blagoveshchensk). [as a matter of fact, a day earlier; see 20050614.1672].
This area is close to the Chinese border, but at least 1000 km from the
nearest outbreaks confirmed by the Chinese authorities in the reports
previously cited. The outbreak was subsequently confirmed in reports by the
Russian authorities to the OIE. This location of the outbreak suggests
infection is present in neighbouring regions of north-east China close to
the Russian Federation border.
Disease mapping and analysis
----------------------------
Virus type analysis; the genetic information received from the FAO and OIE
Reference Laboratories(WRL, Pirbright, UK, FGI-ARRIAH, Russia, and USDA
Plum Island USA) indicates a closer relationship of the Asia-1 viruses
isolated from the outbreaks in Hong Kong SAR to those from earlier
outbreaks in central Asia (Tajikistan) and west Asia (Afghanistan and
Pakistan), than with recent virus solates from other south Asian countries
(Nepal, India).
Pattern and implication of findings
-----------------------------------
The findings suggest that Asia-1 infection in central Asian countries in
2003 was followed by infection in ruminant livestock in Xinjian Province,
China. This would fit with media reports of a new disease pattern in the
similar livestock systems of north west China (Xingjian) in October 2004.
At some period and from an unknown source, the virus escaped to eastern
China. Given the very significant swine population of eastern China and
apparent export from Xingjian, it is possible that consumption by pigs of
waste or contaminated meat may have been the vehicle of spread.
Risk for other areas
--------------------
Western China; until information is provided to clarify [the] extent of
infection and efficacy of measures, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and
Mongolia in their border can be considered at risk. Other countries in
central Asia: these countries are at risk from continued infection within
the region and from endemic countries to the south. Intensified
surveillance and communication to OIE and FAO should assist to better
identify risk and provide early warning to neighbours to prevent further
spread.
FAO project support is available to assist countries concerned.
South East and East Asia: until information is provided to clarify the
extent of infection and efficacy of control measures, countries bordering
China to the south and east can be considered at risk on a geographical
basis. Other trade and long-distance transport links between these
countries may affect risk and should be considered. The report of FMDV
Asia-1 in far-east of Russian Federation (Amur oblast) would suggest
increased risk to the DPR of Korea and Republic of Korea.
Risk of international spread
----------------------------
The currently available information is limited. Each country needs to
conduct its own risk analysis. However, the distribution of the reports
suggests an increased incidence of infection, and this may contribute to
increased risk through the pathway of animal products, live animals or
other routes (such as contamination of fodder).
Throughout most of the FMD Asia-1 recorded distribution, pig populations
are insignificant compared to ruminant host numbers and density. The
extension of Asia-1 to eastern China may allow significant exposure of
pigs. In general for FMD, pig infections are of significance, since aerosol
excretion provides a potent source of airborne virus for ruminants, and the
virus contamination and survival in meat is more likely than in ruminants,
providing a vehicle for infection to spread to other locations (including
international). In such countries, disease establishment is almost always a
consequence of feeding pigs with food containing untreated ruminant or pig
products. The transmission of FMDV Asia-1 to and between pigs is little
studied, but can be expected to follow the norms established for other FMDV
types in pigs.

[This 7-page review, most kindly forwarded by FAO Animal Health Service, is
an exemplary outcome of their cooperative efforts with EMPRES, EUFMD, and
the unique, indispensable FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright. Together with other international and regional institutions,
particularly the OIE, these institutions lead international efforts in the
surveillance, prevention and control of FMD.
The report includes also the following maps:
1. locations of reported FMD outbreaks in 2005, and of an unconfirmed
epidemic in 2004;
2. predicted bovine density map for central-east Asia, illustrating the
apparent gap between cattle populations in western China/central Asia and
eastern China;
3. predicted Bovine density map, illustrating areas of significant bovine
density extending across the borders of several central Asian countries;
4. predicted buffalo density map for central-east Asia;
5. predicted swine density map for central-east Asia.
According to the disease-notification report received by the OIE on 23 Mar
2005 from the Director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) in Hong Kong, the FMD lesions were observed on 9 Mar 2005
in 16 cattle held in a lairage ("area where animals are held prior to
slaughter in an abattoir") in a Sheung Shui slaughterhouse. The report did
not specify their origin, but it is rather clear the cattle had come to the
"New Territories" from mainland China. This is apparent from 2
epidemiological remarks included in the report:
"1. Surveillance and testing of local pig herds have revealed the presence
of FMD virus serotype O, which is endemic in Hong Kong and for which there
is in place a vaccination programme, but no evidence of serotype Asia 1 had
been found till now;
2. There is only one cattle farm in Hong Kong."
EMPRES and EUFMD are 2 animal-disease-related entities under FAO's
umbrella. EMPRES is "Emerging Prevention System for Transboundary Animal
and Plant Pests and Diseases"
(<http://www.fao.org/ag/AGA/AGAH/EMPRES/index.asp>). EUFMD, the European
Commission for the Control of FMD, was established under the auspices of
the FAO in 1954 with the initial goal of combating FMD in Europe. The
Commission is primarily a forum to foster cooperation between member
countries and to coordinate their efforts to prevent and control FMD. It
also provides technical expertise, epidemiological information, and advice
to member countries.
