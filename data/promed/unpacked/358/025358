Colombia: rabid bats kill 13 children in the Choco region
-----------------------------------------------
13 children have died of rabies, in Colombia's jungles, after being bitten
by bats [over the course of a 12-month period; see the following report. -
Mod.CP]. Tribal elders in the Choco region at first blamed evil spirits,
when the children were struck down with headaches, neck pains, and paralysis.

Colombia: 13 cases of suspected bat-associated rabies in children
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry for Social Welfare hopes to control [a suspected outbreak of
bat-transmitted rabies] through an emergency order, which will remain in
force for 3 months. The victims were reported in a low isolated area near
the Baudo river, which opens into the Pacific ocean. The government has
stated that no new cases have been reported. During the past 12 months, a
total of 13 individuals have died, apparently as a result of this disease
[rabies], which attacks the nervous system. However, sources in the
Ministry stated that, of the 13 fatalities, most of whom were children,
rabies virus infection has been confirmed clinically in only 2 cases.
According to the latest report from the Administrative Health Department at
Choco, and, the medical commission of the Pizarro city council, no new
cases of [suspected rabies] or deaths have been recorded following a
surveillance operation carried out among the most remote communities along
the banks of the Purricha river, located northward [from/to?] Birrinchao,
in the Bajo Baudo region.
Rabies vaccine and immune globulin were administered to 160 people, and
vaccine coverage is planned for at least 2000 people living in the
aforementioned region. According to the State News Service, the Ministry
sent 1000 doses of rabies immune globulin, 7000 doses of canine rabies
vaccine, [and other supplies] to the affected area.

[The press note suggests, but does not confirm, that this is an outbreak
associated with exposure to vampire bat bites. Generally, rabies cases
related with accidental non-hematophagous bat bites are isolated and
occasional. Recently, ProMED-mail (see below) reported the occurrence of
another severe rabies outbreak caused by vampire bat bites in the Brazilian
Amazon region, which was, apparently, triggered by ecological factors
related to deforestation activities. - Mod.JT]
[The decision to supply canine rabies vaccine in the control of an outbreak
of rabies thought to be transmitted to humans from bats suggests that,
perhaps, not all the cases can be connected to bat-bites. The predominance
of children among the victims could be explained by greater contact with
domestic dogs during play. - Mod.CP]
