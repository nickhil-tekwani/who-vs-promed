[1] Alabama: bait distribution

Hundreds of thousands of rabies oral vaccination baits will be dropped over several north Alabama counties to combat a significant public health threat in your backyard.

The USDA will fly over Jefferson, Shelby, Tuscaloosa, and Morgan counties through 6 Oct [2020] on a mission to drop the vaccination baits in areas where raccoons and coyotes can eat them. The goal is to stop the spread of the deadly viral disease among wild animals and protect pets and people.

Authorities say it is best to leave the bait where you find it unless it is on your lawn or driveway, where it is not likely to attract a raccoon, fox, or coyote. While wearing a glove, you can move the bait to a wooded area where a wild animal will be more likely to find it and get the protection against rabies.

Rabies infects the brain and spinal cord of mammals and is spread from exposure to saliva or nervous tissue from an infected animal, usually through a bite.

The Alabama Department of Public Health tracks rabies cases. So far in 2020, 40 cases have been confirmed across Alabama.

Jefferson County has the most with 5 [cases]. Those 5 cases involve 3 raccoons and 2 bats. Raccoons make up the majority of rabies cases in Alabama each year.

The coyote that was killed after attacking 3 people in Rockville, Maryland, on Thursday [1 Oct 2020] tested positive for rabies, town officials announced Friday [2 Oct 2020].

The coyote attacked a 59-year-old woman and her dog at about 10 a.m. Thursday [2 Oct 2020] around Windsor Court, a 12-year-old boy on the Upper Watts Branch Trail at Nelson Street and College Parkway, and a 39-year-old woman around Redland and Gaither roads, the town said in a release. The 3 people were treated and released for injuries; the dog is being quarantined.

The Rockville police said they found the coyote along West Gude Drive at about 4:45 p.m., and the coyote charged at an officer. The officer shot the coyote, who ran into a wooded area near Aster Boulevard and Carnation Drive. They found the coyote with a thermal imaging camera and put it down.

Rockville asked anyone who may have had contact with the coyote to call the Montgomery County Health Department to talk about what should be done next.

Rabies is fatal to people if it is left untreated.

Henrico County Police confirmed the 5th rabies case of 2020 in the county.

On 1 Oct [2020], Henrico Police Animal Protection responded to the 3000 block of Silverbush Court in the Brookland District for the report of an aggressive raccoon. Officers discovered a resident had been chased by a raccoon as they exited their home to walk to their car. The resident was able to escape from the animal after it had initially grabbed them by the shoe.

The raccoon was submitted to the State Lab for testing and was tested positive for rabies. The person involved in the incident has been notified and is consulting with the Health Department. There were no additional animal or human exposures reported.

Henrico Police Animal Protection reminds everyone to be sure to keep their pets' rabies vaccinations current to ensure the safety of their pets and the community.

On 17 Oct [2020] from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., the Henrico County Police Division will provide rabies vaccines for dogs and cats. Pet owners must register and pay at the cashier's office in the Administration Building before seeing a veterinarian on the 1st level of the parking deck. Those who plan on attending should wear a protective face mask and maintain social distancing due to COVID-19. Each vaccine costs $10.00 and must be paid in cash.

Please report abnormal wildlife behavior and any possible rabies exposures to the Henrico Police Non-Emergency Communications Center.

A cat in Sparta has tested positive for rabies after confirmation by the New York State Department of Health. Livingston County Public Health Director Jennifer Rodriguez said test results came back positive on Thu 1 Oct 2020.

The cat, which was a feral kitten, had come in contact with 16 people before testing took place. Each person will need to undergo rabies post-exposure treatment.

Mammals are at risk of contracting the deadly rabies virus, which attacks the central nervous system. It is most often found in raccoons, skunks, and bats in Livingston County.

Signs of rabies include an inability to walk, a "drunken" appearance, drooling, aggressive behavior, and no desire for eating or drinking.

All potential rabies exposure incidents should always be reported to your county's Department of Health.

A raccoon that attacked a young child in Arlington had rabies. It happened Wednesday [14 Oct 2020] afternoon in the family's backyard on Fountain Road. The child's mother stopped the attack and chased the animal away. The child suffered bites and scratches.

Arlington Police captured a large lethargic raccoon nearby, which tested positive for rabies. The raccoon was humanely euthanized.

"While we do not believe there is any current danger to the community, we wanted to notify residents about this incident so they can be vigilant about protecting their loved ones and pets," Arlington Police Chief Julie Flaherty said.

The child, who is under the age of 5, is expected to be OK.

[Those who have been exposed are reminded to wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention. Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is needed; without it, rabies is almost always a deadly disease.

We need to build a barrier between this disease and ourselves. One way of building it is to vaccine our animals. Most counties have some type of rabies ordinance requiring pets to be vaccinated. The wise owner will make sure pets and livestock are vaccinated.

Almost any mammal is susceptible to the rabies virus. Don't take chances with your life. If they are pets, however large or small, vaccinate them. Most counties/states have a rabies prevention law. Vaccinating your pet forms a barrier between you and the disease as well as protecting your pet.

Once exposed, unvaccinated animals, companion animals, or our livestock will be euthanized. Exposed individuals are advised to take post-exposure prophylaxis.

If you come into contact with wildlife, remember they can become infected with rabies. Be cautious of them. Animals normally afraid of you may appear more likely to come to you. Sometimes the animal may be aggressive, but sometimes the dumb form of rabies may mean the animal seems more friendly or outgoing than usual.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html). - Mod.TG]
