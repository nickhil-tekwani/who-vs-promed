The death of a 29 year old woman from pneumonic plague has brought the
number of plague victims in Peru to 3 in 2 months, the health ministry
said. The woman, who had been seriously ill for 36 days before succumbing
to the plague in the coastal province of Ascope, some 325 miles (520
kilometres) north west of Lima, died in hospital on Thursday [12 Aug 2010].

Since late June 2010 another 2 deaths were from bubonic plague, officials
said; and 31 more people have been infected. Health minister Oscar Ugarte
blamed the situation on the expansion of farming in the region that ha
prompted rodent infestations in nearby towns.

The last outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Peru was in 1994, which
killed 35 people and infected more than 1100 others.
