Confirmation of Measles Case in Santa Catarina
-----------------------------------------------
The Secretary of Health of Santa Catarina confirmed a case of measles in the
State yesterday [14 Jul 2005]. A serologic examination showed that a 38-year-
old male from Florianopolis contracted the disease in June. The Ministry of
Health affirmed that Brazil has not reported an autochthonous case of measles
since 2001. The 3 most recent occurrences [of measles] were imported: from
Japan (in 2002), and from Europe (2 [cases] in 2003). 424 persons who had a
history of contact with the patient were vaccinated.

[The ongoing effort to interrupt measles transmission in the Americas began in
late 1989 and was adopted as a regional goal in 1994. Between 1 Jan and 9 Jul
2005 there have been a total of 25 cases of measles (laboratory confirmed)
reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). All were in North
America: 21 were reported by the USA, 3 were reported by Canada and one was
reported by Mexico. (<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/FCH/IM/sme1127.pdf>).�
According to this table, the last reported case of Measles in Brazil was in the
49th Epidemiological Week (49th week of the year) in 2003 (see above the 2
cases imported from Europe).
According to the 2004 Immunization Technical Advisory Group for the Americas
document: "In the 10 years since the goal of measles elimination was adopted,
measles incidence has decreased by more than 99 percent in the Americas.
Transmission of the D6 measles virus genotype -- which began in 1995 and caused
large outbreaks in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and
Haiti -- was interrupted in September 2001. The subsequent transmission of the
D9 measles virus genotype in Venezuela was interrupted in November 2002, 14
months after it had started. The Venezuelan outbreak can be viewed as the last
instance of widespread endemic transmission of the measles virus in the
Americas.
In 2003 and 2004, approximately 100 cases were reported each year in the
Americas. Most of these cases were directly or indirectly linked to
importations of the measles virus from other Regions of the world." (see
<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/FCH/IM/TAG16_FinalReport_2004.pdf>)
It is unclear from the above newswire if this current case represents
autochthonous spread of measles virus in Brazil, or if there is a known,
documented contact of this patient with a traveller from a measles-endemic
country/reason. If the former, it would be a major setback for the planned
measles elimination effort in the Americas. More information from knowledgeable
sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
