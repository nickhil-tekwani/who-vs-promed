Alabama reported 36 cases of congenital syphilis in 2021, the highest number of cases since 2006. Since 2019, Alabama has had increasing cases with 15 in 2019, 23 in 2020, and alarmingly, 36 cases in 2021.

Congenital syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection passed from mother to child during pregnancy. Infants born with syphilis can have lifelong complications including skeletal and facial deformities, deafness, and blindness. Up to 40 percent are stillborn or die soon after birth. Not all babies have symptoms at birth. Babies who do not get treatment for congenital syphilis and develop symptoms later can die from the infection, be developmentally delayed, or have seizures.

In a joint effort of the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the Alabama Medicaid Agency to stop the rise of syphilis, healthcare providers and the public are reminded that ADPH offers free syphilis testing and treatment for pregnant women and their partners. Testing is recommended both at the initial prenatal visit and again early in the third trimester of pregnancy, regardless of risk factors. Forty-four percent of these pregnant women had a negative syphilis test result at the first prenatal testing but a positive test close to or during labor and delivery.

Congenital syphilis is a preventable condition. As syphilis rates of childbearing females increase, congenital syphilis rates also increase. Of reported cases in Alabama, 79 percent of the mothers who delivered infants with congenital syphilis received prenatal care, but prevention opportunities were missed. The most missed opportunities to prevent congenital syphilis among prenatal care recipients in Alabama were the lack of syphilis diagnosis in the early 3rd trimester.

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most contagious stages of the disease, reached historic lows with fewer than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, by 2015, 23 872 cases of P&S syphilis were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates had increased in every region of the United States, in every age group over 15 years, and across almost every race/ethnicity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6089383/).

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the United States was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, in the years 2013-2015, P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, rates in women have increased substantially in recent years, increasing 21% during 2019-2020 and 147% during 2016-2020, suggesting that the heterosexual syphilis epidemic continues to rapidly increase in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm).

Trends in the number of congenital syphilis cases reflect rates of P&S syphilis among reproductive aged women. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2014, the incidence rate of reported congenital syphilis cases in the US was 11.6 cases per 100 000 live births (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6444a3.htm). By 2020, the national congenital syphilis rate of 57.3 cases per 100 000 live births represents 394% increase relative to 2014 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm).

A history of incarceration, illicit drug use, and homelessness have been repeatedly cited in prior ProMED posts on the rising incidence of syphilis in the USA. During 2013-2017, the proportion of P&S syphilis cases that reported illicit drug use within the past 12 months more than doubled among women and men who have sex with women (MSW) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/dstdp/DCL-SyphilisRiskMMWR-feb2019.pdf).

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Congenital syphilis occurs when a child is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40% of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time that pregnancy is confirmed. Testing should be repeated for pregnant women at high risk and in areas of high prevalence at the beginning of the 3rd trimester and at delivery. The 2021 US CDC guidelines for syphilis screening in pregnancy can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/syphilis-pregnancy.htm:

"Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who at the time of delivery has no prenatal care history or has been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs; has had another STI during pregnancy; or has had multiple sex partners, a new partner, or a partner with an STI) should have the results of a syphilis serologic test documented before discharge."

In a CDC study of about 1300 cases of congenital syphilis reported nationwide in 2018, "missed opportunities" for prevention of congenital syphilis occurred, which varied by region (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6922a1.htm). Racial/ethnic disparities existed within the highest morbidity regions: in the South, the most commonly missed prevention opportunity among white mothers of infants with congenital syphilis was no timely prenatal care and no timely syphilis testing (31.6%), whereas among black and Hispanic mothers, no adequate maternal treatment despite a timely syphilis diagnosis (37%) was the commonest. These differences in the missed prevention opportunities require strategies that are tailored to local situations.

Poverty and other social determinants have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. More information on factors driving this increase in syphilis in Alabama would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
