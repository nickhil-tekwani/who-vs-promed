The administrator of the territory of Mwenga, Bundya Kika, announced a new epidemic of cholera in this politico-administrative entity of South Kivu. In an interview with Radio Okapi on Tue, 7 Sep 2021, he said he noted 90 new cases in one week with 8 cases of death recorded, specifically in the Kitutu health zone, in the Wamuzimu chiefdom, in the south of Mwenga territory.

"In the Kitutu health zone, there is a cholera disease epidemic. We have already made an official statement. In the past month, there was suspicion of this disease, since many people had diarrhea and vomiting. We took samples. They were sent to the lab from Bukavu for analysis. And this is what confirmed that really it is not diarrhea disease but is cholera," confirmed the administrator of the territory. He explained that the lack of drinking water and the pollution of a local river are among the causes of the resurgence of cholera in Kitutu.

"What we have noticed is linked to the shortage of drinking water and also the water polluted by certain companies which exploited gold, on the Elila river. A large part of the population of Kitutu consumed this as drinking water," Bundya Kika said.

He said he has already taken steps to combat this epidemic: "We have had a lot of meetings with a lot of layers to educate them on how they should behave in this period when the epidemic is raging in Kitutu. And they must respect the hygienic measures which are decreed by the health technicians," indicated Bundya Kika.

[2] Cholera - Niger

An epidemic of cholera that has struck 6 regions in southern Niger has claimed 104 lives, the health ministry said on Fri, 3 Sep 2021. It reported that 2874 cases of the water-borne disease had been recorded in the capital Niamey and 5 other regions -- Maradi, Zinder, Dosso, Tahoua and Tillaberi.

The toll as of 19 Aug 2021 stood at 35 fatalities out of 845 cases. But the number of dead hit 104 on 1 Sep 2021, with a "fatality rate of 4%", the health ministry said in a statement. Most infections are among people aged between 15 and 37, the ministry said. The authorities are working with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the UN, and EU on a prevention campaign, including disinfection of village wells and the distribution of water purification tablets.

Cholera is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated by human feces. The disease is treated with rehydration and antimicrobials and prevented with better hygiene and sanitation.

Niger's last epidemic of cholera was in 2018, when 78 people died out of a caseload of 3824 patients, according to the UN's WHO. The latest outbreak coincides with severe flooding, which increases exposure to cholera bacteria.

[Niger or the Niger, officially the Republic of the Niger, is a landlocked country in West Africa named after the Niger River. Niger is bordered by Nigeria to the south, where, as reported below, a large outbreak of cholera has been occurring especially in the north of Nigeria.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said 2141 people have died of cholera out of 65 145 suspected cases logged by 2 Sep 2021.

The deaths and cases were reported by 23 states, most of them in the northern part of Nigeria and the Federal capital of Abuja. The NCDC disclosed this in its Cholera Situation weekly epidemiological report posted on its official website, on Mon 6 Sep 2021. There was a 62% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 33 (2127) when compared with the 3098 cases in week 32 [2021].

According to the report, Bauchi with 855 cases, Katsina with 396 cases and Kano's 306 cases accounted for 73.2% of 2127 suspected cases reported in week 34 [2021]. The others were: Yobe (162), Zamfara (80), Niger (78), Borno (67), Sokoto (45), Kaduna (41), Gombe (21), FCT (18), Kebbi (17), Adamawa (15), Taraba (13), Nasarawa (10), Plateau (2), and Jigawa (1). The suspected cases were registered since the beginning of 2021, with children aged 5 - 14 years as the most affected age group for both male and female.

The public health agency added that of the cases reported, there were 48 deaths from Bauchi (10), Kano (7), Katsina (6), Taraba (5), Zamfara (4), Sokoto (4), Borno (4), Niger (3), Nasarawa (2), Kebbi (1), Yobe (1), and Kaduna (1) states with a CFR of 2.3%.

Cholera is a waterborne disease and the risk of transmission is higher where there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply.

The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation, endanger the safety of water used for drinking and for personal use. These lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera and without proper WASH [Water, Sanitation and Hygiene], Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths.

The long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation, and hygiene. Cholera is also preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately.

[Although not stated specifically, it is likely that the report in [5] is an outbreak of cholera. West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India along the Bay of Bengal. It can be seen on a map of India at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal#/media/File:IN-WB.svg.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
