Rabid raccoons have been discovered in Manhattan for the 1st time since 2011, leading the health department to warn residents to keep a close eye on their pets in and around an Inwood park. Of the rabies-stricken animals, 4 were found in Inwood Hill Park since January [2019], officials said. Parks Department workers quickly began hanging signs in the park, warning residents to keep their pets away from any raccoons in the area.

"Rabies is a serious illness that poses a danger for you and your pets," health commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot said in a statement. "Keep a close eye on your pets when you take them outside and if you see a wild animal -- such as a raccoon -- maintain a safe distance and do not approach it," Barbot added.

The discovery comes after a vaccination effort by the health department in 2011, when city workers trapped, vaccinated and released about 500 raccoons near Central Park. In addition to the 4 raccoons in Inwood, 2 other of the rabid animals have been found this year [2019] -- one in The Bronx and another on Staten Island.

[In the eastern USA, the main terrestrial reservoir of rabies is raccoons (see a map of distribution of major rabies virus variants among carnivores at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html).

A strategy that has been developed to control and contain the spread of rabies in raccoons in the eastern USA is the use of oral rabies vaccination (ORV), which can be implemented by distributing bait. ORV is accompanied by enhanced rabies surveillance, which in New York State is prioritized on the north western border, away from these cases (see https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed2030034). - Mod.PMB
