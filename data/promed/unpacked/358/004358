In South Australian [SA] piggeries, 2 new detections of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported, including in the Mid Murray.

This brings the total number of cases in SA to 9, including the detection of cases in Murray Bridge and Coorong in March [2022].

SA Pork assures shoppers there are no food safety issues associated with eating pork meat.

The 2 latest detections of JE on properties in the Mid Murray and Loxton Waikerie LGAs [local government areas] align with a February [2022] infection period. JE was known to be circulating in the South Australian environment at this time.

PIRSA [Primary Industry and Regions, South Australia] urges pig and horse owners to prevent Japanese encephalitis by controlling mosquitoes and protecting animals from mosquito bites.

Measures to reduce risk include
- controlling mosquitoes on your property;
- eliminating breeding areas and using chemicals responsibly;
- preventing mosquitoes from biting your pigs and horses;
- protecting yourself, your staff, and your family;
- reporting, if you suspect the virus, by calling your private vet or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline at 1800 675 888.

Japanese encephalitis is a notifiable disease; animal owners must report any cases of unexplained pig deaths, especially piglets, or unexplained horse illnesses to their vet or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

PIRSA and SA Health continue to work together with local industry and interstate counterparts to understand the implications, and to communicate to farmers how they can reduce the risk of human exposure.

[Surveillance efforts have led to the detection of an additional 2 JE-infected piggeries in South Australia, bringing the total in the state to 9. Focusing on vector mosquito breeding areas for control is prudent as is vector surveillance in other areas where piggeries may not be present for early warning of JE virus transmission. It is good to see that animal health and public health agencies are working together along with animal production associations, private pig producers, and, doubtless, veterinarians in private practice. - Mod.TY
