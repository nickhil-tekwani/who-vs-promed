Mystery of mass dolphin deaths
------------------------------
As many as 877 dead dolphins have washed up on the coast of northern Peru in the past few weeks. An investigation was underway to determine whether a viral infection by the marine morbillivirus was the cause of the mass deaths, the country's Deputy Environment Minister Gabriel Quijandria Acosta said yesterday.

The dead animals began to wash up over the past weeks on a 220-kilometre stretch of shore from Punta Aguja to Piura, around 700km northwest of the capital Lima.

About 80 per cent of the dolphins were found in an advanced state of decomposition, which made laboratory analysis more difficult, the minister said. The results for the tests are expected next week.

Mr Quijandria Acosta added that massive viral diseases had already been detected in [dolphins] in Peru, Mexico and the United States. He ruled out commercial fishing, poisoning and the effects of earthquakes as possible causes.

[Mr Quijandria Acosta said later that analyzes determined that these marine mammals were not killed by shot or clubbed, nor poisoned with pesticides or rat poison. They do not show any signs of having been poisoned with biotoxins generated by concentrations of algae during red tides. The studies also ruled out, although not 100%, disruption in their internal organs from the blows of seismic waves generated during oil and gas exploration at sea.

[Morbilliviruses have been reported as culprits of dolphin mortalities in the past, such as those of endangered Mediterranean striped dolphins (_Stenella coeruleoalba_) in 1990 and 1991, common dolphins (_Delphinus delphis ponticus_) from the Black Sea in 1994, and bottlenose dolphins (_Tursiops truncatus_) in the Gulf of Mexico from 1987 through 1994.

Another pathogen that should be taken into account is _Brucella_, a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium. In marine mammals, brucellosis is an emerging infectious disease. From the 1990s onward, previously unknown strains of _Brucella_ were detected in free-ranging pinnipeds [seals & ses-lions] and cetaceans [whales, porpoises & dolphins] from around the world. Brucellae isolated from cetaceans constitute 2 species with different preferred hosts, i.e. _B. phocoenae_ in porpoises and _B. delphini_ in dolphins. Pathogenic findings associated with brucellosis in cetaceans include placentitis, orchitis [inflammation of the testicles], abortion, mastitis [inflammation of the mammary glands], pneumonia, subcutaneous lesions, arthritis, nonsuppurative meningo-encephalitis and encephalitis. Brucella-induced neurologic disorders may lead to strandings. Hopefully the test results soon to be reported will shed light on this episode.
