The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (23 Jun 2015) investigating an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) at a residential child care centre in Causeway Bay, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.

The affected persons comprise 26 children -- 15 boys and 11 girls -- aged from 9 to 35 months, and a staff member. They have developed fever, oral ulcers and rash on their hands or feet since 14 June 2014. All of those affected sought medical attention, while 3 children were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for management, and 2 of them have been discharged. They are all currently in stable condition.

The rectal swab of an affected child tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the residential child care centre on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The centre has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.

"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet," a spokesman for the CHP explained.

To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:
* Maintain good air circulation;
* Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
* Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding 1 part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;
* Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;
* Avoid going to overcrowded places; and
* Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.

[The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) occurs and case counts are routinely reported.

Northern Hemisphere/ China: As of 31 May, there were reported 630 391 cases of HFMD, including 26 deaths in China for 2015. From 1 to 31 May 2015, 304 863 cases of HFMD had been reported, a 42 percent decrease compared with the same period in 2014 (528 777). The number of HFMD cases reported monthly in 2015 is following the seasonal pattern displayed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (Figure 1). It is likely that the figures for Hong Kong (SARI) follow the same seasonal pattern as elsewhere in China http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_20150616.pdf?ua=1.

HFMD usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear:
- inside the mouth (on the tongue, gums, or cheeks)
- on the palms of the hands or on the fingers
- on the soles of the feet or on the toes
- on the buttocks

The rash is not generally itchy and, in some cases, may develop on other parts of the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult. Infection by EV71 has been known to cause encephalitis or viral meningitis in rare cases.

Children and adolescents are the most commonly affected people. Adults are rarely infected, although pregnant women who have not been exposed to the virus before have a higher chance of becoming infected. Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.

A pregnant woman who is infected may show mild or no signs of illness. If she is infected just before her delivery, the infection can be transmitted to the newborn, resulting in only a mild illness in the baby. Rarely, multiple-organ infections occur.

During the acute phase, a person can infect others through secretions from the nose and throat. Discharge due to coughing and sneezing can cause the virus to be transmitted easily. Young children, who tend to drool, can also transmit the infection through their saliva.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease affects mainly children 5 years old and under, is caused by different types of enterovirus and in most forms is normally not severe. However, 1 type of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by the virus EV71, can have dramatic effects, including nerve damage, paralysis or death. EV71 also appears to be very pathogenic, and in recent years has caused large and worrying outbreaks in children in Asian countries, especially in China.
