Childhood virus kills 70 in Viet Nam
------------------------------------
A health official says a surging outbreak of hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) in Viet Nam has killed 70 people so far this year
[2011] and infected more than 23 000, mostly children under 5. Nguyen
Van Binh, head of the Ministry of Health's Department of Preventive
Medicine, was quoted by the Thanh Nien newspaper as saying most of the
cases have been reported in the country's south.

Enterovirus 71, or EV-71, is the dominant strain [virus] circulating
in Viet Nam. It can result in a more serious form of the common
childhood disease leading to paralysis, brain swelling [encephalitis]
or death.

This year's outbreak is a sharp [increase] from recent years. Since
2008, about 10 000 to 15 000 cases were reported per year with about
20 to 30 children dying annually.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. The disease usually begins
with a fever, poor appetite, malaise, and often with a sore throat.
One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores usually develop in the
mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often
become ulcers. The sores are usually located on the tongue, gums, and
inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days.
The rash has flat or raised red spots, sometimes with blisters. The
rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the
feet; it may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person
with HFMD may have only the rash or only the mouth sores.

HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_ which
includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and
enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of
HFMD in the North America, and other coxsackieviruses have been
associated with the illness elsewhere. In recent years Human
enterovirus 71 have been associated with outbreaks of HFMD in
South-East Asia responsible for more serious disease accompanied by
encephalitis in some children. The above report reveals that this more
serous form of HFMD, and associated encephalitis, is increasing in
prevalence in Viet Nam.

Very recently Tran CB, Nguyen HT, Phan HT, Tran NV, Wills B, Farrar J,
Santangelo JD, Simmons CP. have published a study of 'The
seroprevalence and seroincidence of enterovirus 71 infection in
infants and children in Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam' (PLoS One.
2011;6(7):e21116. Epub 2011 Jul 12.
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0021116).
They reported that: "Enterovirus 71 (EV71)-associated hand, foot and
mouth disease has emerged as a serious public health problem in South
East Asia over the last decade. To better understand the prevalence of
EV71 infection, we determined EV71 seroprevalence and seroincidence
amongst healthy infants and children in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. In
a cohort of 200 newborns, 55 percent of cord blood samples contained
EV71 neutralizing antibodies and these decayed to undetectable levels
by 6 months of age in 98 percent of infants. The EV71 neutralizing
antibody seroconversion rate was 5.6 percent in the 1st year and 14
percent in the 2nd year of life. In children 5-15 yrs of age,
seroprevalence of EV71 neutralizing antibodies was 84 percent and in
cord blood it was 55 percent. Taken together, these data suggest EV71
force of infection is high and highlights the need for more research
into its epidemiologyand pathogenesis in high disease burden
countries."
