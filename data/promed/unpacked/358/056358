Five children have died, and around 100 are infected in remote Rangamati villages of Bangladesh.

As many as 31 children and 2 young adults suffering from measles were brought to the Lama Upazila Health Complex by tractors after the death of another in Lailyapara village of the Mro tribe in Bandarban on 16 Mar 2020.

As many as 5 children have died from measles in remote villages of Baghaichhari Upazila in the hills district of Rangamati. Around 100 other children have been infected by the disease in 3 villages in Shialdaha under Sajek union, Rangamati Civil Surgeon Bipash Khisa told bdnews24.com on Thu [19 Mar 2020].

The deaths in Arunpara, Newthangpara and Haichpara occurred in the past week, Bipash said.

"The children suffer from pneumonia as well. We've sent an emergency medical team there. Another special team will go there by helicopter with the help of BGB [Border Guard Bangladesh] on Fri 20 Mar 2020," the civil surgeon said.

Sajek Union Council Chairman Nelson Chakma Nayan said he had informed the authorities when he had come to know about the outbreak. "But it was late, as the area is very remote," he said.

The Directorate General of Health Services had acted immediately on getting information about the outbreak, Baghaichhari Upazila Executive Officer Ahsan Habib Jitu said. "But the villages are very far away, and there is no alternative to walking to reach them," he said.

A similar measles outbreak among the Tripura villages in Chattogram's Sitakunda claimed the lives of 9 children in the span of 4 days in July 2017.

None of the nearly 400 villagers had taken measles vaccines, officials had said at the time.

In Bangladesh, about 85 percent of children come under the coverage of measles vaccine, which is "good coverage" compared to many countries in the region, Dr Stephen Chacko, who had been working as the medical officer for immunisation and vaccine development at the World Health Organization, had said.

In 2016, tests confirmed 165 measles cases in Bangladesh. None died.

After the 2014 large-scale measles vaccination, the number of cases declined the next year.

The special measles vaccination campaign, which is carried out every 4 years, was conducted in Bangladesh in 2018.

This year [2020], the campaign to vaccinate 34 million children aged between 9 months and 10 years for measles and rubella in Bangladesh had been scheduled to start on Wed [25 Mar 2020]. But it was postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

[2] Bangladesh: vaccination postponed

Another Tripura child died of measles in a remote area of Rangamati's Baghaichhari upazila.

PT, 9, passed away at her home in Lungthian Para early yesterday [23 Mar 2020], said Dr Istekhar Ahmed, upazila health and family planning officer.

Earlier, 5 indigenous children from remote Arun Tripura Para had died of measles since 26 Feb 2020. They all were from the Tripura community.

Local public representatives said children contracted measles in 5 paras of Sajek union early last month [February 2020].

Around 130 children, aged between 1 and 15 years, of Tripura and Chakma communities are infected with measles, said Harin Joy Tripura, a health assistant of Baghaichhari Upazila Health Complex.

The affected areas are Arun Tripura Para, Lungthian Tripua Para, Tarun Tripura Para, Kamalapur Chakma Para, and Kaikhya Tripura Para.

"A child died of measles in Arun Tripura Para on 26 Feb 2020. The 4 other children passed away on 27 Feb 2020, and 15, 16, 17 Mar 2020," said Harin Joy.

Community leaders alleged that neither doctors nor community health service providers visited their paras, as those were very remote areas. It takes around 10 hours to reach there from Rangamati town on foot. There is no other communication link between the town and the 5 paras.

Mithun Joy Tripura, karbari of Lungthian Para, said most of the children at their para were infected with measles. He said the villagers were panicked now.

Dr Istekhar said the sick children were still not out of danger as they were suffering from severe malnutrition.

Rangamati Civil Surgeon Bipash Khisa said they had a meeting with the programme manager of Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) in Baghaichhari yesterday [23 Mar 2020]. The meeting drew up a work plan to address the measles situation. He hoped the situation would improve soon.

Meanwhile, locals in Bandarban claimed that a child died of measles and that around 40 other people, including 33 children, were infected with the virus in a remote area of the hill district.

However, health officials claimed that the child died of an unknown disease.

In 2017, 9 children from the Tripura community died of measles in Chattogram's Sitakunda upazila.

[3] South Sudan: vaccination drive
Date: Thu 19 Mar 2020
Source: VOA News [abridged, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/africa/amid-challenges-south-sudan-vaccination-drive-tackles-measles


SM sits beside her children in front of their makeshift home in a shanty community in South Sudan's capital Juba. Six of her children have died of various illnesses. She's got 3 left.

"The 1st one died at 9 months. Another one died at the age of 10 months. Another one died when he was crawling, about 3 months," she tells VOA.

Moni's story highlights a sad fact: Millions of children in South Sudan do not get routine vaccinations. They are vulnerable to preventable illnesses.

While South Sudan is currently free of the coronavirus pandemic alarming the global community, the country is battling a severe measles outbreak, with over 4700 confirmed cases and 26 deaths since January 2019.

The government of South Sudan has partnered with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and ONE, the anti-poverty campaign co-founded by Irish musician and celebrity-activist Bono, to carry out a nationwide measles vaccination drive that aims to reach 2.5 million children by April 2020.

The campaign was launched in February 2020 at the only pediatric medical facility in the entire country, Al-Shabbah Children's Hospital. Situated in the heart of Juba, it provides healthcare to more than 5000 people monthly, reaching some of the poorest people in the city.

"We need to boost the vaccination coverage to protect children against measles outbreaks," says Dr. Makur Matur Kariom, the Ministry of Health's undersecretary. "Unfortunately, in South Sudan, routine vaccination coverage against measles remains low at only 59 percent."

Public health specialists recommend coverage not to fall below 90 percent. It's crucial to maintain that standard for measles, which is highly infectious. With poor coverage, outbreaks reoccur.

"[Measles] can cause rashes, eye infection, respiratory infections, diarrhea and even death," says Dr. Olushayo Olu, the WHO's South Sudan country representative.

One reason why childhood immunization coverage against measles is low in the country is due to the logistical challenges involved in keeping vaccines at near-freezing temperatures. It's not easy to do in South Sudan, the least electrified country in the world, where temperatures often soar above 40 C [104 F].

"We are able to keep these things at the correct temperature in the hospital here. That is the most important thing," says Dr. Felix Nyungura, the hospital's executive director. "Public electricity has not yet arrived in our place here. Although in some places, it is there. But now we are depending on solar power and electricity from a generator."

UNICEF is helping to restore what is known in healthcare terms as the cold-chain system, which was severely disrupted during the civil war that broke out in 2013.

"With the conflict, more than 50 percent of the cold chain equipment installed in the country was vandalized, and some of it looted," Dr. Patti Samuel, a UNICEF health specialist, tells VOA. He says UNICEF has installed cold-chain equipment, such as refrigerators, to run in about 55 percent of health facilities across the country.

South Sudan faces huge developmental challenges as a young nation mired in historic conflict, economic crisis, and grappling with rapid population growth. Only one percent of the government's 2019-2020 fiscal budget has been allocated to healthcare. In 2018, it was 2 percent.

"When your house is on fire, you just want to put out the fire, and, unfortunately, in South Sudan, the fire has been burning for so long and some of the basics of development have just not been prioritized," says Edwin Ikhuoria, ONE's Africa executive director.

He says governments in Africa do not adequately fund healthcare because politicians don't see it as a "sexy campaign," compared to other areas like infrastructure.

"But if health care is not well invested in, you're going to lose a lot in human capital," he says.

ONE tries to convince governments to increase domestic financing for primary healthcare and pushes for investments that help to end preventable childhood deaths.

Another reason immunization coverage is low is because people aren't informed. That's where community mobilizers like Agnes Anjack Alphonse come in. Volunteering for UNICEF, she's on the frontline in the effort to get the word out.

"Sometimes I knock on the doors," she says. "If they do not come, and I know that this house has kids, and they did not come, I'll go knock on the door. 'Hi, we are doing vaccine, why are you not coming?' They'll say, 'I'm busy.' I'll say, 'can I have your kids and I'll return them back?' They'll say it's OK."

Making the rounds in her neighborhood, she meets a mother whose daughter has not been vaccinated and gently persuades her to go to a medical facility.

The efforts are paying off. So far, the vaccination campaign has reached more than a million children, including Shejirina Moni's.

[4] Mexico (Valley of Mexico)
Date: Tue 24 Mar 2020
Source: Explica [abridged, edited]
https://www.explica.co/they-recorded-67-cases-of-measles-in-the-valley-of-mexico/


The Valley of Mexico currently faces 2 diseases that day by day infect a greater number of citizens. Not only has the so-called coronavirus pandemic caused the authorities to take preventive measures, measles became a latent risk.

Shortly after the health authorities began to implement preventive measures for Covid-19 throughout Mexico, it was revealed that 16 people were infected with measles, but, from 5-23 Mar 2020, cases have reached 67 infected.

It was the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health that released the report of confirmed measles cases in the Valley of Mexico. Although 62 cases were located in Mexico City, the rest occurred in people who live in the State of Mexico.

In 24 hours, a total of 20 cases were confirmed, most of which are found in the Gustavo A. Madero, Alvaro Obregon, Miguel Hidalgo and Cuajimalpa mayoralties.

The cases in the State of Mexico were located in the municipalities of Ecatepec, Naucalpan, Tecamac, Nezahualcoyotl and Tlalnepantla, which have infected cases in each one.

Of the 67 cases, only 10 of them had a history of vaccination for the disease.

It all started when last 5 Mar 2020, the health authorities of the capital announced the existence of an outbreak of measles in 16 people.

The information caused a stir, because all the cases were related to the North Male Preventive Prison, located at Jaime Nuno 155, Cuautepec Barrio Bajo, Guadalupe Chalma neighborhood, city hall Gustavo A. Madero.

According to the newspaper El Universal, among the confirmed infections was a minor of 8 years who was linked to one of the inmates.

Before more than 10 cases, the authorities decided to carry out a sweep inside the prison, that is, a vaccination campaign for the more than 3000 inmates incarcerated, but also for the personnel who work in the facilities, the custodians and the relatives who commonly visit the prisoners.

For the 8-year-old girl who was infected, El Heraldo de Mexico reported that a perimeter of 25 blocks around the house in which the minor lives, located in the Alvaro Obregon city hall, was swept. However, the general director of Epidemiology, Jose Luis Alomia Zegarra, clarified that the 1st measles patient registered was an imported case.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and is one of the leading causes of death in children. During 2017, measles took the lives of 110 000 children under the age of 5 around the world.

The disease begins to appear between 10 and 12 days after the 1st contact with the virus, as a runny nose, cough, red eyes, tears, and white spots appear on the inside of the cheeks.

The best known feature of the disease are red welts, known as anaxems, that appear between day 7 and 18 after contact.

[5] Impact of unrelated outbreaks on measles and other diseases
Date: Wed 8 Jan 2020 [note date]

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51028791


The number of people killed by a measles epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo has passed 6000 [in 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.

The WHO says the epidemic is the world's largest and fastest moving.

Around 310 000 suspected measles cases have been reported since the start of 2019, the WHO says.

The Congolese government and the WHO launched an emergency vaccination programme last September [2019]. More than 18 million children under 5 were vaccinated across the country in 2019, the WHO says.

But poor infrastructure, attacks on health centres and a lack of access to routine healthcare have all hindered efforts to stop the spread of the disease.

[I am posting this report from January 2020 to highlight the effect of an outbreak of one disease on other diseases that are endemic but not in the limelight. The impact of diversion of funds and focus on Ebola to the neglect of other agents was also evident in the DRC in January 2019 by the incidence of cholera (15 331 cases, 287 deaths), measles (161 397 cases, 3117 deaths) and malaria, the leading cause of death in the DRC, which kills more than 48 000 people every year. (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-08-2019-as-ebola-cases-reach-3000-in-drc-who-calls-on-partners-to-fulfill-promises-to-communities).

Because of limitation of funds and availability of health care workers, this is difficult, but public health practitioners and governments must try not to lose sight of endemic diseases afflicting the population. This can only be accomplished by maintaining a strong public health infrastructure with well-trained personnel. - Mod.LK]
