In general, ticks are increasing, there is no doubt about it, says tick expert Lars Lundqvist.

It is important to look up, or rather down, when you move in nature and in high humidity grass during the summer. This is where ticks thrive best. According to statistics from the Swedish Public Health Agency, the number of cases of TBE [tick-borne encephalitis], the viral disease spread by ticks, has doubled compared to last year [2020].

By 2020, we had 31 cases reported through the end of June, and this year [2021] the number is 62, says Public Health Agency investigative epidemiologist Marika Hjerkvist.

It is difficult to answer what lies behind the doubling. The biggest aspect is the weather, says Lars Lundqvist, affiliated with Lund University. Tick activity is highly dependent on the weather, ticks need heat and moisture. The activity of people also depends on the weather, as people go out and move around nature. I think a clear trend has been observed, says Lars Lundqvist.

He adds, "In general, the number of ticks is increasing, there is no doubt about that because there are more mammals, such as deer and wild boars, in the wild."

In May [2021], Apoteket and Doktor24 reported that the number of TBE vaccines had fallen by about 40 percent since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Usually, people are vaccinated in May and July. This year [2021], a large number of people were vaccinated against COVID-19 during the same period. According to the Swedish Public Health Agency, a week should pass between the TBE injection and the COVID-19 vaccine.

TBE
---
- TBE stands for tick-borne encephalitis.
- It is encephalitis caused by an encephalitis virus. This is transmitted, by ticks, from small mammals to humans.
- The 1st signs of the disease are observed 1-2 weeks after infection. The disease begins with a fever.
- There is no known cure.
- In Sweden, TBE is more common around the Baltic Sea, and in the areas around Lake Vattern and Lake Vanern. But the disease has spread to the west coast, and it occurs in large parts of southern and central Sweden.
- Most cases in Sweden get sick during the summer.

[The increase in cases is reportedly due to climatic conditions favorable to tick vectors and lack of the usual vaccination of people frequenting tick habitats. In July 2016 an invasive tick, taiga tick, _Ixodes persulcatus_, was found in n 9 out of 36 field localities in the Bothnian Bay area in Sweden (see Invasive tick - Sweden: (Bothnian Bay) 20160718.4351669). Although the report above does not mention which tick species is transmitting TBE virus this year (2021), the taiga tick spreads a more dangerous far eastern form of the TBE virus which can have a mortality rate of up to 30 percent.

Sweden has had cases of the European TBE subtype in the past. Although the arrival of the taiga tick is of concern, the good news so far is that there is no indication that far eastern TBE subtype virus has arrived with it. However, with the real possibility of additional introduction of this tick into Sweden, there is the risk that the more virulent virus will come with it, as well. In the meantime, the taiga tick very likely will expand its range in the country, as the report above indicates. Intensification of surveillance of both tick and virus would be prudent. - Mod.TY
