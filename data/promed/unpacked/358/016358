The Wayne County Public Health Department has received notification from the New York State Department of Health of a positive report of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a 2nd horse in the town of Macedon.

The horse died at an undisclosed farm in the Town of Macedon.

Wayne County Public Health [WCPH] has been actively trapping mosquitoes in the towns of Rose and Galen and sending them for testing on a weekly basis.

A mosquito pool in Galen has been found to have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). Currently no pools of mosquitoes have tested positive for EEE. Unvaccinated horses are very vulnerable to the EEE virus (EEEV) and die from the disease if infected. It is important to understand that even though the mosquito pools tested for EEE have resulted as negative, the death of 2 horses from EEE indicates there are mosquitoes in Wayne County carrying the EEEV.

EEE is a rare disease caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. EEEV is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). EEE is a rare illness in humans and is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can affect humans, birds, horses and other mammals. Disease transmission does not occur directly from person to person, mammal to mammal, or mammal to person.

Mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn. However, we are rapidly approaching the end of the season of flight activity by biting mosquitoes due to the seasonable low nighttime temperatures. WCPH is urging residents to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and protect themselves from potential exposure to the mosquito born illness until the 1st hard frost by:
- Using insect repellent properly. Those that contain DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus are most effective but should be used with care. Read the product label and use according to package instructions.
- Limiting outdoor activities in areas where mosquitoes are most active and between dusk and dawn which is the peak mosquito biting time.
- If you have to be outside, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, shoes and socks as weather permits.
- Repairing or replacing all window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.
- Reducing or eliminating all standing water.
- Emptying or disposing of pails, cans, flower pots, or similar water-holding containers.
- Clearing roof gutters, removing leaf debris from yards and gardens, and cleaning vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds.
- Turning over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use.
- Cleaning and chlorinating swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs and drain pool covers.
- Changing the water in birdbaths and horse troughs twice a week.
- Disposing properly of old tires.
- Most people bitten by an EEE infected mosquito will not develop any symptoms. Severe cases of EEE infection in humans begin with a sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, encephalitis and coma.
- Most people bitten by a WNV infected mosquito also will not develop any symptoms. About 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months. Severe cases can cause encephalitis.
- There is no human vaccine for EEE or WNV. The best way to protect yourself is to keep mosquitoes from biting you.
- There are EEE and WNV vaccines available for horses. Call your veterinarian for further information.

For further information and or questions on EEE, contact the Wayne County Public Health Department at 946-5749, weekdays between 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.

[This article does not mention that there is a very effective combination vaccine for both EEE and WNV for horses. Horse owners should vaccinate immediately. Clearly the virus is circulating in the area. The immunity to EEE wanes relatively quickly and horses should be vaccinated approximately every 4 months to ensure their protection. - Mod.TG
