Polio outbreak in Tajikistan raises risk of reigniting spread elsewhere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A large polio outbreak in Tajikistan -- Europe's 1st in years -- has
the potential to further spread the dangerous virus to other regions
of the world, the Canadian Medical Association Journal warned
Wednesday [23 Jun 2010]. [While Tajikistan is geographically located
in Asia, it is a member of EURO -- the European Regional Office of
the World Health Organization, hence the statement that it is the 1st
outbreak in Europe in years. - Mod.MPP] Top editors of the journal
suggested the outbreak, the largest since 2005 in a country where
polio is not endemic, serves as a reminder that until polio is
eradicated, the risk of renewed spread remains.

"In all countries certified as polio-free, including Canada, the
Tajikistan outbreak should be clanging alarm bells," editor-in-chief
Dr. Paul Hebert and Dr. Noni MacDonald, section editor for public
health, wrote in the editorial which was published online. "The key
message here is pretty straightforward. You can't let your guard down
on this one because . . . if you do, pop! There it goes. Another
outbreak," Hebert said in an interview.

Others questioned whether the risk to Canada is as grave as Hebert
and MacDonald suggested, but agreed with the overall principle that
no country is safe from polio while the virus continues to spread in
parts of the globe.

"It clearly is a wake up call," said Dr. John Spika, director general
of the Public Health Agency of Canada's centre for immunization and
respiratory infectious diseases. Spika said Canadian polio vaccine
coverage rates are generally high enough to prevent spread, but he
acknowledged there are pockets of children who aren't vaccinated,
either because of religious reasons or because their parents
subscribe to anti-vaccine sentiments. "The incredible success of
immunization programs is leading to some complacency," he said. "And
therefore our challenge is really how do we continue to maintain high
coverage in the face of that very low perceived risk of disease and
growing perceived risk that there's injury following vaccination?"

The Tajikistan outbreak is the latest in a string of setbacks for the
global polio eradication initiative, the 22-year-old campaign aimed
at permanently stopping the spread of the disease. The campaign,
jointly run by the World Health Organization, Rotary International,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF, has to date spent
USD 8 billion trying to achieve the goal.

Only 4 countries remain on the list of nations that have never
interrupted spread of polio -- Nigeria, India, Pakistan and
Afghanistan. And after years of setbacks, enormous progress has been
made in these countries this year [2010]. But then in April [2010]
polio was found in Tajikistan. Analysis of the viruses show the
outbreak was the product of an importation from northern India.

As of Wednesday [23 Jun 2010], there have been 275 confirmed cases in
the outbreak and lab results are pending on about 300 more suspected
cases, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the Canadian who heads WHO's polio
eradication team. "This is a big one, that's for sure," he said of
the outbreak in an interview from Geneva.

The last outbreak of this size in a previously polio-free country was
in Yemen in 2005, when 478 cases were reported, he said. "Outbreaks
of this size are very rare now. You see them in India and Nigeria.
But outside of that, you never see an outbreak this big anymore.
Very, very rare." Aylward said there are signs the outbreak is coming
under control. There have been no new cases reported in the past 10
days. But control doesn't count in polio, he said; stopping
transmission has to be the goal.

And that's the message of the editorial Aylward wanted to highlight.
Given the tremendous cost of the effort and the fact that the virus
continues to foil the Herculean efforts to wipe it out, some
scientists have questioned whether eradication is achievable. It
would be better, some suggest, to try to aim for controlling polio at
low levels and use the money devoted to eradication for broader
public health purposes.

Aylward said the Tajikistan outbreak shows the shortcomings of that
argument. The world is currently spending USD 800 million a year to
keep polio to fewer than 1000 cases a year, he said. "(But) it's not
going to stay there if you don't finish. Those funds are going to
disappear." He likened the continued spread of polio viruses to
sparks from a fire. "They don't always catch. But then when it
catches, it can explode."

And pockets of unvaccinated individuals in Canada or other developed
countries could provide those sparks an opportunity to ignite,
Aylward said -- though he, like Spika, believes polio vaccine
coverage rates are high enough here that a large outbreak is
unlikely. "It's harder for the spark to catch," said Aylward. "But
the bigger point they're making -- that look, we are still at risk of
the disease -- is very, very true."

[Canada's concern about pockets of susceptibles is not without merit,
as the last polio outbreak in Canada in 1978/1979 involved pockets of
susceptibles not vaccinated due to religious objection. At that time
there were 11 paralytic cases among unimmunized individuals in
religious groups in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, who had
contact with imported cases. Bijkerk H. Poliomyelitis epidemic in the
Netherlands, 1978. Dev Biol Stand. 1979;43:195-206. (see
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/poliomyelitis-eng.php>).

The importations were related to an outbreak in the Netherlands where
there were 110 cases among members of the same religious group that
were unimmunized (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/230110>).
There were 15 cases in the USA, among similar religious groups, also
unimmunized in the USA during 1978/1979 related to this outbreak as
well. MMWR. Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Follow-Up on
Poliomyelitis -- United States, Canada, Netherlands. 19 Dec 1997.

As of 11 Jun 2010, Tajikistan had reported 607 acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) cases; 239 were laboratory confirmed for wild
poliovirus type 1, and 22 had been confirmed negative. There had been
11 deaths among the 239 confirmed poliomyelitis (polio) cases (4.6
percent). A total of 3 rounds of national immunization days (NIDs)
had taken place in Tajikistan and 2 rounds in Uzbekistan. In both,
coverage was extremely high: more than 99 percent of the targeted
populations. Further rounds are expected in both countries, and
Kyrgyzstan will begin an immunization campaign in July [2010].

[According the most recent polio eradication website case count
update (as of 15 Jun 2010), there have been 239 confirmed cases of
polio in Tajikistan (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp> for the case count
table by country). While the table does not list cases in Russia
related to this outbreak, there is a summary statement below the
table that mentions that wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been
identified in 4 AFP cases in Russia, and epidemiologic studies of
these cases are presently underway to determine source of exposure
and possible relationship to the ongoing outbreak in Tajikistan.

There have been a total of 349 cases of WPV confirmed polio in the
world since January 2010, of which 58 were in endemic countries, and
291 were in non-endemic countries. Below is a table from on the
reported cases by country for 2010 as of 15 Jun 2010 from
polioeradication case count website.

Country: Year-to-date 2010 / Year-to-date 2009 / Total 2009 / Date of
onset most recent case
Pakistan: 24 / 18 / 89 / 29 May 2010
Tajikistan: 239 / 0 / 0 / 21 May 2010
Afghanistan: 10 / 8 / 38 / 15 May 2010
Angola: 8 / 9 / 29 / 3 May 2010
Senegal: 18 / 0 / 0 / 30 Apr 2010
India: 21 / 67 / 741 / 29 Apr 2010
Mauritania: 5 / 0 / 13 / 28 Apr 2010
Nigeria: 3 / 312 / 388 / 18 Apr 2010
Chad: 14 / 1 / 64 / 5 Apr 2010
Niger: 2 / 13 / 15 / 1 Apr 2010
Mali: 2 / 1 / 2 / 30 Mar 2010
Liberia: 1 / 1 / 11 / 3 Mar 2010
Sierra Leone: 1 / 0 / 11 / 28 Feb 2010
Nepal: 1 / 0 / 0 / 19 Feb 2010

In the last update on this outbreak posted by ProMED-mail on 12 Jun
2010 (see archive 20100612.1972), there had been 564 AFP cases
reported of which 183 had laboratory confirmation of WPV1 infection,
and 14 cases were negative for WPV. According to the WHO EURO update
in part [2] of this posting, there is mention that as of 11 Jun 2010
there have been 607 AFP cases reported of which 239 were confirmed to
be due to WPV1 infection and 22 had been confirmed as not due to
polio ("negative"). Hence, there remain 356 known AFP cases still
pending confirmatory results, suggesting that the numbers of
confirmed cases of polio in this current outbreak will most likely
continue to increase as more information on these cases becomes available.
