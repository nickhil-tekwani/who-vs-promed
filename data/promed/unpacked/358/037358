Scotland's red squirrels are facing a new threat from a form of leprosy, according to scientists in Edinburgh. Since 2006, 6 cases caused by a bacteria similar to _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_ have been confirmed in the squirrels. It is the 1st time the disease has been found in the species and little is known about the spread of the potentially fatal disease.

Conservationists, however, say there are other more significant threats to red squirrels such as squirrel pox.

Scientists are urging the public to report sightings of squirrels which may be suffering from leprosy. They said the information would help them build up a more detailed understanding of the disease.

There is no suggestion of any risk to human health.

Infected animals have been found from Dumfries and Galloway to the Moray Firth.

Professor Anna Meredith of the Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies at Edinburgh University is leading the research. She told BBC Scotland: "We suspect this disease is more widespread than the 6 cases we have confirmed. Red squirrels are in decline. They are threatened by the grey squirrel and already face the major threat of the squirrel pox virus. Symptoms of squirrel pox virus include hair loss and severe swelling to the snout, eyelids, ears and feet. This is the last thing that they need -- another disease which could potentially threaten the population."

However conservationists from Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels said the leprosy infection appeared to be extremely rare and would not be a major threat to the wider population.

Project manager for Mel Tonkin, said: "Much more of a threat is the squirrel pox virus which is virtually always fatal to red squirrels, but finds a reservoir in grey squirrels. Research indicates that squirrel pox disease is responsible for accelerating the rate with which grey squirrels have replaced red squirrels throughout most of England and Wales. However, the conservation community has shown that red squirrel populations can be protected in the midst of grey squirrels carrying the virus by keeping the grey squirrel population density at a very low level."

Researchers in Edinburgh investigating the leprosy infection said dead red squirrels could be sent to them by post provided they were appropriately packaged. But they advised members of the public to follow basic hygiene rules before and after handling dead squirrels.

[With the introduction of the grey squirrel (_Sciurus carolinensis_) in Great Britain, along came the squirrel pox virus. This virus circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations of the eastern part of North America. Infection with this virus results in fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK. This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 2 decades. A new pathogen able to cause disease, potentially affecting fitness and survival in red squirrel is terrible news.

The etiology, ecology, and significance of the disease caused by this novel mycobacterium ought to be investigated. Apparently, the microorganism is similar to _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, a newly discovered pathogen that was found to be the cause of diffuse lepromatous leprosy, a unique form of leprosy endemic in Mexico and the Caribbean.
