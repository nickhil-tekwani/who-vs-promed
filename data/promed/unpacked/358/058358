Subject: Cholera epidemic in East Africa

We are an importer of Lake Victoria perch in Holland. Our factories are
based in Uganda. Since today there is a total ban on the imports of fresh
Victoria perch fillets into the EC. The regulation made by the Veterinary
Commitee of the EC is strange, in a way that they allow frozen fillets, but
refuse fresh fillets.
In Europe the imports of fresh fillets became a very big item and lots of
people are relying on the product. Even worse, in East Africa, more than
10,000 people are employed in this line of business. As you can
understand, factories will have to close down because of this problem.
Every factory in East Africa has its own medical staff, who are strictly
controlling employers on _Salmonella_ and cholera.
As human health is not our business, we don't know much about this
epidemic. Can you inform us on the present situation in East Africa,
forecast the period of time which the epidemic can last, and inform us
about the disease and the way to treat it, and how can we help to treat it.

[Firstly, being a veterinarian I am not the person to advise on the care &
treatment of human cases. Would any members with special knowledge advise
Frits DIRECTLY. Secondly, I doubt if anyone has information as to how long
this epidemic will last but comments based on informed experience are
welcome. Thirdly, thanks to Benadette Abela and Carlos dos Santos of FAO,
Rome, <Carlos.DosSantos@fao.org> I obtained a copy of the EC Commission
decision (23 Dec, 1997, 97/878/EC). The key parts are:
"Whereas within the meaning of Article 19 of Directive 90/675/EC the
necessary decisions must be adopted as regards the imports of certain
products from third countries where any cause likely to constitute a
serious danger for animal or human health appears or is spreading;
Whereas there is a cholera epidemic in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and
Mozambique and this disease presents a serious risk to human health, while
the cholera agent can communicate animal and animal products;
Whereas imports of fresh fishery products from, or originating in Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique should be prohibited;
Whereas processed and frozen fishery products from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania
and Mozambique should, on presentation for importation at the Community
border inspection posts, be sampled in order to demonstrate their
wholesomeness;
Whereas tests of this nature should be used to detect in particular the
presence of salmonellae and vibrios (_Vibrio cholerae_ and _V.
parahaemolyticus_).
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION
Article 1: This Decision shall apply to fishery products, fresh, frozen or
processed, originating in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique. It shall
not apply to fishery products caught, frozen and packaged in their final
packaging at sea and landed directly in Community territory.
Article 2: Member States shall prohibit the introduction in their territory
of fresh fishery products originating in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and
Mozambique.
Article 3: Member States shall, using appropriate sampling plans and
decision methods, subject each consignment of frozen or processed fishery
products originating in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique, with the
exception of sterilised products, to a microbiological test in order to
ensure that the products concerned do not present a hazard to human health.
The test must be carried out, in particular, with a view to detecting the
presence of salmonellae and, in the case of frozen products, vibrios
(_Vibrio cholerae_ and _V. parahaemolyticus_).
Article 4: Member States shall not authorize the introduction of the
fishery products in question in any territory or their consignment to
another Member State unless the results of the checks required are
favourable.

survival of on frozen (imported) frog legs and radiation
treatment ... FC Sang, 1987, A research note: Viability of _Vibrio
cholerae_ 01 on frog legs under frozen and refrigerated conditions and low
