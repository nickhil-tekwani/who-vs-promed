A NetCost Market listeriosis outbreak in Brooklyn, New York has sickened at least 3 people, according to a health alert [see below] from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The 3 patients have clinical isolates that are highly related by whole genome sequencing (WGS). All 3 patients live in Brooklyn.

And all 3 patients purchased ready-to-eat food from the deli counter at the same NetCost Market, which is located at 3100 Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. NetCost management is working closely with the Health Department and New York State Agriculture and Markets to make sure that the deli area is safe for consumers.

If you bought food from that deli counter before [5 Sep 2021], do not eat it, even if some has been consumed and no one has been sick yet. It can take up to 70 days for the symptoms of listeriosis to appear, and not every bit of a food may be contaminated with this pathogen. After you discard the food clean your refrigerator with a mild bleach solution to kill any bacteria since _Listeria monocytogenes_ can grow at fridge temperatures.

The patients are all over the age of 50 years. Diagnosis dates for these patients range from [30 Jun to 20 Jul 2021]. All 3 patients have been hospitalized. No deaths are associated with this cluster.

Officials have collected food and environmental samples from the facility, and test results found bacteria that were "highly related to the NYC clinical isolates by WGS."

Listeriosis is a reportable illness. All healthcare providers should consider this infection when evaluating people who said they ate food from a deli counter before they got sick and present with fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms consistent with a _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection [listeriosis].

This infection has a long incubation period [up to 70 days]. People who are more likely to become seriously ill include the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and anyone with a compromised immune system or chronic illness such as diabetes. Symptoms can include a high fever, stiff neck, muscle aches, and serious and severe headache. These symptoms can be preceded by nausea and diarrhea. Pregnant women may only feel mildly ill what they think is the flu, but this infection can cause stillbirth, miscarriage, premature labor, and severe infection in the newborn.

If you have eaten food purchased at that deli and have been ill with those symptoms, see your doctor. You may be part of this NetCost Market listeriosis outbreak.

2021 Alert no. 34: Investigation of a listeriosis cluster in Brooklyn
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please share this alert with all primary care, family medicine, emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, intensive care, laboratory medicine, and infection control staff in your facility

- The Health Department is investigating a cluster of 3 listeriosis patients with clinical isolates highly related by whole genome sequencing who all reside in Brooklyn.
- All 3 patients purchased ready-to-eat food from the deli counter at the same NetCost Market located at 3100 Ocean Ave in Brooklyn. (NetCost management has worked closely with the Health Department and New York State Agriculture and Markets to ensure that the deli area is safe for consumers at this time.)
- Patrons who have purchased food from this deli counter before [5 Sep 2021] should not eat the food and throw it out.
- Providers should consider listeriosis when evaluating patients who report eating food from a deli counter prior to illness and present with fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms consistent with _Listeria_ infection and request testing and treatment for _Listeria_.
- Providers and laboratories should report all confirmed cases of listeriosis to the New York City Health Department and laboratories should continue to send clinical isolates to the Public Health Laboratory for additional subtyping.

Dear colleagues,

The New York City (NYC) Health Department is investigating a cluster of 3 patients who tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_ and whose clinical isolates are highly related to each other by whole genome sequencing (WGS). All 3 patients reside in Brooklyn. Diagnosis dates for these patients ranged from [30 Jun to 20 Jul 21] and all were ≥ 50 years of age. All 3 patients were hospitalized and there have been no deaths associated with this cluster. All 3 patients reported shopping at NetCost Market (3100 Ocean Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11235) and purchasing ready-to-eat products from the deli counter prior to illness onset. Food and environmental specimens collected at the deli area were found to be highly related to the NYC clinical isolates by WGS. Patrons who purchased ready-to-eat products from the deli at this NetCost Market prior to [5 Sep 2021] should discard the food immediately. NetCost management has worked closely with the Health Department and New York State Agriculture and Markets to ensure that the deli area is safe for consumers at this time.

Listeriosis, a bacterial disease caused by _L. monocytogenes_, is uncommon, and usually occurs sporadically. Although it can cause mild illness in immunocompetent adults, it can also cause sepsis and meningoencephalitis in newborns and adults, and spontaneous abortion in pregnant women. Neonates, the elderly, immune compromised individuals, and pregnant women are at greatest risk for serious or fatal infection.

Foodborne outbreaks of listeriosis have been associated with ingestion of raw or contaminated milk, soft cheeses, contaminated raw vegetables, and undercooked or ready-to-eat meats such as hotdogs, luncheon meats, and refrigerated pâtés.

To help the NYC Health Department identify cases of listeriosis associated with this cluster providers should consider listeriosis if patients report consuming food from a deli counter prior to illness and present with fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms consistent with _Listeria_ infection. Providers should test and treat these patients for listeriosis.

Providers are required to report all laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases to the NYC Health Department. To report a case and for information about listeriosis, please call 866-NYC-DOH1 (1- 866-692-3641). Paper Universal Reporting Forms (URFs) can be found at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/hcp/urf-0803.pdf OR report online at https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/NYCMED/Account/Login.

Laboratories are required to forward all _Listeria_ isolates to the Public Health Laboratory (PHL) for additional subtyping. Laboratories should send isolates with the PHL eOrder requisition form (available at https://a816-phleorder.nyc.gov/PHLeOrder/) to:
Public Health Laboratory
455 First Ave, Room 136
New York, NY 10016
For laboratory-related questions, please call the PHL Microbiology Section at 212-447-6783.

PHL eOrder electronic [test request submission process]:
PHL test request form can be completed via eOrder. Once you have confirmed an existing facility account or created a new facility*, please follow the steps below:

[In the USA, the CDC identifies a listeriosis outbreak when a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates have the same molecular pattern based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), suggesting a common food source. Epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, include soft cheeses and ready-to-eat (RTE) refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease when the food is ingested.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

PulseNet (a national laboratory network that collects information about _Listeria_ isolates) works with other federal food regulatory agencies (the US FDA and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA/FSIS) to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source.

In this listeriosis outbreak in the New York City (NYC) borough of Brooklyn, the 3 patients had clinical isolates with similar genotypes, based on WGS. A food history revealed that all 3 patients purchased RTE food from the deli counter at the same market; food and environmental samples collected at this market yielded _Listeria_ isolates that were highly related to the patients' isolates by WGS, confirming this as the common source. However, the exact food items were not mentioned in the news report.
