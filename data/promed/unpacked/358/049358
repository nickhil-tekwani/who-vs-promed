CDC is assisting ministries of health and working with other organizations to control and end the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6325a4.htm?s_cid=mm6325a4_w1).

The updated data in this report were compiled from situation reports from the Guinea Interministerial Committee for Response Against the Ebola Virus and the World Health Organization, the Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Total case counts include all suspected, probable, and confirmed cases as defined by each country. These data reflect reported cases, which make up an unknown proportion of all actual cases and reporting delays that vary from country to country.

According to the latest World Health Organization update as of 22 Oct 2014 (2), a total of 9911 Ebola cases have been reported as of 19 Oct 2014 from 3 highly affected West African countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e1028a1.htm?s_cid=mm63e1028a1_e#Fig1 Figure 1). The highest reported case counts were from Liberia (4665 cases), followed by Sierra Leone (3706) and Guinea (1540).

The geographic distribution of the number of Ebola cases reported during 28 Sep - 18 Oct 2014 changed from the distribution of cases reported during 31 Aug - 23 Sep 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6339a4.htm?s_cid=mm6339a4_w3), when counts were highest in the areas where Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea meet. Counts of Ebola cases reported during 28 Sep - 18 Oct 2014 were highest in the area around Monrovia and in the district of Bong, Liberia; the Freetown area and the northwest districts of Sierra Leone; and the district of Macenta, Guinea (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e1028a1.htm?s_cid=mm63e1028a1_e#Fig2 Figure 2).

The map of the cumulative incidence of Ebola, as of 18 Oct 2014, indicates that the highest incidence rate (over 100 cases per 100 000 population) was reported by 2 districts in Guinea (Guekedou and Macenta), 5 districts in Liberia (Bomi, Bong, Lofa, Margibi, and Montserrado), and 4 districts in Sierra Leone (Bombali, Kailahun, Kenema, and Port Loko) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e1028a1.htm?s_cid=mm63e1028a1_e#Fig3 Figure 3).

[It should be noted that the case counts reported officially by the 3 countries are well known to be basically unreliable because of the difficulty in finding cases that do not come to a hospital and the impossibility of getting lab confirmation for most of them. - Mod.JW]

[2] Mali: implications of infection
Date: 24 Oct 2014
Source: Washington Post [excerpts]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/24/the-real-worry-isnt-ebola-in-new-york-its-ebola-in-mali


The baby girl in Mali is reported to have been bleeding from her nose while she traveled from Guinea on a bus that stopped in several towns in Mali. WHO is now warning that a large number of people may have been exposed to the girl while she was infectious. Finding and containing these people may not be a simple task. Like Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Mali is poor, with a low GDP per capita and a weak health care system. These countries are really fragile and can't absorb these types of cases without causing a lot of calamity to their systems.

Mali has also suffered from serious security problems, and since 2012, the central government has battled an Islamist insurgency in the North of the country. "Access to health care is still a critical issue for people in the north of Mali," Christoph Luedi, head of the Red Cross delegation in Mali, said in November 2013. "Conflict continues to have an effect on the functioning of health facilities, which struggle mightily to meet people's needs without outside support."

WHO is now sending a group of experts to Mali to bolster a team of 3 workers, a representative told The Post. So far, 43 contacts of the infected infant have been isolated, including 10 health-care workers in Kayes. With the aid of international experts, Mali had been preparing for an outbreak in recent months, training staff and readying special facilities. It may well need more help, however. On 10 Oct 2014 , Markatie Daou, a Mali health ministry spokesman, told Bloomberg that his ministry had received USD 672 000 to prepare for Ebola, but added that it wasn't nearly enough...

The northern half of the country is Sahara desert. Kayes, where the little girl from Guinea was hospitalized and died, is on the main railway line from Bamako, Mali's capital, to Senegal, and has road connections to a main road in Mauritania. WHO says 82 people are being monitored for Ebola in Mali:

[4] Sierra Leone: IBM joins fight against Ebola
Date: 26 Oct 2014

IBM will put its super-computing data crunching to use in Sierra Leone as part of the fight against Ebola. It has launched a system which allows citizens to report Ebola-related issues and allows government health agencies to keep track of the locations of the disease.

Citizens can use SMS or voice calls that are location-specific for reporting, with the data then edited and analysed. It is already functioning in some regions, with numbers of suspected Ebola cases pinpointed, and delivery sped up of urgent supplies. Radio broadcasts are being used to encourage people to use the system, and telco operator Airtel has set up a free number via which citizens are able to send SMS messages. "We saw how this technology could be used to enable communities directly affected by Ebola to provide valuable information to enable effective community effort to fight it," explained Dr Uyi Stewart, chief scientist of IBM Research in Africa.

Khadija Sesay, director of Sierra Leone open government initiative, said it had helped "open up a channel with the general public so that we can learn from their input and create actionable policies in the fight against Ebola. Using mobile technology has given them a new voice and a channel to communicate their experiences directly to the government health services."

[5] Sierra Leone: UK NHS staff will help

More than 800 NHS staff have volunteered to help treat those infected with Ebola in West Africa... A 92-bed treatment centre funded by the UK is almost ready to open in Kerry Town in Sierra Leone. It will be run by the charity Save the Children and staffed by British volunteers, each of whom will go out for a stint of several weeks...
