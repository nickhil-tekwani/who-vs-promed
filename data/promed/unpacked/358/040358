Atypical pneumonia: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
------------------------
A human epidemic of atypical pneumonia called severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) is currently raging across the globe and particularly in
South-East Asia.
The causative agent has not yet been identified. It appears to be a
Paramyxovirus, a Coronavirus, or a mixture. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has hypothesised that the causative virus(es) may be of animal
origin, from domestic or wild animals located in Guangdong Province (in
South China).
This is why the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has contacted
the Chinese Veterinary Authorities to obtain information on the animal
health situation in China over the past 6 months and, in particular, in
Guangdong Province.
The OIE has also approached its Reference Laboratories and Experts
specialising in Paramyxovirus and Coronavirus diseases.
As soon as it is available, the OIE, in close collaboration with the WHO,
will communicate the scientific information needed to confirm or invalidate
the animal origin of SARS and to evaluate, if necessary, the risks incurred
by the international community.

SARS - Deja vu ?
----------------
As SARS enters its fifth month, a number of questions remain unanswered.
Why Asia? Why now? Why young adults? To these I would add a fourth question
(Why the panic?) and an hypothesis.
Every 10 years or so, a pandemic spreads out from China and surrounding
countries. The 'Asian flu' of 1957 claimed 98 000 lives worldwide, and the
'Hong Kong flu' of 1968 an additional 45 000 lives. Although the world
community was rightly concerned, I do not recall a collapse of air travel,
imposition of quarantine, or daily front-page headlines. To date, SARS has
claimed 79 lives, and the etiological agent appears to be far less
contagious than Influenza A virus.
Current evidence suggests that new strains of Influenza A virus evolve as
recombinants when they pass between swine and ducks, a process favored by
close species proximity on Asian farms. Thus, I was surprised to learn in a
recent ProMed-mail posting that coronaviruses also exist in poultry and
swine, as well as cattle, cats, dogs, and rodents (see: Coronavirus,
Chicken, New - Brazil 20030403.0816). I do not know whether coronaviruses
are capable of recombination in the manner of influenza viruses, but such a
mechanism would partially explain the origin of SARS.
3 years ago, a 'new' human infection was described in the Netherlands. It
soon became evident that Human metapneumovirus [HMP] was neither new nor
exotic, and seems to have affected most humans in every country
investigated, going back decades. The clinical features of this infection
mimic those of Human respiratory syncytial virus, and infant deaths are not
uncommon. Indeed, it may well be that more people die of HMP than from SARS
each year. These facts only became evident when serological tests were
developed. I suspect that use of serological and other tests for SARS
developed over the next few weeks will reveal: (1) a high degree of
sero-positivity in the 'healthy' community of Asia, if not other countries;
and (2) the existence of an animal (Porcine? Avian?) reservoir.
During the H1N1 pandemic of 1977, there were suggestions that elderly
persons had a lower rate of complications than would be expected. It was
theorized that persons who had survived the prior H1N1 pandemic of 1918 had
retained partial immunity into old age. If, as noted above, background
immunity exists from a SARS outbreak several decades ago, relatively low
disease rates among the elderly during the current epidemic would not be
surprising. The fact that few children are affected is also not surprising,
when we recall that viral diseases (measles, varicella, poliomyelitis,
mumps) are often more overt and severe among adults.

[Steve Berger has posed some interesting questions and made some relevant
comments. My response is limited to consideration of the genetic
characteristics of coronaviruses. High frequency recombination is a
characteristic property of coronaviruses, and is probably restricted to
closely related coronaviruses. An example is Feline infectious peritonitis
virus, a coronavirus that exists as 2 serotypes and causes peritonitis,
pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and other immunopathologic complications in
cats. Serotype 2 of feline infectious peritonitis virus appears to be a
recombinant virus incorporating genetic information from a canine
coronavirus, which causes diarrhea in dogs. The serotype 2 virus, in
addition to causing peritonitis, etc., in cats can -- unlike serotype 1 --
infect pups (but does not cause acute disease).
That said, it is not necessary to hypothesize origin of the putative
SARS-associated coronavirus by recombination with an animal or avian
coronavirus. There are many coronaviruses in the natural environment that
could become pathogenic in humans as a result of progressive mutation, or
perhaps have existed undetected.
The origin of pandemic influenza A viruses by "recombination" is an
entirely different process and can occur between dissimilar viruses. The
genome of influenza viruses exists as a complement of sub-units which can
be interchanged when genetically distinct viruses replicate in a common (or
intermediate) host, generating progeny with non-parental combinations of
genes (and potentially expressing novel combinations of antigens and
causing an explosive pandemic). Consequently there could be abundant
opportunity for exchange of sub-units between human and avian viruses where
humans, domesticated mammals, and birds live in close proximity. This is a
gross oversimplification, of course, but the origin of pandemic strains of
influenza A virus in east Asia in the past should not be used as an
argument favouring the origin of the SARS agent by recombination between a
human virus and an animal virus.
At this stage we simply do not know. Nor is it certain that the coronavirus
(and/or the human metapneumovirus) present in SARS patients is the
pathogenic agent. As Steve Berger points out, coronaviruses and
pneumoviruses are ubiquitous in the human population. Caution is required
in advancing hypotheses at this stage until more data become available. -

Update on the ongoing laboratory investigation:
--------------------------------------
CDC is part of an international collaborating network of laboratories led
by WHO. There are 12 laboratories and 10 companies participating in this
network.
Evidence for a previously unrecognized Coronavirus has been found now in
at least 10 laboratories, including the laboratories here at CDC. The
preponderance of the evidence continues to mount and continues to favor an
etiologic role or this previously unrecognized Coronavirus in the cause of
SARS.
So far, in looking at specimens from the suspect cases in the United
States, we now have evidence of infection with this agent in a total of 4
people, and we are working with the state health departments in the states
where these people reside, so that they are provided with the information
and they, in turn, will provide the clinicians and the patients with the
information.
We have cultured this Coronavirus from a total of 4 patients. We have
electron microscopic evidence from 2 patients of this virus. We have PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) results -- , the amplification technique --
where we find evidence of Coronaviral nucleic acid in 11 patients.
Looking at the antibody tests, of which we have 2 --an IFA
[immunofluorescent antibody] test and Allose test -- there is evidence for
infection in a total of 5 patients. And from the standpoint of
histopathology, looking through the microscope at tissue from deceased
patients, we have seen evidence of an entity that the pathologist call
diffuse alveolar damage, which is the pathologic correlate for the clinical
syndrome of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which has appeared in
patients with severe forms of SARS.
We have seen that evidence in a total of 4 specimens. Don't try to add those
numbers up and get a grand total because some patients, in some cases, have
more than one positive result.
[In response to a question on whether there were samples that tested
negative for coronavirus]:
There are negative results. I don't have numbers. For example though, when
you think about antibody tests, what you really need, [in order] to be able
to interpret those and to say that something's negative, is 2 serum
specimens collected 2 or 3 weeks apart. So any negative that we have now for
the most part represents a single serum that's negative. So we're not in the
position to say that evaluation is complete. Part of our effort now, working
with the states, is to get paired serum specimens from patients so they can
be tested.
[In response to a question re: the information that some of the earlier
cases had eaten wild game]:
[Dr. Hughes had not heard the reports about the wild game consumption.] But,
we don't know the source, the original source
of this previously unrecognized virus. There are a number of Coronaviruses
that do infect animals, though. So it may well be that there is an animal
origin for this, and it's the sequencing of the full virus that will tell us
this. So I'm interested actually to follow up and see what sort of wild game
this is and what the evidence might be.
[In response to the question if they have run the tests on controls] :
In terms of PCR, yes, we have negative controls that we run, both for the
PCR and for the serologic tests that we have done, and it looks like these
tests are performing quite well, but it is early in their use.
There are several diagnostic tests that look promising. There is the ELISA
test for antibody, there's the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody -- or IFA --
test, again, for antibody, and then there's a PCR assay [for viruse] that
look like they have
potential to be useful.
We will be collecting and testing as many specimens as we can acquire from
suspect cases, from health care workers exposed to them, from household
contacts, and from healthy controls over time to further validate them.
We are going to be trying very soon to transfer some of these tests to
state public health laboratories through the Laboratory Response Network so
we can get the diagnostics, such as they are at the moment, closer to where
the illnesses are occurring. So that's a high priority
[In response to the question on reports ot the isolation of Chlamydia]:
The outbreak in Guangdong Province initially was reported based on some lab
evidence that I don't know the details of, to be caused by _Chlamydia and
[sic] pneumoniae_. My impression is that they had relatively few positive
results for that. We certainly put _Chlamydia and [sic] pneumoniae_ on our
long list of differential diagnostic possibilities when we first heard about
the situation in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Canada. We, in our laboratories,
looked for evidence of _Chlamydia and [sic] pneumoniae_ infection in suspect
cases, and so far have not found it.

[The new information provided in this briefing from CDC is consistent with
the hypothesis that a novel (or perhaps previously unrecognized) human
coronavirus is the etiologic agent of SARS, either alone or in combination
with another agent still to be identified. The supporting evidence is far
from conclusive, however. If at the CDC only specimens from suspected cases
in the United States have been examined so far, an undetermined proportion
of whom may not be SARS patients, this would be a limitation.
The RT-PCR amplification of coronavirus sequences produced 11 positive
results and was the most sensitive diagnostic procedure employed, but even
with this technique an unspecified number of negative results was obtained.
The most encouraging result is successful propagation of virus from 2 of the
suspected SARS cases. This will allow the entire genome of the virus to be
sequenced and its phylogenetic position in the family _Coronaviridae_ to be
established. It will be possible then to deduce whether this virus is a new
human pathogen derived by recombination with an animal coronavirus, or
whether it has evolved by progressive mutation from either of the 2 known
human coronaviruses, which are associated with upper respiratory tract
infections, or from one of the known animal coronaviruses. It is curious
that a virus, which has such devastating pathological potential in some
people, is present in these specimens in such low abundance.
Specific antibodies were detected in five patients by ELISA and/or IFA
tests, but samples suitable for demonstrating seroconversion appear to have
been lacking. The response to the question on controls is confusing. It
should be a priority to extend these diagnostic procedures to a matched
series of non-SARS patients to exclude the possibility that this novel
human coronavirus is no more than a ubiquitous resident in the human
respiratory tract. Several respiratory viruses, such
as the common cold-associated coronaviruses and human respiratory syncytial
virus, are distributed world-wide and affect individuals of all ages. At
the moment the single fact that best identifies this virus as the etiologic
agent of SARS is its apparent low nucleotide sequence homology with other
coronaviruses. - Mod.CP]
