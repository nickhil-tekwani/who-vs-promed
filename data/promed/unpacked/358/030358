The Australian Health Commission's Communicable Disease Control Director
Robert Hall said there has been no progress in finding the specific germ
strain responsible for causing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in five
children during the past five weeks.
He said tests will be redone on 3 South Australian children after first
tests were inconclusive.
An earlier outbreak which affected 23 children and killed one was linked to
eating contaminated, commercially processed sausage. The current situation
is not expected to achieve those proportions.

[HUS is a serious, sometimes fatal, complication of infection with EHEC
enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ , usually O157:H7). But since tests
for this must have been done and seem to have been negative, tests should
be done for hantaviruses, some strains of which cause hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome - Mod.JW]
