Bluetongue update: extension of protection zone to allow further vaccination
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFRA has today announced that the Bluetongue Protection Zone will be
extended again on Mon 19 May 2008, following the delivery of additional
doses of bluetongue vaccine. Vaccination is only permitted within the
Protection Zone; therefore, in accordance with the Bluetongue vaccination
plan, the Protection Zone will be extended to cover all of Leicestershire,
Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire, and Somerset. The
Surveillance Zone is unaffected.

The additional 3 million doses of vaccine are available for use in the
existing Protection Zone from today [16 May 2008]. Livestock keepers in the
areas coming into the Protection Zone will be able to obtain the vaccine
from Monday. They are encouraged to order vaccine so that they can protect
their livestock at the earliest opportunity. The vaccine is available in
20ml and 50ml bottles.

Protection Zone restrictions will apply to those keepers coming into the
extended Zone. Animals can only be moved out of the Protection Zone if they
are vaccinated, naturally immune or moving for slaughter, subject to
meeting certain conditions. Please refer to the DEFRA website for further
guidance.

[2] US concerns over bluetongue

US concerns over bluetongue
---------------------------
M Enseink's News of the Week story "Exotic Disease in Farm animals tests
Europe's responses" (8 Feb 2008, p 710) describes how bluetongue, a disease
caused by a vectorborne orbivirus, has spread widely in ruminant livestock
in Europe since 1999. Unlike Europe, which has only experienced bluetongue
disease in the past few years, the United States and the Americas in
general have been endemic for several bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes
since first reported in the 1950s. The historically prevalent US BTV
serotypes, though pathogenic in sheep, have caused little to no disease in
US cattle. The vectors of these serotypes have been identified, and their
distribution has in the past explained the epidemiology of BTV in the
United States.

Recently, 8 new serotypes of BTV and a new serotype of the related
orbivirus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), have been identified
in the United States. Some of the virus isolates were from clinically
affected sheep and deer, with others being detected through testing of
cattle for export. The presence of these new serotypes raises the specter
that the epidemiology of these viruses in North America may be changing and
could result in more extensive disease in US livestock and wildlife then
ever seen previously. This is bad news for the US livestock industries and
for our ruminant wildlife.

Our ability to understand the current situation is hindered because there
is currently no comprehensive surveillance in the United States for either
BTV or EHDV. A comprehensive surveillance system, greater risk assessment,
and risk prevention through vaccine development and vector control are all
needed. The events in Europe demand that we pay attention before BTV and
EHDV have similar repercussions for the United States.
