Health officials have confirmed 3 cases of yellow fever [YF] in Cote
d'Ivoire's northwest Denguele region. "We have 10 suspected cases,
with 3 confirmed," Simeon N'da, Health Ministry head of
communications, told IRIN on 16 Nov [2009]. Health workers vaccinated
people in and around affected villages at the weekend [14-15 Nov
2009], according to N'da. He did not specify how many people were
vaccinated and in what localities.

N'da said there had been no deaths from the mosquito-borne viral
infection. Local taxi drivers told IRIN they transported the bodies
of 4 teenagers from the village of Tron Touba to the region's main
city Odienne in a period of a few days the week of 9 Nov [2009].
Villagers said they had died of an unknown illness. Local health
officials in Odienne would not comment.

Some 30 000 people worldwide die of yellow fever each year, of about
200 000 cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). No
cure exists and 50 percent of infected people who cannot access
treatment will die, according to WHO, which says vaccination is "the
single most important preventive measure".

[Abidjan, the capital of the Cote d'Ivoire, located in the south of
the country, experienced an outbreak of urban YF last year (2008),
which triggered a rapid vaccination campaign that reached 2.2 million
people in the city.

The current political situation in the Cote d'Ivoire is in a state of
flux that may hamper the government's response to what has been so
far, a small YF outbreak. The northern part of the country is
controlled by the New Forces, and recent information indicates that
both New Forces and government forces are re-arming, with the
possibility of increased violence in the run-up to the 29 Nov 2009
elections. This situation would further complicate attempts to mount
an extensive vaccination campaign to control the outbreak. ProMED
watches this situation with considerable concern.
