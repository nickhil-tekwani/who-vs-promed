In a follow-up on the hepatitis A outbreak in Victoria, Australia, Deputy Chief Health Officer, Victoria, Dr Brett Sutton says cases of hepatitis A continue to increase in Victoria, with one death having been confirmed as part of the outbreak. There are now 58 confirmed outbreak cases, 7 probable cases and A death. An additional 16 cases of hepatitis A are under early investigation. All cases are adults with most reporting male-to-male sexual activity, and many have not travelled overseas.

A number of cases have also identified as people who inject drugs (PWID). Evidence is suggesting that homeless people may now be at risk of infection.

Detailed laboratory analysis has found that the strains of hepatitis A virus in this outbreak are very similar to a currently circulating strain in Europe. Since mid-2016, several hepatitis A outbreaks associated with MSM [men who have sex with men] sexual activity have been reported in many European countries and in the USA. A similar outbreak was reported earlier in 2017 in New South Wales.

Health officials offer the following advice:
- all MSM and people who have injected drugs in the past 12 months are strongly encouraged to get the free 2-dose vaccination from their local GP, sexual health clinic, or community health centre;
- patients suspected to have hepatitis A should not prepare food or drink or share utensils, provide personal care for others, share linen or towels, have sex, or donate blood until infection is excluded;
- advise MSM against engaging in high-risk sexual practices, including oral-anal sexual activity (rimming), or attending sex on premises venues, as such practices may increase the potential for transmission;
- advise PWID not to share or re-use needles, spoons, swabs, water, or any other injecting equipment;
- PWID should wash their hands in warm soapy water before and after injecting, and swab the injection site with alcohol swabs. Special care should be taken when injecting in groups, or when being injected by others. Label or mark your syringe.

[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative. This outbreak appears to be spilling over into populations that have been the root of the recent outbreaks in the USA (homeless individuals, illicit drug users).

In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.

The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:
- men who have sex with men;
- people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;
- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;
- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;
- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and
- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. - Mod.LL
