42 howler monkeys have died in Alto de Morichal -- 45 minutes distant from
the city of Maturin -- with symptoms of black vomit, typical of yellow
fever. The authorities say laboratory confirmation will take 14 days, but
they have already applied 120 000 doses of vaccine to the population at risk.

[Maturin is not far from the coast and the narrow strait
separating Venezuela from the islands of Trinidad & Tobago. Historically,
YF epizootics have spread across the strait, possibly by wind-borne
mosquitoes; health authorities in southwest Trinidad should be on the
alert. Under the International Health Regulations, monkey deaths from
suspected yellow fever must be reported to WHO within 24 hours, with
confirmation to follow when available. - Mod.JW]
