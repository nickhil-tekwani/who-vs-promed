[Although Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific, human cases are rare in Japan. In Asia, JE virus is maintained in ardeid wading birds, can be amplified in pigs, and is transmitted by several _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes that breed in rice fields and other water catchments. JE virus in the above cases could have been transmitted by mosquitoes that acquired the virus from birds as well as from pigs. A vaccine for human use is available in Japan. - Mod.TY
