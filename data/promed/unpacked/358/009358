The victims and family members of the 2001 anthrax mailings have
waited patiently for nearly 7 years to find out who was responsible
for the worst case of bioterrorism in U.S. history. This morning
during a special briefing at FBI Headquarters, Director Robert
Mueller provided answers. The briefing took place several hours
before the public release of documents relating to the investigation.
While updating victims and their families on the case in which 5
people were killed and 17 were sickened, Mueller said that "the pain
and suffering the attacks caused the victims and their families was
in the minds of all the investigators" as they tirelessly worked to
solve the case. That pain and suffering, he added, "has never, ever
been lost to us."

The FBI and Department of Justice Officials held a press conference
on 6 Aug 2008 to talk about one of the most complex and comprehensive
investigations ever conducted by law enforcement. This afternoon
during a press conference, Department of Justice and FBI officials
highlighted some of the information contained in the just-released
Amerithrax documents, explaining why charges were about to be brought
against anthrax researcher Dr. Bruce Ivins, who took his own life
before those charges could be filed.

U.S. Attorney Jeff Taylor, District of Columbia, said that, normally,
evidence against a suspect who has not been charged is not publicly
released, in part because of the presumption of innocence. "But,"
added Taylor, "because of the extraordinary public interest in this
investigation, ... we are compelled to take the extraordinary step of
providing the victims, their families, congress, and the American
public with an overview of some recent developments as well as some
of our conclusions."

Because of Ivins' death, the government will not be able to present
its case in court. But according to Assistant Director in Charge
Joseph Persichini, FBI Washington Field Office, "Bruce Ivins was
responsible for the death, sickness, and fear brought to our country
by the 2001 anthrax mailings."

The Amerithrax investigation is one of the largest and most complex
investigations ever conducted by law enforcement. The Amerithrax Task
Force, comprised of 17 special agents and 10 U.S. postal inspectors,
has conducted more than 9100 interviews, executed more than 70
searches, and followed leads across 6 continents. Along the way, a
brand new science was developed that ultimately led to the big break
in the case. That science -- creating a DNA equivalent of a
fingerprint -- allowed investigators to pinpoint the origins of the
anthrax. The FBI Laboratory, in conjunction with the best experts in
the scientific community, developed 4 highly sensitive and specific
tests to detect the unique qualities of the anthrax used in the 2001
attacks. This took several years to accomplish, but in early 2005,
the ground breaking research successfully identified where the
anthrax used in the mailings had come from.

Another key piece of evidence was provided when investigators were
able to identify a limited geographic area where the anthrax
envelopes were purchased based on a forensic investigation that
revealed printing defects in certain batches of envelopes.

In 2006, speaking about the investigation, Persichini said
investigators were frustrated that no arrests had been made, but that
"no one in the FBI has, for a moment, stopped thinking about the
innocent victims of these attacks. ... The FBI's commitment to
solving this case is undiminished."

Today, Persichini was able to tell the American public that a chapter
on one of the most heinous crimes committed against the citizens of
the United States has been closed.

Summary of evidence against suspected anthrax killer Bruce Ivins, as
outlined by Jeffrey Taylor, the U.S. attorney in Washington:

- Investigators identified in early 2005 that the anthrax used in the
mailings came from a single flask of spores known as RMR-1029. Ivins
created and solely maintained it. Investigators ruled out others who
could have accessed the flask, but they could not rule out Ivins.

- Ivins was one of the few scientists who could create spores of "the
concentration and purity used in the attacks."

- In the days before the mailings, Ivins worked off-hours, alone at
night and on the weekend, in the lab where the anthrax spores and
production equipment were stored. He previously had not often done
so. He could not adequately explain his reasons for being there.

- Ivins behaved in a way and said things that suggested
"consciousness of guilt." He also submitted a questionable sample of
anthrax to the FBI and attempted to divert attention away from himself.

- Ivins had a history of mental health problems and was having a hard
time professionally in the summer and fall of 2001, "because an
anthrax vaccine he was working on was failing."

- Ivins had frequently driven to other places to send packages in the
mail under other names to disguise his identity.

- Ivins was a "prolific writer" to Congress and the media, which were
targeted in the attacks. Authorities found 68 letters to these
entities in a search of his house on 1 Nov 2007.

- An e-mail written by Ivins used language similar to that of one of
the anthrax letters.

- The envelopes used in the mailings were "very likely" sold in 2001
at a post office in the Frederick, Md. area. Ivins had a post office
box in Frederick from which the type of envelopes with print defects were sold.

- Federal authorities interviewed Ivins several times and found his
statements were "inconsistent over time and failed to explain the
evidence against him."

[This is a 23-page document prepared when applying for a search
warrant in October 2007 to search the Ivins' family home and cars. It
contains an account of the evidence to that date that they had
against Ivins. It is well worth reading, but one must remember it is
a legal document. It is not a balanced scientific argument, with
arguments for Ivins being a definite suspect and for him not being
suspected. It is a prosecutor's document to get permission to access
the Ivins' home. Obviously, there are other documents with other information.

The damning things against him are:
1. the science - it appears the anthrax came from a beaker in his lab;
2. his unexplained lab time late at night just before both letters were mailed;
3. the Greendale Mississippi school connection.

The biggest holes in the case seem to be:
1. no NJ connection;
2. the lack of any anthrax found anywhere that they tested regarding Ivins;
3. the fact he passed one, possibly 2 polygraphs.

At the press meeting, a question was raised about the handwriting on
the envelopes and letters being ignored in the FBI documents. The
response was that handwriting is too easily changed. An answer that
is open to interpretation.

Another oddity is why they didn't follow up more thoroughly on the
_B. subtilis_ contamination in 2 samples of the product. It had to
come from somewhere.

Clearly, the evidence was circumstantial. The FBI claims it was
adequate to get a conviction. If you read the Washington Post account
of his memorial service below, attended by some 200 persons including
the most senior staff at USAMRIID, it is clear that Bruce was held in
affectionate regard and respect in Frederick. - Mod.MHJ]

[At this point, we are calling a temporary halt on this thread and
will await future concise reviews, significant revelations and such.
This present flood of press and TV reports is going to continue for a
while, and much of it will be repetitive. The objective of ProMED is
to report on outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and certain
toxic events, which one could argue is not strictly the present
situation concerning those 2001 letters. - Mod.MHJ]
