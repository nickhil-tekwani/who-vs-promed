[This is the 2nd fox rabies case reported this year (2015) in Presov (ProMED post 20150109.3081404) and reinforces the alert that the virus is circulating in the fox population despite vaccination efforts.

The oral vaccination campaign in Slovakia started in 1993. Before these 2 reports in 2015, the last fox rabies case reported in Slovakia was in 2006, after which it had been regarded as rabies-free until a new case was reported a year ago (ProMED post 20130110.1490773). - Mod.PMB
