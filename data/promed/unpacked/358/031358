A man in Pennsylvania says he contracted an eye-eating parasite from an amusement park water ride, and he is suing the park for negligence. The affected person claims that he contracted the parasite microsporidia in his left eye from being splashed during a ride at Pittsburgh's Kennywood amusement park in early July [2017].

In a complaint filed in Allegheny County civil court on [Tue 28 Nov 2017], he stated that the eye became itchy, red, painful and sensitive to light in the days following a [Sun Jul 2 2017] ride on Kennywood's Raging Rapids, which simulates white-water rafting.

He was given antibiotics after being diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis -- pinkeye -- but his symptoms continued to worsen, his lawsuit claims. He underwent "an extremely painful surgery where the parasite was scraped out of the eye with a surgical scalpel," after being diagnosed with microsporidia keratitis [Fri 14 Jul 2017], according to the complaint.

The parasite was "unable to be removed" during surgery, the complaint says, and [the patient] continues to suffer from blurry vision, redness, itchiness, dryness, inflammation and pain.

Microsporidia keratitis is rare in North America. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said through a spokeswoman that it does not have a lot of information about the ocular infection.

Correction Dec. 1 [2017]: An earlier version of this story included information about the causation and incidence of parasitic keratitis. Parasitic keratitis is a different ocular infection from the one caused by the parasite microsporidia, microsporidia keratitis. The story has since been updated.

[A comment to a report of a series of cases from India in 2008 reads:
"Microsporidia spp. are related to fungi and are found in almost all animals and insects and include more than 600 genotypes. They are very small, intracellular organisms which in humans have been described primarily in immunocompromised hosts. Because of their small size they are very difficult to identify by light microscopy and in humans a trichrome stain is the methods of choice for microscopy. (Das S et al. Br J Ophthalmol. 2008;92:861-2)."

A recent review of microsporidia keratoconjunctivitis (Garg P. Microsporidia infection of the cornea--a unique and challenging disease. Cornea. 2013 Nov;32 Suppl 1:S33-8) discuss diagnostics and treatment and no medical treatment is available. It points out that most infections in immunocompetent persons are self-limiting. Microsporidia is ubiquitous in the environment and would probably be found in most fresh water sources if samples and analysed.

The diagnosis is traditionally made by microscopy using a trichrome stain. However, microsporidia is difficult to identify due to their small size and confirmation (and genotyping) by molecular methods would be required for a definitive diagnosis. - Mod.EP
