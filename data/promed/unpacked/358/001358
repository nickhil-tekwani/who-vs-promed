An emergency report was sent to the OIE on 8 Jun by Dr L.O. Barcos,
President of the National Department of Agrarian Health (SENASA), Ministry
of Economy, Public Works and Services, Buenos Aires, regarding horses
stabled at the German Riding Club in the city of Buenos Aires which were
presenting clinical signs consistent with an infectious and contagious
condition.
Clinical manifestations: edema and/or inflammation of the lips, with
asymmetry of lips and nostrils, nasal erosions and secretion, erosive
lesions of 2 to 5 mm in the mouth (palate, cheeks, gums, interior of lips
and upper and lateral surfaces of the tongue). her signs observed are anal
and genital erosions, inflammation and secretions. Some animals present a
short period of slight hyperthermia. A possible non-infectious etiology
should not be ruled out.
Diagnosis: ENASA personnel have taken samples from affected animals, which
are being processed at the SENASA Central Laboratory and at INTA (Instituto
Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Castelar, province of Buenos Aires).
To date, it has not been possible to identify any potential causal agent or
the epidemiological mechanisms involved.
Control measures: In response to this event, SENASA has taken measures
including the following: the stables of the German Riding Club and other
premises with affected animals have been placed under quarantine and sick
animals have been isolated within a zone delimited by provincial highway
No. 41 and its extension as far as the bay of Samborombon, around the city
of Buenos Aires, and delimited to the north and east by the coast of the
province of Buenos Aires: ban on equestrian events and movement of equids
between establishments, restrictions on entering and leaving this zone, and
temporary suspension of delivery of certificates for the definitive or
temporary export of equids.
