The isolation of _Streptococcus iniae_, was from 2 workers at separate
barramundi farms that had been experiencing a continued ulceration of the
skin, especially around the feet and ankles (Summer of 96-97). The GP's
(General Practitioner, medical doctor) that took swabs from the areas sent
samples to the local pathology clinic, who were unable to identify the
organism (identified as _Streptococcus_ spp). I was able to obtain the
isolates and tested them next to the _S. iniae_ isolates recovered from
moribund fish found at their farms. The biochemical characterisation was
identical to the published reports of _S. iniae_.
It quite interesting to see the ulcers, which look to a non-medical doctor,
like a tropical sore. The ulcers are continually exuding puss, and the
area surrounding the ulcers is quite inflamed. I believe in both
incidences penicillin (or some derivative) was the drug of choice. In both
cases there was no direct wound to the area from fish they were handling,
but all workers at the farms suffer continual puncture wounds to the hands
and forearms from fish's dorsal and gill spines while grading or processing
for market.
