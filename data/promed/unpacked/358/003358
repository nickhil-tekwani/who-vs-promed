Bird flu has hit another commercial turkey operation in north west Iowa, the 3rd outbreak in Buena Vista County and the 6th in the state since the beginning of March [2022], the Iowa Department of Agriculture said on Thursday [24 Mar 2022]. The state said the facility has nearly 54 000 turkeys being destroyed to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. The virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours.

Buena Vista County has been under a state disaster proclamation since 6 Mar 2022 when the first outbreak was reported in a commercial flock of nearly 50 000 turkeys. And a week ago, the state said the deadly disease hit an egg-laying operation with 5.3 million hens.

The disaster proclamation enables the state agriculture department and other agencies to help track, monitor and contain the disease. Officials are testing 7 flocks in a 6-mile area around the infected site, and monitoring 14 others, said Chloe Carson, the department's spokeswoman.

Midwestern states are struggling to contain a virulent strain of bird flu having doomed millions of turkeys and chickens since March [2022]. Iowa has struggled with avian influenza outbreaks in backyard flocks in Pottawattamie and Warren counties, and at a Taylor County operation with about 916 000 pullets, or young laying hens.

On Wednesday [23 Mar 2022], the agriculture department canceled all live bird competitions and exhibits at county fairs and the Iowa State Fair. The agency said it was prohibiting live bird sales at auctions, markets, swap meets and exotic sales. State officials believe wild birds are infecting domestic poultry with highly pathogenic avian influenza. Iowa is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds each year.

State and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach US food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States. "This is a difficult time for poultry producers as HPAI (highly pathogen avian influenza) continues to impact farms across Iowa and the United States," said Iowa agriculture secretary Mike Naig. Nationally, 17 states have reported outbreaks of bird flu among commercial or backyard flocks, with about 14 million birds destroyed to prevent the virus' spread, the US Department of Agriculture reported on Thursday [24 Mar 2022].

Iowa leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens producing 16 billion eggs annually, and it ranks 7th nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds a year. A 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys and other birds in Iowa. That was about two-thirds of the 50.5 million destroyed nationally.

Officials urge flock owners to prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and to immediately report sick birds or unusual deaths.

[2] Missouri (Lawrence County): commercial turkeys

A flock of 37 770 commercial turkeys that were being raised in Lawrence County were confirmed to be infected with avian influenza (AI). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated on their website the birds were confirmed to be infected on Wed 9 Mar 2022. The flock has since been "depopulated," a commonly used term for killed.

According to information from the Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDA), AI viruses are influenza type A viruses that naturally occur in bird populations and transmitted from bird to bird "through fecal droppings, saliva, and nasal discharges." Infections in humans are rare.

Besides the case in Lawrence County, 4 other cases of AI have been confirmed in Missouri, according to the USDA website. The first confirmed case was in Stoddard County, where the USDA confirmed on 4 Mar 2022 a flock of 360 000 commercial broiler chickens were infected. That same day, they also confirmed a flock of 51 "backyard mixed species" of non-poultry birds in Bates County were also infected. A flock of 25 015 commercial turkeys in Jasper County were discovered to be infected on 8 Mar 2022, and the latest confirmation was in Ralls County, where 75 non-poultry birds were found to be infected on 15 Mar 2022. All of the infected birds were depopulated.

Christi Miller, communications director for the MDA, said it was unknown how the birds in the confirmed cases were infected. According to information from the MDA website, the virus can be transmitted to birds in the North American flyways when they intermingle with birds from Europe and Asia. "Positive tests in wild waterfowl can occur, and waterfowl can be infected and show no signs of illness," website stated. "There is a risk for spillover from wild birds into domestic poultry and then spill back from poultry to wild birds, resulting in further spread." The MDA stated some of the warning signs a flock has been infected include a decrease in water or feed consumption, respiratory signs such as coughing and sneezing, quietness among the flock, a decrease in egg production and a sudden increase of death in the flock.

Poultry growers are being asked to take precautions to prevent the spread of AI. Among these are restricting visitors from access to their flocks, preventing flocks from having contact from wild birds, and refraining from visiting other poultry growers. Other suggestions include having a set of clothing and footwear only worn when working with their birds, disinfecting footwear before entering barns or coops, and washing hands before and after handling birds.

Poultry growers are also asked to reduce any availability of food, water and nesting areas for wild birds and to fix any holes in roofs, screens and walls of poultry coops to keep wild birds from entering. Likewise, it is recommended that poultry growers clean and disinfect the wheels of any vehicle that has been to another poultry farm, as well as clean and disinfect any equipment that another poultry grower has borrowed and returned.

Any poultry grower who suspects their birds may be infected should immediately contact their local veterinarian or MDA Animal Health Division. Miller stated the names of all poultry growers whose flocks are found to be infected are kept confidential. The MDA also stated chicken and other poultry products are safe to eat if cooked properly, and none of the infected birds are in the food supply. They also stated US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk for infection to the general public to be low.

[3] Missouri (Ralls County): backyard flock

The Missouri Department of Agriculture has reported 5 cases of avian influenza in Ralls County. The cases were confirmed on 15 Mar 2022, and poultry owners in Ralls County received a visit from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) encouraging them to keep their poultry locked up.

Christi Miller, communications director at Missouri Department of Agriculture, said the avian flu comes in various strains, just like the human influenza. This particular strain of the avian flu is what they call a highly pathogenic avian influenza, which means it is a highly contagious and deadly strand.

The last highly pathogenic virus reported was in 2020 and spreads when poultry mingles with waterfowl migrating for the season. Miller confirmed the virus impacts poultry only and will not spread to other livestock. She reports that the 5 chickens affected by the virus are within the same flock and it has not spread to any other premises in Ralls County. [It is unclear if this 5 birds or 5 cases of chickens being affected. - Mod.TG]

The virus has been found in 4 other Missouri counties, including Stoddard, Bates, Jasper and Lawrence counties. Miller said all cases have been contained to one premises and have not spread to date. "We have been very fortunate this year [2022] in the locations where we have had it in our state, there has only been one premise having been impacted and I think it's a real testament to the biosecurity of those producers," she said. "They are doing a good job of keeping their animals and flock contained and mitigating that spread."

Signs of the avian influenza include a quieting of the flock, a refusal to eat or drink, a decrease of egg production, and sudden deaths within the flock.

[MJ] and [JJ] raise chickens on a farm in Ralls County. They had just released their flocks to free-range after the winter 2 days before they received a personal visit earlier this week from the USDA informing them of the outbreak. It is the first time they have dealt with avian flu, and they are taking the precautions suggested by the USDA. "We have several different coops with different breeds of chickens. So we're just keeping everything separate," [MJ] said. "We've got all our layers in one coop and the special breeds in other coops." They were told it might be a while before they can release their flocks again.

Miller said a specific time can't be pinpointed, but hopes to see a decrease by April or May [2022]. She believes the virus will slow down as the weather heats up, as it doesn't pronounce itself as much in heat. "When the weather is warming up and those birds have moved on through that's when we usually start seeing a decrease and we certainly hope is the case this year," she said.

Officials from the USDA or Missouri Department of Agriculture will make at least one more round of visits to check on the status of area poultry, and Miller said these officials will always have a marked vehicle and badges to identify themselves. She encourages all livestock owners to fill out a premises ID form on their website in order to ensure they receive important information and updates when things like this happen. Miller assured consumers the food supply is not affected by the avian flu and the eggs and poultry in the supermarket and local grocery stores are safe to eat. She added poultry and eggs should always be cooked to the proper temperature.

If someone suspects the avian flu in their flock, they can talk to their local veterinarian who will then get in touch with the Missouri Department of Agriculture. They can also call the Missouri Department of Agriculture's animal health division.

More cases of the deadly avian influenza have been reported in Cumberland County. The cases affected a mixed flock of about 150 poultry and were reported on 22 Mar 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The H5N1 avian influenza, a deadly disease that was first identified in Maine in a small flock in Knox County in February [2022], has the state on high alert. Keepers of backyard poultry flocks are being urged to take every precaution to prevent its spread. Cases also have been detected in Washington, Knox, Lincoln and York counties. So far in Maine it has been found in both domestic and wild birds.

Symptoms include swollen heads, blue coloration of combs and wattles, lack of appetite, respiratory distress and diarrhea with a significant drop in egg production. These symptoms are particularly severe in chickens and turkeys.

If there is any question about the health of an individual bird or entire flock, it is crucial to report those cases to state officials.

[If possible, keep your flocks inside to protect them from co-mingling with wild birds. And remember you can transport this virus on boots, or hands or even your coveralls. Be sure you are in clean gear before entering your birdhouses, and also blow your nose before entering a poultry house. - Mod.TG
