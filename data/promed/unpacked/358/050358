I want to inform you that avian influenza H5N1 has been found in 4
cities in Iran. The government has killed a [large number] of poultry
(broilers, layers and breeding hens) during the recent 50 days. This
has led to an increase in the price of broilers and eggs.

[Hashtgerd is a city located 68 km west of the city of Tehran; map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IR/26/Hashtgerd.html.

Iran's last reported outbreak of H5N1, affecting domestic fowl,
started, reportedly, in December 2007 and was resolved in August 2008;
see OIE's reports and map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6685.
A previous, solitary case in a wild bird (swan) was reported in 2006.

Another report hinting at the possible current presence of avian
influenza in Iran is available (in Persian) on the web-site "News Urmu
Ayshcylry" at
http://urmuiscileri.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-post_6444.html.
According to this (google translated) piece of information, dated Fri
11 Feb 2011, a large number of poultry farms around Tehran, Karaj and
Urumiyeh were put under quarantine due to bird flu. The source further
reported a sudden increase in the price of eggs. Karaj, the capital of
the Alborz province, is 20 km west of Tehran. Urumiyeh (Urmia or
Orumieh) is a city in Northwestern Iran and the capital of West
Azerbaijan Province. For a map of Iran, see

Any information, confirmatory or otherwise, related to the above
reports will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
