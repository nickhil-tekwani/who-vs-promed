HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN CONSUMERS NOT TO CONSUME FRESH ITALIAN-STYLE CHEESES
MADE BY LIUZZI CHEESE CO. IN NORTH HAVEN
HARTFORD: The Departments of Public Health (DPH) and Agriculture are
issuing an advisory today regarding cheeses produced by Liuzzi Cheese
Company in North Haven, Connecticut. Epidemiologic investigation has linked
at least 12 of 15 cases of a particular strain of _Salmonella_ bacteria
(_Salmonella newport_) to consumption of any of 3 different types of cheese
produced by the store since approximately 20 Mar 2001: basket cheese,
ricotta cheese,and mozzarella cheese. All were made with unpasteurized milk.
These cheeses have been widely distributed in Connecticut and neighboring
states and were sold with a Liuzzi label in food stores and delicatessens.
_Salmonella_ bacteria usually cause self-limited diarrhea. However, some
people can get high fevers and become dehydrated. The illness can then
become life-threatening if not treated, particularly in persons in
high-risk groups such as infants, the elderly and immunocompromised
individuals. Of the 15 cases reported to date, 7 have been hospitalized for
treatment.
The Connecticut Departments of Public Health and Agriculture recommend the
following:
* Consumers who bought any of these fresh cheese products with the Liuzzi
label since at least 20 Mar 2001 or later are advised NOT to eat it.
Rather, they should call the Department of Public Health (860-509-7994) to
report that they still have some of the cheese left.
* Persons who have already consumed the potentially contaminated cheese
made with raw milk and who do not have any symptoms do not need any special
medical evaluation or treatment, even if they are in high risk groups.
*Persons who have consumed the cheese and who become ill within 7 days with
fever and/or diarrhea should inform their physicians about this exposure
and ask to be cultured for _Salmonella_ and call the state Department of
Public Health (860-509-7994).
The producer and the Department of Consumer Protection are working with
distributors to remove all unsold implicated cheese from store shelves. The
producer has ceased production of cheese until further investigation has
been completed.
Over the past 10 days, DPH epidemiologists noted an increase in _S.
newport_ infections. By 23 Apr 2001, 4 cases were reported, and 11 more
cases during the ensuing week (usually only one to 2 _S. newport_
infections are identified each month). Interviews of the 15 ill persons and
40 persons without illness who live in the same towns as the cases have
established a clear link with cheese from Liuzzi's. Of the 15 ill persons,
at least 14 ate Liuzzi's fresh cheese within a week of becoming ill. Few of
the persons without illness ate any fresh Italian-style cheese. No other
food or drink item was implicated.
The 15 ill persons range in age from 15 to 88 years. At least 7 have been
hospitalized; none have died. They are residents of Bristol, Hamden,
Hebron, Naugatuck, New Haven, North Haven, Orange, Seymour, Southington,
Torrington, Watertown, Wethersfield, and Wolcott.
Although it is unknown exactly how the cheese may have become contaminated,
it was made with unpasteurized milk, which may be contaminated with
bacteria carried by cows. Unless it is pasteurized, milk may contain
_Salmonella_ and other pathogenic organisms. Federal regulations require
that fresh cheese be made with pasteurized milk or that the processing
include a formal pasteurization step.
Persons who have questions about the distribution of basket, ricotta, or
mozzarella cheese from the Liuzzi Cheese Company should call the Department
of Agriculture at (860)713-2508, Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.
