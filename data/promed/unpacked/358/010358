[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 182 197 with 82 367 (3.8%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 2 099 830 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 132 276 cases when compared with the data on 15 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 55 158 (41.7%), France 17 164 (13.0%), Turkey 4801 (3.6%), the UK 4617 (3.5%), Spain 7315 (5.5%), Italy 3786 (2.9%), Russia 3448 (2.6%), and Germany 4544 (3.4%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 96.2% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 31.1% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 145 521 deaths have been reported, 142 179 (97.7%) outside mainland China.

The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19; Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey and Russia have shown a rapid increase in the number of cases. The number of cases in Ireland and India has also been accelerating. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Wuhan: revision of cases and deaths
Date: Fri 17 Apr 2020
Source: China.org.cn, Xinhua News Agency report [abridged, edited]
http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2020-04/17/content_75943843.htm


Article 14 and Article 15 of the Rules for the Population Death Information Registration (for trial implementation), which stipulate that "medical institutions shall establish data revision systems," "medical institutions shall establish data comparison, verification and supplementation systems," and other regulations; following the principle of being responsible for history, the people and the deceased and to ensure that the information on the city's COVID-19 epidemic is open, transparent, and the data are accurate, the Wuhan municipal headquarters for COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control established a group for epidemic-related big data and epidemiological investigations. Municipal authorities for health, disease control, public security, civil affairs, judicial affairs, and statistics have pooled their efforts to compare the COVID-19 case information in the Wuhan municipal COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control big data system, the municipal funeral service system, the municipal hospital authority's COVID-19 information system, and the municipal novel coronavirus nucleic acid test system to remove double-counted cases and fill in missed cases. Aiming to leave no COVID-19 case undocumented, the authorities have worked to collect full information from all epidemic-related locations, including fever clinics, hospitals, makeshift hospitals, quarantine sites, communities with COVID-19 cases, and special sites administrated by public security, judicial and civil affairs authorities such as prisons, detention centers and elderly care centers, collect full personal information on all COVID-19 cases, and screen and verify every case with health institutions, communities and neighborhoods, primary-level police stations, employers and families of COVID-19 patients. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan as of the end of [16 Apr 2020] was revised up by 325 to 50 333, and the number of fatalities up by 1290 to 3869.

The data discrepancies are due to the following reasons:
- 1st, a surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.

- 2nd, during the height of their treating efforts, hospitals were operating beyond their capacities and medical staff were preoccupied with saving and treating patients, resulting in belated, missed and mistaken reporting.

- 3rd, due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients, including those administered by ministries, Hubei Province, Wuhan city and its districts, those affiliated to companies, as well as private hospitals and makeshift hospitals, a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network and failed to report their data in time.

- 4th, the registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting.

Life and people are what matter most. Every life lost in the epidemic is not only a loss to their family but also a grief for the city. Our sincere condolences go to the families of those who deceased in the COVID-19 epidemic, and we express deep sorrow to the compatriots and medical workers who lost their lives in the epidemic.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 16 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- Speaking at the COVID-19 media briefing yesterday [15 Apr 2020], WHO Director-General Dr Tedros stressed that our "commitment to public health, science and to serving all the people of the world without fear or favour remains absolute." The Director-General's speech is available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---15-april-2020.

- WHO has released a substantial update to its COVID-19 dashboard, offering better data visualization. The news article is available at https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-updates-covid-19-dashboard-with-better-data-visualization and the dashboard is available on the WHO COVID-19 webpage at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/.

- Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19: existing rules and regulations to protect health and reduce harm caused by alcohol such as restricting access, should be upheld and even reinforced during the outbreak. More on this is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/alcohol-use/news/news/2020/04/alcohol-does-not-protect-against-covid-19-access-should-be-restricted-during-lockdown, and a factsheet on Alcohol and COVID-19 is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak-technical-guidance-europe/alcohol-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know.

- In India, WHO is deploying its national polio surveillance network and other field staff to help with the COVID-19 response More information is available at https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/15-04-2020-who-s-polio-surveillance-team-other-field-staff-join-covid19-fight.

- Oxygen therapy plays an extremely important role in case management and is briefly explored in the 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: case management and oxygen therapy
----------------------------------------------------
While the majority of patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderated illness, it is estimated that 20% of affected patients will need oxygen. The ability to boost capacity to deliver oxygen therapy is critical to being able to treat those patients and it has implications for the functioning of the entire system. WHO has recently published "Oxygen sources and distribution for COVID-19 treatment centres", available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/oxygen-sources-and-distribution-for-covid-19-treatment-centres, that describes in detail how to surge oxygen systems and distribution.

In many resource-limited settings, oxygen supply and delivery systems are limited and thus rapid gap analysis should be done to inform surge activities. To do so, the COVID-19 Essential Supply Forecast Tool (ESFT), found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/covid-19-critical-items, can be used to forecast the total needs of oxygen and associated consumables and accessories (that is, essential oxygen delivery devices and pulse oximeters). The forecast can then be compared to the existing oxygen supply availability. This method provides a way to identify a contextually appropriate oxygen surge strategy based on structures, capabilities, practices and technologies. Decision-makers can then use this strategy to frame and implement a surge plan.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China is stable at 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 33 760 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 76.4% were reported by the USA, followed by Peru at 8.2%, Brazil (5.4%) and Canada (4.1%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Peru reported 35.0%, followed by Brazil at 23.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 17.5%, Mexico at 4.8%), and Chile at 4.4%.

The European region newly confirmed 35 497 (46.3% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 4710 (59.8%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. Spain reported 14.3% of newly confirmed cases, the UK 13.0%, Turkey 12.1%, Germany 8.1%, Italy 7.5%, and France 7.4%. Russia accounted for 9.7% of the newly confirmed cases, more than Germany, Italy and France. Those 6 countries (UK, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and France, representing 10% of the European countries) account for 62.3% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1617 new cases representing 37.4%% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 12.8%, Saudi Arabia at 12.2%, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at 10.7%, , and Qatar at 7.0%. Removing Iran from the denominator, Pakistan represents 20.4% of newly confirmed cases, followed by the Saudi Arabia at 19.4%, UAE at 17.1%, Qatar at 11.2%, and Egypt at 6.1%.

In the African region, there were 21 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, South Africa reported 19.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 18.9%, the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) at 9.0%, Guinea at 8.6%, Tanzania at 7.3% and Nigeria at 6.3%.

In the Western Pacific region, 10 countries reported no cases. Japan reported 36.7% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Singapore 34.0%, the Philippines 17.5%, and Malaysia 6.5%.

In South East Asia, India reported 62.6% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 19.8% and Bangladesh at 14.6%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 52.8% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh 39.0%, Thailand 5.2%, and Myanmar 2.0%.

Figure 1. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [16 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve dropped over the weekend, although the America's region did not appear to drop. Consistent with prior weekend reporting drops, but the European region did not return to its pre-weekend height after the weekend recovery.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 4 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
