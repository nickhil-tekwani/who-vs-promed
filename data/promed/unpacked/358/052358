At a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 4 Dec 2012, the European Commission recognised the validity and results of the surveillance mechanism implemented in mainland France and gave a favourable opinion on the recovery of its free status under community regulations.

Following the recovery of its disease-free status, mainland France will continue with bluetongue surveillance on its territory in accordance with current European regulations. Serological surveys will be carried out over its entire territory in the autumn to identify any re-emergence of the disease. The clinical surveillance mechanism will also be reinforced by an information campaign targeted at private veterinarians with an animal health accreditation mandate and livestock producers, and new clinical suspicion forms will be distributed.

In light of the above information, the Delegate of France to the OIE declares, in accordance with article 8.3.3. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2012 edition) of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), that mainland France (excluding Corsica) recovered its bluetongue-free status on 14 Dec 2012.

[France has been infected since 2006 by 2 BTV serotypes: initially by BTV-8 (spreading from the northeast) followed by BTV-1 (spreading from the southwest). In 2008, BTV serotypes 1 and 8, respectively, caused 4831 and 27 409 outbreaks in France.

The above self-declaration on the recovery of its bluetongue-free status throughout the mainland (excluding Corsica), regained as of 14 Dec 2012, has been preceded by self-declarations from the Netherlands and Germany, as follows:

1. Self-declaration from the Netherlands on the recovery of its bluetongue-free status, regained 15 Feb 2012.
Bulletin de l'OIE 2012, Vol. 2012, n1, p. 66. http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D11613.PDF.

2. Self-declaration from Germany on the recovery of its bluetongue-free status, regained 15 Feb 2012.
Bulletin de l'OIE 2012, Vol. 2012, n3, p. 39-41. http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D12034.PDF.

The 3 countries were initially infected by BTV-8 in 2006. The origin and route of introduction remains to be clarified. The disease was eventually controlled (eradicated?) by compulsory mass vaccinations. - Mod.AS
