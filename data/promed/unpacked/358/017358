Bengal (West): Killer Virus Returns, 8 Children Dead
----------------------------------------------------
A mysterious fever that returns every summer to a West Bengal
district has killed 8 children, but doctors have yet to identify the
[etiologic agent]. About 200 children have developed fever,
prompting the health authorities to deploy medical teams to contain
further spread of the disease.
However, doctors treating the children have failed to understand the
ailment's annual return to the Lalgola area of Murshidabad district,
where around 40 children died during the summer of 2003. Deaths
had occurred in the previous years as well.
The disease begins with high fever, after which the patient suffers
from convulsions and delirium and develops breathing problems.
The patient -- usually under 3 years of age -- also vomits
continuously. As of Mon [31 May 2004] 8 children, including 2
newborns, had died in Nashipur area of Lalgola. Some health
officials stated that the [etiologic agent] could be influenza B virus.
Though medical camps had been set up in some of the affected
villages, there is widespread disappointment with the healthcare
facilities provided. Health officials said medical camps couldn't be
set up in the entire area because of shortage of manpower. "Our
medical teams are working. We are arranging to send more such
teams," said a Murshidabad district health official.
Health officials also said they were arranging to collect blood
samples from children in the affected villages. Villagers of Nashipur
area said even though the 1st death from the mysterious disease
had been reported almost a month ago, help started arriving only a
few days ago.

[An outbreak of an undiagnosed disease of children occurred in the
same area of West Bengal in 2003 at approximately the same time
of year. This outbreak has been described in detail in the ProMED-
mail reports listed below. Influenza B virus infection was suspected
on the basis of incomplete laboratory analysis. The continuous
vomiting reported in the current outbreak was not a feature of the
previous outbreak, but has been reported in up to 25 percent of
children in some influenza B outbreaks (Control of Communicable
Diseases Manual 2000 p.270. - Mod.CP/JW]
