Italy has had 5 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu in farms in the central and northern parts of the country since the start of the month [October 2017] . About 880 000 chickens, ducks and turkeys will be culled, officials said on [Wed[11 Oct 2017].
The biggest outbreak of the H5N8 virus, which led to the death or killing of millions of birds in an outbreak in western Europe last winter, was at a large egg producing farm in the province of Ferrara.

The latest outbreak was confirmed on [Fri 6 Oct 2017] and about 853 000 hens are due to be culled by [Tue 17 Oct 2017], the IZSV zoological institute said.

Another outbreak involved 14 000 turkeys in the province of Brescia, which are due to be culled by [Fri 13 Oct 2017].

A 3rd outbreak involved 12 400 broiler chickens at a smaller farm in the province of Vicenza and 2 others were among a small number of hens, ducks, broilers and turkeys on family farms.

In those 3 cases, all the birds have been culled.

[The current H5N8 event in Northern Italy started, according to OIE's data, in wild birds on 3 Jan 2017 and in commercial poultry on 20 Jan 2017.

The cases in the 2 realms have been reported in 2 separate threads.

H5 clade 2.3.4.4 of the H5N8 subtype was 1st detected in domestic poultry in China in 2010; by 2014, this virus had caused multiple outbreaks among domestic ducks, chickens, geese, and wild birds in South Korea and subsequent outbreaks in Japan, China, Europe (including Italy), and North America. During these outbreaks, 2 distinct clusters of HPAI A(H5N8) viruses were identified: group A viruses were detected in China in early 2014 and later in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, the United States, and Europe; group B viruses were detected only in China in 2013 and South Korea in 2014. Co-circulation of group A viruses with low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses led to new reassortants, including H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8.

In late May 2016, a novel reassortant group B HPAI A(H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4 virus was detected in a wild bird in UVs-Nuur Lake in the Republic of Tyva, Siberia. As of March 2017, the virus had spread across most European countries (Italy included) , the Middle East, and Africa. (Further details in ref 1).
