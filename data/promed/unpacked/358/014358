Public Health Dispatch: Poliomyelitis --- Madagascar, 2002
---------------------------
Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Madagascar has detected a
cluster of 4 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis from which type-2
vaccine-derived polioviruses have been isolated. Preliminary data indicate
that these patients, residing in the Tolagnaro district of Toliara province
in southeastern Madagascar, had onset of paralysis during 20 Mar - 12 Apr
2002. None of the children affected was vaccinated fully. During
March--April 2002, provincial authorities conducted a small-scale
house-to-house vaccination response. Genetic sequencing studies of these
vaccine-derived viruses indicate substantial genetic drift and
recombination with non-polio enteroviruses. These findings are compatible
with an outbreak of paralytic polio associated with a circulating
vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV); however, further investigation is required.
The 3 outbreaks of cVDPV described previously occurred in areas where
routine oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage is low, AFP surveillance is
suboptimal, and supplementary vaccination activities have not been
conducted for years (1,2). Vaccination coverage data suggest that during
1999, 37 percent of children aged <1 year had received 3 doses of OPV. In
2001, the nonpolio AFP rate of 0.3 case per 100 000 population aged <15
years was below the target level of 1.0.
A joint mission by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar, the Pasteur
Institute of Madagascar, the World Health Organization, and United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) is ongoing to 1) conduct a field investigation of
the cases to verify early reports, 2) review health facility records for
any missed cases, 3) enhance the quality of AFP surveillance nationwide,
and 4) plan for a nationwide house-to-house polio vaccination response. The
work of this mission is being complemented by laboratory work in
Madagascar, South Africa, France, and the United States.

[This is now the fourth documented occurrence of cases of paralytic polio
associated with circulation of a vaccine-derived virus (VDPV) with
reversion to neurovirulence. Prior instances were in Egypt (type-2), the
Philippines (type-1), the Dominican Republic and Haiti (type-1) (see
referenced ProMED-mail articles below).
On reflection, this moderator has not abandoned the views expressed in the
commentary contained in the ProMED-mail posting on vaccine-derived cases
(cVDPV) in the Philippines (Poliomyelitis, vaccine-derived - Philippines:
2001 20011013.2506), and therefore am borrowing from that posting to
repeat here.
One wonders if this is a case of "seek and ye shall find," or if this is an
emerging problem associated with the vaccine. The former seemed to have be
preliminarily ruled out by the failure of a retrospective study of over
2000 AFP-associated poliovirus isolates (performed in the Philippines) to
identify additional VDPV. If it is truly a low-level occurrence, it may
have been missed. If this is an emerging problem, one wonders why now,
after approximately 50 years of vaccine use, we are seeing this
phenomenon. If one disregards "approximately 50 years of use" and chooses
to adjust the date to the implementation of increased vaccination
activities associated with the polio eradication effort, the time frame for
widespread use is approximately 17 years, when polio eradication activities
in the Americas region began. At the risk of provoking our readers, this
moderator wonders whether the increased prevalence of HIV infection might
not be associated with this observed phenomenon. There are greater numbers
of immune-compromised infants who may have been exposed to the live virus
with resultant chronic infections postulated to predispose to
neurovirulence reversion.
This phenomenon has now occurred (or better stated, "been documented") in 4
different regions of the world: the Middle East (Egypt and Israel), the
Americas (Hispaniola), the Western Pacific (Philippines), and now in Africa
(Madagascar). In 2 of the areas (Hispaniola and the Philippines)
circulation of the wild poliovirus had been interrupted (the last reported
case of wild poliovirus-associated disease in the Americas was in 1991 and
in the Philippines in 1993). In all 4 cases, this occurred in pockets of
unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals.
In the absence of total interruption of wild poliovirus circulation
worldwide, there is still a need for intensified vaccination efforts. The
risk of disease is still present, especially in today's environment with
extensive world travel. The occurrence of cVDPV in association with
clinical disease is very disturbing, as it adds another factor to the
risk/benefit equation of vaccination recommendations. As mentioned in an
earlier comment, a cost-efficacy analysis of switching to the inactivated
polio vaccine (IPV) in countries that have interrupted wild virus
circulation probably points to the economic nonviability of such a
recommendation. Significantly, a switch to IPV would remove the advantage
of flooding the environment with the vaccine virus (the attenuated
very-low-neurovirulence virus) to further interrupt transmission of wild
poliovirus if introduced as well as to "vaccinate" individuals who may not
have directly taken the vaccine themselves. - Mod.MPP]
