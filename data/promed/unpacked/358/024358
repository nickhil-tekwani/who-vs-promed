It has been confirmed that there has been an outbreak of a rare strain of
botulism on a South Australian dairy farm, which has crippled the farm's
operation. Farmer Mark Schubert has lost 80 cows since May 2006 at his farm
in the Jervois area of Murray Bridge.
Type B botulism was suspected, but early tests found nothing. Now Pfizer
Animal Health spokesman Dominic Dellosa says new tests run at a Queensland
laboratory have found traces of the disease. "Type B botulism toxin has been
found in some dung samples from the cows from Mr. Schubert's property," he
said. "It indicates the outbreak that has occurred on the property is a
result of the Type B botulinum organism as opposed to the Type C and D which
are usually more common."

[Botulism is most often caused by the pre-formed toxin produced by
_Clostridium botulinium_. Animals are most often exposed to the organism
through oral ingestion or through wound contamination.
Botulism is a potentially fatal toxemia caused by ingestion of the toxin of
_Clostridium botulinum_. There are 8 recognized types and subtypes of the
organisms. Botulism toxins C and D, which are the ones related to cattle,
are generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans.
The sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates 7
types of antigenetically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:
type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxin types A and B are highly poisonous
proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes.
About 50 per cent of human foodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused by type
A toxin, followed by types B and E. _C. botulinum_ spores are relatively
heat-resistant, though high temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will
kill the spores. Toxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat
and by cooking food. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at
temperatures as low as 3 C (37.4 F), i.e. inside a refrigerator, and does
not require strict anaerobic conditions.
Following consumption of the toxin, the clinical signs may appear as quickly
as an hour or 2, generally in 24 hours and as long as 7 days. Cattle
demonstrate a lack of tone in the muscles, progressively become weak and
ataxic. The weakness is because the toxin interrupts the nerve impulses to
the muscles, producing a flaccid paralysis. Many cows will lie down in what
is described as a "milk fever" position, that is turning the head to flank.
The flaccid paralysis produces abnormal facial expressions with droopy
eyelids, drooling and lack of ability to grasp food with the mouth. The
tongue may hang out of the mouth due to lack of muscle tone (often
considered a classical sign of botulism in cattle). The rumen activity
ceases, bloat and hard, dry manure are present.
The clinical signs vary widely because of the wide range of times between
exposure and onset. Generalized weakness may persist for weeks. There are no
clinical or distinctive pathological signs of disease to indicate the signs
are specifically due to botulism. The toxin may be detected in the blood,
the rumen contents or the feed. It is the toxin that is detected, not the
bacteria responsible for production of the toxin. Mouse bioassay, injecting
the suspect toxin into the mouse and waiting for death or clinical signs in
the mouse, is often done. Samples are injected into mice, some of whom have
been protected by specific botulism antitoxin. Culture of the bacteria is
difficult, it is an anaerobic bacteria, and conditions must be right for the
bacteria to produce the toxin.
Vaccines against _Cl. botulinum_ toxins types C and D in cattle and other
farm animals (small ruminants, horses) are available and widely applied in
countries such as Australia, South Africa, and Israel. - Mod.TG]
