Queensland's 1st confirmed occurrence of tobacco streak virus (TSV)
in mungbean crops has been detected in the Emerald district.
Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries senior extension
development officer Anne Shepherd said that TSV was identified last
year [2006] as the cause of the mystery disease that devastated
Central Queensland sunflower crops in 2004 and continued to impact on
the few crops sown in the past 2 summer seasons.
Ms. Shepherd said a number of Emerald district agronomists had now
reported mungbean disease symptoms in dryland and irrigated crops
that were inconsistent with known mungbean fungal or viral disorders.
"Diseased mungbean plant samples were forwarded to the DPI&F
virologist Murray Sharman early this week, who confirmed TSV
infection," Ms. Shepherd said.
Suspicions were raised by Belinda Chase, an agronomist with the
Emerald agricultural consultancy company, Graham Spackman and
Associates, who suspected the TSV infection in a mungbean crop that
was heavily infested with thrips insects.
Ms. Shepherd said this TSV infected crop was adjacent to pasture
country with a prolific stand of flowering parthenium weed. DPI&F
pathologists have confirmed that parthenium weed was a known host of
TSV in Central Queensland, linking it to the sunflower disease caused by TSV.
"It is likely the main source of the virus is infected parthenium
pollen, which is carried by thrips. This sucking insect then
transmits the virus when feeding on the mungbean plant," Ms. Shepherd said.
"Crop areas closest to the pathenium infested pasture recorded 100
per cent infection, whereas the TSV presence decreased to around 5
per cent in the centre of the mungbean field.
"Our immediate research objectives are to establish how widespread
the TSV disease is in mungbean crops in the district, confirm that
the parthenium is carrying TSV and identify which thrips are
responsible for transmitting the virus to crops."
TSV symptoms on the mungbean plants include fine dark necrotic lines
on the leaves, yellowing on the leaves that become large necrotic
(dead) patches, necrosis running down the petioles and the stem and
death of the plant's growing terminal.
Ms. Shepherd said that last season, TSV was also found to be present
in the Central Highlands' chickpeas. Other crops with known TSV
susceptibility were cotton, peanuts and soybeans.
"At this stage, we are asking growers to report unusual crop symptoms
to their agronomist or contact Emerald DPI&F field crop extension officers.
"We would like growers to describe the disease symptoms, record the
location of affected plants and note the impact on crop yields."
Ms. Shepherd said there were a number of potential TSV management
measures that could be adopted by mungbean growers to reduce the
thrips population and promote the development of an economically
viable and productive crop.

[Tobacco streak ilarvirus affects a number of crops, including bean,
sunflower, peanut, maize, soybean and a range of vegetable and
ornamental species. It is probably distributed worldwide and
spreading in North America and the Pacific region. It is transmitted
by vector insects (_Frankliniella occidentalis_ and _Thrips_ spp.),
possibly by allowing virus from the surface of infected pollen to
enter through feeding wounds. TSV can also be transmitted by
mechanical inoculation and grafting, by pollen to the pollinated
plant, and it is seed-transmitted in some species to different
extents; it is not transmitted by contact between plants.
The weed referred to as a possible reservoir species and potential
source of infected pollen is _Parthenium hysterophorus_. It is native
to Mexico and the USA and is considered to be one of the 10 worst
weeds worldwide, causing huge problems to agriculture and adverse
effects on humans and animals.
