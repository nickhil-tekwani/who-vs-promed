Nigeria confirmed at least 6 cases of monkeypox in August 2021, 2 more than in July, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).

Monkeypox is a viral illness caused by a group of viruses that include chicken pox [caused by a herpesvirus, not a poxvirus] and smallpox [eradicated from the world], with symptoms like severe headache, fever, back pains, among others.

Of 9 suspected cases last month [August 2021], 6 were confirmed, with one each in Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Niger, Ogun, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

[They are] the 1st cases confirmed in Niger and Ogun since a 2017 monkeypox outbreak, that spread to at least 14 states and sparked nationwide panic.

A total of 26 monkeypox cases have now been confirmed in 7 states and the FCT [Federal Capital territory] since the beginning of the year [2021], with no deaths.

Of the nearly 500 suspected cases reported since the 2017 outbreak, 215 have been confirmed in 19 states and the FCT, with 8 deaths in 4 years.

[Nigeria continues to have substantial numbers of monkeypox (MPX) cases this year (2021). A previous report on 10 Jun 2021 indicated that a total of 32 suspected cases had been reported from January to May [2021 of which 7 were confirmed from 5 states. On 2 Aug 2021, the total of confirmed cases through July 2021 increased to 17. A total of 26 monkeypox cases have now been confirmed in 7 states and the FCT (Federal Capital territory) since the beginning of the year (2021), with no deaths. However, another 7 Sep 2021 report states that of the suspected cases, 23 were confirmed from 8 states: Delta (7), Lagos (4), Bayelsa (4), Rivers (4), Edo (1), FCT (1), Niger (1), Ogun (1) and no deaths recorded from any of these states (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/monkeypox-in-nigeria-six-confirmed-cases-in-august-36693/).

The continued increase in MPX cases in August 2021 is not surprising. As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and widespread there geographically and can be a source of infection for travelers. A man with MPX virus infection traveled from Nigeria to Texas, USA, and another infected man traveled to the UK recently this year (2021). One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases in Nigeria that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. Contact with infected carrier rodents may be the source of MPX virus transmission.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
