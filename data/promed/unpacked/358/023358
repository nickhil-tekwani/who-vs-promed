Japan: 6 cases of hepatitis E virus infection contracted via pork barbecue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 people who ate pork liver in August [2004] at a barbecue restaurant
in Kitami, Hokkaido, contracted hepatitis E virus infection, and one
of them died of fulminant hepatitis, it was learned on Sat 27 Nov
2004.
One of the 6 also donated blood [prior to confirmation of infection]
and [was responsible for transmission of the virus to transfusion
recipients] according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
This is the 1st reported case in Japan of the hepatitis E virus being
transmitted to people via ordinary food, officials of the Ministry
said. Based on the Food Sanitation Law, the Ministry and the Hokkaido
Prefectural Government started examining the health of other patrons
of the barbecue restaurant and checking its remaining stocks of meat.
According to health officials, the 6 were related and went to the
restaurant with 7 other relatives in mid-August 2004. There, they
reportedly ate pork liver and other organs, in addition to beef and
chicken. Among them, a man in his 60s developed symptoms of fulminant
hepatitis and was hospitalized in late September [2004]. Hepatitis E
virus was detected in his blood, and the man died several days later.
Since recipients of the blood donated by his son were later found to
be infected with the virus, the Ministry and blood experts decided to
test the blood of the surviving 12 relatives. [Subsequently], they
detected hepatitis E virus [nucleic acid] in the son's blood and
antibody against the virus -- proof of infection -- in his and 5
other relatives' blood, said the officials.
Since the disease has a latent period of about 6 weeks on average, it
is normally difficult to determine which food is the source of
contagion. However, as a result of thorough interviews, the Ministry
and [other specialists] found that most of the 6 people [who
contracted] hepatitis E ate both barbecued pork liver and organs. The
7 others [who did not contract hepatitis E] did not eat both of them,
according to health officials.
Since the meal at the barbecue restaurant was the only time the 13
relatives had eaten together in the relevant time frame, the Ministry
concluded that one of the pork dishes, most probably the liver, was
the source of infection. At this restaurant, patrons are [expected]
to barbecue meat themselves, said officials of the Ministry and the
Hokkaido Prefectural Government. Many patrons are said to prefer
eating the dish rare.
Though no other patrons have been reported to be infected yet, their
health, along with that of employees at the restaurant, is being
monitored, and sanitation measures at the restaurant are being
examined. In past cases, groups of people were reportedly infected
with hepatitis E virus [as a result of] eating [improperly cooked]
wild boar or deer [meat]. However, since hepatitis E virus has also
been detected in ordinary pork liver at meat shops, the Ministry has
started urging the public not to eat pork liver without cooking it
thoroughly. "It is important to realize the dangers of eating raw
meat of not only wild, but also domestic animals," said a hepatitis E
specialist. "Research has shown that infection is likely to take
place only if a food contains a large amount of hepatitis E virus.
Infection can be prevented if the meat is heated enough."
In developing countries, a major source of hepatitis E virus
infection is said to be drinking water. Though in developed countries
a route of infection has not been established, an increasing number
of experts say infection is caused by eating raw or under-cooked wild
game.
Jaundice and other symptoms of the disease develop in 15 to 50 days
after infection, but most patients recover naturally without
developing chronic hepatitis. The mortality rate is said to be one
percent, but pregnant women have a higher mortality rate, according
to the experts.

[This outbreak of hepatitis E in the Hokkaido Prefecture of Japan
appears to have been restricted to a single family party at a
restaurant where customers barbecued their own meat. No other
customers were affected, but some others contracted infection through
blood donations from one member of the family party, the son of the
deceased (though the precise details of this are obscure). No
information is provided concerning the consequences of this
blood-borne transmission, and the matter is left hanging in the air.
Further information is awaited.
Unlike previous outbreaks in Japan (see the ProMED-mail posts listed
below), the hepatitis E virus-contaminated meat did not originate
from wild-life but was identified as liver tissue originating from
farmed pigs. Hepatitis E virus infection appears to be common in both
farmed and wild swine in parts of Japan; therefore, all pig meat
should be cooked thoroughly before consumption. - Mod.CP]
