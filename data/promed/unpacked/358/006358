Although the serotype for this current bluetongue (BT) event was not typed, given the recent cases of BTV4 in nearby Montenegro and South coastal Croatia, it is likely to also be BTV4.

Trebinje is situated only 28 km (17.4 mi) away from the famous city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, and 40 km (25 mi) from Herceg Novi, Montenegro. http://www.panacomp.net/bosnia_and_herzegovina?s=trebinje.

In the previous BT event published in ProMED-mail archive no 20140920.2789774, we included a request for information (RFI). The comment made was:

"The above immediate notification, submitted nearly 5 months after the apparent 'start of the outbreak' namely the day of import of 150 (apparently, clinically healthy) cattle from Germany to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 3 of which were found BT seropositive upon arrival, is puzzling; does such an event deserve the title "outbreak"?!

It would be interesting to test the positive sera for the BTV serotype involved, to trace back the 3 positive animals to their precise farms of origin, and to carry out a thorough investigation in order to definitely exclude the possibility that they were vaccinated.

Since the event is termed "continuing" and no culling is reported, can it be assumed that the 3 seropositive animals are still there?"

Since a response to our RFI is still pending, an update on the BT affected "imported cases" from 20 Sep 2014, would be helpful and useful. - Mods.AS/CRD
