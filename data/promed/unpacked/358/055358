[A] UK: Alternating dose study
Date: Thu 4 Feb 2021 [accessed 22 Mar 2021]

The world's 1st COVID-19 vaccine study researching alternating doses of 2 approved vaccines -- alongside different dosing intervals, begins today [4 Feb 2021] at 8 research sites across England.

The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) supported study, referred to as the COVID-19 Heterologous Prime Boost study, or 'Com-Cov', will determine the effects of using a different approved vaccine for the 2nd dose to the 1st dose, in addition to examining the efficacy of 2 different time intervals between doses.

Over 800 volunteers, aged 50-years-old and above, are expected to take part in the study at 8 sites across England - including in Oxford, London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol, and Southampton.

Professor Andrew Ustianowski, NIHR Clinical Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Programme and Joint National Infection Specialty Lead, said: "This is another exciting step forward in finding a variety of vaccine options for the UK and globally, for which the NIHR is integral to ensuring the participant recruitment for this study and the gaining of robust data on safety and effectiveness.

"We need people from all backgrounds to take part in this trial so that we can ensure we have vaccine options suitable for all. Signing up to volunteer for vaccine studies is quick and easy via the NHS COVID-19 Vaccine Research Registry."

Researchers will gather immunological evidence on different intervals between the 1st and 2nd dose for a mixed-vaccine regimen against control groups when the same vaccine is used for both doses.

A same-dose regimen is currently implemented for the national COVID-19 vaccination programme, and there are no current plans for this to change. Anyone who has received either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccination as part of the UK-wide delivery plan will not be affected by this study. They will receive their 2nd dose from the same source and over the same 12-week interval.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for the study Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said: "Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against COVID-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definitely advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme, if ever needed and approved by the medicines regulator.

"It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer; unless this is evaluated in a clinical trial we just won't know.

"This study will be a promising opportunity to gain greater insight into how we can use the vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease."

Classified as an Urgent Public Health study by the NIHR, it is being undertaken by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC) and the Oxford Vaccine Group, and is backed by GBP 7 million [about USD 9.6 million] of government funding from the Vaccines Taskforce.

Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said: "This is a tremendously exciting study that will provide information vital to the roll out of vaccines in the UK and globally.

"If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery, and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains."

The clinical study will monitor the impact of the different dosing regimens on patients' immune responses, and whether this can be a viable route to increase the flexibility of the UK's vaccination programme. It has received ethics approval, as well as approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to commence.

Should the study show promising results, then the government may consider reviewing the vaccine regimen approach if needed, but only if proven to be safe and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

The study will initially have 8 different arms, testing 8 different combinations, but more products may be added:

- Oxford/AstraZeneca and Oxford/AstraZeneca -- 28 days apart
- Oxford/AstraZeneca and Oxford/AstraZeneca -- 12 weeks apart -- as a control group
- Pfizer/BioNTech and Pfizer/BioNTech -- 28 days apart
- Pfizer/BioNTech and Pfizer/BioNTech -- 12 weeks apart -- as a control group
- Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech -- 28 days apart
- Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech -- 12 weeks apart
- Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca -- 28 days apart
- Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca -- 12 weeks apart

The study will run for 13 months and patients will be recruited over the course of February [2021] via the NHS COVID-19 Vaccine Research Registry. Vaccinations are expected to start towards the middle of the month and initial results to be made available over the summer period.

If the study shows promising results, the MHRA would formally assess the safety and efficacy of any new vaccination regimen before it would be rolled out to patients.

[B] Vaccines vs variants
Date: Fri 19 Mar 2021
Source: Nature [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00722-8


This month [March 2021], updated versions of Moderna's vaccine -- based on the genetic sequence of the B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in South Africa -- were given to clinical-trial participants for the 1st time. These efforts got a boost by new data showing that people infected with B.1.351 develop immune responses that can fend off multiple variants. And scientists want to learn from people who recover from COVID-19 and make antibodies that, over time, become more capable of blocking diverse coronavirus variants.

Penny Moore was one of the 1st scientists to show that a coronavirus variant identified in South Africa could dodge the immune system. So the virologist was expecting more grim news when she tested the immune responses of people who had been infected with that variant, named B.1.351.

Instead, her team found a ray of hope: B.1.351 infection triggered antibodies that fended off variants old and new. "That was a surprise," says Moore, who is based at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

The discovery, posted to bioRxiv this month/1, joins a slew of recent research suggesting that vaccines might cope with coronavirus variants of the past, the present -- and maybe even the future.

"Getting vaccines that will tackle the variants that are currently circulating is an eminently solvable problem," says Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at Rockefeller University in New York City, whose laboratory is studying variants. "It might be that we already have that solution."

Researchers in South Africa identified B.1.351 in late 2020. It now accounts for the majority of the country's cases and has spread around the world. The variant attracted scientists' attention because it was linked to outbreaks in places that had already been hard hit by South Africa's first wave, earlier in the year, and because it carried changes that blunted the potency of some antibodies that ordinarily disable SARS-CoV-2.

Research led by Moore and Alex Sigal, at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, stoked early worries over B.1.351 in January/2,3. It showed that the variant evaded virus-blocking antibodies produced by a large number of people who had been infected with 1st-wave strains. Weeks later, clinical-trial results showed that the variant diminished the efficacy of vaccines developed by Novavax4 and Johnson & Johnson, and potentially wiped out much of the protection conferred by AstraZeneca's jab/5.

Moore hoped that B.1.351 infection would trigger strong immune responses, but she was open to the possibility that this variant might be less visible to the immune system than are other strains. To find out, her team analysed antibodies from 89 people who had been hospitalized with B.1.351 infections. The researchers used a 'pseudovirus' -- a modified form of HIV that infects cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein -- to measure the capacity of the antibodies to block infection.

Reassuringly, people who recovered from B.1.351 infection made as many antibodies as did those infected with earlier circulating variants. Those antibodies did a good job of blocking pseudoviruses with B.1.351 mutations. To Moore's surprise, the antibodies also blocked other strains. These included some that were similar to the ones that B.1.351 displaced, and an immune-evading variant called P.1, identified in Brazil, that shares several mutations in common with B.1.351. Sigal's team reported similar results last month/3.

Moore does not know why B.1.351 infection results in such a broad immune response, but she is working to find out. "It's about the only thing I think about these days," she says. It's possible that the antibodies are recognizing features of the viral spike protein that do not differ between those variants.

The results are a boost to nascent efforts to develop vaccines able to cope with variants such as B.1.351. Last week [week of 8 Mar 2021], updated versions of Moderna's vaccine, based on the genetic sequence of the B.1.351 variant, were given to trial participants for the first time. Other developers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, also plan to trial vaccines based on B.1.351's genetic sequence. "I think there's a good possibility those vaccines might perform slightly better," Moore says.

Different coronavirus variants can trigger different immune responses, and researchers are only beginning to map their full diversity. Infection with the UK's fast-spreading variant, known as B.1.1.7, seems to provoke antibodies that do a poor job against B.1.351 and earlier variants/6, according to work led by immunologist George Kassiotis, at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and virologist Eleni Nastouli, at University College London.

Again, it's not clear why B.1.1.7 seems to generate a narrow immune response. The variant is handled by existing vaccines -- which are based on the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 -- but researchers urgently need to determine whether vaccines based on B.1.351 can also cope with B.1.1.7, says Kassiotis. If not, future vaccines might need to immunize simultaneously against multiple variants, in a similar way to seasonal influenza jabs.

Redesigning vaccines is not necessarily the only way to cope with emerging coronavirus variants. Researchers are identifying other factors that could make existing vaccines more resilient, such as mimicking how natural immunity caused by infection can sometimes offer broad protection. For instance, Bieniasz's team found that some people who recover from COVID-19 make antibodies that, over time, become more capable of blocking diverse coronavirus variants/7.

Antibody-producing B-cells can evolve through natural selection to make antibodies that bind more tightly to their target, a process known as maturation. Bieniasz's team isolated B-cells, several months apart, from people who had recovered from infection, and looked at how the potency of individual antibodies changed as the B-cell lineages that made them matured over time.

In some instances, 'matured' antibodies recognized coronavirus variants, including B.1.351, that earlier versions of these antibodies failed to recognize. One type of matured antibody could even neutralize distantly related coronaviruses. "The more mature an antibody response is, in terms of having gone through the selection process, the better it is able to cope with things like variants," says Bieniasz.

It's not obvious how to make vaccines trigger such antibodies. Maturation occurs when viral molecules called antigens, which are recognized by antibodies, persist in the body. "Really, the way to drive the process is to have the antigen be as persistent as possible," says Bieniasz. Formulating vaccines with adjuvants -- foreign molecules that increase their potency -- might be one way to achieve this.

Some of the vaccines that have been administered to millions of people might already be triggering variant-resilient immune responses. In another March [2021] preprint, a long-running COVID-19 study in Seattle, Washington, reported that after receiving a single dose of an mRNA vaccine, participants who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 produced heaps of antibodies that can neutralize B.1.351, as well as an earlier circulating variant/8. Those people also produced much higher levels of antibodies than typically seen even in those who have received two vaccine doses.

Leonidas Stamatatos, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in Seattle who co-led the study, suspects that a single vaccine dose boosted the levels of pre-existing antibodies that were capable of recognizing diverse variants. It's not clear how to mimic this response in people who haven't had COVID-19. One possibility is that a lag of several months between infection and vaccination was responsible and that its effect could be replicated with another vaccine dose, given 6 months or a year after the 1st 2, says Andy McGuire, an FHCRC immunologist who co-led the study.

By showing such a broad immune response to variants, the latest data have many researchers cautiously optimistic that vaccines will be able to protect against a breadth of variants. "I think it's very good news in terms of a path towards better vaccines," says Morgane Rolland, a virologist at the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine who works at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland.

And the fact that the virus is repeatedly developing the same immune-evading mutations could mean that its spike protein has limited capacity for change, Rolland adds.

Moore isn't so sure. Given enough time, "I have infinite faith in the ability of a virus to escape an immune response," she says. "We've got to lower the global number of infections to the point where the virus doesn't have as many opportunities to escape."

[C] AstraZeneca vaccine trial
Date: Mon 22 Mar 2021 8:50 AM
Source: Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) [edited]
https://sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/astrazeneca-reports-powerful-covid-19-protection-new-vaccine-trial


The long-awaited results from a new trial of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine hold some good news for the company, which has had to address eroding confidence in its shots recently amid news of possible rare, serious side effects. In a press release published on Monday morning, the company announced that the trial, which included more than 32,000 participants in Chile, Peru, and the United States, had shown the vaccine to have 79% efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

"I'm thrilled," says Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. "This is the vaccine that I had always assumed would vaccinate a large chunk of the world."

Two thirds of the volunteers in the trial received an initial standard dose of the vaccine followed by a booster dose 4 weeks later; the other 1/3 received placebo shots. The press release noted there had been 141 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in the trial overall, but did not specify how many cases occurred in the placebo and vaccine groups.

The press release also said the vaccine showed "100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation," though the company did not state how many COVID-19 cases of this nature occurred in the placebo group, making it impossible to assess whether that result was statistically significant. "Not reporting how many of these events happened in the placebo group is probably very misleading," says Hilda Bastian, an independent expert on evidence-based medicine and health communication. She notes the trial was not designed to answer the question of how well the vaccine prevents severe disease. "Encouraging people to think they have perfect protection from serious harm if they are vaccinated is a terribly risky message."

AstraZeneca's vaccine, which had a range of efficacies in previous large-scale trials and was withdrawn from planned use in South Africa after showing seemingly poor protection against a SARS-CoV-2 variant there, is the centerpiece of the United Kingdom's vaccine campaign. But it has been in the spotlight in the past week in Europe following reports of rare strokes called cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST) and clotting disorders in people who had received the vaccine. Many European countries paused AstraZeneca vaccinations last week as vaccine safety experts investigated the cases. On Thursday [18 Mar 2021], the European Medicines Agency said although it could not rule out that the symptoms were connected to the vaccine, the benefits strongly outweighed the risks. At least a dozen countries, including Germany, France, and Italy, have resumed use of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The press release for the new efficacy trial says a specific search for CVST found none in the 21 583 participants who received the vaccine. That finding does not rule out, however, that such a side effect could still occur in rare instances.

The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, consists of the gene for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 integrated into a harmless adenovirus. Much of the world has pinned its hopes on the shots as AstraZeneca has pledged to sell them for no profit and at much cheaper prices than other COVID-19 vaccines. (Between USD 2 and USD 6 per dose has been reported.)

Although previous efficacy trials for the vaccine were enough to win it authorization in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and some other countries, the studies were marred in the eyes of many outside vaccine experts. Some people received half-doses, which was not the trial's original intent, and the interval between doses varied as well. The trials also enrolled few elderly people, leaving open how well the vaccine protected that vulnerable group. About one in 5 of the new trial's participants were 65 or older, the company said, and the efficacy was reportedly 80% in that group too, although the press release did not provide case numbers to indicate the strength of that finding.

"A great deal of anxiety and extraordinarily difficult decision-making could have been avoided by doing a trial like this right from the start, as there was for other vaccines," Bastian says. Still, the new results are "wonderful," she says. "It's an enormous relief to have results from a well-designed trial."

The latest efficacy results could lead to criticism of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Jha says, because millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been sitting unused in the United States. AstraZeneca never applied for US authorization of the vaccine, with company officials and Oxford scientists saying the agency gave them the strong impression the new trial's results were needed for that. The company says it now plans to submit its data to FDA, but any emergency use authorization of the vaccine could still take several weeks.

"There could be a lot of anger at the FDA for not for not authorizing it based on UK [trial data] and other data and insisting on a new trial," Jha says. Given that the new vaccine results are good, that might look like overkill now. "But you can't know that before," Jha says. "That's why they did what they did."

[This good news is welcome, but could be improved by actually presenting the case and severity data from the experimental and placebo groups. And even with these encouraging results, the public likely will remain skeptical because of all the adverse publicity creating fear of side effects. It is up to the media to counter the old messages where they publicized the negative side effects. Certainly, rare adverse events will continue to be detected as large numbers of individuals are vaccinated. - Mod.LK

The placebo-controlled trial began in August 2020, included 32 449 adult volunteer participants enrolled across 88 sites in the United States, Chile, and Peru. The data safety monitoring board reviewed thrombotic events (blood clots) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis among participants and found no increased risk of these conditions in vaccinated participants.

This trend of releasing partial results by press release is unfortunate and we must wait for full data, most likely in the form of presentation to FDA for approval. While adverse events due to abnormal clotting were not seen in this trial, it doesn't fully address these problems, since rare adverse events may only be seen when vaccines are administered to much larger populations. Nonetheless, it does provide some reassurance.

This study doesn't address efficacy against variants of concern, but the vaccine was withdrawn in South Africa because it failed to protect against the B.1.351 variant there. Similarly, no data are presented on prevention of asymptomatic infection. - Mod.LM]

NIAID statement on AstraZeneca vaccine
--------------------------------------
Late Monday [22 Mar 2021], the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) notified NIAID, BARDA [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority], and AstraZeneca that it was concerned by information released by AstraZeneca on initial data from its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.

The DSMB expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.

We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible.

Authorization and guidelines for use of the vaccine in the United States will be determined by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Both previous infection and vaccination have been shown to provide potent protection from COVID-19. However, there are concerns that waning immunity and viral variation may lead to a loss of protection over time. Predictive models of immune protection are urgently needed to identify immune correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we modelled the relationship between in vitro neutralisation levels and observed protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from 7 current vaccines as well as convalescent cohorts. Here we show that neutralisation level is highly predictive of immune protection. The 50% protective neutralisation level was estimated to be approximately 20% of the average convalescent level (95% CI = 14-28%). The estimated neutralisation level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level (CI = 0.7-13%, p = 0.0004). Given the relationship between in vitro neutralization titer and protection, we then used this to investigate how waning immunity and antigenic variation might affect vaccine efficacy. We found that the decay of neutralising titre in vaccinated subjects over the first 3--4 months after vaccination was at least as rapid as the decay observed in convalescent subjects. Modelling the decay of neutralisation titre over the first 250 days after immunisation predicts a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralisation titres against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared to the vaccine strain and our model predicts the relationship between neutralisation and efficacy against viral variants. Our analyses provide an evidence-based prediction of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.

Understanding the relationship between measured immunity and clinical protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed for planning the next steps in the COVID-19 vaccine program. Placebo controlled vaccine studies are unlikely to be possible in the development of next generation vaccines, and therefore correlates of immunity will become increasingly important in planning booster doses of vaccine, prioritising next-generation vaccine development, and powering efficacy studies. Our work uses available data on immune responses and protection to model both the protective titre and long-term behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. It suggests that neutralisation titre will be an important predictor of vaccine efficacy in future as new vaccines emerge. The model also predicts that immune protection from infection may wane with time as neutralisation levels decline and that booster immunisation may be required within a year. However, protection from severe infection may be considerably more durable, as lower levels of response may be required or alternative responses (such as cellular immune responses) may play a more prominent role.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Though 11 novel COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy, additional affordable, scalable, and deliverable vaccines are needed to meet unprecedented global demand. With placebo-controlled efficacy trials becoming infeasible due to the roll out of licensed vaccines, a correlate of protection is urgently needed to provide a path for regulatory approval of novel vaccines. To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy (ρ= 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy (ρ = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels, and manufacturing platforms. This correlation is strengthened by substituting post-hoc analyses for efficacy against the ancestral strain (D614G), where available. Together with an accumulating body of evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines."

"The results support the use of post-immunization antibody levels as the basis for a CoP [correlate of protection]. We propose that the next steps toward achieving consensus on a CoP include the following: First, to establish comparability of antibody measurements among laboratories by (i) using the WHO International Standard (NIBSC 20/136) to express VNA [virus neutralizing antibody] titers in IU/ml and binding antibody titers in BAU/ml and (ii) establishing a relevant proficiency panel. Second, to agree on an assay, most likely a VNA meeting performance-based criteria, to serve as the gold standard assay for CoP and perhaps to allow validation of secondary assays by strong correlations with the gold standard. Third, to calculate the protective threshold in each phase 3 study based either on the distribution of antibody titers in random samples of vaccinees and controls or on case-cohort evaluations. Fourth, since the CoP calculated from different studies may differ, stakeholders should be convened to arrive at a consensus on a minimum protective antibody level for the primary outcome of symptomatic COVID. If possible, it would also be useful to estimate thresholds for preventing severe disease or asymptomatic infection. Fifth, to verify that the CoP will apply to new variants using appropriate adapted assays as information accrues on the immune response and efficacy of vaccines against them."

[3] USA (New York): P.1 variant
Date: Sat 20 Mar 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/world/new-york-brazil-variant.html


New York has joined a growing list of more than a dozen states that have confirmed at least one case of a worrisome coronavirus variant first found in Brazil.

The variant of concern, known as P.1, is highly contagious and has in some cases reinfected people who had already recovered from the coronavirus. About 48 cases of the variant have now been reported in at least 16 states, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is now in at least 25 other countries.

Scientists expect that variants will soon become the dominant source of infection in the United States. The country has been racing to vaccinate as many people as possible before that happens, even as some states are loosening lockdown restrictions.

Florida has recorded 21 cases of the P.1 variant, the most of any state, according to the latest CDC data. At least 49 states and Puerto Rico have reported about 5500 cases of the variant first identified in Britain, which could soon be the dominant form of the virus in the United States. Another 180 cases of a variant first found in South Africa have also been reported.

Gov. Andrew M Cuomo of New York announced on Saturday [20 Mar 2021] that the state's 1st P.1 case was identified by scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in a Brooklyn resident in their 90s with no travel history.

"The detection of the Brazilian variant in New York further underscores the importance of taking all the appropriate steps to continue to protect your health," Mr Cuomo said in a statement.

Scientists are concerned about the P.1 variant because it shares many mutations with the variant that is now dominant in South Africa, known as B.1.351. Vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer still protect against that variant, but they are slightly less effective. The vaccines are expected to perform similarly against P.1.

The pace of vaccinations has been ramping up in the United States. About 79.4 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine as of Sat, the CDC said. In New York, at least 25 percent of the population has received at least one dose.

The P.1 variant was first reported in Japan in December [2020], in 4 people who had traveled from Brazil. It quickly became dominant in Manaus, the largest city in the country's Amazon region, and spread to other South American cities. It reached the United States in January, appearing first in Minnesota.

Three studies offered a glimpse into the variant's rise in Brazil, most likely escalating in the winter and fueling a record-breaking increase in coronavirus cases, in part because of its increased contagiousness. It also had the ability to infect some people who had immunity from previous bouts of COVID-19.

[The P.1 variant has already been detected in at least 26 countries, with local transmission currently confirmed in 4 of them. Recently, New York reported a Brooklyn resident patient with no travel history to Brazil who is infected with the P.1 variant. Up to 18 US states have already reported 54 cases of infections with the P.1 variant, based on the CDC update dated 21 Mar 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html). - Mod.UBA]
