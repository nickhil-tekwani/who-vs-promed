HFMD death is 1st in 7 years
----------------------------
A 3-year-old boy died on Wednesday [6 Aug 2008} after being diagnosed
with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), the 1st fatality here since
2001. His elder sister has also been infected, but no details are
available on her condition. Elias Kindergarten in Woodlands, where
the boy was a pupil, has been told to close for 10 days for a
thorough clean-up, and to help stop the disease spreading among children there.

The Health Ministry said yesterday [7 Aug 2008] 15 children at the
kindergarten have been diagnosed with HRMD. A visit by The Straits
Times yesterday evening found the place quiet, with no parents or
children to be seen.

The boy who died had fever, ulcers and a rash on Sunday [3 Aug 2008].
His family took him to a doctor, who diagnosed HFMD. On Monday, he
started vomiting. By Wednesday, he was so ill that his family had to
rush him to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), where he was
sent straight to the intensive care unit. He became more alert after
some initial treatment, but continued throwing up. He later had
seizures, a sign of encephalitis or inflammation of the brain lining
-- a rare but severe complication associated with HFMD. Dr. Chong
Chia Yin, a senior consultant in infectious diseases at KKH, said the
boy could not be resuscitated despite their best efforts.
"Encephalitis patients can go downhill rapidly," she said.

It happened to many of the 7 children who died of HFMD in the
2000-2001 outbreak, the last time anyone here died here from the
disease. Like most of them, this boy was also infected with EV71
[Human enterovirus 71], the deadliest of about 70 HFMD strains. The
strain is responsible for almost a 3rd of the more than 17 000
infections that hit children who develop this normally mild childhood disease.

The outbreak this year has raised some concerns because, compared
with the same period last year, there has been a 40 percent jump in
the number of children coming down with HFMD. As a precaution, the
Health Ministry has ordered child-care centres and kindergartens to
close when there is a large active cluster, or in this case, a death
from the disease.

However, the outbreak seems to be tailing off. Last week, only 392
children caught the bug -- down from a high of more than 200 cases a
day in April [2008]. There were 2 other severe cases this year. There
is currently still one child warded in KKH for HFMD.

As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a
consequence of enterovirus 71 virus infection. The most recent update
by the Ministry of Health in Singapore states that as of 3 Jun 2008
the number of HFMD cases notified to the MOH decreased by 9 percent
to 665 cases in the week ending 31 May 2008 from 729 in the previous
week. This brings the total number of notified HFMD cases in 2008 so
far to 14 063. Nine (1.4 percent) cases required hospitalisation last
week mainly because of poor feeding
(<http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/pressreleases.aspx>).
