[3] Saudi Arabia: family cluster, blog

A family cluster of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been reported from Hafar Al-Batin in northern Saudi Arabia. 5 of these individuals have been reported to World Health Organization (WHO) by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MOH). There is uncertainty surrounding the family relationships among these infected individuals, however, Arabic media reports (noted below) allow a tentative construction of the kinship relations among these cases as depicted below. According to the reconstruction, 3 generations in this family have been infected with the disease.

Besides this family cluster, the Saudi MOH is reporting 4 other MERS-CoV cases from Hafar Al-Batin that may be associated with this family cluster. 3 of the other 4 cases as noted below are reported to have had contact with MERS-CoV infected individuals.

[The reports above from the MOH website announce a total of 8 newly confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV during the past few days. 3 of the 4 infections announced on 10 Sep 2013 (in item [1] above) are asymptomatic and were presumably identified as part of contact screening. The wording used in the descriptions of the other 5 cases is less clear, it appears as though 2 have presented with a minor clinical picture and the other 3 perhaps more serious illness, but currently felt to be clinically stable.

Of note is that of the 8 confirmed MERS-CoV infections listed above, 2 are health care workers in Riyadh, one is a health care worker in Madinah (asymptomatic). The other cases include a contact case in Madinah (asymptomatic), and the remainder known contacts of cases in Riyadh, suggesting that there may be a nosocomial cluster ongoing in Riyadh at the moment. There are unsubstantiated rumors circulating on the blog sites that this may involve a military hospital.

The discussion in item [3] above was provided by FluTrackers and provides information on the cluster in Hafar Al-Batin.

Going back to the information reported officially, the one conclusion that is apparent is that there is now limited [?] person-to-person transmission of the MERS-CoV being documented. Previously there had been small clusters of close immediate family or other close contacts. It appears as though clusters are increasing in size. The unofficial global total of confirmed MERS-CoV infections is now 132 cases including 59 deaths. To date there have been 16 asymptomatic contacts identified as infected with the MERS-CoV.
