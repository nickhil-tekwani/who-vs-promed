Sixth Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Death Reported in Panama
-------------------------------------------------------------
PANAMA: Panamanian Health Minister Jose Teran confirmed on Wed 7 Mar 2001
the 6th hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) death since the disease was
detected in the country last year. He said a 25-year-old woman died on Tue 6
Mar 2001 in Tablas Hospital in Panama City, capital of the country.
The woman had been infected with the virus 2 weeks ago in Tonosi, Los Santos
state, some 250 kilometers southwest of the capital, where the first case
was detected last year. Since then 31 cases have been reported. The viral
disease is transmitted via rodent saliva, urine or feces. Infected people
start coughing and feel joint and muscle pain, then have fever, nausea,
dizziness, breathing difficulties, and finally death.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe respiratory disease with
high mortality, which is a consequence with infection by rodent-borne
hantaviruses. In late 1999 and early 2000, an outbreak of acute illness
compatible with HPS was reported in Los Santos, Panama, with the death of 3
of the 12 (25 percent) suspected cases. It was established that
hantavirus-specific antibodies were present in patients' sera, and virus RNA
was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence
analysis of virus genome N-, G1-, and G2-encoding fragments showed this to
be a novel hantavirus, given the name Choclo virus. Serologic and virus
genomic analyses of rodents trapped in the area showed the rodent
_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_ to be the likely reservoir for the HPS-associated
Choclo virus. In addition, _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ rodents were shown to
harbor another genetically unique hantavirus, Calabazo virus. It is
presumed that the death reported here is a consequence of Choclo virus
infection, but this has still to be confirmed. - Mod.CP
