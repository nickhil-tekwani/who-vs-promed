Falciparum malaria in a traveler visiting a country designated malaria-free
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) wishes to report a travel-related
case of malaria due to _Plasmodium falciparum_ in a German traveler
who returned from Libya, a country designated as malaria-free by WHO.

Dr Jakob Cramer and Prof Dr Gerd Burchard at our Hamburg, Germany
site (HAM) located at the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) for Tropical
Diseases reported that the patient, a professional tour guide had
returned to Germany on 27 Nov 2010 from a 20-day tour to Libya where
she had arrived on 7 Nov 2010.

After flying into Djerba in Tunisia she travelled overland for the
next 20 days visiting Sabratha, Ghadames, and then to a tented camp
in the Akakuks mountains. From 18 Nov 2010 she stayed 2 days in Waw
an Namus and the last week at Mandara lakes.

She became ill on 24 Nov 2010 with fever. Back in Germany, a
peripheral hospital detected 2.6 percent parasitemia on 28 Nov 2010
and she was transferred to BNI on 29 Nov 2010 with a parasitemia of
14 percent. She has responded to IV quinine in the ICU and her
parasitemia was 3 percent on 2 Dec 2010. She had no underlying
illnesses, is on no regular medication, and has never had malaria
before.

She had travelled to Turkey between 12 Sep and 25 Sep 2010 but
visited only Istanbul and took a coastal boat trip from Antalya along
that coast. She had been on no malaria prophylaxis as those areas of
Turkey are malaria free and have not had known cases for a long time.

She had been in Mali in February 2010 on doxycycline prophylaxis,
which she discontinued immediately upon leaving Mali. In 2009, she
visited Senegal and Niger. She had no illnesses during or after any
of those trips.

Given the typical incubation period for _P. falciparum_ in a
non-immune host here [in Germany], it is almost certain that this
case was acquired in Libya. Acquisition in Turkey cannot be
completely ruled out but is highly unlikely epidemiologically and the
incubation period would be quite long. In addition, _P. falciparum_
malaria would have been very unusual for Turkey. Similarly, for
Senegal, Niger, and Mali, the patient had no suppressive drugs in her
blood after leaving Mali 9 months earlier and _P. falciparum_ does
not cause relapsing malaria.

Libya is officially designated malaria free by WHO though
surveillance is thought to be incomplete. WHO data indicate the last
small local outbreak to have been in 2000 and 12 imported cases were
reported in 2005.

Of note, the Fezzan region in southwestern Libya where the patient
visited is frequented by Tuaregs and other nomadic peoples from
malarious countries to the south and west. The Fezzan has supported
malaria epidemics throughout history. At least 7 species of competent
_Anopheles_ are present in various parts of Libya.

Blood has been sent to CDC Atlanta for genotyping of the parasite.
This will be useful in the small chance that it has a marker that can
relate it to another known isolate with a geographic provenance or in
case another case is detected locally in order to establish a link.

We would be interested in hearing of any further malaria cases from
Libya or any indication of outbreaks of unknown febrile illness
occurring in country.

[ProMED-mail thanks David O Freedman, Jakob Cramer, and Gerd Burchard
for submitting the case of falciparum malaria most likely infected in
Libya. We agree that it is likely that the patient was infected in
Fezzan frequently visited by Tuaregs, which could easily be
asymptomatic gametocyte carriers, thus infecting the local
_Anopheles_ mosquitoes. ProMED-mail will be happy to publish further
data on malaria in Libya. - Mod.EP]
