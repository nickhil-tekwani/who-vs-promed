The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 1 [Practice Usual Precautions] Travel Alert on [3 Jun 2021], regarding a diphtheria outbreak in the Dominican Republic (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/diphtheria-dominican-republic).

In recent years, vaccination against diphtheria in the Dominican Republic has declined, and health officials there are now reporting cases of the disease among children throughout the country. Anyone who is unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated against diphtheria is at risk of getting sick when visiting the Dominican Republic.

In 2021, between epidemiological week 01 (week ending 10 Jan 2021) and week 15 (w/e 18 Apr 2021), 2 countries have reported confirmed cases of diphtheria on the island of Hispaniola: the Dominican Republic with 12 confirmed cases including 9 deaths, and Haiti with 11 confirmed cases including 2 deaths.

Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of bacteria called _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ that make toxins (poison). Infection can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, kidney failure, paralysis, and even death, says the CDC. Even with proper treatment, about 10% of people with respiratory diphtheria will die. Without treatment, up to half of the patients can die from the disease.

The CDC recommends diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination for all travelers. The DTaP is only for children younger than 7 years old, while the Tdap vaccine is only for older people. Because of age or health conditions, some people should not get certain vaccines or wait before getting them. Ask your healthcare professional for more information, says the CDC.

The Dominican Republic is the 2nd-largest and most diverse Caribbean country, home to over 10 million people. Situated just 2 hours south of Miami, the Dominican Republic is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the north and the Caribbean Sea on the south, and nearly 1000 miles of coastline.

Local airports and other ports of entry will perform a breath test on about 15% of arriving travelers and all those who present symptoms upon arrival. Passengers under the age of 5 and crew members are exempt from this procedure. Passengers who present a COVID-19 vaccination card and/or a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival in the Dominican Republic will be exempted from the random test.

[Two countries in the Region of the Americas reported diphtheria to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in 2021: the Dominican Republic and Haiti (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53825). Both countries also reported diphtheria in 2020 (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53380). However, Haiti reported confirmed cases of diphtheria for the past several years (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=43201), whereas the Dominican Republic reported 0 cases in 2018 and 2019 (PAHO update <bit.ly/2RpjTWb>), and only one confirmed case in 2017.

Both the Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola). The Dominican Republic, with a population of about 3.3 million residents, is located on the eastern 5/8ths of the island; and Haiti, with a population of about 11 million, is located on the western 3/8ths of the island.

PAHO attributed "various factors" contributing to the occurrence of diphtheria outbreaks in the Region of the Americas in 2020, including non-compliance with vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the postponement of vaccination campaigns (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53173).

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Diphtheria skin infections are more common in tropical areas, and people who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated against diphtheria can develop serious respiratory diphtheria or cutaneous diphtheria after touching the skin sores of someone with diphtheria skin infection.

Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable infection caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. The CDC recommends that all travelers to the Dominican Republic should make sure they are up to date with diphtheria vaccination (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/diphtheria-dominican-republic).

Although Haiti reported cases of diphtheria, the CDC has issued no travel alert in regard to this disease for Haiti. However, the U.S. CDC has issued for Haiti a Level 4 travel alert (avoid nonessential travel) for COVID-19 ("very high") and a Level 2 travel alert (practice enhanced precautions) for rabies; "rabies in dogs is increasing in Haiti" (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/haiti). - Mod.ML
