[Due to an error in translation, this post entitled "Glanders, equine - Chile: (BI)" (archive number 20120605.1156371) inadvertently reported a case of equine strangles as glanders. We apologize for this error and will post the same report with the proper title and an appropriate moderator comment. - Mod.DK]

Pehuenche [indigenous people] community leaders in Alto Bio-Bio requested the intervention of officers from the Agriculture Ministry because of the occurrence of cases of glanders, and the number animals affected by this condition may increase because of the heavy rainfall that occurred last weekend [26-27 May 2012].

The recent frontal system not only caused prolonged blackouts and difficulties in communications; they also generated more concern in Pehuenche people because of the occurrence of the aforementioned disease, which leads animals to become quite weak.

Glanders affects horses, which are of vital importance not only for transporting people and goods in this remote highland area but also from a cultural point of view, since they are used for traditional ceremonies.

Mr Pedro Paine, a local leader in Butalelbun community, which is located near the Argentinian border, expressed concern because of the effects of glanders after the recent heavy rainfalls, and requested local agricultural authorities to intervene.

Meanwhile, the Agricultural and Livestock Farming Service (SAG, by its Spanish initials), through its spokesman Mr Guido Merino, assured that the glanders diagnosis was made during inspection visits carried out in this area, but these cases are circumscribed to certain areas and affected animals are currently being treated with antibiotics.

However, Mr Merino emphasized that his institution had not received any formal request from the local communities, and insisted that the diagnosis of glanders was made after a routine inspection visit in Alto Bio-Bio, an area located in the Chilean highlands.

[Glanders is a contagious and fatal bacterial disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, and is caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The disease causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy.' While glanders primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys, it can also occur in dogs, cats, goats, and camels. The disease can be fatal in mules and donkeys. The disease can also be severe for hamsters and guinea pigs.

Horses get glanders by close contact with other infected horses, especially through shared water and feed troughs as well as by nuzzling (direct contact). The bacteria can also be spread by fomites (non-living objects contaminated by infected animals), such as brushes, halters, or harnesses.

Carnivores, especially cats, can get glanders after eating contaminated meat.

The most common sign of infection in animals is yellow-green nasal discharge and ulcers on the nose. The horse may have enlarged lymph nodes and nodules on the skin. In some cases, they may look like long, hard ropes, under the skin. Severe coughing can also occur. Long term infections can occur in horses, which may last for several years.

Disease in mules and donkeys can start rapidly (acute) and can lead to death in 1 to 2 weeks after exposure.

People can get glanders by having direct contact with infected animals or contaminated objects. Entry of the bacteria occurs through the skin (wounds, cuts) or through surface of the eyes and nose. People in close contact with horses (veterinarians, farriers, other animal workers, as well as laboratory personnel) are at greater risk for getting glanders.

In people, the disease can affect the skin, lungs, or the entire body (systemic). Signs may include fever, chills, muscle aches, and chest pain; pneumonia can rapidly develop. Nodules or ulcers may occur in the skin or the nose, eyes, or mouth. Glanders is a very painful disease and can lead to death without treatment.

Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of positive reactors. Because it is transmitted to humans by direct contact with sick animals or infected materials, carefully washing hands following handling of animals is important. The wearing of gloves should be encouraged.

All infected or potentially infected material must be handled in a laboratory that meets the requirements for Containment Group 3 pathogens. In the untreated acute disease in man, there can be 95 percent mortality within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies.

One wonders by what test the diagnosis was made. One also wonders what precautions are being taken to keep the equine owners and handlers safe. What education has been provided to them?

For further details on the disease and its diagnosis, see chapter 2.5.11. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf.
