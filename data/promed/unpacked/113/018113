Summary
-------
A small group of individuals with extremely high viral load for SARS-CoV-2 and mild illness was detected in Houston, Texas. Awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand their potential to be superspreaders within the community.

Abstract
--------
Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a minority of index cases are associated with a majority of secondary cases suggesting that superspreaders could drive the pandemic. We identified a phenotype in individuals with extremely high viral load who could act as superspreaders.

Methods
Data were analyzed from individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 18 Mar [2020] through [15 Aug 2020]. Outcomes were compared using contingency table and quantile regression to test the equality of medians between the pandemic waves and by viral load groups.

Results
Of the 11 564 samples tested, 1319 (11.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. An increase in weekly median viral load occurred in the 2nd wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This population was more likely to be women, outpatients, symptomatic, and have an extremely high or high viral load. In patients with multiple RT-PCR positive tests, the duration of viral shedding was comparable between individuals with asymptomatic/mild and mild/moderate illness severity.

Conclusions
We detected a small group of individuals with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 viral load with mild illness. We believe that these individuals' characteristics could be consistent with the superspreader phenomenon and that greater awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
----------
In our study, a majority of individuals were evaluated at outpatient clinics and tested 2 or more times for SARS-CoV-2. This group appeared to maintain medium to high viral load for about 10 days from their 1st RT-PCR positive test suggesting they had the potential to remain infectious during this time period. In a recent report that described the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 Indian states, approximately 8% and 20% of the index cases were responsible for transmitting approximately 60% and 40%, respectively of the secondary cases [32]. Impressively, no positive cases were detected from contact tracing of approximately 70% of the index cases. Comparable results were reported from Shenzhen, China where 9% of index cases were responsible for 80% of secondary infections [33]. It is tempting to speculate that our population of extremely high (7.1%) and high viral load (20.1%) could be responsible for the majority of secondary cases. The overall phenotype seen in the 2nd pandemic wave shifted to women with no reported comorbidity who were overrepresented in the extremely high or high viral load groups. It is apparent that extremely high and high viral loads do not translate to disease severity. Many were asymptomatic or had mild illness indicating that without appropriate viral detection, social distancing and quarantine, individuals who have extremely high or high viral load will be able to spread SARS-CoV-2 and sustain the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to viral load, it is essential to evaluate other mechanisms potentially contributing to efficient viral transmission. The D614G mutation in spike protein was associated with high infectivity [34]. Our initial sequencing of 45 SARS-CoV-2 isolates during the 1st wave showed all had the D614G mutation [35]. Deep sequencing of isolates during the second wave will allow us to assess if there are mutations associated with high viral load or adult phenotypes where the virus replicates efficiently and could thereby transmit easily.

In summary, we detected a marked increase in the median viral load of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals during the 2nd wave of the pandemic. The extremely high and high viral load groups in general were asymptomatic or had mild clinical illness. The duration of the high viral load and the mild nature of the illness suggest many individuals go undiagnosed. Greater awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand their potential to be superspreaders of SARS-CoV-2."

This is a disturbing finding if it holds that individuals with high viral titers and very high viral titres can remain asymptomatic or display mild symptoms and transmit efficiently since they would go undetected for the most part. In what is known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population has been observed to contribute most to transmission. This rule governs inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as "superspreaders". Understanding and recognizing superspreaders is an important facet of infectious disease management. - Mod.LK]

[2] Germany: free rapid tests

Germany plans to offer free rapid COVID tests
---------------------------------------------
The country's health minister is aiming to extend testing capacities and also wants to make home tests available to all once they receive regulatory approval.

People in Germany will soon be able to get rapid antigen tests free of charge, Health Minister Jens Spahn announced on Tuesday [16 Feb 2021]. The German government is pushing to extend its national testing capacity as the country looks for paths to roll back lockdown restrictions and re-open businesses and schools.

What are the rapid test plans?
Starting on 1 Mar [2020], testing centers and pharmacies will offer rapid tests for free, Spahn said. "There are enough of them on the market by now," the minister said on Twitter. In an interview with German media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), Spahn said the federal government plans to cover the costs for the tests.

What is the status on at-home tests?
Tests that can be conducted at home are expected to be approved by regulators "soon," Spahn said. Once the greenlight is given, the tests should be "available for everyone," he said on Twitter. "These testing options can contribute to a safe everyday life, especially in schools and daycares," he said. Spahn also said the government is in negotiations with manufacturers to keep the costs for at-home tests low.

How have things worked until now?
Until now, most people in Germany would have to purchase quick tests from testing centers. The government has also approved their regular use in nursing homes and hospitals. In the event of a rise in cases, the tests can also be used in schools. The new plans would expand their use and make them more accessible. The costs for rapid tests generally range between Euro 30 to Eur 60 (USD 36 to USD 73), although some centers offer them for less. Antigen rapid tests do not need to be sent to a laboratory, but their results are not as exact as PCR swab tests. The Robert Koch Institute [RKI] for infectious diseases currently recommends that a swab test be done in the event a rapid test comes back positive for COVID-19.

How is Germany faring with the pandemic?
The number of new daily COVID-19 cases in Germany has been slowly falling in recent weeks. On Tuesday [16 Feb 2021], the RKI reported Germany's national 7-day incidence rate at 59 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government set a new benchmark for re-opening the economy -- targeting an infection rate of under 35 new cases per 100 000 people. Concerns about the spread of new and more infectious coronavirus variants in Germany led the government to extend the country's lockdown until early March [2021].

7 virus variants found in US carrying the same mutation
-------------------------------------------------------
Scientists don't know yet whether the mutation makes the variants more contagious, but they are concerned that it might.

As Americans anxiously watch variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa spread in the United States, scientists are finding a number of new variants that originated here. More concerning, many of these variants seem to be evolving in the same direction -- potentially becoming contagious threats of their own. In a study posted on Sunday [14 Feb 2021], a team of researchers reported 7 growing lineages of the novel coronavirus, spotted in states across the country. All of them have evolved a mutation in the same genetic letter.

"There's clearly something going on with this mutation," said Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport and a co-author of the new study. It's unclear whether it makes the variants more contagious. But because the mutation appears in a gene that influences how the virus enters human cells, the scientists are highly suspicious.

Investigating these mutant viruses, Dr Kamil realized they all belonged to the same lineage. The earliest virus in the lineage dated back to [1 Dec 2020]. In later weeks, it grew more common. On the evening of his discovery, Dr Kamil uploaded the genomes of the viruses to an online database used by scientists across the world. The next morning, he got an email from Daryl Domman of the University of New Mexico. He and his colleagues had just found the same variant in their state, with the same 677 mutation. Their samples dated back to October [2020]. The scientists wondered whether the lineage they had discovered was the only one to have a 677 mutation. Probing the database, Dr Kamil and his colleagues found 6 other lineages that independently gained the same mutation on their own.

It's difficult to answer even basic questions about the prevalence of these 7 lineages because the United States sequences genomes from less than 1 percent of coronavirus test samples. The researchers found samples from the lineages scattered across much of the country. But they can't tell where the mutations first arose. "I'd be quite hesitant to give an origin location for any of these lineages at the moment," said Emma Hodcroft, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern and a co-author of the new study.

It's also hard to say whether the increase in variants is actually the result of their being more contagious. They might have become more common simply because of all of the travel over the holiday season. Or they might have exploded during superspreader events at bars or factories.

Still, scientists are worried because the mutation could plausibly affect how easily the virus gets into human cells.

An infection begins when a coronavirus uses the tip of the spike protein to latch onto the surface of a human cell. It then unleashes harpoon-like arms from the spike's base, pulling itself to the cell and delivering its genes. Before the virus can carry out this invasion, however, the spike protein has to bump into a human protein on the surface of the cell. After that contact, the spike becomes free to twist, exposing its harpoon tips. The 677 mutation alters the spike protein next to the spot where our proteins nick the virus, conceivably making it easier for the spike to be activated.

Jason McLellan, a structural biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study, called it "an important advance." But he cautioned that the way that the coronavirus unleashed its harpoons was still fairly mysterious. "It's tough to know what these substitutions are doing," he said. "It really needs to be followed up with some additional experimental data." Dr Kamil and his colleagues are starting those experiments, hoping to see whether the mutation does indeed make a difference to infections. If the experiments bear out their suspicions, the 677 mutation will join a small, dangerous club.

Convergent evolution has transformed a few other spots on the spike protein as well. The 501st amino acid has mutated in a number of lineages, for example, including the contagious variants first observed in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Experiments have revealed that the 501 mutation alters the very tip of the spike. That change allows the virus to latch onto cells more tightly, and infect them more effectively.

Scientists anticipate that coronaviruses will converge on more mutations that give them an advantage -- against not only other viruses but also our own immune system. But Vaughn Cooper, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Pittsburgh and a co-author of the new study, said lab experiments alone wouldn't be able to reveal the extent of the threat.

To really understand what the mutations are doing, he said, scientists will need to analyze a much bigger sampling of coronaviruses gathered from across the country. But right now, they can look at only a relatively meager number of genomes collected by a patchwork of state and university labs. "It's ridiculous that our country is not coming up with a national strategy for doing surveillance," Dr Cooper said.

"Abstract
---------
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S) plays critical roles in host cell entry. Non-synonymous substitutions affecting S are not uncommon and have become fixed in a number of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. A subset of such mutations enable escape from neutralizing antibodies or are thought to enhance transmission through mechanisms such as increased affinity for the cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Independent genomic surveillance programs based in New Mexico and Louisiana contemporaneously detected the rapid rise of numerous clade 20G (lineage B.1.2) infections carrying a Q677P substitution in S. The variant was first detected in the US on 23 Oct [2020], yet between 1 Dec 2020 and 19 Jan 2021 it rose to represent 27.8% and 11.3% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from Louisiana and New Mexico, respectively. Q677P cases have been detected predominantly in the south central and southwest United States; as of 3 Feb 2021, GISAID data show 499 viral sequences of this variant from the USA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the independent evolution and spread of at least 6 distinct Q677H sub-lineages, with first collection dates ranging from mid-August to late November 2020. 4 677H clades from clade 20G (B.1.2), 20A (B.1.234), and 20B (B.1.1.220, and B.1.1.222) each contain roughly 100 or fewer sequenced cases, while a distinct pair of clade 20G clusters are represented by 754 and 298 cases, respectively. Although sampling bias and founder effects may have contributed to the rise of S:677 polymorphic variants, the proximity of this position to the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary are consistent with its potential functional relevance during cell entry, suggesting parallel evolution of a trait that may confer an advantage in spread or transmission. Taken together, our findings demonstrate simultaneous convergent evolution, thus providing an impetus to further evaluate S:677 polymorphisms for effects on proteolytic processing, cell tropism, and transmissibility.

"Introduction
-------------
"Here, we describe evidence from 2 independent SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programs in Louisiana and New Mexico that each detected the rise of S variants affecting position 677 in the later months of 2020. We further provide phylogenetic analyses that identify 6 independent Q677H sub-lineages and one Q677P sub-lineage that all appear to have emerged within the United States. These variants were not detected until mid-August 2020, but as of 3 Feb 2021, already account for over 2327 of the 102 462 genomes deposited to GISAID from the USA. Given the broad detection of the lineages across multiple states and the apparent increase in frequency of detection, these novel emergent Q677H and Q677P lineages merit further study for potential differences in transmissibility."

[As the authors state, it is critical to figure out the biological implications of the mutations. But one would suspect they must offer the virus an advantage since they are occurring independently in more than one location. - Mod.LK]

[4] Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)

COVID-linked syndrome in children is growing and cases are more severe
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The condition, which usually emerges several weeks after infection, is still rare, but can be dangerous. "A higher percentage of them are really critically ill," one doctor said.

15-year-old [BW] was frightened of COVID-19. He was careful to wear masks and only left his house, in Simi Valley, California, for things like orthodontist checkups and visits with his grandparents nearby. But somehow, the virus found [BW]. It wreaked ruthless damage in the form of an inflammatory syndrome that, for unknown reasons, strikes some young people, usually several weeks after infection by the coronavirus. Doctors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles put the teenager on a ventilator and a heart-lung bypass machine. But they could not stop his major organs from failing. On [5 Jan 2021], [he died].

Doctors across the country have been seeing a striking increase in the number of young people with the condition [BW] had, which is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C. Even more worrisome, they say, is that more patients are now very sick than during the 1st wave of cases, which alarmed doctors and parents around the world last spring [2020]. "We're now getting more of these MIS-C kids, but this time, it just seems that a higher percentage of them are really critically ill," said Dr Roberta DeBiasi, chief of infectious diseases at Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC. During the hospital's 1st wave, about half the patients needed treatment in the intensive care unit, she said, but now 80 to 90 percent do.

The reasons are unclear. The surge follows the overall spike of COVID cases in the United States after the winter holiday season, and more cases may simply increase chances for severe disease to emerge. So far, there's no evidence that recent coronavirus variants are responsible, and experts say it is too early to speculate about any impact of variants on the syndrome.

The condition remains rare. The latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 2060 cases in 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, including 30 deaths [as of 8 Feb 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/cases/index.html. - Mod.MPP]. The median age was 9, but infants to 20-year-olds have been afflicted. The data, which is complete only through mid-December [2020], shows the rate of cases has been increasing since mid-October [2020].

While most young people, even those who became seriously ill, have survived and gone home in relatively healthy condition, doctors are uncertain whether any will experience lingering heart issues or other problems. "We really don't know what will happen in the long term," said Dr Jean Ballweg, medical director of pediatric heart transplant and advanced heart failure at Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, where from April through October [2020], the hospital treated about 2 cases a month, about 30 percent of them in the ICU. That rose to 10 cases in December [2020] and 12 in January [2021], with 60 percent needing ICU care -- most requiring ventilators. "Clearly, they seem to be more sick," she said.

Symptoms of the syndrome can include fever, rash, red eyes, or gastrointestinal problems. Those can progress to heart dysfunction, including cardiogenic shock, in which the heart cannot squeeze enough to pump blood sufficiently. Some patients develop cardiomyopathy, which stiffens the heart muscle, or abnormal rhythm. Dr. Ballweg said one 15-year-old at her hospital needed a procedure that functioned as a temporary pacemaker.

Hospitals say most patients test positive for COVID antibodies that indicate previous infection, but some patients also test positive for active coronavirus infection. Many children were previously healthy and had few or no symptoms from their initial COVID infection. Doctors are uncertain which factors predispose children to the syndrome. Dr Jane Newburger, associate chief for academic affairs in Boston Children's Hospital's cardiology department, who is a leader of a nationwide study, said patients with obesity and some older children seem to fare worse. [https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/music-study/]

69 percent of reported cases have affected Latino or Black young people, which experts believe stems from socioeconomic and other factors that have disproportionately exposed those communities to the virus. But Omaha's hospital, where early cases were largely among children of Latino parents working in the meatpacking industry, is now "seeing a much more broad spectrum and every ethnicity," Dr Ballweg said.

[JK], [4-years-old], was hospitalized in Omaha for 10 days after developing a headache, fever, vomiting, red eyes, and a rapid heart rate... [JK] recently returned to preschool full time. He has some dilation of a coronary artery, but is improving, his mother said.

Doctors said they've learned effective treatment approaches, which, besides steroids, immunoglobulin, and blood thinners, can include blood pressure medications, an immunomodulator called anakinra and supplemental oxygen. Some hospitals use ventilators more than others, experts said. But though doctors are learning more, pediatricians can miss the syndrome initially because early symptoms can mimic some common ailments.

On New Year's Day [1 Jan 2021], [MB], 11, of Damascus, Maryland, started feeling sick. "My stomach started hurting, and then I went to my soccer game and then I got a fever," he said. His mother, a medical assistant at a women's health practice, gave him Alka Seltzer, Pepto Bismol, and Tylenol. Several days later, he developed shortness of breath and they went to an urgent care clinic. There, a rapid COVID-19 test was negative, as were evaluations for strep, influenza, and appendicitis. [His mother] said she was told, "It was just like a stomach flu." But the next day, [MB] had swollen eyes and lips with red blisters. "He started developing really bad body aches and he couldn't walk anymore," she said. She took him to an emergency room, which transferred him to Children's National Hospital, where doctors said he exhibited cardiogenic shock. ... [MB] spent 8 days in the hospital, 4 in the ICU. Since leaving, he has seen a hematologist, a rheumatologist, and a cardiologist and is on blood thinners for now. The hardest part, said [MB], a star local soccer player, is being temporarily sidelined from sports, as doctors advise for most patients for several months. "It was very shocking for everybody in the community: 'Wow, how did this happen to someone very healthy?'" [his mother] said.

It's unclear why the syndrome hit [BW] so hard. [His mother] said he did not have serious health issues. She said he was overweight but active, swimming 3 times a week and taking dance and yoga at his arts-and-science high school. Symptoms started New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2020], when he began vomiting and spiking a fever. [His mother] took him to an emergency room, where he tested positive for the coronavirus, received treatment that included a new monoclonal antibody drug and was sent home. But his fever persisted and 2 days later, he developed diarrhea and his lips and fingers turned blue. [His mother] called 911. When paramedics arrived, she said, he was "lying in his bed, like almost lifeless."

At the hospital, he was hooked to a ventilator and transferred to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which like several hospitals has established a MIS-C clinic with various specialists.

"[BW] was one of our most ill patients," said Dr Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz, a pediatric cardiologist there. Doctors placed him on the heart-lung bypass machine, put him on dialysis and performed a heart procedure to relieve pressure. "He had what we would term severe multisystem organ failure: his lungs, his heart, his kidneys," Dr Szmuszkovicz said.

[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has been identified as one of the serious complications of SARS-CoV-2 in children, teenagers, and case reports have demonstrated young adult cases as well. The majority of cases have onset within 2-4 weeks following infection with the SARS-CoV-2. Clinical presentations have included shock, cardiac involvement, gastrointestinal involvement, and significantly elevated inflammatory markers. A good review of the syndrome can be found in Godfred-Cato S, Bryant B, Leung J, et al. COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children -- United States, March-July 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020 Aug 14; 69(32): 1074-1080. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6932e2. PMID: 32790663; PMCID: PMC7440126; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e2.htm.

Since the early reports of this syndrome emerged in the USA and Europe, cases have been reported from all 6 of the WHO regions (see a sampling of publications describing cases from the various countries in the selected references below).

Returning to the media report above, the anecdotal observations of increased severities and numbers of cases being seen by some of the tertiary care facilities in the USA warrants further investigation. Is the incidence actually increasing? Is there a simultaneous increase in numbers of cases confirmed in children in the 2nd and 3rd waves of the pandemic in the USA? Are other countries observing the same increase in cases and severity?

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [14 Feb 2021], 10 am CET.

Global overview
---------------
The number of global new cases reported has continued to fall, with 2.7 million new cases last week, a 16% decline over 500 000 fewer new cases compared to the previous week (Figure 1). The number of new deaths reported also fell, with 81 000 new deaths reported last week, a 10% decline as compared to the previous week. A total of 5 out of 6 WHO regions reported a double-digit percentage decline in new cases (Table 1), with only the Eastern Mediterranean Region showing a 7% rise. Europe and the Americas continue to see the greatest drops in absolute numbers of cases. Meanwhile, the number of new deaths declined in all regions.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be the United States of America (673 630 cases, a 23% decrease), Brazil (318 290 cases, a 3% decrease), France (127 565 cases, a 6% decrease), the Russian Federation (104 602 cases, an 11% decrease), and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (97 271 cases, a 27% decrease).

Special focus: Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System -- leveraging influenza sentinel surveillance systems to respond to COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) is a network of 158 institutions monitoring the spread and evolution of influenza all year-round. It includes 6 WHO Collaborating Centres and National Influenza centres (NICs) from 126 countries, areas, and territories. It functions as a global mechanism for surveillance, preparedness and response for seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza, and a global alert for novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens. More than 3.5 million respiratory specimens are tested for influenza each year with assured quality and standards. These specimens are collected from patients presenting at sentinel hospitals and primary care settings with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). More than 10 000 representative influenza viruses are sequenced each year and the genetic sequence data shared via the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). Countries also typically share about 40 000 influenza specimens throughout the year with WHO Collaborating Centres, of which around a quarter undergo a detailed virus characterization that informs the biannual recommendations for the seasonal influenza vaccine composition for the northern and southern hemispheres.

GISRS and COVID-19
------------------
Throughout the COVID-19 response, GISRS laboratories have contributed significantly to country diagnostic and sequencing capacities. Since the onset of the pandemic, 87% of GISRS laboratories have been serving as national reference laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 detection. GISRS has leveraged its External Quality Assessment Program (EQAP) for influenza molecular diagnostics to develop and implement the SARS-CoV-2 EQAP to more than 233 national public health laboratories (including 130 NICs) from 164 countries, areas, and territories, with 94% of the laboratories demonstrating 100% correct results.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza surveillance systems were leveraged to address the critical need to monitor trends in community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. To date, approximately 60 countries have reported integrated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza data that complement SARS-CoV-2 cases detected through non-sentinel sources. The transmission trends based on sentinel surveillance serve to complement and corroborate the transmission trends seen from non-sentinel data sources.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern highlights the importance of quality, representativeness, and geographical coverage of genetic sequencing, and the timeliness of sharing of genetic sequence data on publicly accessible databases. As of [10 Feb 2021], more than 450 000 whole genome sequences of SARSCoV-2 from 131 countries had been shared with GISAID. However, the majority (approximately 70%) are from 3 countries (Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America). At least 60% of GISRS laboratories have shared whole genome sequences with GISAID (Figure 3).

The IHR Emergency Committee for COVID-19 recommended further increases in global sequencing capacities and encouraged the further rapid sharing of data. It recognizes the role of GISRS to strengthen sequencing capacities for SARS-CoV-2 and increase the global genetic database that improves the geographic and demographic representativeness, timeliness and quality of meta-data around the world. WHO is working with GISRS to expedite the sequencing component of sentinel surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 along with influenza and has issued guidance to support in this effort.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions and researchers, continues to monitor the public health events associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides updates as new information becomes available. Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOC) is available from previously published Disease Outbreak News and recent publications of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports]. Here we provide an update on the geographical distribution of 3 variants of concern as reported by countries, territories and areas (hereafter countries) as of [15 Feb 2021]. New variants of potential interest or concern are currently under review and may be incorporated into future updates.

Table 2: Condensed overview of emerging information on key variants of concern, as of [15 Feb 2021].

1. Variant VOC 202012/01
Since our last update on [9 Feb 2021], variant VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 8 additional countries. As of [16 Feb 2021], a total of 94 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported either imported cases or community transmission of this variant ([Figure 5]). Local transmission has been reported in at least 47 countries across all 6 WHO regions.

In an updated report on SARS-CoV-2 and increased circulation of variants of concern in the EU/EEA and vaccine rollout, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) highlights that while a number of European countries have been reporting an overall decrease in the incidence of COVID-19, likely due to a strong combination of public health and social measures, the majority of countries in Europe continues to experience high or increasing notification rates among older age groups and/or high death rates. /1 Moreover, among samples tested in Europe by PCR-based screening and whole genome sequencing, the proportion of cases infected with VOC 202012/01 has increased in the past weeks, indicating community transmission in a number of countries. /1

3. Variant P.1
Since our last update, variant P.1 has been reported in 6 additional countries. To date, this variant is reported in 21 countries across 5 of the 6 WHO regions ([Figure 7]). So far, local transmission has been reported in at least 2 countries in one WHO region.

A list of countries/territories/areas reporting variants of concern can be found in Annex 2.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (63 517), and Brazil (55 271) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 108 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 15 Feb 2021 to late 16 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France (19 590), Russia (13 233), India (11 795), UK (10 625), Italy (10 368), Spain (10 057) and Indonesia (10 029). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 24.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 7.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases over 350 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 110.02 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.42 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. With renewed interest in relaxing restrictions, especially in the USA, I can't help but wonder if this will be accompanied by yet another wave. - Mod.MPP]
