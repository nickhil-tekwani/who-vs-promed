DISEASE SURVEILLANCE - TAIWAN
=============================
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 10:42:41 +0800
From: Trong-Neng Wu <wutn@net.dsqs.gov.tw>

I am the director of National Disease Surveillance and Quarantine Service in
Taiwan. I subscribed to ProMED-mail five months ago. ProMED-mail is very
helpful for knowing outbreaks occurring in other countries. I read mails
every morning and circulate the important information to our infection
control staffs.
Case reporting is the main task for Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
in Taiwan, the tests of antibiotic resistant of micro-organisms are not the
routine work for every reported case.

Thanks for your efforts to maitain the ProMED network system. In order to
have some contribution to ProMED network system, I hope we will post our
information frequently in the future. [We look forward to receiving it - Mod.JW]
