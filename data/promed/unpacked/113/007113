Three Americans were found dead and a 4th person was hospitalized Friday [6 May 2022] at a Sandals [Emerald Bay] resort in The Bahamas, officials said. It remains unclear how they died. Royal Bahamas Police Force said it was investigating a report that a couple had complained of feeling ill and had sought treatment at a hospital.

In a statement to USA Today, Sandals confirmed the deaths at Sandals Emerald Bay on Great Exuma, an island known as a luxury travel destination. "It is with deep sadness that we can confirm the passing of 3 guests at Sandals Emerald Bay on May 6, 2022," Stacy Royal, a spokesperson for Sandals, said in a statement. "A health emergency was initially reported, and following our protocols, we immediately alerted emergency medical professionals and relevant local authorities."

On Friday [6 May 2022] morning, resort staff members notified George Town Police that a man was found unresponsive in one of the villas. While officers were on their way to the resort, they were told another man and woman were found unresponsive in another villa, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said.

Officers found a man lying on the ground in the 1st villa, police said. He was later pronounced dead, but an examination of the body found no signs of trauma.

Police then found a man in the bathroom of another villa and a woman unresponsive on a bed. Both "showed signs of convulsion," police said, but no signs of trauma. That couple had complained of feeling ill the evening before and had returned to their villa after receiving treatment at a hospital, investigators said.

Another American woman was airlifted to a hospital, said Bahamas Acting Prime Minister Chester Cooper, adding that police did not suspect foul play in the deaths. Police were awaiting an autopsy report to determine the cause of the deaths, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force.

Sandals Resorts is based in Jamaica and operates several resorts in Jamaica, The Bahamas, and the Caribbean.

"Nothing is more important to Sandals Resorts than the safety of our guests," the company's statement said, in part. "We are actively working to support both the investigation as well as the guests' families in every way possible during this difficult time. Out of respect for the privacy of our guests, we cannot disclose further information at this time."

Three Americans were found dead in a luxury resort in the Bahamas, and a 4th was airlifted to a hospital, according to authorities. The guests died at the Sandals Emerald Bay resort on Exuma and were identified as Americans by Chester Cooper, the Bahamas acting prime minister, who said foul play was not suspected.

Hotel staff called authorities around 9 a.m. Friday [6 May 2022] morning with a report that a guest had been found unresponsive in one of the beachfront hotel's villas, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Police found the man lying on a bedroom floor with no sign of trauma. He was pronounced dead by a local doctor, police said.

Police were then directed to a 2nd villa where a man was found slumped against a bathroom wall, also unresponsive. An unresponsive woman was found on a bed, police said. They both showed signs of having suffered a convulsion, but no trauma, and were pronounced dead, police said.

The couple complained of feeling sick the previous night and had been treated at a local medical facility before returning to the hotel, according to police, who said they were waiting for autopsy reports to determine the causes of death. The identity of the victims hasn't been released.

Dr. Michael Darville, the Bahamas health minister, told a local television station he flew to the island with a team of officials to make sure there was no public health emergency at the hotel. "We thought we might have to make a makeshift facility, a mini hospital," he said, adding that was not necessary. "We believe it's an isolated situation that revolves around 4 people," he said.

Darville would not speculate on what might have happened. He said the guests who sought treatment Thursday [5 May 2022] suffered from nausea and vomiting. The 4th guest also sought treatment at a clinic before being taken to a hospital, he said.

A Bahamas news channel tweeted video of a plane it said was carrying an American woman to Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau.

Sandals released a statement confirming the deaths and saying the hotel had immediately alerted emergency medical services and authorities of a "health emergency."

"We are actively working to support both the investigation and the guests' families in every way possible during this difficult time. Out of respect for the privacy of our guests, we cannot disclose further information at this time," the statement read.

The resort bills itself as a luxury, adults-only hotel that "is the ultimate romantic getaway." It offers golf, scuba diving, volleyball, and entertainment. A week in a junior villa suite this month [May 2022] is running around USD 10 000 for 2 adults, according to the resort's website.

A 65-year-old Florida man killed by a suspected air conditioning leak at a luxury Sandals resort was there to celebrate his wedding anniversary with his wife. [He] died Friday morning [6 May 2022] at Sandals Emerald Bay in Exuma while on vacation with his wife, 64, [who] woke up to find herself paralyzed and her late husband not moving, the couple's devastated son told ABC News.

Another man and woman -- both from America -- also died but have yet to be named. All victims are said to have suffered convulsions before their deaths.

The stricken son said his mom had first fallen ill on Thursday [5 May 2022] and visited a local clinic. She was discharged shortly afterward and believed her health had improved. [She] is now being airlifted back to Florida for further medical treatment.

Meanwhile, another vacationer has shared dramatic testimony of what happened. [....] "It sounds like it may have been a fault with the a/c in the unit, causing a toxic coolant leak," the post reads. Most air conditioners use a chemical called freon as a coolant, a moderately toxic gas that is tasteless and mostly odorless, and that can prove deadly if inhaled over a prolonged period of time.

[The other vacationer's] claims come as police continue to investigate the deaths of the 3 American guests, 2 of whom complained of illness to hotel staff the previous evening. An investigation by police discerned that those 2 guests, a couple staying at the same villa, suffered convulsions before their death. 'Our initial investigations revealed that the couple found in the second villa complained of illness the previous evening,' a statement released by New Providence police said. 'They attended the local medical facility and, on completion of receiving treatment, they returned to their lodging.'

Hotel staff came across the 1st body shortly after 9 a.m. Friday [6 May 2022] in a villa separate from that of the now-deceased couple, police said in their statement. Officers at the George Town Police Station arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, where they were notified by hotel staff that another 2 guests -- the couple -- had also been found unresponsive in another villa. Police entered the 1st villa to find [a hotel guest] lying on the ground with no signs of trauma, authorities said. The local doctor pronounced [the guest] dead at the scene. [The guest's] wife was then airlifted to a hospital in the capital city Nassau Friday morning [6 May 2022], Exuma MP and Minister of Tourism Chester Cooper said. She has since been airlifted to Kendall Regional facility in Florida, her son, who learned of his parents' deaths after receiving a call from the US Embassy Friday [6 May 2022] night, told ABC.

After speaking to his mother, [the son] detailed to the outlet how she had found her husband Friday [6 May 2022] morning unresponsive on the floor, after also falling ill the previous [day]. "She woke up, and my dad was laying there on the floor, and she couldn't move," he said. "Her legs and arms were swollen and she couldn't move and she screamed to get someone to come in the door." She told her son she had fallen ill on Thursday [5 May 2022] but 'thought she was alright' after visiting the clinic, he said.

In the 2nd villa, an unidentified man was found 'slumped against a wall in a bathroom' and the woman on a bed, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a statement. 'Both individuals showed signs of convulsion,' police said.

They added that no signs of trauma were found on either bodies.

[Minimal details are given about the circumstances that led to the deaths of 3 out of 4 Americans staying at a beach resort in the Bahamas. The 2 couples were staying in 2 separate "villas"; not stated is how the 2 "villas" are situated in relation to each other. Some of the 4 people had been sick for at least 2 days with nausea and vomiting, seeking care at a local medical facility. No further details are given, other than the police saying that 2 may have convulsed prior to death. At this point, there is insufficient information to speculate on the cause of this illness in these 4 resort guests, although another hotel guest speculated that leaking air conditioner coolant may have been at fault. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
