As measles outbreaks grow in many nations, including the United States, a study today [29 Mar 2019] on a previous outbreak in Mongolia demonstrates just how deadly the disease can be, while the WHO issues a call for full vaccination coverage in the Western Pacific in the wake of a huge outbreak in the Philippines.

In the study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Mongolia linked national vital records with surveillance data of clinically or lab-confirmed measles cases in babies younger than 1 year who had an onset of rash from March -- September 2015 (wave 1) and October 2015 -- June 2016 (wave 2).

They note that infant measles deaths in the outbreak rose from 3 among 2224 cases (case-fatality rate [CFR], 0.13%) in wave 1 to 113 among 4884 cases (CFR, 2.31%) in wave 2, or almost 18 times higher. They also noted that hospital admission 7-21 days before measles rash onset for pneumonia or influenza, but not other diagnoses, was significantly associated with death.

The WHO, meanwhile, said in a news release that measles outbreaks in its Western Pacific Region are putting children at risk and threatening progress toward elimination. It said the region had historically low measles cases and no major outbreaks in 2017, but so far this year [2019] the Philippines has reported 23 000 cases and 333 deaths, already more than all of last year's totals.

Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and Viet Nam have also reported cases. The agency encouraged comprehensive vaccination campaigns to make sure all children are protected. "Measles spreads like wildfire," said Regional Director Takeshi Kasai, MD, PhD. "It is the most contagious human disease, and it's very good at seeking out and spreading among even small groups of people who are not immune."

More than 30 people, especially children, have been hospitalised following a measles outbreak in Kagadi District. The measles outbreak has been reported in Rugashali and Mabale sub-counties.

Ms Naster Tumwine, a medical worker at a local clinic in Rugashali town, said the affected parishes include Rugashali, Yerudani, Buhumuriro and Ndeeba.

"It has been reported that the epidemic has been spread by students studying at Rugashali Secondary School but hailing from Bukyinda-Kyangwali in Kikuube District. We have so far registered at least 30 patients here," Ms Tumwine said.

She added that the patients are responding to medication, but the number is increasing daily. Mr Medias Mutume Kakwavu, the female councilor for Ndeeba Sub-county said residents have resorted to use of local medicines.

"We have confirmed the increasing numbers of measles patients. This is because these people could have missed immunisation during childhood. We are using cow dung and mushrooms to treat the disease. The government should come in and immunise the children," Mr Mutume added.

The Kagadi District secretary for health, Mr John Alibankoha, told Daily Monitor that the outbreak is spreading to other areas. "I monitored the outpatient departments of several health centres and found out that most of the registers have measles patients," Mr Alibankoha said.

He said they have started a measles immunisation campaign in the district. The Kagadi District Health Officer, Mr James Olwo, said samples from patients which were recently sent to the virus research institute in Kampala for further analysis tested positive for measles. "We are waiting for the Ministry of Health to organise mass immunization because it is not only here," Mr Olwo said.

Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2-3 years, and measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. Approximately 110 000 people died from measles in 2017, mostly children under the age of 5 years. [WHO]

Situation.
In July 2018, the 1st case of measles was notified in the urban health centre of the district of Antananarivo Renivohitra in Madagascar. According to WHO, from 4 Oct 2018 to 7 Jan 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 "facility-based" deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) were reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar.

In February 2019 (weeks 7-8), an overall 774 new cases were recorded in 3 newly affected districts including Andilamena (145 cases in week 7 and 167 cases in week 8); Mahajanga II (142 cases in week 7 and 241 cases in week 8) and Mahanoro (22 cases in week 7 and 57 cases in week 8). Despite stabilizing in some areas, the above-mentioned spikes show that the epidemic is progressing, and the epidemic is now posing significant risk to remote and hard to reach communities as seen in the table below, which summarizes the rate at which the disease has been spreading, with 7288 new cases in March 2019 (weeks 9-12).

Indeed, from the onset of the outbreak until 20 Mar 2019, some 117 075 cases have been recorded with 638 deaths notified by health facilities, while 567 deaths have been reported within the communities (114 deaths related to measles and 453 unrelated deaths as per community volunteers). As per Ministry of Health (MoH), about 56% of cases are unvaccinated or of unknown vaccine status. Most cases have been reported in children under 9 years old. Some 105 districts are currently in epidemic situation in the overall 22 regions of the country. The increase in cases can be seen in graphs in the pdf listed above.

Madagascar has not suffered any measles outbreaks in the last 13 years (since 2005) and was already on the road to eliminating measles.

More than 900 Aucklanders could have been exposed to measles, prompting the regional health service to contact those at risk individually.

It comes as Auckland Regional Public Health Service said there were now 10 confirmed cases across the region.

Four of the 6 new cases were linked to existing ones as they shared a household, but the other 2 were not linked.

They include a woman, in her 40s, who was infectious when she visited a number of supermarkets and a cafe, and a man in his 30s whose measles was confirmed in the past 2 days.

The service is following up with his family, work or social contacts, who may have been exposed to the virus. A further 62 non-immune people were in quarantine, ARPHS confirmed.

ARPHS's medical officer Dr William Rainger said health authorities had been "tracing all household, work, social or other contacts to check their immunity, discuss quarantine and monitor the appearance of any symptoms." These are standard public health procedures, he said.

Of the 10 cases, one was an 18-year-old student at the University of Auckland. When the 1st-year student was confirmed as having measles, ARPHS contacted about 600 people who attended lectures and tutorials with the person.

Meanwhile, Canterbury is facing an outbreak of measles, with 35 confirmed cases in the region. There have also been cases reported in Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Dunedin, according to ESR.

A New York county's ban on unvaccinated minors in public is working, an official told CNBC on Fri [29 Mar 2019]. Rockland County Executive Ed Day said more than 500 immunizations have been administered since he announced the ban on Tue [26 Mar 2019].

The current rate for those under 18 is 72 percent, he noted. Health officials say the best way to stop the disease's spread is a vaccination rate in the community of 92 to 95 percent.

[7] USA (New York): Understanding Orthodox community
Date: Sun 31 Mar 2019

The measles outbreak that sickened 37 people in Brooklyn and Rockland last week alone, has many wondering how, in the 21st Century we continue to be plagued by the nearly eradicated disease.

33 new cases were diagnosed in Brooklyn, while 4 more new diagnoses were identified in Rockland County.

Since October 2019, in New York City and Rockland, a total of 371 cases have been confirmed.

The outbreaks, which have been traced back to Israel and Europe, have rocked not only the Orthodox Jewish communities they've hit hardest, but have altered the mindset of an America accustomed to not having to worry about measles as a public health threat.

Last week, Rockland County Executive Ed Day declared a state of emergency that includes a prohibition against children who have not been immunized from congregating in public places like restaurants, shopping centers and houses of worship.

Rabbis throughout Brooklyn are urging their followers daily to get vaccinated, advice that would have been considered unnecessary not long ago.

The outbreaks are also forcing many Orthodox Jewish people to ask themselves how this happened and whether there's something unique in the community that has brought it to this place.

One factor some quickly point to is an anti-vaccination strain of literature making the rounds in Brooklyn and Rockland, a pamphlet distributed from the shadowy group PEACH, or Parents Educating & Advocating for Children's Health.

The pamphlet falsely states that the measles vaccine "kills more kids than the disease would." It also includes a passage with the signatures of several rabbis -- including Shmuel Kamenetsky, a well-respected rabbi based in Philadelphia -- who argues schools shouldn't refuse entry to children who have not been vaccinated.

"Anytime there is a community leader or a rabbi that expresses any opinion on anything in any direction certainly people will be influenced," said Yossi Gestetner, co-founder of the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council.

There's also a distrust and questioning of secular authority in the Orthodox world that may have led parents to delay getting their children vaccinated or forego the precaution completely.

Gestetner noted that state's decision last fall to lower the age threshold for a child's 1st measles vaccination from the typical 15 months to 6 months fueled suspicion among the Orthodox. The move essentially raised the question: if the government is such an authority, why change the age?

The answer, of course, was to decrease the likelihood of the disease spreading, according to Rockland officials.

All of these explanations for why the Orthodox community has been so impacted ignore one significant fact: numbers.

David Greenfield, CEO of the Jewish non-profit Met Council and a former city Council member, noted that there is a much higher percentage of children within the Orthodox community than in other groups, making it especially susceptible to higher rates of infection. "Almost everybody in the community is vaccinated," he said, noting that there are approximately 150 000 children enrolled in yeshivas throughout New York State. "Even it were one percent, one percent would be 1500 kids."

"The number of children infected is far less than 1%," said city health department spokesman Michael Lanza. "But city Health Department officials say that should not stop people who haven't been immunized from getting the vaccine."

The unvaccinated child from Calaveras County who contracted the measles was diagnosed at UC Davis Medical Center last week, health officials confirmed Thu [28 Mar 2019].

The child contracted the measles while traveling overseas. She was diagnosed during a visit to UC Davis Medical Center on 17 Mar 2019 and is no longer at the hospital, officials said.

The case is one of several confirmed and suspected measles cases that have cropped up recently in Northern California.

Health officials are investigating 3 cases of the measles in one family in Placer County.

The Placer County Public Health Department said in an update Wed [27 Mar 2019] that the cases are considered confirmed because they meet the clinical criteria for diagnosis and are linked to other confirmed cases.

In Butte County, 2 unvaccinated adults contracted the virus, health officials said. Those cases were connected to a case of the measles in Shasta County. Officials said the cases were part of a measles cluster.

Health officials said the infected Shasta County patient traveled to places in Shasta, Butte and Tehama counties and possibly spread the virus [see URL].

In Placer County, officials identified one location where others may have been exposed [see URL].

So far this year [2019], the California Department of Health has confirmed 7 cases of the measles across the state.

A majority of British Columbians are still worried about the recent measles outbreak, according to a recent poll. However, 23% of residents feel doubtful towards vaccines. Nine percent of respondents were classified as "anti-vaxxers."

A recent poll suggests a "significant" part of British Columbians have doubts when it comes to vaccines, despite the majority expressing concern about the recent measles outbreak in the region.

According to the Insights West poll, even though almost 8 in 10 people in the province are concerned about the recent outbreak, nearly a quarter of those polled said they have some doubts about vaccines.

"That's a pretty massive number," says Steve Mossop with Insights West. "This is your neighbour, this is your friend, and the number of arguments that resonate with that 25 per cent also means that we need to have a better education campaign."

About 9 per cent of those who reported doubts were classified as "anti-vaxxers," explains Mossop, while the other half vaccinate their kids to be on the safe side but reported having doubts.

Some also reported that vaccinations are encouraged simply because pharmaceutical companies are trying to make money.

He says misinformation seems to be at the root of the problem.

"One of the top reasons is a miss-perception by 42 per cent of British Columbians that vaccines are not always effective in preventing what they are set out to prevent," he adds.

With all that being said, Mossop says most of us in BC are open to taking public safety measures to stop the spread of the disease.

"B.C. is known for maybe outside ideas, and I think there are definitely more anti-vaxxers here in B.C. However that being said, it is a fairly small number." For instance, around 90 per cent say parents should have to show proof of vaccinations when enrolling kids in public school.

He says a strong public education campaign is needed to fully tout the benefits of vaccinations.

The poll was conducted online between 8-11 Mar 2019, 807 B.C. adult residents participated. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 per cent.

[11] Lithuania: 310 cases this year

Measles in Lithuania is up to 310 cases this year [2019] compared to 30 cases for 2018 in total. The number of measles cases is projected to increase further in Lithuania, as people have lost their collective immunity to this highly contagious viral disease, Director of Lithuania's Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), Saulius Caplinskas, said on Fri [29 Mar 2019].

"The collective immunity has been lost, as a 95 per cent measles vaccination coverage rate is considered as minimum to prevent an outbreak. There are new suspected cases of measles; blood samples are being examined. I have no doubt that in the nearest future, there will be new cases,'' Caplinskas was quoted as saying by local news website lrt.lt.

Recent data from ULAC shows that the proportion of children vaccinated against measles in the country has decreased from 97 per cent in 2009 to 92.2 per cent in 2018 due to parents' reluctance to vaccinate their kids.

According to ULAC, every year, some 5000 children are not vaccinated in Lithuania.

"Measles outbreaks feature certain upswings and descents, yet we will have to live under the threat of measles for a while,'' Caplinskas said.

In total, 310 cases of measles have been registered as of Fri [29 Mar 2019] in Lithuania this year [2019], compared to 30 cases for the whole of 2018, ULAC data showed.

The largest number of cases, 149, was registered in Kaunas, Lithuania's 2nd largest city. In Vilnius, the capital, 39 measles cases have been registered to date.

Measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus, says the World Health Organization.
