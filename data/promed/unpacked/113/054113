[This report carries no official lab-based confirmation from the health
authorities of Nepal. ProMED-mail would appreciate further information from
knowledgeable source. Nevertheless, there have been vivid description of JE
epidemic in Nepal in the past. The most notable epidemic was reported in
1978, described in reference 1 : "the disease was first recorded in Nepal
in 1978 as an epidemic in Rupandehi district of the Western Development
Region (WDR) and Morang of the Eastern Region (EDR). At present the disease
is endemic in 24 districts. Although JE as found endemic mainly in tropical
climate areas, existence and proliferation of encephalitis causing viruses
in temperate and cold climates of hills and valleys are possible. Total of
26 667 cases and 5381 deaths have been reported with average case fatality
rate of 20.2 per cent in an aggregate since 1978." According to the
authors, there are no lack of effective mosquito species (ref 2), such as
_Cx tritaeniorhyncus_, which are abundant in the local rice paddies. JEV
isolates have been obtained from JEV-infected _Cx tritaeniorhyncus_ females.

[JE virus is transmitted by the Vishnui group of _Culex_ mosquitoes. Wild
birds are the vertebrate hosts of the virus, and pigs may serve as
amplifying hosts. These reports do not indicate whether any vector control
measures are being carried out in the areas where cases are occurring. JE
virus vaccines are available, and ProMED-mail would be interested in
knowing whether there have been vaccination campaigns or whether
individuals in areas where JE occurs seasonally are routinely vaccinated.
