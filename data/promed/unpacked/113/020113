About 2 months ago, [a man] who rears goats in Kitengela [map at https://goo.gl/2C4htH] came to my office in Nairobi with 3 goats in his covered pick-up truck. He found me at the reception just finishing off with another client.

[The man] looked disturbed and eager to have his case attended to. "My goats have been dying in the last 2 months and treatment does not appear to help," he told me. He further wondered why he kept getting strange cases on his farm.

At his car, he gave me the full history of the disease in his goats. He had 100 small east African breed goats of various ages on his farm. He had bought most of the animals from other areas of Kajiado county to ensure there was minimal change in the animals' environmental conditions.

Around June this year [2017], he bought 5 male Gala bucks from Isiolo aiming to improve the average body size of his goats. However, in July some of the goats started getting sick.

It started with 2 goats, which showed poor appetite, weakness, and getting startled by loud noise. One of the goats died soon after showing poor appetite while the other one started going round in circles before dying.

None of the goats from Isiolo was affected. The 1st 2 goats died without treatment and [the farmer] did not get a doctor to carry out post-mortem examination. Within 2 weeks, 3 other goats showed similar symptoms. One of the goats had stiff legs and would sometimes topple over and keep pedalling the legs as though riding an imaginary bicycle.

The 3 goats in the car started showing signs similar to the others 2 days before. I examined the goats and confirmed the signs of disease as [the farmer] had described. In addition, one of the goats had diarrhoea. All the goats had elevated body temperature or fever and higher than normal breathing rates. One goat had muffled heart sounds. One of the goats lay on the side, kept pedalling and would get startled on being touched or when I tapped the floor of the car.

"This is a bacterial disease called heartwater or Ondiri disease," I told him after concluding the examination.

I treated the goats with antibiotics both directly into the blood through the jugular vein and also into the muscles.
I cautioned [the owner] that the goat that was unable to stand would most likely succumb.

It was nonetheless advisable to treat the animals as some cases could still recover at that stage.

Heartwater derives its name from the accumulation of fluid it causes in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. The fluid prevents a doctor from clearly hearing the heart beat sounds using a stethoscope.

The illness is also called Ondiri disease because the 1st case in Kenya was diagnosed around the Ondiri swamp in Kikuyu.

The disease is spread by the _Amblyomma_ species of ticks. It is caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia ruminantium_ [also referred to as _Ehrlichia ruminantium_]. Immature and adult ticks are infected with the bacteria when they feed on infected or carrier animals. They inject the germs into healthy animals when they attach on the skin to feed.

Heartwater is widely spread in Africa but the _Amblyomma_ tick may be found in areas where the disease organisms are not present. Animals that recover naturally from the disease become carriers of the bacteria.

This may explain why [this man's] goats from Isiolo were not affected by the disease. Animals from areas where the disease is present are also more resistant to the infection than those from clean areas. They may carry the bacteria in their bodies without developing the disease.

The disease affects cattle, sheep, goats, and some wild ruminants such as deer and other antelopes.

In addition to the disease pattern seen [in this case], animals may also die suddenly without exhibiting signs of heartwater. This happens when the infection causes severe damage to the heart.

Some animals may also show coughing, pressing of the head against objects due to swelling of the brain, bleeding in the gums, and abortions.

To effectively control heartwater, farmers should treat their animals against ticks with chemicals once per week.

They should also promptly detect signs of illness and report to veterinary doctors for immediate treatment. Animals from infected areas should be given preventive antibiotic treatment before being mixed with others.

I gave all the goats on [this farm] preventive antibiotic treatment since laboratory screening of the whole herd would be too expensive for him.

[The farmer] also started washing his goats once a week with acaricides. 2 of the sick goats recovered but the one that was pedalling died. No other case of heartwater has appeared on the farm.

[Heartwater (cowdriosis) is an OIE-listed rickettsial disease of domestic and wild ruminants caused by _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ (formerly _Cowdria ruminantium_) and transmitted by _Amblyomma_ ticks. It is also known by the synonyms malkopsiekte (Afrikaans), péricardite exsudative infectieuse (French), hidrocarditis infecciosa (Portuguese), idropericardite dei ruminanti (Italian), and a variety of names in different African languages, such as Ondiri disease in Kenya.

_E. ruminantium_ is classified in the order Rickettsiales and in the family Anaplasmataceae, together with the genus _Anaplasma_. Although ruminants remain the primary target of the pathogen, in South Africa a possible canine _E. ruminantium_ infection has been reported and was strongly suspected in humans (see further). In ruminants, the specific diagnosis is readily obtained by clinical examinations supported by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained brain tissue samples presenting the typical colonies of _E. ruminantium_ in capillary endothelial cells. Several other diagnostic tests are described in refs 1 and 2 below. Isolation and characterisation of the infectious agent is necessary before _E. ruminantium_ can be considered an emerging pathogen in species other than ruminants and especially in humans.

Heartwater occurs in nearly all the sub-Saharan countries of Africa where _Amblyomma_ ticks are present and in the surrounding islands: Madagascar, Reunion, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands, and São Tomé. The disease is also reported in the Caribbean (Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Antigua), from where it threatens the American mainland. All domestic and wild ruminants can be infected, but the former appear to be the most susceptible. Indigenous domestic ruminants are usually more resistant to the disease. Wild animals could play a role as reservoir, but Rusa deer, white tailed deer, springbok, chital, timor deer, which are used in wildlife farming, seem to be the main wild ruminant species in which heartwater can have a significant economic impact. The disease can cause high mortality (up to 90 percent) in susceptible domestic ruminants. Goats and sheep are more susceptible than cattle, and European breeds are generally more susceptible than indigenous African breeds.

Clinically, the disease most commonly presents as an acute form characterised by a sudden high fever, depressed demeanour, nervous signs, and a high mortality. Hydropericardium and hydrothorax and lung oedema are commonly associated post-mortem signs. Acute and peracute clinical forms of the disease occur: in the former, there are high death rates without many clinical manifestations and in the latter, there is a higher recovery rate.

Recovered animals become carriers of infection. Certain wild animals can play a role as reservoir; Rusa deer, white tailed deer, and springbok are susceptible to this infection and can experience high mortality.

Ref 1 (chapter "Heartwater", Iowa State University's Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH), updated 2015) includes the following comment addressing the zoonotic potential of heartwater: "Currently, the evidence that _E. ruminantium_ may be zoonotic is limited to findings published in 2005, which reported positive PCR results for this organism in three fatal cases of human ehrlichiosis in Africa. 2 cases occurred in children with encephalitis, vasculitis of the brain, and pulmonary edema. Clinical details were not available for the other case, an adult. _E. ruminantium_ was not proven to be the cause of death in any of these 3 individuals, and it remains to be determined whether this organism can cause illnesses in humans. As of 2015, there appear to be no additional reports of possible zoonotic infections."
