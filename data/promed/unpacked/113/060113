The authorities responded with resolve when a serious outbreak of anthrax shook the far northern Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug [province] in summer 2016. A mass evacuation of reindeer herders, including children, quickly started from the exposed areas and the country's Ministry of Defence launched a special emergency task force equipped with 30 tons of biologically active agents aimed at decontamination of infected areas.

At the same time, a mass vaccination program was launched. That program is continuing this summer [2017]. According to regional authorities, the whole regional reindeer population of about 730 000 will be vaccinated in the course of the summer. So far, at least 230 000 animals have got the vaccine, the Yamal-Nenets government informs.

The anthrax outbreak zone was in the Yamalsky district, the part of the [province] that covers all of the Yamal Peninsula. About 70 000 reindeers have since then been vaccinated in the peninsula. A total of 170 specialists divided on 26 vaccination teams are currently engaged in the effort, the regional government says.

Also in the neighboring Nenets Autonomous Okrug a comprehensive vaccination program is unfolding. According to regional authorities about 100 000 animals have so far got the vaccine. The region has about 180 000 reindeer. The 2 sparsely populated regions are among Russia's biggest producers of oil and gas and have significant importance for the country's economy.

The 2016 anthrax outbreak is believed to have come from an old burial site with reindeer that died of the disease more than 70 years ago. Veterinary authorities fear that more outbreaks will occur as climate change is melting the tundra permafrost bringing more similar burials sites to the open. "There are thousands of such cattle graves across Russia and many of them are inside the Arctic Circle, says Sergey Netesov, Chief of the bionanotechnology, microbiology, and virology laboratory with Novosibirsk State university told the media.

Anthrax infections are lethal unless they are treated with antibiotics. A young boy died and at least 115 people were hospitalized during the 2016 outbreak. The military personnel sent to the region burned more than 2300 infected reindeer to halt the spread of the infection.

[It is not absolutely clear but the 2017 vaccination programme is covering the Yamalsky district affected in 2016 and the Yamal Peninsula, and an adjoining Nenets Autonomous Okrug also seen to be at risk. They estimate that some 800 000 reindeer will have been vaccinated by the end of the summer (2017). A very significant challenge for the vaccinating teams, the organisers, and the reindeer owners. And it is August. We wish our Russian colleagues the very best of luck and good fortune, and may it be boring. When there are adventures it means that something has gone wrong.
