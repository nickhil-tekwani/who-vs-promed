[USDA-APHIS (US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service) has published a fact sheet about caprine
arthritis/encephalitis (CAE). The description below is from the fact
sheet, which can be found in more detail at
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergingissues/downloads/prcaevinfosheet.pdf.

Caprine arthritis/encephalitis is a viral disease of goats that is
caused by the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV). CAEV is a
lentivirus, and one of several lentiviruses in the family
_Retroviridae_. Other retroviruses are human immunodeficiency virus,
which causes AIDS in humans; maedi-visna virus of sheep; bovine
leukosis virus of cows; avian leukosis virus of chickens; and simian
immunodeficiency virus of monkeys.

The multisystem diseases caused by CAEV infection are: arthritis,
pneumonia, mastitis, weight loss (all of which are more common in does
and bucks), and encephalitis (more common in kids).

It appears as if the cases may be occurring in an urban setting and
in high economic value goats which would be an interesting and unusual
population at risk for further cases.

The location of the outbreak can be found appended to the OIE WAHID
report at the source URL above or at http://healthmap.org/r/0_Az. -
