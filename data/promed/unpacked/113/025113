Renewed West Nile Virus Activity in Israel
------------------------------------------
The following report appeared in the Israeli Daily Maariv today. "A
50-year-old male, suffering from high fever and diarrhea, was hospitalized
in the Hillel-Yaffe hospital in Hadera; following last year's outbreak of
West Nile fever, all fever cases in hospitals are routinely tested for West
Nile virus. The positive laboratory results were obtained after the release
of the patient.
Dr Alex Leventhal, Head of the Public Health Services in the Israeli
Ministry of Health, has indicated that the described case is the first
confirmed one this summer, though several dozens of serum samples are sent
and tested daily. So far, all of them have been found negative and the
current finding is not indicative for future developments. He said that
surveillance is being carried out in animals and arthropods, so far without
detection of West Nile virus activity."
Arnon Shimshony writes: I have verified the [accuracy of the press report
with the Department of Epidemiology at the Israeli Ministry of Health. The
patient (aged 51, from a rural location in the Sharon region) was
hospitalized last week and discharged after 4 days. He was found to be
IgM-positive for West Nile virus. Though West Nile fever was not suspected
clinically, high fever led to his inclusion in the West Nile virus testing
scheme.
During the year 2000, 417 clinical cases in humans were diagnosed in
Israel, of which 326 (78.1%) were hospitalized and 35 (8.4%) died; all but
one of the latter being older than 68.
Vector control and West Nile virus surveillance activities are coordinated
in Israel between the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture
(Veterinary Services), and the Ministry of the Environment.
