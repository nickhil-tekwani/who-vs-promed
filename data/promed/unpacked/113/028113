From mid-August to November, hundreds of millions of birds cross Israel as
they migrate from Europe to the warmer African climates. Some of them carry
West Nile virus. This virus is picked up by mosquitoes and spreads quickly
to humans, causing sickness ranging from a severe, flu-like symptoms to
deadly encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. This year, Israel is in
the grip of a particularly severe outbreak of the disease, triggering a
health crisis that competes for headline space and talk-show time with
political turmoil and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
As of yesterday, 120 cases had been identified, hundreds more are
suspected, and 8 people have died. No cases have so far been reported in
the West Bank or Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities, who are
nonetheless working to curb their mosquito population. [West Nile virus
was first identified in the blood of a patient in West Nile province,
Uganda, in 1937. Outbreaks have since occurred in 17 countries, including a
serious one in New York last year. The elderly and weak and those with
heart problems are at greatest risk of serious complications. Of those who
died, 7 were close to 80 years old. The latest victim, a 54-year-old woman,
suffered from a disease that suppressed her immune system, officials say.
Patients often become comatose before dying. For the young and healthy,
West Nile virus causes fever, head and muscle ache and a severe sore
throat. One 33-year-old woman, told Israel television she had been
hospitalized and is now in a wheelchair, but doctors give her good chances
of recovery.
The reason for this year's outbreak is still a mystery. One theory is that
the bird migratory period began earlier than usual. Israel does not have
more mosquitoes than normal, said Yossi Inbar, deputy director general of
the Environment Ministry. Mosquitoes multiply in standing water, and this
has been a dry year even by Israeli standards.

[ProMED-mail does not normally cover outbreaks in endemic regions, but this
outbreak of West Nile virus disease in Israel appears to be more extensive
than usual and it has unusual features. Previously on 8 Sep 2000 the
Jerusalem Post reported that a total of 47 Israelis, all over 60 and many
over 80, had been diagnosed with West Nile fever since the beginning of
August, and there had been 5 fatalities.
According to the Gideon Database, epidemics of West Nile fever were
reported during 1950 to 1954, and in 1957. 61 cases ere reported during
1975 to 1980. In 1998, serum antibody was demonstrated in horses and
migrating white storks (_Ciconia ciconia_). In 1999, 8000 geese were
destroyed when the virus was discovered in commercial flocks. The viral
strain found in these geese was virtually identical to that responsible for
an outbreak in New York City during 1999. The principal vectors are _Culex
univattatus_, _Cx. pipiens_, _C. perexiguus_ and _Anopheles coustani_. -
