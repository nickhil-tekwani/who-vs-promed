More than 130 diners have reported being struck down with foodborne illness after eating at a Hyson Green takeaway. A heavily-pregnant woman was among those affected, and 17 people have now been confirmed as having picked up a strain of _E. coli_, an investigation has revealed.

The Khyber Pass restaurant, in Gregory Boulevard, was ordered to close "until further notice" on 26 Jun 2014 after 13 people were hospitalized with food poisoning. A further 122 customers reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as feverish temperatures, severe vomiting and diarrhea.

The pregnant woman said: "Me and my daughter visited the Khyber Pass on the Monday before it closed. We had rung in our order of 2 kebabs with salad and collected it at about 6:45 pm. We got home for 7:10 pm and ate it straight away. Then, 2 or 3 hours after, I could feel a lot of motion in my stomach, there was some bubbling and then constant diarrhea. I finally managed to get to bed at 1:00 am, and then my daughter started being sick. She had to have 8 days off school."

Public Health England is working with Nottingham City Council to investigate the food poisoning cases. Investigations are ongoing to try to determine the source of the outbreak. The Khyber Pass was last inspected in April 2013, when it was given the top hygiene rating of 5 marks.

Nottingham City Council's food and health and safety manager, Paul Dales, said: "We are confident that the closure of the premises has contained the outbreak."

[The presence of significant fever and vomiting and a fairly short incubation period suggests that the pathogenic _E. coli_ in this outbreak is one of the other enteropaths of the organism. These include enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroaggregative and enteroinvasive forms of _E. coli. - Mod.LL
