The disease that has killed 16 people at a Toronto nursing home has been
identified. The current outbreak at the nursing home is likely Legionnaires'
Disease, officials said Thu [6 Oct 2005].
3 of the 16 people who died at the 7 Oaks Home for the Aged tested positive
for the pneumonia-type illness, Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's medical health
officer, told a press conference on Thursday.
Dr. McKeown said there have been no new deaths since Wednesday and it appears
that the cases have been waning.
The bacteria that cause the illness are found in water, the health officials
said. Legionellosis is not an airborne disease, they said.
Toronto Mayor David Miller emphasized that the city's general population has
never been at risk because of the outbreak.
"In identifying the source we are now able to move effectively to address it."
All 16 people who died of the respiratory illness that surfaced on 25 Sep
[2005] were elderly, and frail from other medical problems. The latest victims
were 3 men, who were 75, 84 and 89, and 3 women, who were 85, 92 and 96. In
all, 70 residents were affected, along with 13 staff members and 5 visitors.
The name "Legionnaires' disease" came from an illness that swept through a
convention in 1976 in Philadelphia. That convention was held by the American
Legion of Pennsylvania. Eventually, the bacterium responsible for the disease
was isolated and [called] "_Legionella pneumophila_."
Since the until-now mystery illness appeared, officials have taken pains to
emphasize that it is in no way comparable to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome [SARS] in 2003 that killed 44 people in the city.
On Thursday, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty issued a word of caution against
those tempted to compare the death of the residents with the outbreak of SARS.
Mr. McGuinty insisted that medical experts have concluded that the [bacterium]
was contained and that it posed no threat of spreading.
The Premier insisted that there was nothing unusual about the recent outbreak
which was not "dissimilar to what happens from time to time" in long term care
homes.
Toronto's economy was hit hard following the SARS outbreak, as tourists stayed
away in droves.

[In ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed respiratory deaths - Canada (ON)(02)
20051005.2908, Dr. Steve Berger mentioned: "Regarding the outbreak of
respiratory illness at a facility for senior citizens in Ontario,
legionellosis appears to have been discounted on the basis of negative urinary
antigen tests. Most such tests are designed to detect only _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Additional procedures, such as culture and
serology, should be performed in order to rule out other strains of
Legionella."�
>From the above newswire, it appears that Dr. Berger's comment was right on
target, and further testing of autopsy specimens confirmed Legionella as the
etiologic agent of this outbreak.
Background information on legionellosis in Canada is available on the Gideon
website:
