ENCEPHALITIS, ARBOVIRAL - AUSTRALIA

A report in the West Australian Newpaper today 31st May 1997 states that
the northwest of Western Australia has been put on the alert as the
virus Australian encephalitis spreads.
A man is seriously ill in a Perth hospital with the potentially fatal
disease which is sweeping through vast tracts of the northwest.
The patient, in his 20s, contracted the mosquito-borne illness in
Carnarvon and was flown to Perth for treatment.
A 30-year-old woman caught a milder version of the disease and a
Karratha man in his 40s is believed to have caught the same strain.
The disease causes permanent brain damage or death in the worst cases.
Only one person in 1000 develops symptoms when bitten.
Telltale signs are headaches and neck aches followed by convulsions,
delirium and coma.
Dr Tony Watson of WA`s communicable disease control programe said the
Kimberley, Pilbara and Gascoyne regions had virus-bearing mosquitoes.
Dr. Watson stated that there has not been such a big wet and such a large
mosquito population since 1993, when there were nine cases and four
deaths.
More than 80 per cent of WA`s early warning system -22 flocks of sentinel
chickens strategically located throughout the north - were riddled with
antibodies to the virus. This means that the disease is rife in the regions
where the chickens were kept.
[Australian encephalitis used to be known as Murray Valley encephalitis
(MVE), but apparently the Murray Valley tourist board objected. Another
form of mosquito-borne encephalitis due to Ross River virus also occurs in
Australia - Mod.JW]
