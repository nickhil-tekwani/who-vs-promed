The data about monkey inhalation challenge is not useful unless control data
is also given. Can anyone find out if unvaccinated controls were included in
these experiments and what the fatality rate was for them?
How many unvaccinated monkeys were similarly exposed to spores and how many
died?

Several studies performed at the United States Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) demonstrated the efficacy of
the anthrax vaccine against inhalation anthrax in the monkey model. Rhesus
monkeys were vaccinated with one or two doses of the anthrax vaccine and
then challenged with highly lethal levels of spores from the Ames strain of
anthrax, the most virulent strain that we have tested. In all these
studies, the anthrax vaccine protected 42 of 43 rhesus monkeys against
inhalational anthrax while none of a total of 14 controls used in these
experiments survived.
