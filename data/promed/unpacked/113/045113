Date: 17 Apr 2000
From: Pam Pontones <Ppontones@isdh.state.in.us>

The organism cultured from cases associated with the daycare centers in
Marion County, Indiana, is _Shigella sonnei_. This particular strain is
resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to sulfa. Most cases have received
antibiotic treatment.

[Many thanks for the prompt response to our request for additional data.
Disease caused by _S. sonnei_ has been described as less severe than that
caused by _S. dysenteriae_, but strains of _S. sonnei_ lysogenic for shiga
toxin-producing bacteriophage have been described. - Mod. ES
