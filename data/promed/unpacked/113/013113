The southwest Pacific islands of New Caledonia are reporting an outbreak of the mosquito borne viral disease Zika fever, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a travel notice for the archipelago on 7 Feb 2014.

Health officials in New Caledonia report that as of Monday [3 Feb 2014], 49 cases have been laboratory confirmed. Of the 49 cases, 30 occurred in people with a travel history to French Polynesia, where an outbreak of Zika fever is ongoing.

Some of the confirmed cases are considered autochthonous, i.e. indigenous or locally transmitted in the population.

There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika fever. Because of this, CDC recommends that travelers to New Caledonia protect themselves from mosquito bites. This includes covering exposed skin, using insect repellent that contains DEET, staying and sleeping in screened or air-conditioned rooms, and using a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors.

Zika infection is a mild febrile viral illness transmitted by mosquitoes. A few outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa and in some areas in Southeast Asia, according to the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Zika virus is transmitted to humans mainly by certain species of _Aedes_ mosquitoes and is closely related to the dengue viruses.

[The outbreak of Zika virus infections has been the source of cases with illnesses in 3 individuals on New Caledonia reported on 2 Dec 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131203.2089681) and with more imported cases since then. On 21 Jan 2014, the occurrence of the 1st indigenous infection with the Zika virus was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute. This is the 1st time a person has been infected with Zika virus on New Caledonian territory. The other 26 cases reported at that time had been imported from French Polynesia, where more than 35 000 cases have been detected. Now, the count of imported cases has increased to 30, with the remaining 19 cases locally acquired. That number is expected to climb in the coming days.
