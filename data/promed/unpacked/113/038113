As the health ministry waits for vaccines to arrive, yellow fever,
which has broken out in northern Uganda, continued to spread,
affecting 12 more people but with no new deaths recorded. The number
of those infected now rises to 190, while the deaths stay at 48, 2
months after the disease broke out.

The Ministry of Health in a statement sent to Daily Monitor yesterday
[30 Dec 2010] said the epidemic has remained confined to the 10
northern districts of Abim, Agago, Lawo, Pader, Kitgum, Gulu, Arua,
Kabong, Kotido and Lira.

Junior health minister James Kakooza said the vaccine is scheduled to
arrive in the country tomorrow [1 Jan 2011]; thereafter, a vaccination
exercise will commence. "We cannot quantify how much vaccine will be
arriving, but what I can say is there will be enough to cover the 10
affected districts," Mr Kakooza said. He also ruled out any
possibilities of the disease spreading, as the sick have been confined.

Signs of yellow fever are muscle pain and backache, headache, fever,
shivering, loss of appetite and vomiting in the earlier stages. In the
later stages, patients can develop yellow eyes, abdominal pain,
bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes and stomach. The disease, only
confirmed 2 weeks ago, if not contained, can kill in 14 days.

The Ministry of health has advised people to destroy mosquito breeding
places like stagnant water around homes and to sleep under
insecticide-treated mosquito nets.

[Insecticide-treated bednets won't give much protection against the YF
vector _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which bites during the day. Another
version of this news report stated that one other person succumbed to
YF on Thursday evening [30 Dec 2010], putting the total number of
those dead at 49, and that Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Health, Dr Asuman Lukwago, said on 31 Dec 2010 that there are only
1.5m available doses of vaccine that have to be shared between Uganda
and Cameroon, which has also had an outbreak of the disease. However,
Dr Lukwago said everything will be in place, including enough drugs
[sic] to vaccinate the 2.5 million people, by the end of next week [8
Jan 2011]. The math defeats me, but it does point out the prrecarious
situation of world stocks of YF vaccine.

ProMED reported a single case in Cameroon in January 2010, with a plan
for vaccination in May 2010, since when there has been no further news
-- see ProMED archive Yellow fever - Africa (04): Cameroon (SO)
20100527.1763. If YF cases are still occurring there, ProMED would
like to hear about them. - Mod.JW]
