Wyoming residents should take precautions against ticks to avoid serious
diseases, state health officials say.
The Wyoming Department of Health reports 4 recent cases of Rocky Mountain
spotted fever in north eastern Wyoming. "Three of them, at least, were from
the Campbell-Converse County areas," said Dr Tracy Murphy, state
epidemiologist.
The department also has received several recent, unconfirmed reports of
tularemia, a bacterial infection, among people who have handled sheep in
Johnson, Natrona, and Niobrara counties.
Ticks and other insects that can carry the diseases are present in every
part of Wyoming, Murphy said. In addition to ticks, tularemia is spread by
deer flies, horse flies, and other biting flies, he said.
Dr Dan O'Leary, acting state public health veterinarian, recommended that
people check carefully for ticks after they've been outside, checking
places such as the back of the neck and the backs of legs, [as well as the
clothing, where ticks might hide and bite people.] O'Leary encouraged
people to use insect repellant containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or
picaridin when traveling in tick country.

[Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tickborne disease caused by
_Rickettsia ricketsii_. It is most common in the south eastern US but is
also seen in Oklahoma and North Texas, as well as in New England and Long
Island, and in other pockets throughout the Americas. The common tick
vectors are the dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_) and _D. andersonii_.
The disease can be fatal, particularly if the characteristic rash is absent
('spotless fever') leading to a delayed diagnosis. Prevention, by use of
insect repellents and prompt removal of ticks, is important in endemic areas.
Regarding a 2002 report of RMSF in Wyoming (ProMED-mail posting
20020604.4403), Mod.LL noted: "Wyoming has not had much RMSF reported in
recent years and the diagnosis of 2 cases so early in the 'tick season'
requires attention. However, in Harrell's classic paper from 1949
(reference below), in the period between 1939 and 1947, Wyoming reported
over 300 cases." Harrell GT: Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Medicine 1949;
28: 333-70. - Mod.LM
Wyoming is located in the western US. Campbell and Converse counties can be
found on the map of the state at
