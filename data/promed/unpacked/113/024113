Olympics brings worries of measles outbreak
--------------------------------------
It's a disease that was technically eradicated in this country [USA] twelve years ago, but unvaccinated international travelers and those who are not protected here, run the risk of measles especially after the Olympics. While the Olympics bring the world together, the competition can also provide a breeding ground for infectious disease like measles. The issue, travelers who are not adequately protected bringing back the illness.

The CDC reported 17 measles outbreaks in 2011, four times the average. There were 222 cases, most linked to international travel, none were in Ohio.

The London Olympics are a huge concern. The UK and other parts of the world are dealing with widespread cases. If you enter a room with an infected person and you're not vaccinated, you have a 90-95 percent chance of getting measles. Now, multiply that by a worldwide event bringing in hundreds of thousands. Measles spreads like the common cold. A cough could infect surfaces and even the air. When symptoms appear, they usually come with a rash, fever, cough and or conjunctivitis. Measles can cause pneumonia and in the worst cases brain swelling and death...

The CDC recommends children get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. The first at 12-15 months, the next at 4 to 6 years. If you're not absolutely sure you've had those doses, the CDC says get another one before you travel.

[The risk is real and the warning prudent. Nonetheless, so far, no measles cases have been traced to those attending the World Football Championships in South Africa in 2011 or the European Football Championship in Poland/Ukraine in 2012, events which attracted spectators from all over the world and were preceded by similar travel alerts. It must be presumed that these alerts have achieved their propose and the travelling public bass responded positively - Mod.CP]

Illinois county investigating first probable case of measles in 18 years
----------------------------------------------------------
Health officials from the northern Illinois county of Winnebago are investigating the first likely case of measles in nearly two decades. According to a Winnebago County Health Department (WCHD) news release Tuesday, a four-year-old child presented with a rash that began near the ears with an onset of 6/30/2012. The child also presented with conjunctivitis, fever, and Koplik spots, all symptoms of the respiratory illness. Health officials say, if this case is confirmed, it will be the first confirmed case of measles in the county since 1994.

WCHD strongly urges all area health-care professionals to maintain a high index of suspicion for the appearance of additional measles cases in the coming weeks and report all suspect cases to WCHD.

Health authorities also advise to ensure you are up-to-date with vaccinations if traveling abroad. Many countries still have high rates of the disease and the concern of importing measles to the US is high.In fact, Dr. Anne Schuchat, MD, Director, Office of Infectious Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease said in April, 200 of the 222 measles cases reported in 2011 were associated with importations from other countries.

Measles or rubeola, is an acute highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later a red blotchy rash appears first on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from four days prior to the rash appearance to four days after rash appearance. The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles which are reported in up to 20% of people infected include; seizures, pneumonia, deafness and encephalitis. Prevention of measles is through vaccination.

Winnebago County Health Dept. reports probable case of measles
-------------------------------------------------------
According to the Winnebago County Health Department (WCHD), an area four-year-old may have measles. The WCHD is investigating the case, which began on 30 jun 2012 with a rash that began near the child's ears. The child also had conjunctivitis, fever, and Koplik spots that were observed by a physician.

Measles is highly contagious and can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, mainly when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. There is an average of 14 days between exposure to the onset of rash. Main characterizations of measles includes a fever and cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, red runny and sensitive eyes, and a cough. Those symptoms are then followed by a red, blotchy rash that usually begins on the face or neck and then spreads to the rest of the body.

Measles can easily be prevented through a vaccination. People of all ages are recommended to keep up to date with their vaccinations, and all children should receive two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between 12 and 15 months of age and the second should be given between the ages of four and six. Vaccinations are available to Winnebago County residents without a medical provider at the WCHD. Appointments can be made by calling 815-720-4370.

Winnebago County has not seen a confirmed case of measles since before 1994, but the WCHD is encouraging local doctors to keep an eye out for patients exhibiting the above symptoms and to report any suspicious cases to the department. More information on measles can be found at the WCDH's website or by calling the department at 815-720-4000 during normal business hours.
