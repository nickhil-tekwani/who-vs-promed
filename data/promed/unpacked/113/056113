Scientists have devised a new system of planting different varieties of
rice plants which reduces yield losses associated with a lethal fungal
disease - rice blast.
The experiments were conducted by Oregon State University researchers
jointly with Chinese researchers in China's southern Yunnan province,
according to NATURE, a weekly science journal. Field tests - one of the
largest experiments ever conducted, - involved interspersing one rice
cultivar with other rice cultivars to slow down the movement of the rice
blast fungus.
The results showed that yield losses to blast in glutinous rice varieties
dropped by an average of 94 per cent and losses in non-glutinous varieties
decreased by 25 per cent the first year of the experiment and by 55 per
cent in the second year. The Asian Development Bank provided 1.3 million
dollars over 3 years for the project, which was proposed and organised by
the International Rice Research Institute in Manila, Philippines. During
the experiments, growers who had been using fungicides three to 8 times a
year to fight the disease reduced their use of chemicals to a single
treatment the first year, and used no chemicals at all in the second year.
Overall, gross income per hectare of rice increased by an average of 15 per
cent said Chris Mundt, professor of botany and plant pathology at Oregon
State University and co-author of the study, said. "This is not a new
concept," he said, "but it is a sound application of ecological principles
to crop agriculture."

[Using a mixture of cultivars with different degrees of susceptibility is
one means of impeding rapid spread of a pathogen under field conditions.
The rice blast fungus, _Magnaporthe grisea_, spreads via spores, and a
mixture of susceptible and more resistant genotypes would tend to reduce
inoculum loads in the field. Chris Mundt is absolutely correct when he
states that this old concept, applied to crop agriculture, may provide a
useful degree of disease control. The results of using this method of
biological control for rice blast in this instance is certainly very
impressive. - Mod.DH
