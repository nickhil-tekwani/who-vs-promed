H7N9 sickens another in China
-----------------------------
Health officials in China's Jiangxi province today [31 Dec 2015] announced an H7N9 avian influenza infection in a 46-year-old man from the city of Ganzhou, according to a provincial health department statement translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board.

The case is the 8th in China's 4th wave of illnesses and Jiangxi's 1st case since May [2015].

So far the pace of H7N9 illness at this point in the year appears to be running well below that for the same time last year during the early part of the 3rd wave. However, health officials have said they expect more H7N9 cases in the months ahead, and China has reported an uptick in H7N9 infections linked to increased poultry sales and travel in advance of early February Lunar New Year [2016] celebrations.

The latest case raises the global H7N9 total to 693, according to a running case list kept by FluTrackers [https://flutrackers.com; note this number differs from the numbers provided below (665 & 684), from avian flu diary (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/). This is likely a consequence of the inconsistency in reporting. - Mod.LK].

China reports human H7N9 avian influenza infection in Shanghai man
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning, a 59-year-old man is the latest human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in the Mainland, bringing the total to 665 cases since 2013.

The patient was confirmed positive on 1 Jan 2016 and is currently under treatment.

This follows a H7N9 avian influenza case that was reported by the Jiangxi Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission on 31 Dec 2015 (see [1]). According to an Avian Flu Diary report, this is the 1st report of H7N9 out of Jiangxi Province this fall, and only the 11th overall case reported from that province (ranked no. 8 in number of cases in Mainland China).

According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection).

The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings.

Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[As with many infectious diseases, the reported numbers represent the tip of the iceberg, as only those seriously ill individuals seek medical attention. It is not known how many asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have occurred.

It appears this virus does not transmit efficiently between individuals at this stage, but surveillance is important to identify any changes in transmissibility; and education of the population on how the virus is contracted is equally important.

An informative table is presented with H7N9 cases since 2013 on Avian Flu Diary: http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/12/jiangxi-province-announces-1-h7n9-case.html
