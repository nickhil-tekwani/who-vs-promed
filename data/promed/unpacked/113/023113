For the 2nd time this season, a bat found at the Holter Lake Campground has tested positive for rabies, the Lewis & Clark City-County Health Department reported Thursday [11 Jul 2013]. Health officials urge anyone who had direct contact with a bat at the campground since early June [2013] to call the health department immediately to determine if rabies treatment is needed.

"Our advice to people is [to] never touch a bat," said Mike Henderson, administrator of the Disease Control Division of the health department. "There's always a small percentage of bats that have rabies, so the best way to protect your health is to avoid contact with all of them."

Rabies is transmitted through infected saliva via a bite, scratch or other break in the skin. Treatment involves a series of vaccinations that should begin as soon as possible after exposure. People who had no direct contact with a bat are not at risk, but parents should check with their children to find out if they touched or played with a bat while at the campground.

Campers should also make sure their pets have current rabies vaccinations.

A 2nd domestic cat has tested positive for rabies in Atlantic County as reported today [11 Jul 2013] by the Atlantic County Division of Public Health.

The 10-year-old cat was surrendered by its owners on Saturday [6 Jul 2013] after it had uncharacteristically bitten and scratched 2 of the residents of the home located on Atlantic Avenue in Egg Harbor Township.

The cat, which had never been vaccinated for rabies, was very aggressive and appeared sick with a relatively fresh wound of unknown origin on its face. The cat was euthanized and sent for rabies testing at the state lab where it was confirmed positive on Wednesday [10 Jul 2013].

The 2 individuals who were bitten and scratched are seeking post-rabies treatment. A dog who shares the home is current with its rabies vaccination, according to an investigation by the Division of Public Health.

Rabies is a viral disease that can be fatal if left untreated. It is most common in raccoons and bats, but has also been found in foxes, skunks, cats, groundhogs and other wildlife in New Jersey. Atlantic County reported its 1st case of rabies in 2013 in a Buena Vista [Atlantic County] raccoon in March, and in June a Hamilton Township [Mercer County] cat tested positive. Last year 3 cases of rabies were confirmed, and in 2011 there were 12 cases.

Health officials remind residents about the importance of vaccinating their pets to protect them from rabies. The Atlantic County Animal Shelter offers a free rabies vaccination clinic to residents each month.

Wayne County continues to be on alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after a Wayne County dog tested positive for rabies last month [June 2013].

According to Wayne County Health Center administrator Rae Jean Crutchfield, the animal was taken to a veterinarian and later died. Suspicious animals are to be tested, so the dog's head was removed and sent to a state lab. The Health Center was notified of the positive test 25 Jun 2013.

"We're seeing a lot more domestic animals this year than what we have in the last few years," Crutchfield explained. "The rabies cases are already a lot higher this year." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 23 cases so far this year in Missouri, including 15 skunks, 3 bats, 3 dogs, 1 cat and 1 horse. Of these, 19 are attributed to the Southeast Missouri area, including Bollinger, Cape Girardeau and Oregon counties.

This year's [2013] numbers indicate "a sustained, higher-than-normal level of rabies activity in animals that naturally harbor and transmit this virus, which in this part of Missouri is primarily skunks," according to a Wayne County Health Center news release.

Veterinarian Arnold Powell, owner of Powell Veterinary Clinic in Puxico, Mo., said vaccination is the only prevention among domesticated animals. Without the vaccine, a pet that is exposed to another animal that tested positive must be euthanized or quarantined by a veterinarian or city or county animal impoundment facility, at the owner's expense, for 6 months, according to the Wayne County Health Center. A vaccinated animal, however, only requires a booster shot and a 45-day quarantine at home.

The vaccine must be administered by a vet, Powell said. "A veterinarian would be unwise to send a vaccination out the door," he said. "A veterinarian will only write a certificate if he or she has given the vaccine. It makes it a lot easier for a pet owner to have the vaccine certificate in hand. In some places, it's required, but everybody, even in a rural situation, would be better off to have it."

Although some pet owners worry about the cost of the vaccination, Powell said an extended vet stay is even more costly. If an animal has contracted the illness, there is no cure, and after its death, its head must be removed for testing on the brain stem.

With that in mind, Powell also has advice for anyone coming into contact with a suspicious wild animal. "If a skunk comes in contact and we need to examine it, don't shoot it in the head," he said. If the brain is damaged, testing may not be possible.

A suspicious animal should not be handled, even after its death. Call your veterinarian for more information on how to handle the situation.

Exposure to an infected pet also can mean costly treatments for the treating the human pet owner. In 2012, a Reynolds County family faced more than USD 10 000 in treatment after handling unvaccinated puppies who were attacked by a rabid skunk.

[Rabies] kills 55 000 people per year worldwide. While spread through bites, exposure also can occur through contamination of broken skin or mucus membranes with saliva of an infected animal.

Forsyth County Animal Control officers are looking for the kittens of a mother cat that tested positive for rabies. The state lab tested the white and black cat after it bit a woman who was feeding it last week [week of 1 Jul 2013] in the 100 block of East Sprague Street. [Hopefully the woman is receiving post exposure prophylaxis, as rabies is almost always fatal without it. - Mod.TG]

"I knew it wasn't normal," said a man who spotted a kitten Tuesday [9 Jul 2013] acting strangely. "It was hesitant and everything, but it took off."

Animal control officers sent out flyers warning neighbors on Monday [8 Jul 2013] and have set traps to catch 2 kittens of the mother. One was located and tested negative for rabies.

"It's pretty stressful for people," said Tim Jennings with Forsyth County Animal Control. "It could have all been avoided with a simple vaccination [of the mother cat] and we hope the rest of community gets the message too. If they have an outdoor animal it's incredibly important to have those animals vaccinated."

Under North Carolina state law, if your pet is not up-to-date on its vaccines and comes in contact with a suspected rabid animal, it will have to be euthanized to be tested or quarantined for 6 months at your expense.

Animal control is reminding residents to avoid contact with unfamiliar domestic and wild animals and teach children to do the same even if the animal looks and acts friendly.

A rabid fox was shot dead after it bit a 70-year-old woman and a sheriff's deputy, according to the Isle of Wight County Sheriff's Office.

The woman called the Sheriff's Office last week [week of 1 Jul 2013] after the fox bit a cat. When 2 deputies arrived at the home in the Waterwords Road area, they could not find the animal. As they departed the scene, they heard screams. The woman had gone to her car to move it. As she exited the vehicle, the fox jumped into her lap and bit her, the release said.

As the deputies tried to get the fox off the woman, one deputy was bitten. The fox then ran away and was shot.

Lab results received Monday [8 Jul 2013] showed the fox tested positive for rabies, according to the county health department.

The woman has received a post exposure vaccine to prevent rabies, the release said. The cat will be euthanized. [Hopefully the deputy is also receiving post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]

Residents are advised to contact the health department if they believe they or their pets have been bitten by a rabid animal.

The Worcester County Health Department is warning people living in and visiting Ocean City to immediately report any aggressive wildlife to police or animal control officers. This includes raccoons, foxes, skunks, and feral cats.

There have been 18 confirmed cases of rabies, and 15 other suspected cases, according to the Worcester County Health Department.

[A woman] said her dog didn't survive after being mauled by a rabid animal.

"That dog was my life," she said. "I had him for 13 years. He was my best friend and my very loyal companion. It's really heart-breaking, devastating."

The health department has received several reports of aggressive raccoons approaching or attacking people and pets in north Ocean City, particularly in the area of 85th to 130th streets.

Health officials confirmed a rabid raccoon attacked one person on 18 Jun 2013 and behaved aggressively toward 2 others.

Health officials say humans exposed have received treatment for rabies and pets have either been quarantined or euthanized.

"Worcester County is on track to exceed the previous 2 years in rabies confirmed cases and going back to a higher level [that] we saw in 2010," said Dr. Andrea Mathis of Worcester County Health Department.

Dr. Mathias said rabies should be taken very seriously. "Rabies, once confirmed in a human, is uniformly fatal, 100 percent fatal," said Dr. Mathias.

If a pet has contact with a wild animal, do not touch the pet with bare hands. If you find wounds from a possible attack, treat it as if your animal could have rabies. Report the incident to the health department and your veterinarian.
