Increased cases of invasive Group A streptococcal infections in Sweden
----------------------------
During the period January-April 2001 a total of 133 isolates from patients
with invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection have been reported to
Smittskyddsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control,
SMI). The increase in the total number of reported cases of invasive GAS is
restricted to the centre and south west of the country. This represents an
incidence of 1.5 per 100 000 population, 15% higher than in January-April
1999 (115 cases, 1.3/100 000) and 58% higher than in the same period for
2000 (84 cases, 0.9/100 000). In March 2001, 49 cases were reported, and
between 27 and 29 cases were reported during each of the other 3 months.
Of the 133 isolates reported, 64 (48%) were serotyped, and 30 were found to
be T1, compared with 18 in 1999 and 13 in 2000. Other strains isolated more
often during this year's January-April period included T3.B3264 (10
isolates compared with 6 in both 1999 and 2000) and T13.28 (4 isolates
compared with none in 1999 and one in 2000).
The proportion of serotyped specimens identified as T1 rose from 34% in
1999 to 47% in 2001. The increase in reported T1 isolates is not due to an
increased proportion of specimens being serotyped during this period.
Similar proportions were serotyped in the same periods of 2001 (64/133,
48%), 1999 (52/115, 45%), and 2000 (36/84, 43%).
Of the 133 patients with invasive GAS, 61 (46%) were female and 72 (54%)
male. The median age of cases in 2001 is 55, compared with 64 and 71 during
the equivalent periods of 1999 and 2000, respectively. The fall in age is
due largely to data from February 2001, when 5 cases of infection in
children aged 2 to 7 years were reported. In 2001, 15 cases aged 0 to 15
years have been reported, compared with 7 for the equivalent periods of
both 1999 and 2000; 22 infections among women of childbearing age (20 to 49
years) have been reported during this period, compared with 19 and 8 for
the equivalent periods of 1999 and 2000, respectively.
The data must be interpreted with caution, as invasive GAS infection is not
a notifiable disease in Sweden. Infections are reported voluntarily by
microbiological laboratories, which notify all GAS isolates recovered from
blood, spinal fluid, or other normally sterile sites. Preliminary
consultations do not suggest that any changes in laboratory methods or in
the reporting system have occurred to explain the observed changes.
The reported GAS isolates originate from cases with different clinical
presentations. There is concern that the epidemiology of GAS infections is
changing, with more cases of necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic
shock syndrome (STSS), with a high case fatality. Previous studies have
shown an association between serotype T1 and STSS in Sweden (1). A
descriptive study of the cases of invasive GAS during 2001 is under way,
with emphasis on the occurrence in children and women who have just given
birth. We would like to learn whether this increase is also affecting other
European countries. This might justify the initiation of a collaborative
epidemiological study.

[The caution about interpreting the data when diseases are not reportable
is an important one. Perceived increases in invasive group A streptococcal
disease could be related to increased awareness and/or increased news
reporting of horrific cases. Systematic studies would be useful, and we
would appreciate any such information. - Mod.ES
