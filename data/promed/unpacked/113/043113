Authorities say 2 cows on a Becker County farm have died of anthrax.
The Minnesota Board of Animal health says they're the state's 1st
anthrax cases of the year [2008].

The herd will remain quarantined for 30 days from the day of its last
anthrax death. The herd was not vaccinated for the disease this year
[2008].

Officials say it's unusual to see anthrax so early in the year, but
the cows that died were on pasture in an area where anthrax had been
detected in the past.

[I spoke with Dr Linda Glaiser -- the MN veterinary officer
responsible for anthrax -- yesterday (21 Apr 2008) about this early
outbreak in Becker County. Apparently the snow has only recently
thawed, there is some flooding, and the Spring green-up has yet to be
obvious in this area. Ground water will force spores up to the soil
surface and into the root system of the forage, where they would be
consumed by grazing cows. But this is very early for grazing cases,
though not unknown. I would be more suspicious of a contaminated hay
source at such a time. - Mod MHJ
