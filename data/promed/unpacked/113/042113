You can hear the mother's proud, playful voice celebrating her daughter's accomplishment, on cell phone video, as the infant sat up on the couch at home just 2 weeks ago. "That's such a big girl sitting up!" the mother exclaimed.

But now her 4-month-old bundle of joy is barely moving. She's at Rady Children's hospital suffering from infant botulism -- a rare illness that can cause paralysis.

"I was worried at first it was affecting her brain because it's paralyzing her," the mother said. "It doesn't affect her brain, just her muscles." The mother said at her daughter's worst point, she could only open her eyes. "It was really scary, definitely scary," she explained.

[Botulism is so rare, the CDC reports only approximately 145 cases yearly, 65 percent of them infant botulism.]

In San Diego, the county's latest stats show 3 cases from 2009-2013. While people are familiar with honey containing the bacterial spores for infant botulism, [this baby's mother] was surprised to find her daughter may have contracted the intoxication when her father unknowingly brought dirt home from his construction job.

The woman said her daughter is slowly starting to regain the movement she lost a week ago and getting her personality back. "We're very excited to get our happy, silly, baby back," she told NBC7.

[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL] Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
