High Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever activity reported nationwide in Afghanistan through August [2022], especially in Herat. Avoid tick bites.

Afghan health officials report elevated Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever(CCHF) activity, with 131 additional cases reported from [10 Jul to 6 Aug 2022], bringing the total number of cases since the beginning of the year [2022] to 250. This caseload is compared to roughly 51 cases reported over a similar period in 2021. Disease activity is reported from 23 provinces, with Herat reporting the highest number of cases, followed by Kabul, Balkh, and Takhar. As of [6 Aug 2022], 14 deaths are associated with the outbreak. This report is the most complete information available as of [17 Aug 2022].

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is considered a nationwide threat in Afghanistan, and disease activity is typically highest between April and September.

CCHF is caused by a virus that commonly infects wild and domestic animals (cattle, sheep, and goats), but may also infect humans. The disease is transmitted through the bite of a tick, or through contaminated tissue or blood from infected humans or animals. Once a human is infected, the disease can spread among people through close personal contact. CCHF can also infect healthcare workers who fail to diagnose the disease and institute proper precautions. CCHF fatality rates for patients requiring hospitalization can range from 9-50%. Early treatment with the antiviral agent ribavirin can reduce fatality rates.

After being in areas where ticks may be present, bathe or shower as soon as possible and conduct a full-body tick check using a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of the body. As weather permits, wear clothing that covers arms and legs. Wear socks and avoid wearing sandals. Use an insect repellent containing DEET (around 35%) on clothing and exposed skin when outdoors. These precautions are especially important during the daytime. Contact a healthcare provider if a fever develops during or after being in Iraq, especially if you remember being bitten by a tick.

[CCHF exemplifies a classic zoonotic disease that requires a One Health approach at every step, outbreak investigation, case detection, and joint public health response by the human and animal health sectors. It appears that the chain of disease transmission continues, possibly due to tick infestation of a large number of animals/cattle, poor socioeconomic conditions of the affected region, and low level of public awareness about preventive measures. - Mod.UBA]
