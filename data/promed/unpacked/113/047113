From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>
The following background information on salmonella infections in the U.K.
(including enteric fever salmonellae) was abstracted from the GIDEON software
program:
Over 76% of salmonellosis cases in the U.K. are acquired from meat or
poultry. Most outbreaks are ascribed to _Salmonella enteritidis_. 90% of
typhoid fever cases are imported.
England and Wales registered 22,474 isolates in 1991. Approximately 30,000
isolates are registered yearly during 1989 to 1994. 1,489 outbreaks and
30,427 isolates were reported in 1994 (13,782 of these were characterized as
_S. enteritidis_ PT4). 29,717 cases were reported in 1995 - including 6,700
reports of _S. typhimurium_ (this is the second most common _Salmonella_
species from humans in England and Wales). Regarding enteric fever
salmonellae, England and Wales registered 132 isolates of _Salmonella typhi_
and 91 _S. paratyphi_ A and B in 1991. 183 cases of typhoid were reported in
1993; 238 in 1994; 255 in 1995; 173 in 1996 (152 of these imported). 135
cases of paratyphoid were reported in 1994; 126 in 1995; 100 in 1996.
Northern Ireland registered 160 isolates in 1991; and one case of typhoid
during 1979 to 1993 (in 1993).
Scotland registered 133 salmonellosis outbreaks (involving 939 patients) in
1985; 180 outbreaks (942 patients) in 1987; 156 outbreaks (1,081 patients) in
1988; 151 outbreaks (712 patients) in 1989; 122 outbreaks (910 patients) in
1990; 114 outbreaks (459 patients) in 1991. Scotland registered 267 cases of
typhoid (and 32 carriers) 1975 to 1990; 7 in 1992; 3 in 1993; 8 in 1994.
Wales reported one case of typhoid and 1 of paratyphoid in 1990; 2 typhoid
and 0 paratyphoid in 1991; 3 typhoid and 1 paratyphoid in 1992; 1 typhoid and
1 paratyphoid in 1993; 4 typhoid and 0 paratyphoid in 1994.
