The U.S. Agriculture Department Wednesday urged consumers to check their
refrigerators for Canadian salami that has been recalled out of fear the
meat may be contaminated with deadly _E.coli_ bacteria.
Fleetwood Sausage Company of Surrey, British Columbia, said it was
recalling all Schneiders salami products that are in the U.S. marketplace
for possible contamination.
This action is being taken in light of illnesses associated with products
produced by Fleetwood in British Columbia earlier this month.
The company said on Nov. 15 that 98 percent of the product was distributed
in Western Canada. However, the USDA said Wednesday that it has been
determined that approximately 13 000 pounds of the potentially-contaminated
meat were sold in Seattle, Northern California, Alabama and Florida.
_E.coli_ bacteria sickens an estimated 20,000 Americans each year and kills
another 250. The bacteria causes bloody diarrhea and dehydration. Children,
elderly people and people with weakened immune systems are especially at risk.
Consumers are advised not to consume the Schneiders salami and return it to
the point of purchase for a refund.
Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a physician immediately.
