The number of cyclospora infections reported in Wisconsin, believed to be tied to vegetable trays sold at Kwik Trip stores, has risen more than 10-fold in less than 2 weeks.

As of [Wed 20 Jun 2018], there were 123 laboratory-confirmed cases in the state, with at least 84 of the individuals sickened telling state health officials they had consumed a Del Monte Fresh Produce vegetable tray sold at a Kwik Trip.

Dozens of similar cases have been reported in Minnesota.

Kwik Trip has removed the 6-ounce and 12-ounce vegetable trays from its stores, according to health officials, but the trays may also have been sold at other businesses not yet named by health agencies.

Del Monte Fresh Produce has not answered Milwaukee Journal Sentinel questions about the outbreak believed to be linked to its products in Wisconsin and Minnesota.

But in a product recall notice, the Coral Gables, Florida, based company said it had voluntarily recalled a limited quantity of vegetable trays containing fresh broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrots and dill dip sold to retailers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.

Del Monte Fresh Produce said the vegetable trays, in sizes from 6 to 28 ounces, were sent to Kwik Trip, Kwik Star, Sentry, Peapod, Demond's, and other retailers.

The vegetable trays, in clear plastic containers, had a "Best if Enjoyed By"
date of [17 Jun 2018] or earlier, according to the company.

Minneapolis attorney Ryan Osterholm says he now has more than 75 clients from the outbreak, including many from the Milwaukee area. [Wed 20 Jun 2018], he filed a lawsuit in Brown county alleging that one of his clients, a business owner, was severely sickened from one of the vegetable trays.

_Cyclospora_ is a parasite commonly found in developing countries. During the summer, outbreaks and illnesses occur from contaminated fresh produce entering the US from endemic countries.

Washing of imported produce is unlikely to kill the parasite, which can be seen only with a microscope.

Nationwide, from May to August 2017, there were 206 cases of cyclospora infections reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up 134 percent from 88 cases reported in the same period in 2016.

Previous US outbreaks have been linked to imported fresh produce such as basil, cilantro, lettuce, raspberries and snow peas. Most cases in the US have been reported in the spring and summer.

[It is not surprising that the numbers continue to increase, partly because of the incubation period after eating the contaminated products and partly due to the media interests, which encourage people with symptoms to be investigated. No new sources are mentioned and we assume that the product responsible for the outbreak has been identified and withdrawn and the outbreak should fade over the coming days. - Mod.EP
