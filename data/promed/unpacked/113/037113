INFECTION CONTROL - MARYLAND, USA
=================================
Date: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 14:34:51 -0400
From: ctaylor@friend.ly.net (Carole Taylor)

I am the Infection Control Practitioner for a 62 bed inpatient psychiatric
facility, the Upper Shore Community Mental Health Center in Chestertown,
Maryland.
I have been watching the items for some time now and I agree with the
postings that suggest some form of Infection Control list.
We have not had a problem with MRSA, etc. but that doesn't mean we won't
come up with something, and knowing what is out there as it is happening
would be wonderful.
Would be interested in what is going on in other psychiatric hospitals also.
