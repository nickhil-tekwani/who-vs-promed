Two cases of leishmaniasis in dogs have just been detected in Gualeguaychu [Entre Rios province].

Leishmaniasis is caused by a parasite transmitted by the bite of infected sandflies (insects similar to mosquitoes). These vectors acquire the parasite after feeding on blood from an infected [animal].

The 2 dogs that tested positive for leishmaniasis in Gualeguaychu lived in the Corsodromo area. The 1st dog was a stray that was picked up from national highway 14 and taken to a home. When leishmaniasis is detected in a dog, it is mandatory to report it to national health authorities and all dogs living in a radius of 100 meters [330 ft] are tested. That is how the 2nd dog was detected -- a Bichon Frise puppy that had never left Gualeguaychu. [Camilo Hernandez and Aldo Tellechea, the veterinarians who sacrificed the dog, said therefore the puppy couldn't have brought the disease from elsewhere.]

The owners decided to sacrifice the puppy on [Sat 3 Oct 2015], as indicated (they must be slaughtered and incinerated). As for the other dog, his whereabouts are unknown, since the person who picked him up refused to kill him and could even have returned him to where he was found. "The latter would be very serious, since the dog was very ill and could also infect others if bitten by a sandfly," Hernandez told Clarin.

In Latin America, the average fatality rate of [human] visceral leishmaniasis (the form detected in Gualeguaychu) is 8 percent with treatment, and up to 90 percent without treatment, especially in children. It is very serious in immunocompromised persons (that is, those with cancer, diabetes, HIV, etc.).

Every dog with leishmaniasis should be euthanized and incinerated, say the 2 veterinarians. There are no treatments for animals, only palliatives that slow the inevitable and painful death, and these dogs only expose the human population to the infection.

Silvina Saavedra, director of Epidemiology in the province of Entre Rios, told Clarin, "We are investigating the source of the infection. So far we have not found sandflies in Gualeguaychu. Across the province, we have only found them in Chajari and Concordia, already transmission areas." The detection is performed using light traps on nights when the temperature is above 20 deg C [68 deg F], therefore, they will have to wait until the summer to confirm that the vector is not present in the town.

"This could be a case of vertical transmission, from mother to offspring," Saavedra added. "It is transmitted through the placenta. We are very attentive to cases of purebred dogs infected by the mother that, when sold, may carry the disease to many destinations." She recommended that anyone who purchases a purebred dog [or any dog] have it tested to ensure that it is not carrying leishmaniasis.

"This is not the case here," said veterinarian Hernandez. The mother of this puppy was tested, and she is healthy, as certified by Dr Fatala Chaben of the National Institute of Parasitology.

The 1st indigenous case of leishmaniasis in the country was detected in Misiones in 2006. In 2014, the National Leishmaniasis Control Programme recommended monitoring all towns located on the coast of the Uruguay River, and the list included Gualeguaychu.

"We are monitoring several departments," said Saavedra; "for possible cases, I take the blood samples and do the analyses to be sure of the results. So far, we have confirmed that in this province, the sandfly is present in Chajari and Concordia. It has also been present in Salto, Uruguay, since 2010."

Prevention: clean pastures, always use insect repellent, put collars with repellent on dogs. The World Health Organization recommends early diagnosis, effective case management to reduce the prevalence and prevent disability and death, and social mobilization (inform through effective communication strategies).

[Leishmaniasis (visceral) in Argentina has previously been reported from Misiones and Corrientes provinces, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, along the northern border towards Brazil, and not in the province of Entre Rios. Entre Rios is bordering Corrientes to the north, and this seems to be one of the 1st reports of _Leishmania_ in dogs from Entre Rios, indicating that _Leishmania_ is spreading south in Argentina. ProMED will be happy to post further information - Mod.EP
