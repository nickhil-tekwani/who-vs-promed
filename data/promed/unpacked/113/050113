[Rockland County Department of Health officials said there were 95 confirmed cases and 7 suspected cases of measles in the county as of 17 Dec 2018. It appears from this report there are now 96 confirmed cases. The outbreak began with visitors to and from Israel in September 2018, demonstrating the importance of vaccination even in a country declared measles-free such as the US.

The Health Department administered free vaccination with MMR to non-immunized individuals in December 2018 in Orange county in response to the increasing number of measles cases in the region. See ProMED mail Measles update (79): Middle East, Americas, Europe, Pacific 20181223.6221389. - Mod.LK]

Amid deep-rooted vaccination fears, curable disease makes forceful reappearance with thousands of cases and 22 deaths.

Even though it's widely accepted that [measles] is close to being eradicated here in Thailand's deep south, the virus has spread rapidly since September [2018], affecting some 3000 people out of the 4000 reported cases nationwide and causing the deaths of at least 22 children.

Doctors are warning that the measles outbreak has gone off the rails in the country's south. The region borders Malaysia in a cluster of provinces - Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Songkla - where tensions have been raging for years amid ongoing conflict between separatists fighting for independence and the Thai military.

Experts say the recent measles outbreak is the result of a lack of adequate health education, high levels of child malnourishment and dangerous anti-vaccination narratives that have long plagued the area.

"Right now, the situation is really bad," says Muhammadfahmee Talek, a local epidemiologist and lecturer at Prince of Songkla University Pattani campus, noting that the majority of those affected are children under the age of 4.

Talek attributes the growing number of cases to the deep south's high levels malnutrition - affecting, in some areas, up to 30% of children, according to UNICEF - and low vaccination coverage.

"We need to improve the nutrition status of the kids here, and we also need to encourage the education of the parents. This is so important for the kids because immunisation saves countless lives," he says, calling for the crisis to be contained. "If our kids aren't generally healthy, then they will be more susceptible to other illnesses in the future."

There's no doubt that vaccinations have made global progress. Research indicates that immunisations have resulted in an 80% drop in measles-related deaths between 2000 and 2017, and within that period, measles vaccinations thwarted an estimated 21.1 million deaths.
