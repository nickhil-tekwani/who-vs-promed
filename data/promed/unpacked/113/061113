The province of Capiz records 60 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), as of 25 Feb 2022, according to the Capiz Epidemiological Surveillance and Response Unit (CESRU) of the Provincial Health Office.

HFMD is a viral infection common in children under 10 years of age characterized by fluid--filled blisters appearing on the hands, feet, and mouth with or without fever. It is transmitted through droplets or direct contact with nasal discharges, saliva, feces, and fluid from the rashes of an infected individual.

Provincial Health Officer ll Ramon Lex T. Nolasco said that as a proactive response, continuous active case finding through field investigation is being conducted by the CESRU in coordination with the Department of Health and the Local Government Units (LGUs) to immediately trace HFMD cases, prevent its complications, and reduce transmission of infection through health awareness and health education campaigns.

Nolasco appealed to all Capiznons to inform their Barangay Health Care Workers or the Local Health Offices if their children experience symptoms of HFMD.

"As a preventive measure, kindly maintain proper hygiene and basic sanitation at all times," said Nolasco.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) surveillance began in the Philippines in 2012 following an outbreak in Cambodia. Since then, the National Reference Laboratory for Polio and other Enteroviruses has been providing laboratory support for the surveillance.

HFMD is a notifiable disease with a case definition of any individual who developed acute febrile illness with papulovesicular or maculopapular rash on palms and soles, with or without vesicular lesion/ulcers in the mouth (L.N. Apostol, M.M.A. Jiao, H. Oshitani. Characterization of enteroviruses from hand, foot and mouth disease cases in the Philippines, 2012-2017. IJID. vol 101, suppl 1, 501, 1 Dec 2020. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.1304)

Coxsackievirus A type 16 (CVA16) is the etiologic agent involved in most cases of HFMD, but the illness is also associated with coxsackievirus A5, A7, A9, A10, B2, and B5 strains. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) has caused outbreaks of HFMD with associated neurologic involvement in the western Pacific region and Southeast Asia. - Mod.LK]
