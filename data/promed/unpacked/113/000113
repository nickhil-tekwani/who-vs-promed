Ross River fever cases have increased by 260 per cent in the southern Riverina in New South Wales, prompting the Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) to issue a health alert.

From 1-20 Jan [2021], 18 new cases of the mosquito-borne disease had been identified across the district, a significant increase from the fewer than 5 notified cases for the same period last year [2020].

MLHD infectious diseases manager April Roberts-Witteveen said the virus was regularly seen in the area.

"Factors such as weather, rainfall, mosquito numbers, and travel out of the area all play a part in determining whether it is a season with a lot of human infections," she said.

"Ross River virus does tend to ebb and flow a bit. Sometimes we get a huge number of infections, and sometimes we get a slow and steady amount, but this is more than we've seen in the past couple of years."

There have been no arbovirus detections in sentinel chickens; however, Ross River was detected in mosquito trappings on 19 Jan [2021] in the Griffith area.

Ms Roberts-Witteveen said people could suffer long-term health impacts once infected.

"People who have Ross River experience flu-like symptoms with a fever, chills, headaches, aches and pains and particularly muscle and joint pain," she said. They can get swollen joints and can also have a rash along their body, arms and legs. These symptoms are likely to occur about 7 to 10 days after being bitten by a mozzie with Ross River virus."

The health district has urged anyone experiencing symptoms to seek medical advice.

"The best way to counter Ross River virus is to avoid being bitten by mosquitos so you have no chance of getting sick," Ms Roberts-Witteveen said. She recommended people to wear long, loose fitting clothes to cover up, apply mosquito repellent, and be careful around dusk and dawn when mosquitos were active. She also said it was important to remain vigilant when travelling, especially while camping during the summer months.

[Interestingly, a 25 Nov 2020 report indicated that southeast Queensland could see more mosquitoes this summer as cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infections rise across southern Queensland. These conditions could also occur in New South Wales. Weather forecasters claim a La Nina weather event is likely to cause more rain over the coming months, which will create perfect conditions for more mosquito breeding. Now, cases of RRV infection are occurring with the potential for more cases as the summer there continues.

RRV infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. Making preparations to deal with an increase in vector mosquito populations is prudent as well as informing the population of possible increased risk of infection with advice to avoid mosquito bites.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious, and the infection can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. - Mod.TY
