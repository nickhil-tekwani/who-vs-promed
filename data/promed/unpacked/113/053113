CASE DEFINITIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE
================================================
Availability of Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance on Internet
In response to high demand from state and local health
departments, the 1990 MMWR Recommendations and Reports entitled
Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance is now
available electronically on the Internet. This document provides
case definitions for use by health-care providers, laboratories,
and other public health personnel who report the occurrences of
notifiable diseases to state and local health departments. The
reported numbers of cases of selected notifiable diseases are
printed each week in Tables I-III of MMWR.
Case definitions for specific conditions can be accessed
individually as World-Wide Web (WWW) pages. To access these
pages, use WWW browser software to connect to the CDC home page
at http://www.cdc.gov/, then select MMWR --- Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Reports; go to the "new" item titled Case
Definitions for Public Health Surveillance. To access the Case
Definitions directly, connect to
http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/other/case_def/about.html.
Users can download the complete document as a .pdf file
(Adobe[Registered] Acrobat[Registered]* portable document format)
from the Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance WWW page
and from CDC's file transfer protocol server at ftp.cdc.gov/.
When prompted for user name enter anonymous, and give your
Internet e-mail address when prompted for the password. Select
pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr3913.pdf and download the file
(309,488 bytes). Because of changes in software used for
processing the file, the page numbers for this file do not
correspond to those in the original document.
Case definitions for conditions recently made nationally
reportable and newly revised case definitions will be included in
a supplement to this 1990 publication, which will be added to
this website at a later date. The Council of State and
Territorial Epidemiologists and CDC are revising the entire case
definitions document for publication in late 1996.
