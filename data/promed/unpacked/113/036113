The differential diagnosis of rickettsial spotted fever in Russia is
complex. GIDEON notes the following:

Astrakhan fever:
The agent of Astrakhan fever (Caspian Sea area) is similar to the strain of
_Rickettsia conorii_ responsible for spotted fever in Israel, and is
characterized by a relative rarity of tache noire.

6 cases were reported in 1983; 1,168 during 1984 to 1996; 204 in
1997. Rates per 100 000: 0.6 in 1983; 19.9 in 1997.

The vector for Astrakhan fever is the tick (_Rhipicephalus pumilio_), and
the reservoirs are dogs, cats, hares, small rodents and hedgehogs. 3
percent of _R. pumilio_ are infected in the Astrakhan area (1996).

_Rickettsia conorii_ and _R. slovaca_:
Outbreaks were described in the Black Sea area during 1940 to 1950. An
outbreak occurred in Crimea during 1947 to 1957. Since then, only sporadic
cases were encountered until 40 cases were diagnosed in Central Crimea in
1996; over 70 in 1997. 8 percent of _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ from Crimea
are infected (1997).

_Rickettsia slovaca_ (vector = _Dermacentor marginatus_) has been
implicated as a cause of spotted fever in The Russian Republic.

_Rickettsia heilongjiangensis_:
16 cases of _Rickettsia heilongjiangensis_ infection were documented in the
Russian far east during the summer of 2002. Possible regional tick
vectors include _Haemaphysalis concinna_ and _Dermacentor sylvarum_.

_Rickettsia sibiricus_:
_Rickettsia sibiricus_ was first identified in 1935, in Central Siberia.

North Asian tick typhus is endemic to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia,
Buryat and Primorsky Kray. A similar agent is present in ticks in
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Lithuania and the Tula region of Russia. Rates
are highest among rural populations. The local vectors are _Dermacentor
nuttalii_, _D. silvorum_, _D. pictus_, _D. marginatus_, _Haemaphysalis
concinna_ and _H. punctata_. 12 percent of _D. nuttalii_ are infected
(Siberia, 1994).
