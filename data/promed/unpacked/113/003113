Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 178 / 37 / 37 / 141 / 0
Affected population: The affected premises is a small backyard mixed free-range flock of geese, turkeys, chickens, ducks, and pigeons that are allowed access to the outdoors and regularly exposed to wild migratory waterfowl.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comment: The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in conjunction with State Departments of Agriculture and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance in response to the HPAI H5N2 wild bird related event. The USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N2 in a backyard mixed flock. Preliminary results indicate that the H5N2 identified is 99 percent similar to the recent H5N2 isolated from the Northern pintail duck. Epidemiological investigation of backyard AIV infected premises as of 6 Jan 2015: 2 high risk epidemiologically linked contact backyard premises have been identified and placed under quarantine. Biological sampling for AIV has been completed and results are pending. Enhanced surveillance in a 10 km [6.2 mile] radius has been implemented. The HPAI H5N2 virus has NOT been found in commercial poultry anywhere in the United States.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 3 Jan 2015 / Positive
