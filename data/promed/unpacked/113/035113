Primary Amebic Encephalitis observed in Viet Mam
---------------------------------------
_Naegleria fowleri_ is a free-living excavate form of protist typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and hot springs.

A man who died at a Ho Chi Minh City hospital last month [August 2012] was a victim of what is probably Viet Nam's 1st-ever recorded case of the brain-eating amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_.

The Hospital of Tropical Diseases said Wednesday [29 Aug 2012] a [25 year old] male patient [from] Phu Yen Province died from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a rare and usually deadly disease of the central nervous system caused by the amoeba.

According to his family, [the patient] and his friends swam in a lake to catch oyster in a rural village near his hometown in mid-July [2012].

[He] then developed fever and headache and was admitted to Gia Dinh People's Hospital in HCMC. He was diagnosed with meningitis and transferred to the Hospital of Tropical Diseases on [30 Jul 2012].

Tests there showed the patient was infected with _Naegleria fowleri_. His condition got worse with unconsciousness, high fever and respiratory failure. He died the following day [31 Jul 2012].

According to doctors, the amoeba may have penetrated into the nasal mucous membrane of the patient before entering his brain.

This is the 1st case of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis that the hospital has ever encountered, according to Dr Nguyen Van Vinh Chau, the hospital's director. "It may be the 1st case in the country as well" he said.

No previous reports media reports have mentioned the amoeba or the disease's existence in Viet Nam.

[_Naegleria fowleri_, a free living amoeba, is probably found world wide in warm fresh water. _Naegleria fowleri_ causes an acute menngoencephalitis and - in contrast to other free living amoeba - causes an acute infection where amoebae can be seen directly in the cerebral fluid. It may simply not have been identified before in Viet Nam. For further information see: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html. - Mod.EP
