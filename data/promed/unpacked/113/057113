[1] Now 128 cases
Date: Wed 1 May 2013

The new H7N9 avian flu virus has been detected in one more patient in China, a finding that brings the number of cases in the outbreak to 128, which includes 24 deaths. [Now 26 deaths according to WHO; see part [2] below]. The patient is a 69 year old man from Hunan province, located in south-central China, according to a statement today [1 May 2013] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The man -- Hunan province's 2nd H7N9 case-patient -- is hospitalized in critical condition.

The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday [30 Apr 2013] updated its "frequently asked questions" background information on the H7N9 virus, which said that although evidence points to live poultry as the source of infections, investigations haven't confirmed that the birds are the primary or only source. Addressing the role of live-bird markets in the transmission of the virus, WHO said the markets should be periodically closed and emptied of all birds for regular cleaning. New birds brought into the market should be regularly sampled and tested to detect diseases early. WHO said regular maintenance of market environments can help minimize economic disruptions and the impact on a key source of protein for people. It also noted that the markets help ensure that the bird trade isn't diverted to channels of uncontrolled sales.

Until more information is known about the infections, it's difficult to determine whether the H7N9 virus poses a significant risk of person-to-person spread in the community, WHO said. "This possibility is the subject of epidemiological investigations that are now taking place." It's not known yet whether H7N9 is a pandemic threat, the agency said. Animal viruses that infect people theoretically carry a pandemic risk, but some animal influenza viruses known to infect people haven't sparked pandemics.

Regarding potential risks to health care workers, WHO said standard and extra precautions should be taken when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed H7N9 infections. In China and Taiwan, monitoring of close contacts of H7N9 patients turned up some instances of respiratory symptoms in health workers who cared for H7N9 patients, but so far, tests have not confirmed H7N9 flu in any worker.

In other developments, a rush to publish scientific papers based on H7N9 genetic sequences that the Chinese National Influenza Center uploaded to the GISAID database early in the outbreak has sparked worries that China might not receive credit for its efforts to isolate and sequence the virus, according to a news report in Nature today [1 May 2013]. One of the points of conflict involves a genetic analysis and case study that Chinese scientists submitted to the New England of Journal of Medicine on 5 Apr 2013. At about that time, the researchers learned that other groups were preparing papers or had already published studies on the sequences that Chinese researchers had uploaded to GISAID. At that time, the Chinese researchers also learned that pharmaceutical company Novartis and the J Craig Venter Institute had used the uploaded sequences to develop US-funded H7N9 vaccine without collaboration with the Chinese team, according to Nature. The Chinese researchers believed that the usage wasn't handled in the spirit of the GISAID database, which requires scientists who use the sequences to credit and propose collaboration with those who deposited the data. A spokeswoman from Novartis said the company explored research collaboration with China and is committed to sharing meaningful insights from the vaccine work with Chinese officials, Nature reported.

Kristine Sheedy, PhD, associate director of communication science at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Nature that the CDC's use of the sequences isn't part of the misunderstanding. She added that the agency has had strong ongoing collaborations with China since the start of the outbreak.

[2] WHO update
Date: Thu 2 May 2013

As of 2 May 2013 (16:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The 1st patient is a 58 year old man from Fujian province who became ill on 21 Apr 2013, and the 2nd patient is a 69 year old man from Hunan province who became ill on 23 Apr 2013. In addition, 2 patients earlier reported have died.

To date, a total of 128 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 26 deaths, have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures.

Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.
