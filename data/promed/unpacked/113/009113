2000/046B - Pepper huasteco begomovirus
----------------------------------------
Why: Pepper huasteco begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of capsicum and tomato in the Americas.
Where: Pepper huasteco begomovirus was first reported on capsicum
(Garzón-Tiznado, 1993), in a region called Las Huastecas in northern Mexico
(Tamaulipas state). It is reported to occur in Guanajuato, Quintana Roo,
Sinaloa, and also in Rio Grande valley in Texas (USA) (Torres-Pacheco et
al., 1996). Recently, it was also found in glasshouse tomatoes in Sonora
(Idris et al., 1999). Pepper huasteco begomovirus is sometimes found in
mixed infection with Chino del tomate and Texas pepper begomovirus.
Distribution: Mexico (Guanajuato, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora,
Tamaulipas), USA (Texas).
On which plants: Capsicum (_Capsicum annuum_), but also tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_).
Damage: According to Guevara-Gonzalez et al. (1999), pepper huasteco
begomovirus is widely distributed in horticultural areas in Mexico and
southern USA, and is probably the most important begomovirus affecting
Mexican agriculture. Symptoms are characterized by chlorotic mottle, leaf
rolling, leaf distortion.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Pathway infected tomato and capsicum plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where pepper huasteco begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. Among begomoviruses of tomato and capsicum, pepper
huasteco begomovirus is reported as the most serious one in Mexico, but
actual data on its severity and extent in the field is lacking. The vector
is present in many parts of the EPPO region.
