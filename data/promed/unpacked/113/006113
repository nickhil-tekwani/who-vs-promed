Since June [2018], an unexplained outbreak of listeriosis, a rare infectious disease, has been occurring across Switzerland [in 6 Swiss cantons]. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has identified 12 cases, 2 of which are fatal.

"What is unusual is that it is all cases of the same subtype of bacteria. We counted 12 cases, which is not that much, but 12 of the same type in a short time, it's not normal," said Daniel Koch, director of the Division of Communicable Diseases at the FOPH, told SRF [Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen, German-language broadcaster in Switzerland].

Research is being conducted to find the sources of the infection. Currently 6 cantons are affected by the listeriosis outbreak. In Neuchatel, 3 cases were reported, 4 in Valais and others in Ticino, Zurich, Aargau and Schwyz.

Listeriosis is a rare infectious disease caused by a bacterium that spreads especially through the ingestion of contaminated food. Charcuterie, soft cheeses and salads are all foods that are possible sources of infection.

"We can talk about an epidemic and this disease can be deadly, but the population is not at risk. These germs benefit from flaws, a decrease in immunity, in the defenses of individuals. This therefore concerns especially pregnant women and the elderly," Raffaele Malinverni, head of the Department of Medicine at the Neuchatel Hospital, told RTS on its Tuesday [16 Oct 2018] 12:45 broadcast.

The FOPH reminds that people at risk should avoid raw vegetables, raw or undercooked meat, raw fish and seafood, soft cheese and unpasteurized milk.

"Our survey is all the more difficult because the cases are spread all over Switzerland; it's not easy, people have probably been infected with the same food, but it's a food that had to be distributed in many places," said Daniel Koch.

Several people infected by the same source of bacteria -- the case is not new. In 1987, more than 120 people became ill after eating Vacherin-Mont-d'or, and 30 of them died.

[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past outbreaks, contamination occurred in parts of the machinery "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, _Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold cut meats (e.g., ham), are recognized potential sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, the source in some outbreaks has been contamination with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization.

Serotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 percent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf). We are told in the news report above that all 12 cases have the same "subtype," but we are not told what that subtype is. Genotyping the clinical isolates from ill people, if they match, will establish that we are dealing with a common source.
