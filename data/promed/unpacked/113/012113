The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 27 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1044, of which 978 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there have been 652 deaths (586 confirmed and 66 probable) and 325 people recovered.
- 218 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 14 new confirmed cases, including 6 in Katwa, 4 in Vuhovi, 1 in Beni, 1 in Lubero, 1 in Oicha and 1 in Mandima.
- 9 new confirmed cases, including 4 community deaths, including 3 in Vuhovi and 1 in Mandima; 5 deaths at Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), including 4 in Butembo and 1 in Mabalako.
- 1 new probable case validated in Vuhovi whose death occurred on 1 Mar 2019. This is the nurse of a confirmed patient who died on 14 Feb 2019 in Vuhovi.
- 1 new recovered patient discharged from the ETC of Mabalako.
- 2 health workers are among the new confirmed cases in Katwa, all working in the health facility in the Muchanga health area, where several confirmed cases have passed since 10 Mar 2019. The cumulative confirmed and probable cases among the agents is 80 (7.7% of all confirmed and probable cases), including 27 deaths.

News of the response
Beni and Oicha: Reactivation of the epidemic following population mobility
-------------------------------------------------------
- Due to a relatively well-developed road network, the population of North Kivu is very mobile and travels frequently from one health zone to another. This mobility is the main cause of reactivation of the epidemic in health areas where the transmission of the virus had already been stopped.
- This is notably the case of Beni, which had no new confirmed cases between 21 Feb and 20 Mar 2019. Since 20 Mar 2019, the Beni outbreak has been reactivated after a person infected with the Ebola virus from Biakato Mine (Mandima) moved to Beni for treatment. Preliminary investigations revealed that of the 7 new confirmed cases reported in Beni since 20 Mar 2019, 6 are linked to a Biakato Mine transmission line and one was infected after attending the funeral of a confirmed case in Butembo.
- The same is true for the last 2 new cases confirmed in Oicha. These are family members of a confirmed case, a child from Biakato Mine who died in Oicha on 20 Mar 2019.

Vaccination
----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 92 502 people have been vaccinated [see URL above for total number of vaccines in each location].

[The health facility in the Muchanga health area where health workers have become infected, as well as several cases, should be thoroughly decontaminated, and all remaining healthcare workers should be vaccinated to prevent further infection. See the MoH report below from 27 Mar 2019. It appears the community would not allow for this to take place. The facility should not be used without decontamination because new cases will occur. The community must be convinced of the infectiousness of Ebola and the need for precautionary measures to prevent further spread. But vaccination of frontline workers also must be provided for their safety. According to Helen Branswell, "so far in this outbreak 78 health workers have been infected and 27 have died". - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 26 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1029, of which 964 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there have been 642 deaths (577 confirmed and 65 probable) and 324 people recovered.
- 239 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 7 new confirmed cases, including 4 in Katwa, 2 in Beni, and 1 in Oicha.
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths in Katwa and 1 death at the ETC of Butembo.

News of the response
Katwa: Importance of decontamination of households and health centers
----------------------------------------------------------
- Of the 4 new confirmed cases in Katwa reported today, 3 are from the Muchanga health area. These 3 people were cared for in the same health facility in which 7 confirmed patients were hospitalized since 10 Mar 2019, indicating a possible nosocomial transmission of the virus. However, no decontamination activity could be carried out after the notification of each new confirmed case because of the refusal of the surrounding community.
- As explained in the 26 Mar 2019 newsletter, Infection Prevention and Control (ICP) is an essential pillar to break the chain of transmission of the virus and stop the spread of the virus. Thus, when a person infected with Ebola is treated in a health center, outside the ETC, decontamination of the center is important to prevent other patients from being infected later.

Vaccination
----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 92 172 people have been vaccinated [see URL above for total number of vaccines in each location].

2. Three of today's cases didn't have to be. They are people who were infected in a health clinic that had 7 #Ebola patients. The clinic was not decontaminated -- the community wouldn't allow it. So these 3 people, who were getting care for something else, caught Ebola.

3. This week's #Ebola situation report from @WHOAFRO reveals that resistance and insecurity remains a problem for the people trying control this outbreak.

4. It appears that one of the ways the #Ebola response is trying to adapt to get the community to work with them is to put more control over what is and isn't done (in terms of control measures) in the hands of the community. Hope it helps.]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 25 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1022, of which 957 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there have been 639 deaths (574 confirmed and 65 probable) and 324 people recovered.
- 161 suspected cases are under investigation.
(Information unavailable for health zones covered by Butembo's sub-coordination due to an internet connection problem.)
- 6 new confirmed cases: 2 in Katwa, 2 in Mandima, and 2 in Vuhovi.
- 5 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 4 community deaths -- 2 in Katwa and 2 in Mandima -- and 1 death at the ETC in Butembo.
- 3 new patients recovered and discharged from the Butembo ETC.

News of the response
New strategy for prevention and control of community infections
----------------------------------------------------
- Following the attacks on the ETCs in Katwa and Butembo, the coordination launched community dialogues in several health zones to invite the community to share their concerns and suggestions regarding the conduct of the response to the Ebola outbreak. Many recommendations were made, and 2 pillars of the response were then targeted by coordination, namely, Infection Prevention and Control (ICP) and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (CREC).
- IPC teams are responsible for putting in place measures and practices to stop the transmission of infectious diseases in health facilities and in the community. These measures include the disinfection of health facilities and households, the installation of handwashing points, and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Coordination organized a 1st workshop on IPC 21-23 Mar 2019 in Goma to improve the quality of ICP interventions and the perception of ICP by communities. The main recommendations of the workshop are:

1. Adapting standard ICP community-based operating procedures targeted at community engagement and integrating families into the process;
2. Developing a specific communication strategy on new approaches to community-based ICP to improve community understanding; and
3. The revitalization of the Villages and Clean Schools program and the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene projects, particularly in Butembo and Katwa.

- A 2nd workshop on risk communication and community engagement was held in Goma 25-26 Mar 2019, and recommendations will be shared shortly.

Vaccination
----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 91 891 people have been vaccinated [see URL above for number of vaccines at each location].

[2] Summaries
- Thu 28 Mar 2019. Disease Outbreak News update
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/28-march-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a rise in the number of new cases this past week. At this time, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities. Despite this, progress is being made in areas such as Mandima, Masereka and Vuhovi, where response teams are gradually able to access once again and acceptance by the community of proven interventions to break the chains of transmission is observed.

During the past 21 days (6-26 Mar 2019), a total of 125 new cases were reported from 51 health areas within 12 of the 21 health zones affected to date; 38% of the 133 health areas affected to date (see Fig. 2 at the source URL). The majority of these cases were from remaining hotspot areas of Katwa (36), Butembo (14), and 3 emerging clusters in Mandima (19), Masereka (18) and Vuhovi (17), in addition to a limited number of cases in other areas (see Table 1 at the source URL). All cases link back to chains of transmission in hotspot areas, with onward local transmission observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases have visited prior to their detection and isolation.

As of 26 Mar 2019, a total of 1029 confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases have been reported, of which 642 died (case fatality ratio, 62%). Of 1029 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (584) were female, and 30% (307) were children less than 18 years of age. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 78 (8% of total cases), including 27 deaths.

Community engagement efforts to encourage greater local participation and ownership of the outbreak response is ongoing and has yielded some success in many areas. In Butembo and Katwa this past week, a total of 4171 households have been visited by community health and Red Cross volunteers. This past week also saw the establishment of 9 community committees to enhance direct dialogue with healthcare workers and empower community members to partake in the decision-making process of the local response. Special dialogues are being held in the communities where there have been the most frequent incidents. Herein, an anthropologist 1st meets with the community to ascertain their concerns, then arranges for communal meetings where these concerns can be discussed, including amongst local youth leaders, women's associations, traditional practitioners, and healthcare providers.

In Beni, local NGOs and international teams are currently conducting eye care training for 10 ophthalmologists and establishing dedicated eye care clinics to provide screening and eye care for EVD survivors. To date, 145 survivors have been screened in these clinics and a total of 293 survivors have enrolled in the survivor's programme.

Notable strides have also been made in improving IPC capacities in healthcare facilities. Since January 2019, IPC field teams have decontaminated more than 250 healthcare facilities and households, provided more than 100 supply kits, and trained more than 3000 healthcare workers in IPC.

These local successes do not come without challenges. When visiting communities in high-risk areas, Ebola response teams sometimes face security challenges. WHO and partners have recently established operational analysis and coordination centres to both gain a more holistic understanding of how we can engage communities more effectively, as well as further increase operational awareness of the day-to-day operations to ensure the safety of frontline healthcare workers and the communities they are aiding. WHO and partners have also strengthened physical security in the treatment centres and accommodations of healthcare workers.

Finding a balance between providing adequate operational protection to community members at risk of Ebola and healthcare workers while simultaneously winning the trust of communities remains an iterative learning process. WHO is constantly evolving the response efforts to address these operational challenges and will continue to step up collaboration with communities to increase acceptance on the ground.

- Tue 26 Mar 2019. Ebola sickens 6 more in DR Congo
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/ebola-sickens-6-more-dr-congo
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) saw no let-up in the steady pace of Ebola cases today [26 Mar 2019], with the health ministry reporting 6 more cases. In other developments, Oxfam, one of the nongovernmental agencies working in the region, weighed in on ongoing challenges in the outbreak, and the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office provided a snapshot of events in its weekly update.

Latest cases in 3 hot spots
--------------------------
The 6 new cases are from 3 different locations. Katwa, the main epicenter, reported 2, as did 2 smaller hot spots -- Mandima and Vuhovi.

The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 1022 cases, which includes 957 confirmed and 65 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating at least 161 suspected cases, but that total may be higher because the ministry said health zones covered by the Butembo office couldn't report because of an internet connection problem.

Five more people died from their infections, 4 of them in community settings in Katwa and Mandima and one at Butembo's Ebola treatment center.

In other developments, the ministry said community dialogues in the wake of attacks on Ebola treatment centers resulted in several recommendations, and that the outbreak response has targeted 2 of them: infection prevention and control and risk communication/community engagement.

It said infection prevention teams will be taking steps to curb transmission in health facilities and in the community, such as disinfection, installing handwashing points, and providing personal protective equipment. A workshop on infection prevention was recently held in Goma, and a similar one on risk communication and communication is wrapping up in the city, with recommendations due soon.

Oxfam airs concerns over local elections
-------------------------------------
Along with other groups that have marked the DRC's eclipsing of the 1000-case mark, Oxfam yesterday [25 Mar 2019] warned that humanitarian access to the outbreak region has deteriorated in the wake of the most recent attacks on Ebola treatment centers, and community trust is almost nonexistent.

Oxfam's work in the region involves public health promotion, supporting community-led efforts to break transmission chains, providing clean water, and improving health center infrastructure.

In a news release, Tamba Emmanuel Danmbi-saa, Oxfam's DRC humanitarian program manager, said the growing presence of police and military is fanning the flames and making people even more frightened. "While there is an imperative to protect staff in the field, using security forces during the Ebola response should be done with extreme caution," Danmbi-saa said. "If communities feel that they are being coerced into vaccination or decontamination they lose trust in the response. Building that trust is vital to stopping the spread of the disease."

Other groups have raised concerns about the role of police and military in the outbreak, and earlier this month [March 2019] the DRC's health ministry said there were misunderstandings about its involvement in response activities, though it acknowledged that police escorts of response teams in less secure areas had been perceived with suspicion.

Focusing only on the medical issues isn't enough to contain the epidemic, Danmbi-saa said, adding that health workers need to prioritize the affected people, not just the disease. "There needs to be a real change in the response to end the epidemic as soon as possible."

WHO notes reversal of declining trends
---------------------------------
In a weekly diseases and health emergencies update from its African regional office today, the WHO said moderate-intensity transmission continues in the DRC, with a slight reversal in declining activity over the past several weeks. It added that more health zones reported at least one confirmed case over the past 3 weeks.

Katwa is still the main hot spot, but several recent cases have also been reported in Masereka, Mandima, and Butembo, the WHO said. The agency added that pockets of mistrust and insecurity are still challenging for contact follow-up and other measures, but it notes that transmission has stopped in many areas.

- Wed 27 Mar 2019. WHO names Peter Graaff new Ebola chief in DRC
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/who-names-new-ebola-chief-drc-7-more-cases-noted
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Peter Graaff is the new World Health Organization (WHO) special representative for the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, appointed Graaff, who previously served as the WHO's director of Ebola emergency response in Liberia and West Africa.

Graaff, a Dutch national, will be based in Kinshasa and will coordinate the outbreak response with both the WHO and the DRC government. During a radio address made from Kinshasa today [27 Mar 2019], Graaff said, "We are talking about 'cases' and 'containment' to use scientific terms, but behind every case there is a person, a family and a community that suffers."

'Daily challenges'
-----------------
"Currently, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities," the WHO said in a situation report issued yesterday [26 Mar 2019].

From 4-24 Mar 2019, officials confirmed 115 Ebola cases in 13 health zones. Katwa had the most cases (31), followed by Masereka (19), Mandima (17), and Vuhovi (15). The new cases include healthcare workers, and the total number of healthcare workers now infected during this outbreak is 78. Thirty percent of cases as of Sun 24 Mar 2019 have been in children, and 57% involve girls and women.

As of today [27 Mar 2019], the WHO Ebola dashboard [see URL below] shows a total of 1029 cases, 7 more than yesterday. The death toll stands at 639.

Shifting response to the community
-----------------------------
Community mistrust still overshadows the Ebola response, the WHO said. As of Sun [24 Mar 2019], only 78% death alerts were responded to successfully by safe and dignified burial teams, and the WHO notes there has been an increase in community deaths in the past 3 weeks.

To combat this, the WHO has established operational analysis and coordination centers focused on engaging the community. "With the shift in strategy, the focus has been to transition ownership of the Ebola response interventions to local communities, particularly in the hotspots of Butembo, Katwa and Vuhovi," the WHO said.

"Nine Ebola community committees have been established in Katwa (2), Butembo (3) and Vuhovi (4) comprising youth leaders, quarter chiefs, women's associations, traditional practitioners, and activists. They are responsible for making decisions on Ebola response activities within their localities."

The WHO said that, despite the recent uptick, officials are seeing ample progress. "There are still many areas in which disease transmission has stopped," the WHO said. "Local and national authorities and partners must continue with the current proven and innovative public health measures, which will ultimately bring this outbreak to an end."

[4] Public trust
- Wed 27 Mar 2019. Public mistrust thwarts Congo's Ebola response as cases climb
[Thomson Reuters Foundation, abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-ebola-mistrust/public-mistrust-thwarts-congos-ebola-response-as-cases-climb-idUSKCN1R82QW
[Byline: Nellie Peyton]

A quarter of people surveyed in Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola hotspots believed the virus was not real, a study said on Wed [27 Mar 2019], as the world's 2nd-biggest outbreak spreads. Health workers said public mistrust is now the biggest obstacle to stopping the epidemic, which has infected more than 1000 people in eastern Congo since July [2018], with many refusing vaccines, resisting treatment and concealing symptoms.

Harvard University researchers found that trust in public authorities had already fallen in the cities of Beni and Butembo before Ebola hit, due to decades of conflict and poor governance. "It's been 3 years now that we saw a declining level of trust in those actors, and the Ebola crisis comes on top of that and accelerates the distrust," said Patrick Vinck, author of the study published in British medical journal The Lancet [see report below]. "In some ways, we are now paying the consequences of many years of lack of interest and focus on this issue," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

People who believed rumors that Ebola does not exist were 15 times less likely to seek formal health care and 5 times less likely to accept vaccination, showed the study, which was based on interviews with 961 people in September [2018].

Community resistance is highest in and around Butembo, the latest epicenter of the outbreak, said Jean-Philippe Marcoux, country director for international aid group Mercy Corps. "We need to -- as much as possible and rapidly -- scale down the presence of security forces with response teams, because it is creating more harm than good right now," he said. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and charities are running community engagement programs, these have not been well-integrated with the medical response, Marcoux added.

But building trust is a slow process, said WHO's regional emergencies director Ibrahima Soce Fall. "What worked in Beni might not work in Butembo because the communities are not the same," he said.

[It is not only in the DRC that vaccines are being refused, but globally as has been occurring with distrust of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR). The big challenge is how best to combat such distrust and educate people of all levels to the benefits of vaccination. There are other similarities such as lack of belief the disease itself is a real problem. The approach clearly will be different in this situation for Ebola and in developed countries for MMR, but it is all a basic distrust of authority and science. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 27 Mar 2019. Low levels of public trust during violent conflict may have thwarted attempts to control Ebola
[EurekAlert, edited]
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/tl-pss032619.php

A quarter of people surveyed during active 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo believed the virus was not real, and would not accept vaccination against infection. Mistrust and misinformation can stop people taking measures to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD), increasing the likelihood that they refuse vaccination, according to a study with nearly 1000 people published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30063-5/fulltext).

The study highlights the vital importance of understanding that, among people who have learnt from experience to distrust authority, how and by whom health messages are communicated can be just as important as what is said.

Of 961 adults interviewed, only 349 thought that local authorities could be trusted to represent their interests and 230 believed rumours that the Ebola virus does not exist. Among individuals who believed the virus was real, those who thought the risk of contracting the virus was high were less likely to seek care or to accept vaccination. This might be due to fear that a medical setting could expose them to the virus. At the same time, most respondents reported taking individual measures such as washing their hands more frequently (885 of 961) and avoiding contact with people suspected to have Ebola (757 of 961).

Higher trust was positively correlated with seeking care and accepting vaccination.

The research was conducted in the cities of Beni and Butembo at the epicentre of an active Ebola outbreak in the east of the country. It is a highly insecure, densely populated environment. Violent conflict over 2 decades has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, including attacks against civilians and targeted attacks on EVD response teams. Delayed presidential elections have contributed to an unstable political situation.

It was already known that violence leads to a collapse of trust and that trust is important for compliance with changes in behaviour to reduce health risks. However, this is the 1st study to more precisely define how misinformation and mistrust on an individual level can undermine the response to an infectious disease outbreak.

"Medical responses alone are not enough to stop the spread of Ebola," says Dr. Patrick Vinck from Harvard University, who led the research. "Ebola responders are often from outside local communities, so building trust via local leaders and service providers should be a cornerstone of efforts to engage with people to control outbreaks. This is particularly important in conflict zones where information about outbreaks can become politicized" [1].

Interviews were conducted in September 2018, a month after the country declared its 10th EVD outbreak. Most respondents had heard false rumours about the EVD outbreak. While 1 in 4 believed in the statement that Ebola does not exist (230 of 961 people or 26%), an even higher proportion believed that the outbreak was fabricated for financial gains (312 of 961, 33%), or was fabricated to destabilize the region (371 of 961, 36%) [2]. Nearly one-fifth (171 respondents) believed all 3 statements. Among those who believed in all or any misinformation statements, trust scores in EVD information, government and health professionals were significantly lower. The belief that EVD does not exist was linked to lower adoption of behaviours to prevent its spread, as well as people being more than 15 times less likely to seek formal health care and 5 times less likely to accept vaccination.

Confidence in vaccines in general was high, with 899 people believing that they work. It was lower in relation to Ebola vaccines specifically. Only 641 believed that EVD vaccines work and only 589 reported that they would accept vaccination, while 59 were unsure. The reasons cited for not accepting vaccination included that it was unsafe (225 of 313 people), that it didn't work (75 of 313) and that it was not needed to avoid contracting the virus (45 of 313).

All people who took part in the survey believed that local authorities were more trustworthy than provincial and national levels of government. This might reflect the fact that they have greater visibility and access and are directly involved in delivering services. Health professionals were more frequently trusted than authorities, though the authors note that they did not distinguish between government, private, and humanitarian health providers. Additional differences in trust might exist depending on these affiliations.

The researchers point to several limitations, including that the study was conducted in urban environments. In other affected areas, particularly those that are rural, perceptions might be different. All data were self-reported, including behaviour changes, and it's possible that participants act differently to the behaviour they report to researchers. This can lead to over-reporting of the extent to which individuals take precautions to prevent the virus spreading.

Writing in a linked comment, Joe Trapido from the London School of Economics, UK, says: "The strength of the paper by Vinck and colleagues is the attention given to ordinary people." He adds: "Extensive participant observation fieldwork might not be an immediate option here, but more qualitative knowledge might be useful: What it is about how a rumour acts in a social context that makes it harmful? In many cases, I suspect that establishing common ground on the basis of genuine attempts at communication, as shown in the article by the extensive questioning of local people, might be more important in securing positive outcomes than dispelling misinformation."

[Med Page Today, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Molly Walker]

One-quarter of adults surveyed in Ebola outbreak areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo said they didn't believe there is such an outbreak. Moreover, only 32% of the 961 respondents living in the cities of Beni and Butembo said they trusted that local authorities represented their interest, reported Patrick Vinck, PhD, of Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and colleagues, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see report above].

Mistrust in authorities has been a theme of this ongoing Ebola outbreak. In October 2018, Mary Choi, MD, of the CDC reported in a session at IDWeek that there were "pockets of resistance" in trying to treat this outbreak, where high-risk contacts were refusing to be traced and actively fleeing from tracers. Rumors circulating around the community included "the illness is due to witchcraft" and "Ebola is a sham conducted by doctors and NGOs [non-government organizations] to make money."

"Ebola responders are often from outside local communities, so building trust via local leaders and service providers should be a cornerstone of efforts to engage with people to control outbreaks," Vinck said in a statement. "Medical responses alone are not enough to stop the spread of Ebola."

Indeed, at a recent press conference, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, emphasized the importance of community engagement in helping to combat the ongoing Ebola outbreak.

An accompanying editorial by Joe Trapido, PhD, of the London School of Economics, provided some context, stating that the cancellation of the presidential election in Ebola-affected regions of the country is "strongly linked in the public mind with the rigging of the national ballot." "The Congolese people have been taught by bitter experience to distrust authority, in ways that make it difficult to sustain public health interventions," Trapido wrote.

Trapido warned against engaging with "locally trusted leaders" who act as intermediaries between local populations and the outside world because of their history of double-dealing and exploitation. "[D]ifferent performances for internal and external audiences by local leaders are common," he said, citing the example of Butembo's business class.

"The so-called Nande traders have carefully presented themselves and been accepted by outsiders as entrepreneurial problem solvers, practical people who offer a model for the wider DR Congo," Trapido commented. "In fact, research shows that the business class have repeatedly used violence to sabotage or hijack development projects to preserve their trade monopolies and political power."

Vinck and colleagues surveyed adults in Beni, one of the former epicenters of the outbreak, and Butembo, where many of the cases are now concentrated. Mean age of respondents was about 34 years, and there was equal representation of men and women, per the study design.

[Devex, abridged, edited]
https://www.devex.com/news/chanjo-ebola-warnings-puzzle-communities-in-goma-94538
[Byline: Jenny Lei Ravelo]

The availability of an experimental vaccine is seen as a game changer in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But some residents in the North Kivu province capital city of Goma, in particular women over 35 years old, aren't so sure. For starters, they don't know what "vaccine" is, or its equivalent in Swahili, "chanjo." They only know of "ndui," a Congolese Swahili term that refers to prenatal vaccines, Ellie Kemp, head of crisis response at Translators without Borders, told Devex. "Women and older people [in Goma], the majority of them told us that they didn't have the information they needed to keep their family safe. That's a terrifying situation to be in."

"That's the word [ndui] they understand for vaccination, while men were more likely to understand the formal Swahili word for vaccination. But unless you know that and test the comprehension of some of these keywords ... then you could miss out [a significant part of] the population," Kemp said.

The findings are part of a new report by the NGO that surveyed 216 residents of Goma and engaged 75 others in a group discussion to assess whether the information provided by aid organizations on Ebola prevention is understood. The assessment was made in support of the ministry of health's campaign to ensure the effectiveness of Ebola prevention and preparedness in Goma. There are fears the virus might reach the city of more than 1 million people near the Rwandan border, making it even more challenging to contain the outbreak.

Kemp said insights on the language people use and in what format they most effectively receive information is crucial for the Ebola response. "This is in Goma, which is a relatively well-educated, well-connected part of eastern Congo. Once you get into more deprived rural areas, you're going to find more people and more linguistically diverse areas [where] people struggle to understand communications in Swahili, written communication, and the formal kind of Swahili that is taught in schools," she said. "The risk communication needs to adapt to the local area if it's to be understood locally."

What's the French word for gums?
-------------------------------
During the focus group discussions, Translators without Borders found that most people didn't understand some terms in a French-language poster that shows the different Ebola-related symptoms. This included words such as "sanglant" (bloody) and "gencives" (gums), which, in the poster, were referring to bloody diarrhea, vomiting blood, and bleeding nose and gums.

When asked how they refer to gums, participants used the Congolese Swahili phrase "nyama za mumeno," which means "meat of the teeth," or "bihanga."

Some participants also did not fully grasp the meaning of some of the illustrations in the information poster. For example, an image of a man's torso with reddish spots in the stomach area was mistaken by some to mean hot, or an upset stomach, when it was meant to show skin rashes.

This helped the NGO understand how drawings can be misunderstood, Kemp said, adding that some participants encouraged the use of photos instead of drawings. For some respondents, it may be a way to convince them that Ebola is real.

Another poster using Congolese Swahili and endorsed by the ministry of health and several aid agencies "was very widely understood" by focus group participants, Kemp said. "So there are good things in place. It's about learning what's working and what's not, and then adjusting," she said.

International Rescue Committee Country Director Sarah Terlouw told Devex the report will help inform the organization's programs, especially as IRC prepares its teams in case the outbreak reaches Goma. "Knowing linguistic preferences will aid us [MSF] to work better in North Kivu and may also prove useful to offer insights to improve IRC's wider response beyond Ebola in the DRC. It is important to note that the key to resolving the epidemic will be through community engagement," she said.

The report found disparities in language between demographics, reiterating the importance of targeted communication.

In the individual surveys for example, 21% of respondents prefer information spoken in French. However, only 48% of women understand spoken French. Many of them prefer Congolese Swahili, or their mother tongues, such as Nande, Rwanda, Shi, and Hunde. Only 48% of youth participants ages 18 to 34 years can understand French.

Why only now?
------------
The report provides new insights that could aid in the Ebola response, but it also raises some critical questions. Kemp said this is the 1st language assessment they have done in Congo in relation to the current response. And they were able to carry it out only after receiving some support from a small group of organizations, such as IRC.

"To be honest, we've struggled to get the attention to the issue to enable us to carry out that initial research," she said, explaining that they've tried to raise the issue of language since the outbreak was declared in August [2018].

- Wed 27 Mar 2019. Gold mines in Congo
[Mining, abridged, edited]
http://www.mining.com/third-gold-mines-congo-exposed-ebola-report/
[Byline: Cecilia Jamasmie]

A World Health Organization study shows that more than 35% of the gold mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are at risk of being affected by the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the country, which is the world's top cobalt producer and a significant copper and gold producer. The DRC generates more than 60% of the world's cobalt, a key material for making the batteries that power electric cars.

Along with the obvious risks for those working in the country's gold mines, companies are now facing delays in their exports, as part of Ebola prevention methods being implemented at border checkpoints, Indigo Ellis, Verisk Maplecroft's lead DRC analyst, warns.

In Ellis' view, there are 2 major issues the gold mining industry has to urgently deal with. One is the risk to mine staff. "Larger industrial mining companies will need to enact strict protocols to reduce the risk of transmission to their sites, which will likely slow down ore extraction and construction efforts," the analyst says.

The other is related to shipment disruptions. "Ebola prevention methods at border checkpoints will almost certainly slow gold exports as the Ugandan government and the World Health Organization introduce measures to limit the spread," Ellis says. "A combination of lengthier processes, such as heat signature mapping, and less time-consuming methods, such as hand washing, will result in tailbacks at border crossings."

The risk assessment specialist notes that, in its current form, the Ebola epidemic won't impact the nation's cobalt production, as the distance from the Katanga region largely prevents its spread. Ellis bases his predictions on the DRC's low-risk score achieved in Verisk Maplecroft's Pandemic Transmission Index, which measures the likelihood of pandemic spread relative to connectivity, including travel infrastructure.

Worse before it gets better
------------------------
The consultancy's outlook is not encouraging, as it expects health workers to continue to struggle to track contacts with Ebola patients, which makes it hard to stop the virus from spreading across the eastern provinces. This past week saw 58 new cases, the highest number in a week this [year 2019], according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC).

"We are already almost 7 months into this outbreak and at this stage we should be seeing the case rate declining, not on the rise," Tariq Riebl, IRC's Emergency Response Director in the DRC, told Time Magazine. "With an optimistic outlook this outbreak is predicted to last another 6 months -- but realistically we could be looking towards another year of fighting this disease," Riebl said.
