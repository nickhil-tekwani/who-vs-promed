Thiomersal content of vaccines and autism 20010528.1037
Date: Tue 29 May 2001
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

The news article posted in the ProMED-mail posting referenced above from
Mon 28 May 2001 strongly suggests that there has been a real association
between vaccines containing thimerosal [thiomersal is still the preferred
spelling in Europe - Mod.CP and the increased occurrence of autism in
children having received these vaccines. The Sunday Times article mentioned
that, in May 2000, a scientist [from the centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) "found the screening analysis suggests "statistically
significant associations" between certain neurological developmental
disorders -- such as attention deficit disorder, and speech and language
disorders -- and exposure to mercury from thiomersal-containing vaccines
before the age of 6 months."
As the United Kingdom (UK) has been a hotspot for anti-vaccination
movements, this article in the Sunday Times deserves further scrutiny and
comment on its conclusions about the available knowledge to date on the
issue of autism as a result of vaccination and of the health impact of
thimerosal used as a preservatives in vaccines given to children.
ProMED-mail readers should be aware that such articles as the one reported
have been used by anti-vaccination groups to discourage parents from having
their children vaccinated. In the late 1970s and early 1980s in the UK this
led to significant drops in the coverage of pertussis-containing vaccines
and a resultant resurgence of whooping cough that was associated with more
than 200 deaths, a number far higher than could have been attributed to
adverse reactions to the vaccine. (See for review: Gangarosa EJ, Galazka
AM, Wolfe CR, Phillips LM, Gangarosa RE, Miller E et al. Impact of
anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story, Lancet 1998;
351: 356-61 <http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/research/lancet.htm>).
Vaccinations and autism
-----------------------
See web links on the CDC National Immunization Program website
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/issues/autism/default.htm>, whose summary states:
"The weight of currently available scientific evidence does not support the
hypothesis that vaccines cause autism. We recognize there is considerable
public interest in this issue, and therefore support additional research
regarding this hypothesis. CDC is committed to maintaining the safest, most
effective vaccine supply in history". This webpage provides links to
numerous references supporting the above summary statement.
Thimerosal preservatives in vaccines
------------------------------------
Another series of web links on CDC's National Immunization Program website
deals with the issue of thimerosal in vaccines, current knowledge, and
recommendations
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/thimerosal/default.htm>.
The summary update (as of 22 June 2000) on thimerosal states: "The AAFP
[American Academy of Family Practice, AAP [American Academy of
Pediatrics, ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the
PHS [Public Health Service reaffirm the goal set in July 1999 to remove or
greatly reduce thimerosal from vaccines as soon as possible for the
following reasons: 1) the removal or substantial reduction of thimerosal
from vaccines is feasible, 2) the progress in removal made to date is
substantial, 3) the collaboration of the Food and Drug Administration and
the vaccine manufacturers in removing thimerosal is ongoing, and 4) the
public concern about the use of mercury of any sort remains high. Based on
information from the FDA and manufacturers, the PHS projects that the
United States will complete its transition to a secure routine pediatric
vaccine supply free of thimerosal as a preservative (ie, at least 2 vaccine
products each for hepatitis B, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib)
vaccine and the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP)) by the
first quarter of 2001.
"The use of any Hib or DTaP vaccine should continue according to the
currently recommended schedule. The risk of not vaccinating children on
time with DTaP to protect them against pertussis or with any remaining Hib
vaccine is believed to far outweigh the risk, if any, of exposure to
thimerosal containing DTaP and Hib vaccines which are still available or
still being produced. Any new information from ongoing investigations will
be monitored carefully by the PHS to determine if any change in this
assessment and in existing recommendations is warranted."
The Joint Statement of the AAFP, AAP, ACIP and United States PHS on the
progress being made in achieving the national goal (declared in July 1999)
to remove thimerosal from vaccines, and the results of studies to better
assess any potential relationship between exposure to mercury in thimerosal
containing vaccines and health effects, can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/thimerosal/joint_statement_00.htm>.
This statement was issued in June 2000 and followed a joint statement made
in July 1999. In the June 2000 statement there is a review of studies to
date looking for possible associations between receipt of
thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurological disorders (including
autism). The joint statement mentions that "an inconclusive correlation
(ie, one that is inadequate to support or refute a causal link) was
observed between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and 5 of the 17
ICD-9 [International classification of disease, 9th edition codes,
including language delays, speech delays, attention deficit disorder,
unspecified developmental delays and tics" and recommends additional
studies. The conclusion in the joint statement was: "The AAFP, AAP, ACIP,
and the PS recommend continuation of the current policy of moving rapidly
to vaccines which are free of thimerosal as a preservative. Until an
adequate supply of each vaccine is available, use of vaccines which contain
thimerosal as a preservative is acceptable".
There is also a link to an MMWR article in which the recommendation to
remove thimerosal from the childhood vaccines, hepatitis B vaccine, Hib
vaccine, and the DTaP vaccine was made (MMWR 1999; 48(43): 996-8.
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a4.htm>). This article
mentioned that all influenza vaccines contain thimerosal, but the
recommendation to remove thimerosal did not apply to the influenza vaccines.
Institute of Medicine review
----------------------------
The Sunday Times article referred to a forthcoming Institute of Medicine
(IOM) meeting to review the issue of thimerasol in vaccines. Information
about this meeting can be found at the National Academy of Medicine, IOM
webpage:
<http://www4.nationalacademies.org/IOM/iomhome.nsf/18ace18eb695f74c85256691007102f5/9bbce954efa52ff885256a170062be72?OpenDocument>
The IOM plans an open scientific meeting (16 July 2001) to examine
thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders. This meeting is one of several
being conducted by the Immunization Safety Review Committee. Historically
there were 2 separate committee reviews of immunization safety conducted in
1991 and 1994 to assess the causal relationship between vaccines and
adverse health consequences. These committees concluded that the evidence
was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between a specific
vaccine and a putative adverse effect about two thirds of the time.
Nevertheless, controversies about the safety of vaccines, particularly
mandatory childhood vaccines, continue to concern some members of the
public, health care professionals, the public health community, the media,
Congress, vaccine manufacturers, and federal agencies. In response to these
concerns, CDC and the National Institutes of Health asked the IOM to
establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about
existing and emerging immunization safety concerns.
The committee is to meet 3 times per year over the 3 years of its study to
address various vaccine safety concerns. There was a meeting in April 2001
that rejected the hypothesis of a link between MMR vaccine and autism. The
meeting scheduled for July 2001 is to review the hypothesis of a link
between thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. The choice
of topic is not to affirm a linkage, but rather to address a widely
publicized concern.
