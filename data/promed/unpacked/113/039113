Human:
During week 31, 10 West Nile virus (WNV) cases of human illness were
reported in Nova Scotia (1), Quebec (1), Ontario (4), Manitoba (2),
Saskatchewan (1), and Alberta (1).
As of 6 Aug 2005, a total of 11 human WNV cases have been reported to the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Of the 11 cases, 9 were clinical
cases and 2 were asymptomatic. Of the 9 clinical cases, 3 (33 percent) were
reported as West Nile Neurological Syndrome, 5 (56 percent) were reported
as West Nile Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 1 (11 percent) was Other
Clinical / Unspecified. The case in Nova Scotia is
travel-related (see human table).
Bird:
Over the one-week period from July 31 to August 6, 9 new health units
[Ontario (6) and Quebec (3)] reported dead birds positive for WNV. Of the
212 dead birds tested, 41 (19 percent) were reported positive for WNV
within week 31 (see bird table at URL above).
To date, positive dead birds have been reported in 22 health units in
Ontario (Algoma, Chatham-Kent, Huron County, Oxford County, Timiskaming,
York Regional, Halton, Hastings -Prince Edward, Lambton, Middlesex-London,
North Bay, Northwestern, City of Ottawa, Peterborough, Thunder Bay,
Toronto, Brant, Eastern Ontario, Hamilton-Wentworth, Peel, Simcoe, and
Waterloo), 8 health regions in Manitoba (Winnipeg, North Eastman,
Interlake, Brandon, Central, Assiniboine, South Eastman, and Parkland), 4
health regions in Quebec (Laval, Mauricie et Centre-du-Quebec, Monteregie,
and Laurentides) and one health region in Saskatchewan (Regina Qu'Appelle).
A total of 2696 dead birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 104
(3.9 percent) were positive for WNV. 90 of the 104 positive birds were
American Crows.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 31, no WNV positive domestic animals have been reported to the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).
Mosquito:
As of week 31, mosquito pools positive for WNV have been reported in
Manitoba (50), Ontario (23), Saskatchewan (21) and Quebec (1). National
West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis. Click here for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click here for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC- These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 and 16 Aug 2005
that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2005 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 333 cases, 131 (39 percent) were reported as West Nile meningitis or
encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 180 (54 percent) were reported as
West Nile fever (milder disease), and 22 (7 percent) were clinically
unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health department web sites
for further details regarding state case totals.

[The previous posting (20050809.2323) implied that a slow-to-start season
might entail immediate and/or surge of cases. During the past week, the
total cumulative cases suddenly jumped from 187 to 333. There was an
increase of 146 cases (over 78 percent) in just 7 days. So, the prediction
was pretty accurate. -Mod.RY]
