Two male patients from Lihir Island, [Papua New Guinea] PNG have been diagnosed with chikungunya [virus] infections. Serum samples collected in January 2013 were positive by chikungunya TaqMan real-time RT-PCR and negative for chikungunya serology.

Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetics revealed 99.8 per cent homology with previous Thailand 2009 sequences and clustering in the Mauritius clade within the Central/East/South African Genotype. Both E1 gene amino acid mutations implicated in Mauritius 2005 sequences (A226V and D248E) were present in the PNG derivatives. Virus was successfully isolated from one of the patients. This latest outbreak on Lihir Island follows the 1st reported cases of chikungunya in PNG, which occurred in 2012 in and around Vanimo (West Sepik district).

A 3rd female patient returning to Australia from Bali was also diagnosed with chikungunya [virus] infection via TaqMan real-time RT-PCR and serology. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetics revealed 99.4 per cent homology with a previous New Caledonian 2011 sequence in the Asian Genotype. The 2013 Bali sequence was also 98.4 per cent and 98.2 per cent homologous with previous Timor-Leste 2010 and Bali 2011 sequences respectively.

[There was a significant chikungunya virus outbreak on the main island of Papua New Guinea last year (2012). From June-October, a total of 633 patients suspected of having symptoms of chikungunya were reported from Vanimo hospital. The outbreak was localized to the town vicinity and its satellite communities (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121010.1335814). The current report is from a different PNG locality.

Bali has had sporadic outbreaks as well. Interestingly, a traveler acquired a chikungunya virus infection in Bali in December 2012 and became ill on returning home in Germany (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130227.1562598). In that case, as with the cases above from PNG, serological tests for chikungunya virus antibody were negative but PCR results were positive. The sequencing and phylogenetic studies of the PNG and Bali viruses depict an interesting story of their relationships to other chikungunya viruses that have been circulating in the Indian Ocean islands, SE Asia, and the Pacific islands in recent years.
