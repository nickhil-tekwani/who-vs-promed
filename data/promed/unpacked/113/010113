The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [5 Feb 2008] issued a
letter to seafood processors, advising them of recent illnesses
linked to consuming fish carrying the ciguatera toxin, which has led
to cases of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) in consumers. The toxic
fish were harvested in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, near the Flower
Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, which is located in federal
waters south of the Texas-Louisiana coastline.

FDA had considered CFP from fish in this geographical area extremely
rare until recently, when several outbreaks were confirmed in
Washington, DC, and St. Louis, Missouri. The illnesses were linked to
fish caught near the marine sanctuary. FDA now considers CFP to be a
food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to occur in grouper,
snapper, and hogfish captured within 10 miles (16 km) of the marine
sanctuary and amberjack, barracuda, and other wide-ranging species
captured within 50 miles (80 km) of the sanctuary.

FDA's letter urges seafood processors who purchase reef fish and
other potentially ciguatoxic fish directly from fishermen to reassess
their current hazard analyses and update their Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans as necessary. FDA's seafood
HACCP regulation requires processors to have and implement written
plans to control food safety hazards. This updated information
differs from what is currently listed in FDA's Fish & Fisheries
Products Hazards & Controls Guidance, 3rd Edition.

Ciguatera poisoning is caused by the consumption of tropical reef
fish that have assimilated ciguatoxins through the marine food chain
from toxic microscopic algae. The toxins that cause ciguatera cannot
be destroyed by cooking or freezing, and toxic fish do not look or
taste differently from nontoxic fish. The only way to detect CFP is
through laboratory testing.

Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting; diarrhea;
numbness and tingling of the mouth, hands or feet; joint pain; muscle
pain; headache; reversal of hot and cold sensation (such that cold
objects feel hot and vice versa); sensitivity to temperature changes;
vertigo, and muscular weakness. There also can be cardiovascular
problems, including irregular heartbeat and reduced blood pressure.
Symptoms usually appear within hours after eating a toxic fish and go
away within a few weeks. However, in some cases, neurological
symptoms can last for months to years. There is no antidote for CFP;
symptoms can be treated most effectively if diagnosed by a doctor
with 72 hours. CFP is rarely fatal.

If you think you may have ciguatera poisoning, report your symptoms
and what fish you ate to your doctor, local emergency room, or health
department. If possible, save meal remnants. For more information on
the treatment of ciguatera poisoning, contact the National Poison
Control Center at (800) 222-1222.

FDA will continue to monitor the presence of ciguatera in the
Northern Gulf of Mexico and the application of seafood HACCP controls
by seafood processors. Failure to meet the requirements of the HACCP
regulation may result in enforcement actions by the agency.

FDA's letter to industry
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/haccp4f2.html> is part of the
agency's efforts to take preventive steps to minimize the risk of
foodborne illnesses. Prevention is the cornerstone of the FDA's new
Food Protection Plan, launched in November 2007. The plan combines
science and a risk-based approach of prevention, intervention, and
response to ensure the safety of domestic as well as imported foods
eaten by American consumers.

[Background information on ciguatera poisoning can be found at the
FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition website
(<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap36.html>):

"Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of
subtropical and tropical marine finfish which have accumulated
naturally-occurring toxins through their diet. The toxins are known
to originate from several dinoflagellate (algae) species that are
common to ciguatera endemic regions in the lower latitudes.

"Manifestations of ciguatera in humans usually involve a combination
of gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders.
Symptoms defined within these general categories vary with the
geographic origin of toxic fish.

"Clinical testing procedures are not presently available for the
diagnosis of ciguatera in humans. Diagnosis is based entirely on
symptomatology and recent dietary history. An enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) designed to detect toxic fish in field situations is under
evaluation by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)
and may provide some measure of protection to the public in the future.

"Marine finfish most commonly implicated in ciguatera fish poisoning
include the groupers, barracudas, snappers, jacks, mackerel, and
triggerfish. Many other species of warm-water fishes harbor ciguatera
toxins. The occurrence of toxic fish is sporadic, and not all fish of
a given species or from a given locality will be toxic." - Mod.TG
