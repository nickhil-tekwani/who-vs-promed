Egyptian child contracts bird flu
---------------------------------
A 6-year-old Egyptian boy has contracted the highly pathogenic bird
flu virus, the 6th case in a month in the most populous Arab country,
state news agency MENA said on Sunday [5 Apr 2009]. MENA stated the
boy resided in the Nile Delta province of Qalyubia. His case brings
to 63 the number of confirmed cases of the H5N1 avian flu virus in
Egypt, which has been hit harder by bird flu than any other country
outside of Asia.

Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine said the boy started
suffering symptoms 2 weeks ago and was admitted to hospital a week
later, where he was treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu. The boy
is in a critical condition and is breathing with the id of an
artificial respirator, MENA said.

On Friday [3 Apr 2009], Egypt reported a 21-month-old boy had
contracted bird flu. Since 2003 the H5N1 avian influenza virus has
infected at least 410 people in 15 countries and killed 254 of them.
It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in
61 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

Some 23 Egyptians have died after contracting the virus, most after
coming into contact with infected domestic birds in a country where
roughly 5 million households depend on domestically raised poultry as
a significant source of food and income. While H5N1 rarely infects
people, experts say they fear it could mutate into a form that people
could easily pass to one another, sparking a pandemic that could kill
millions.

H5N1 human infection no. 63
---------------------------
Today [5 Apr 2009] the Ministry of Health announced a 6-year-old boy
as the H5N1 human infection no. 63. The boy is from Shubra El-Khemia,
Qalyubia. The boy began to have the symptoms on 22 Mar 2009 and he
entered Ain Shams hospital in Cairo on 28 Mar 2009. He was given
Tamiflu.

It is worth to mention that Qalyubia Governorate was the [principal]
Governorate for poultry raising industry in Egypt, it was a multi
billion industry there before being hit by the epidemic.

[Like the 2 preceding cases reported in the past week, the victim is
a young child. In Egypt in recent weeks those affected have been
predominantly children and women, a reflection of their relatively
greater exposure to diseased poultry.
