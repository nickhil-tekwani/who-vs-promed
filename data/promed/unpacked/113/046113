At least 1026 pigs and piglets have died and 3639 others [are] affected in Mizoram due to the outbreak of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and Classical Swine Flu [Fever?] since March this year [2018], officials said on [Sun 6 May 2018].

This is the 3rd time Mizoram is witnessing an outbreak of PRRS. The disease had hit the State in 2013 and 2016.

Officials of State Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department said that the PRRS outbreak was confirmed to be originated from Zokhawthar village in Champhai district along the Mizoram-Myanmar border on [17 Mar 2018]. Of the blood samples of 12 pigs taken from the village, 11 were tested positive and confirmed for PRRS at Disease Investigation Laboratory in Aizawl on [21 Mar 2018], the officials said.

The PRRS virus has also spread to more than 91 villages. While the outbreak of swine diseases has affected almost all the 8 districts of the State, it was mainly concentrated in Aizawl, Serchhip and Champhai districts, the officials said.

"Reports about the death of at least 1026 pigs and piglets have been received from different districts since March [2018]," Dr. Hmarkunga, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department said, adding that the deaths of the pigs were not caused by PRRS alone, but also by Classical Swine Fever (CSF). He said teams of veterinary doctors were sent to the affected areas to take stock of the situation. Dr. Hmarkunga added that at least 245 blood samples have been tested so far of which 133 were identified to be infected with PRRS and 90 others with CSF.

District Magistrates of Lunglei and Champhai had earlier issued an order banning import of pigs and piglets from Myanmar and other neighbouring states and inter-village movement of pigs.

Meanwhile, an official statement said that experts from the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal visited Serchhip town and examined pigs there during [20-23 Apr 2018].

On [3 May 2018], 2 scientists from North Eastern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NERDDL), Guwahati also came to Aizawl and imparted training to field officers of State Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department, the statement added.

[Mizoram, a state in north eastern India, borders several Indian sister-states as well as the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar. See map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizoram#/media/File:IN-MZ.svg.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), an OIE-reportable disease, is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory disease in pigs. Initially recognised in 1987 in the United States of America, in 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in Germany, it has since become a pandemic. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. Apart from domestic pigs, feral swine and wild boars, no other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV. The virus does not pose a zoonotic risk and it is not infectious for humans or for cells of human origin.

For further information, please refer to the chapter 2.8.6. of OIE's Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.06_PRRS.pdf (version adopted May 2015).

CSF is regarded endemic in India (the last available information, covering January-June 2017, reports 23 new outbreaks). - Mod.AS
