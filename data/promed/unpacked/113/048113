Update on avian influenza -- 18 Nov 2004
----------------------------------------
1. Latest information on avian influenza
No outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported
in Cambodia or Malaysia during the preceding month. Given that the winter
is associated with increasing cases of influenza in northern Asia, it is
important to maintain vigilance and enhance early warning in order to
detect every additional case, to ensure effective control of outbreaks and
to minimise the risk to humans.
2. Country information
Thailand:
Since 3 Jul 2004, H5N1 HPAI infection has been confirmed in 57 provinces
and more than 1 million birds have died or been culled in response. As at 9
Nov 2004, 261 locations in 44 provinces were subjected to the 21 day
surveillance period imposed by the Department of Livestock Development
(DLD), Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. HPAI outbreaks were
confirmed in 117 districts in the week of 8 Nov 2004, and 37 in the week of
15 Nov 2004, resulted in culling of 87 385 and 63 378 birds, respectively.
The Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation collected
samples from 73 birds from Kamphaeng Phet, Phetchabun, Suphan Buri, and
Prachin Buri Provinces in the period 6-10 Oct 2004 and sent them for
testing at the Mahidol University laboratory and the National Institution
for Animal Health. All of the samples tested negative for the HPAI H5N1
strain. The birds that were collected for testing include pigeons, the
Asian open-bill, the common mynah, the red-throated fly catcher, the zebra
dove, and the dark-necked tailor bird.
On 18 Oct 2004, 2 crested hawk eagles were discovered at Brussels
International Airport in the luggage of a Thai man who was attempting to
smuggle them into Belgium. The 2 small eagles were confirmed to be infected
with H5N1.
In early November, birds were observed falling from the sky in Mae Hong
Son. The bodies of the fallen birds were sent to a laboratory for testing
on 5 Nov 2004. [Results and bird species will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
At Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Chonburi province, since 14 Sep 2004, a total of
147 of 441 tigers have died or been culled due to infection with H5N1 HPAI.
Viet Nam:
Since the end of June, avian influenza has been confirmed in 14 provinces,
and 46 984 birds have died or been culled. The case in chickens in Soc
Trang Province on 1 Oct 2004 was confirmed to be avian influenza H5 (no N
type reported to date). The most recent confirmed H5 infection was reported
on 11 Oct 2004 in a chicken farm in Tan My Chanh, My Tho Provincial City,
Tien Giang Province with 1200 deaths out of total 3000 chickens. A new case
was suspected in mid-November in Can Tho City, Binh Thuy District in 20
chickens raised by a household, the flock has been culled. [See further in
item 2].
Indonesia:
In September 2004, H5N1 HPAI was confirmed in Grobogan District, Central
Java province where 300 of 1500 chickens died.
Hong Kong SAR:
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) confirmed
that a grey heron found dead in Lok Ma Chau area was positive for H5N1
virus on 3 Nov 2004. The bird was found by a worker at a construction site
within the restricted area near the border, and was handed to AFCD for
diagnostic testing on 1 Nov 2004.

Vietnam detects new bird flu infections
---------------------------------------
Vietnam has recently detected a small number of chickens being infected
with bird flu virus strain of H5, and remained highly alert for potential
new outbreaks in winter when weather conditions favor the development of
viruses.
20 chickens raised by a household in Binh Thuy district in the southern
city of Can Tho were found to have been affected by H5 in mid-November, all
of them were already killed, local newspaper Liberation Saigon on Thursday
[18 Nov 2004] quoted the country's Department of Animal Health as saying.
To prevent new outbreaks, Vietnam is intensifying anti bird- flu activities
such as frequently disinfecting farms, monitoring the transport and
[control on] import of fowls and their eggs via border gates, and raising
public awareness of the disease nationwide, especially in the southern
Mekong Delta. It plans to vaccinate poultry if large-scale bird flu
resurgence is reported.
In a press briefing held in September 2004, the department said that after
having reappeared in 11 southern localities since June 2004, bird flu [was]
no longer active there.
In late March 2004, Vietnam declared an end to bird flu that had killed 17
percent of its poultry population and claimed 16 human lives during the
previous outbreak starting in December 2003. A total of 43.2 million fowls
nationwide either died or were killed, causing direct losses of 1.3
trillion Vietnamese dong (82.8 million US dollars) to the local poultry
industry.

[Avian influenza virus continues to circulate in south east Asia and
probably will not be eradicated in the near future. During the cooler
months, when temperatures become optimal for virus survival, a further
spread might be anticipated. Viet Nam's alleged plan to vaccinate poultry
if large-scale bird flu resurgence is reported makes sense. At present,
only China and Indonesia officially apply vaccinations, albeit not on a
country-wide levels. According to the media, unofficial (thus unauthorised
and uncontrolled) vaccinations have been carried out by poultry growers in
Thailand on an unknown scale, and probably also in other countries in the
region. Animal vaccines should be produced, tested and certified by the
competent authorities, according to the requirements specified in OIE's
manual for diagnostic tests and vaccines, specifically relating to HPAI;
