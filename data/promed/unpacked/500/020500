An outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), a viral infection transmitted
by mosquitoes, has been reported for the first time in New York City. Of
the 9 cases confirmed by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control
(CDC) laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, 3 have died. Another 48 cases
await laboratory confirmation.
Mosquito control measures, including spraying of affected areas (mainly
Queens and south and east Bronx), are being carried out and may be extended
to cover the entire city. Active surveillance for human cases and
mosquitoes is ongoing.

I have been most interested in the recent news concerning the St. Louis
encephalitis (SLE) outbreak in New York City. I have yet to hear any
comments or references to the role underground storm drains and/or sewers
may be playing in the production of _Culex pipiens_. Does anyone have any
information as to whether these underground systems have been surveyed? And
if so, is it possible that these systems could be the source of these
mosquitoes?
The underground systems are one of the major sources of mosquitoes
associated with SLE outbreaks in Houston and other areas of the South. We
get a lot of production from these sources in our district, and have an
ongoing surveillance and control mechanism for them. Large numbers of
_Culex_ can be produced from these areas, particularly during dry or
drought like conditions when flushing from routine rains does not occur.
These areas also serve as a major daytime resting area for _Culex_
mosquitoes.
I am also curious as to the timing of treatments. As a director of a
mosquito control operation in Louisiana, I would not be getting very good
control of _Culex_ by starting treatments at 5pm. Is the activity period
for _Culex_ in the Northeast earlier? Activity here begins right at dusk,
which is currently about 7:30pm.

[Bob Novak, Illinois Natural History Survey, and Paul Grimstad, University
of Notre Dame, have asked many of the same questions. ProMED usually
reports only arboviral outbreaks but does not pass on details of control.
However, as these questions are fundamental to the apparently burgeoning
epidemic spread of SLE virus in NY city, they are included here. If anyone
has specific details regarding these resting sites in NY City, please let
us know. Based on past history, we likely will not receive any details
from the CDC regarding the on-going cluster/outbreak. Their style, of
course, and their business. However, there should be nothing to keep NY
City or NY State officials from letting us in on some of the details. The
closed circle of NY-CDC seems a bit small to me. - Mod.CHC

For the past several years, I have been telling my microbiology students
that there are too many mosquitoes in the United States biting people for
there NOT to be some kind of outbreak waiting to happen. Well, thanks to
New York City, it finally did.
Is anyone yet asking whether SLE virus will overwinter in NY City? Any
prophylactic measures being considered for next spring yet?

[It seems a bit early for such musings. The first order of business is to
bring the outbreak to closure. Bill Reeves and co-workers in California
and Joel Dalrymple and co-workers in Maryland isolated SLE virus from birds
and overwintering mosquitoes, respectively. Could be a bit of a cluster of
cases in the spring or none at all, or such mosquitoes could serve as
reservoirs for an epidemic next year. Meanwhile it is still warm in the
New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area. - Mod.CHC
