The German government ordered farmers to keep their poultry indoors
beginning 1 Mar 2006 to help counter the threat of avian influenza,
Agriculture and Consumer Protection Minister Horst Seehofer said.
"We are supplementing the wide-reaching measures which have already
been taken over the past couple of months against bird flu", Seehofer
told reporters at a news conference in Berlin today. "We will not
allow any gaps to appear in protecting poultry from the disease."

[Similar measures might be expected in other European countries. In
the Netherlands, where regulations prescribing indoor keeping of
poultry prevailed since autumn 2005, the requirement has been
withdrawn since 1 Jan 2006 "in view of the termination of the
wild-bird migration period and the results of EU survey in wild
birds". Its renewal will be considered in view of the evolving situation.

A Commission proposal to extend requirements for the on-going
surveillance of wild birds and poultry for avian influenza until 31
Dec 2006 was backed by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and
Animal Health (SCFCAH) today. The Commission will provide up to 2
million Euros (2.4 million USD) in co-funding for laboratory tests
carried out on poultry and wild birds for avian influenza. Member
States must submit their national surveillance programmes to the
Commission for approval by 7 Feb 2006, after which the allocation of
funds will be agreed. The Commission already provided 884 000 Euro (1
063 055 USD) towards the costs of surveillance programmes from July
2005 to the end of January 2006, and this next phase of funding will
cover the period from the start of February to the end of December
2006. Today's Decision provides some guidance for Member States in
drawing up their surveillance plans, including requirements for
laboratory testing and procedures for the sampling and testing of
birds. The Commission upgraded the surveillance measures already in
place last October.
Around 25 000 wild birds have been tested for avian influenza in the
EU since [October 2005]. All samples to date have tested negative for
the Asian strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

Household poultry-keeping is set to be banned to reduce the risk of a
bird flu outbreak in Hong Kong, Secretary for Health, Welfare & Food
Dr York Chow says.
The move comes in the wake of the identification of the H5N1 virus in
a smuggled chicken kept at a domestic household, and increasing
incidents of avian influenza outbreaks on the Mainland and elsewhere.
"Given the public health concerns, we are drafting legislation to ban
household poultry-keeping. Such stringent measures are well
justified," Dr Chow said.
Under the legislative amendment, the existing exemption for
households keeping up to 20 poultry will be removed. The unauthorised
keeping of poultry will be an offence warranting fines of up to 100
000 HK Dollars (12 890 USD).
Dr Chow urged the public to surrender their backyard poultry to the
Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department to protect their own
and public health. Those who want to keep birds before the new
legislation comes into effect must have them vaccinated against avian flu.
The Customs & Excise Department has stepped up patrols at the
boundary to prevent the inflow of smuggled chickens.
The separation of chickens and humans must be enforced and the
Government has to consider whether it is necessary to set a date for
the central slaughtering, Dr Chow added.
