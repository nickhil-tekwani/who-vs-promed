No doubt the dinner party of 35 at Wagga Wagga had looked forward to
the fried ice cream dessert, until the raw egg batter gave them all
food poisoning and the host was left with egg on her face. Now NSW
[New South Wales] Health and the NSW Food Authority have the
difficult task of trying to track down the poultry culprits, possibly
from a large Victorian producer, and are investigating whether the
incident and 3 others in Sydney affecting 25 more people are all linked.

"In terms of cases of salmonella from home preparation using raw
eggs, we've had 4 times the year's average in the past 6 weeks,"
Peter Sutherland, director of food safety programs at the NSW Food
Authority, said yesterday [26 Dec 2007].

The investigation comes as the authority hopes to introduce
regulations in 2008 making NSW the 2nd state, after Queensland,
requiring individuals eggs to be stamped so they can be easily traced
to their farms, thus making producers more accountable for quality.

Mr. Sutherland said the other salmonella poisoning cases were: 11
people who fell ill from eating Caesar salad made with raw egg
dressing at a dinner party at a Carlingford home; 3 children sick
from drinking an eggnog at home in Thornleigh; and, most recently, a
cafe in Auburn where 11 people had food poisoning after apparently
eating cheesecake.

The investigation includes DNA testing on stool samples taken by GPs
of some of the sick people to determine whether they fell ill from
the same strain of salmonella. "It's strictly hypothetical but this
batch of eggs may have come from a producer in Victoria," a NSW Food
Authority spokesman said.

Most major producers get their eggs from a large number of farms. The
authority has been working on its new regulation for the past 8
months, which will also make it mandatory for transporters and
retailers to refrigerate eggs, and hopes to take it to the NSW
Primary Industries Minister, Ian MacDonald, for approval early in
2008, the spokesman said.

The NSW Food Authority Director-General, George Davey, urged
consumers to always cook eggs and store them in a refrigerator and to
not use cracked or dirty eggs.
