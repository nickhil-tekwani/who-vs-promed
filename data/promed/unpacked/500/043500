Jiggers blamed for epidemic which has killed at least 20
--------------------------------------------------------
A disease whose progression and symptoms seem straight out of a
horror movie but which can be treated has killed at least 20 Ugandans
and sickened more than 20 000 in just 2 months.

Jiggers [also called chiggers], small insects which look like fleas,
are the culprits in the epidemic which causes parts of the body to
rot. They often enter through the feet. Once inside a person's body,
they suck the blood, grow and breed, multiplying by the hundreds.
Affected body parts -- buttocks, lips, even eyelids -- rot away.

James Kakooza, Uganda's minister of state for primary health care,
said jiggers can easily kill young children by sucking their blood
and can cause early deaths in grown-ups who have other diseases. Most
of those infected, especially the elderly, cannot walk or work.

"It is an epidemic which we are fighting against and I am sure over
time we will eradicate the jiggers," Kakooza said. The insects breed
in dirty, dusty places. The medical name for the parasitic disease is
tungiasis, which is caused by the female fly burrowing into the skin.

It exists in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, besides
sub-Saharan Africa. Kakooza said health workers are telling residents
of the 12 affected districts in Uganda that jiggers thrive amid poor
hygienic conditions.

"We are also telling them to use medicated soap. They can apply
petrol and paraffin in places infested by jiggers and they die," Kakooza said.

The most affected part of Uganda is the Busoga region in the east,
150 kilometers (90 miles) from Kampala, Uganda's capital. Some cases
have been reported in the central region, less that 70 kilometers (43
miles) from the city, which has led to fears the whole country might
be affected.

Some think jiggers -- whose scientific name is Tunga penetrans --
were brought to Uganda and other east African countries by migrants
from India who constructed the railway from Mombasa, the Kenyan
seaport, to Kampala in the 19th century. Others say they came to
Africa aboard a British ship that sailed from Brazil.

Over time locals were affected. One observer near the turn of the
century called jiggers "the most fearful calamity that has ever
afflicted the East African peoples" after seeing affected people on
the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro crawling around on all fours and
groaning with pain.

Colonial governments brought it under control but jiggers have since
re-emerged where hygiene is poor. Some affected people in rural
Uganda, think they are bewitched and simply wait to die instead of
trying to remove the insects. "For the last 3 years I have been
suffering from jiggers," [a] 60-year-old said. "I lost 2 children
killed by jiggers.They were sent to me by my neighbor who wants to
grab my piece of land."

"It is common to find graves of whole families wiped away by
jiggers," said Simon Wanjala, a ministry of health official in eastern Uganda.

Uganda's government has allocated one million US dollars to fight the
epidemic. Treatment involves removal of the insect or topical
medication. A study a few years ago in Nigeria concluded that raising
pigs, having sand or clay floors inside the home and having a resting
place outside the house increased the risk of getting jiggers.
Wearing closed shoes and using insecticides indoors helps prevent infestations.

[Tunga penetrans is not a fly as stated above but a flea, which
burrows into the skin, grows, discharges its eggs and dies. The eggs
once on the ground develop into new fleas. The flea lives in soil and
feeds on warm-blooded hosts including humans. Tunga penetrans
infestation may cause secondary infection around the flea with much
local irritation, but multiple fatalities as described above are
highly unusual. One complication may be tetanus in persons who never
received a tetanus immunization. ProMED would be happy to post
further detail of this outbreak. - Mod.EP]

[According to wikipedia, the Busoga region is a kingdom of the
Busoga/Soga people in the eastern region of the country. The capital
of this region is Bugembe, near Jinja, the 2nd largest city in Uganda
(see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busoga>). For a map of Uganda
