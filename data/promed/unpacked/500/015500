With more than 600 cases being reported from Bhatu Kalan, Ratia and Tohana
areas of the district, a malaria epidemic is under way. Stagnant water at
several places, mostly in the rural areas after heavy rains and floods, is
being blamed for the outbreak. The actual number of cases may be higher,
however, as many patients are being treated in private hospitals and clinics.

The health department has started measures to create awareness among the
people. "The most number of cases have been reported from Bhattu Kalan. We
have managed to contain the spread of malaria in other parts of the state,"
said Dr Narbir Singh, director general, Health Services (DGHS), Haryana.

Besides malaria, as many as 237 cases of dengue, 348 cases of Japanese
encephalitis and 127 cases of swine flu have been reported from various
parts of the state, mostly from Gurgaon and Faridabad districts.
