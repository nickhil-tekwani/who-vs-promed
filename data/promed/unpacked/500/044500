3 cases of trichinellosis from consumption of local pork
-----------------------------------------------
For the first time during last 3 years, cases of trichinellosis have been
found in the Kabardino-Balkaria district. The patients were 3 local
inhabitants who are now in the hospital. The 3 patients come from the same
family, and they were apparently infected via pork meat purchased on the
local market. Investigation has shown that the seller lacked the necessary
documentation to prove the meat had been tested for _Trichinella_. The last
trichinellosis cases in the area were diagnosed 3 years ago.

[_Trichinella_ infection is widespread in Russia, and the last report from
ProMED-mail of _Trichinella_ infection in Russia from pork was in 2000.
Apparently, the rules of veterinary inspection of meat were not followed in
this case. Domestic pigs can be infected from rats and mice, offal from
slaughterhouses and households, garbage, and cannibalism. - Mod.EP]
