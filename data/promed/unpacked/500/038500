Bacterial spot (_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_) of tomato and
sweet pepper in Tanzania

Bacterial spot of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) and sweet pepper
(_Capsicum annuum_) is recorded from ... eastern and southern Africa
including Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa. With the
growing importance of solanaceous cash crops in Tanzania, particularly
tomato, it was important to confirm the findings of preliminary reports of
the possible presence of the pathogen and to officially record it. It was
also desirable to assess the degree of contamination of seed, as
potentially the most significant source of inoculum. Field surveys during
the rainy seasons of 1997 and 1998 showed that bacterial spot [was ...
found in tomato and sweet pepper fields in all the mainland vegetable
regions of the northern and southern highlands but not in Zanzibar.
[Disease incidence (% symptomatic plants) in tomato fields surveyed (59 in
1997, 50 in 1998) varied from less than 5% to more than 90%.
In pepper, incidence ... [never exceeded 5% (10 fields surveyed in 1997, 3
in 1998). _X. c_. pv. _vesicatoria_ (Xcv) suspected from symptoms on tomato
and sweet pepper fruit was confirmed by isolation on semi-selective media
such as Tween B (McGuire et al., 1986) followed by biochemical tests for
_Xanthomonas_ and pathogenicity tests on tomato. Although the name _X. c_.
pv. _vesicatoria_ remains a valid taxonomic name, it has recently been
proposed for re-classification into 3 separate species (Jones et al.,
2000). However, available data for the Tanzanian isolates is not sufficient
for them to be allocated to the newly proposed taxa. In some cases,
bacterial spots masked symptoms of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_michiganensis_ also present (Black et al., 1999). For detection of Xcv in
seed, extraction methods recommended for quarantine purposes were used
(Anon., 1992). Xcv was found by dilution plating in 5 ... of 26 samples of
farmers' saved seed, was absent from 12 commercial tomato seed lots and
present in 2 ... of 3 commercial pepper seed lots sampled.

[The nomenclature of the bacterial spot pathogen is in a state of flux.
According to Solke De Boer, Centre for Animal & Plant Health, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, Charlottetown, there is some confusion and controversy
regarding bacterial names of this pathogen. As indicated in an earlier
post, the old name _X. campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_ (Xcv), is still valid.
A new name suggested by Vauterin et al. is _X. axonopodis_ pv.
_vesicatoria_ (Xav), also widely used. Another type of bacterium causing
bacterial spot of pepper has arisen and differs from Xav in being
nonamylolytic. This bacterium has been referred to as _X. campestris_ pv.
_vesicatoria_ type B, but Vauterin et al. regard it as a new species, _X.
vesicatoria_.
