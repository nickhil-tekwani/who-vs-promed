Despite efforts made by the Nigerian medical authorities to control the
spread of cholera and reduce the death toll, Jigawa state in northern
Nigeria has recorded more deaths from the cholera epidemic in the past few
months. The Jigawa State commissioner for Health, Alhaji Ibrahim Nashabaru,
told journalists on Thu 9 Sep 2010, in Dutse that the number of deaths had
risen from 5 to 20.

According to the commissioner, many of the victims died in their homes and
that most of the diagnosed cases were treated free at the hospitals.
Nashabaru said that health workers in the ministry had been on the ground
in villages to educate people on how to maintain personal and environmental
hygiene to control the epidemic.

[3] Cholera - China (Jiangsu)

Nearly 20 middle school students have been diagnosed with cholera in
eastern China, the government has said, in the 2nd outbreak of the
potentially fatal disease in the nation in a month.

A total of 19 cases have been detected at a school in Huaian city in
Jiangsu province, prompting health authorities to issue a warning for the
region and urge increased disease monitoring, the Jiangsu government said
Thu 9 Sep 2010.

The students began falling ill on 2 Sep 2010, displaying common symptoms
including fever, abdominal pain, and serious diarrhea and vomiting, it said
in a statement. The city is on the border with Anhui province, where
authorities covered up a cholera outbreak for 12 days last month [August
2010] out of fears that publicising it would shock the local population,
state media said earlier this week.

The Anhui health department acknowledged Tue 7 Sep 2010 that at least 38
people in the province had been sickened with cholera since 16 Aug 2010,
with all patients already out of hospital and no new cases discovered in
September 2010.

It was not immediately clear if the strain of cholera found in Anhui was
the same as the one detected in Huaian. No fatalities have been reported in
either outbreak.

China's Ministry of Health on Friday [10 Sep 2010] reported nearly 1600
deaths from infectious diseases on the mainland in August 2010. Some 590
000 infections were registered in August 2010, including 63 cholera
infections, according to a statement released by the ministry. However, no
deaths from cholera were reported in August 2010, the statement said.

Among the 63 cholera infections, 38 were in Mengcheng County in eastern
Anhui Province. Local residents blamed poor hygiene awareness and street
food stalls for the outbreak.

Local health authorities also said Fri 10 Sep 2010, that 19 high school
students were sick after the latest cholera outbreak in Huaian, eastern
Jiangsu Province. Authorities are working to trace the source of the epidemic.
