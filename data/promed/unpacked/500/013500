Today [29 Oct 2015], the Orange County [California] Mosquito and Vector Control District (OCMVCD) informed city officials that invasive mosquitoes have been found in Garden Grove. The species (_Aedes aegypti_) is a small, black mosquito with white stripes, capable of transmitting West Nile virus as well as other diseases. [More important than West Nile virus is its ability to transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses. - Mod.TY] A public health warning of the existence of the invasive mosquitoes, including facts about the species, is being distributed to local residents.

The discovery occurred as a result of a service request to the OCMVCD that Garden Grove residents had experienced bites to their legs from aggressive mosquitoes. A thorough investigation by the OCMVCD was conducted, and the presence of the invasive mosquito was confirmed.

OCMVCD personnel have been deployed to areas of the city to conduct neighborhood inspections of properties for mosquito breeding and standing water in the surrounding area. OCMVCD staff are also informing nearby residents of the discovery of the invasive species and asking them to report additional sightings and mosquito bites.

[_Aedes aegypti_ continues to be found in new localities in Southern California this year (2015), this time in Garden Grove, Orange County. Some of these California localities are places where _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts.

Although the risk of imported dengue or chikungunya viruses sparking a local outbreak is low, it is not zero. In recent years, there has been local dengue virus transmission in Florida involving _Ae. aegypti_ and in Long Island, New York, transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_. Chikungunya virus has also been transmitted locally in Florida recently. These small outbreaks have been initiated by the arrival of viremic individuals from endemic countries.

The fact that the vector mosquito populations in California are low certainly significantly reduces the risk of an outbreak with ongoing transmission being initiated there. The aggressive and well organized surveillance and control measures being carried out in California will likely keep those populations at a low level.
