Cluster of typhoid fever cases links to a sandwich shop in Paris: the
situation on 5 Nov 2003
---------------------------------
5 cases of typhoid fever were reported in France during October 2003, in
patients who had not traveled in typhoid-endemic countries, and who were
resident in 4 administrative departments in the Ile de France region
(including Paris) (1).
The patients had onset of symptoms for typhoid fever between 28 Sep and 10
Oct, and were all admitted to hospital, but have since recovered.
The 5 patients were questioned about possible sources of infection (travel,
places visited, contact with people who had fever or gastrointestinal
symptoms, foods consumed) during the month preceding the onset of their
symptoms. None of the patients had traveled in a typhoid-endemic country.
They all reported having visited a number of different restaurants. 4 of
the patients had eaten mixed salads from the same sandwich shop in the 16th
arrondissement in the west of Paris) (1) [An arrondissement is a district,
the 16th is, in fact, quite a nice neighborhood -- on the right bank in
between the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. - Mod.LL]. 2 of these
patients had visited the sandwich shop several times during the weeks
preceding symptom onset. Visiting this sandwich shop was the only exposure
common to all 4 patients. The 5th patient worked in the 16th arrondissement
for 1 day each week, and reported occasionally buying sandwiches from
different retailers, but could not remember where these retailers were located.
Phage typing and molecular typing of the strains isolated from these
patients is currently being undertaken at the national salmonella reference
centre at the Institut Pasteur.
About 90 cases of typhoid fever are reported each year in mainland France,
and 80 percent of these cases are contracted in a country where typhoid
fever is endemic, the most common areas being North Africa, Asia, and
subSaharan Africa (2).
Given the rarity of autochthonous cases of typhoid fever in France, the
temporal and geographical clustering of these authochthonous cases strongly
suggests the sandwich shop visited by at least 4 of the patients to be the
source of the infection.
The sandwich shop visited by 4 of the 5 cases was closed on 3 Nov 2003, and
an enquiry by the local veterinary and health authorities in Paris is
underway. The directorate general of health has alerted the hospitals and
health authorities in the Ile de France about this cluster of cases, so
that they will consider a diagnosis of the illness in patients without a
travel history, and has reminded them that such cases must be notified
immediately to the local health authorities and the Institut de Veille
Sanitaire. No additional autochthonous cases have yet been notified.
The date of the cluster suggests that transmission could have begun in
mid-Sep 2003. The information available to date doesn't allow calculation
of the duration of the contamination, and it is possible that infected
persons are currently in the incubation phase.
In France, people who visited the incriminated sandwich shop in Paris
between mid-September and November, and who present or have presented with
a fever or bouts of diarrhea, are encouraged to contact their doctors. In
particular, people working in the food sector or with young children, and
those caring for young children, should be especially vigilant in order to
avoid secondary transmission of the disease.
The reservoir for _Salmonella typhi_ is strictly human. Most restaurant
outbreaks that have been described in the literature are due to the
consumption of raw or unreheated food contaminated by an infected
food-handler. Handwashing before any handling of food, and after each visit
to the toilet, is an indispensable hygiene measure for the prevention of
transmission of this disease.
