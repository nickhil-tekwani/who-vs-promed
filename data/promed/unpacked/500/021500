Parents will have been concerned by the news last week [week of 2 Jul 2012] that pertussis (whooping cough) is on the rise. There's been a 10-fold increase in the number of cases so far in 2012 compared with the same period in 2010, according to the Health Protection Agency. Furthermore, this outbreak is greater than the last major outbreak, already in 2012 nearly 1800 adults and children have been affected, almost double the number in the whole of 2008 (when cases of the disease last rose sharply).

What marks out today's whooping cough outbreak is that the current peak is lasting longer than normal. Worryingly, the outbreak is increasingly affecting young babies for whom the disease can prove deadly, 5 babies have died of it already in 2012.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) believes the surge in cases may be partly due to an increased awareness among doctors who have been warned to look out for the disease, but says it could also be due to waning immunity because the effects of the vaccine reduce in time.

Indeed, the rise in cases is occurring despite a good uptake of the vaccination in younger children, 96.3 percent of 2-year-olds have completed their vaccination course against pertussis.

"Cases do increase every 3 to 4 years and this is the case the world over, it seems to be a characteristic of the disease," says Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, a consultant epidemiologist at the HPA. "Our last major outbreak was in 2008 when we had 900 cases, so we were due another one."

But what marks out today's pertussis outbreak is that the current peak is lasting longer than normal. "Normally, the outbreaks of whooping cough are seasonal, peak in the autumn, and are over by the spring," says Dr Amirthalingam.

The key to protect yourself is childhood vaccination. The vaccine is not really designed to protect older children or adults, but instead to prevent them from passing the illness to babies. While it can be an unpleasant illness for anyone, whooping cough in infants can be extremely serious, it is fatal for one in every 500 babies who develop it.

[The UK, like many of the developed nations, is currently experiencing a significant jump in cases of pertussis resulting in severe illnesses and deaths in neonates. Immunizing pregnant women during the 2nd or 3rd trimester will booster anti-toxin antibodies that will be passively transferred to the fetus and should protect the infant until active immunization is finished.

It has been suggested (Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands - Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115 and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia - Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) that acellular pertussis vaccines have selected for less vaccine-protective strains. It may well be, however, that the acellular vaccine produces an immunity that more rapidly wanes than that of the old whole-cell-killed vaccine. More information is needed regarding these possibilities. - Mod.LL
