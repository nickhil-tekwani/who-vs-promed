Iranian news media online reports that there have been 36 cases with
8 deaths from tularemia, probably from contaminated food [or water -
Mod.LL]. No additional cases have occurred in the past 72 hours.

[This submitter reports that tularemia is the cause of the febrile
oroglandular syndrome recently posted. That _Francisella tularensis_
infection occurs in Iran is supported by a study published in 1973,
that serological evidence of infection was found in animals scattered
throughout Iran (Arata A, Chamsa M, Farhand-Azad A, et al: First
detection of tularaemia in domestic and wild mammals in Iran. Bull
Wld Mlth Org. 1973;49:597-603.)
Sistan-Baluchestan province is located in extreme southeastern Iran
as can be seen on the map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchistan_Province>. The
province comprises 2 sections, Sistan in the north and Baluchestan in
the south. The combined Sistan and Baluchestan province today
accounts for one of the driest regions of Iran. - Mod.LL]
