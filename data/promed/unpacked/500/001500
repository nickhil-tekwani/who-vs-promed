As the last remaining person with contact has been released from medical observation, the rubella outbreak in the combined primary-middle school of Dulongjiang Township in Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County has been declared over.

Reports say that a total of 50 blood samples from ill and suspected cases were sent to Gongshan County Disease Control Center for testing. Of these, 15 were found positive for IgM-Ab.

From 24-28 Sep 2015, students and some faculty in Gongshan County schools were given MMR vaccinations, a total of 3725 people. Alcohol disinfection was conducted 18 times in the combined primary-middle school of Dulongjiang Township, covering a treated area of 14 400 square meters.

[ProMED Rapporteur Dan Silver states that while the outbreak appears to be from September 2015, it was just reported this week in local media.

Rubella, sometimes called German measles or 3-day measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus (Family Togaviridae, genus _Rubivirus_). The infection is usually mild with fever and rash. The average incubation period is 14 days (range, 12-23 days).

Rubella usually causes the following symptoms in children: a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body and low fever (less than 101 F [38 C]). These symptoms last 2 or 3 days. Older children and adults may also have swollen glands and symptoms like a cold before the rash appears. Aching joints occur in many cases, especially among young women. About half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms.

Complications include birth defects if infection is acquired by a pregnant woman: deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental retardation, and liver and spleen damage (at least a 20 percent chance of damage to the fetus if a woman is infected early in pregnancy).

The virus is spread person to person through coughing and sneezing through contact or droplets shed from the respiratory secretions of infected people. People may shed virus from 7 days before the onset of the rash to approximately 5-7 days after rash onset. Transmission from mother to fetus can also occur, with the highest risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if infection occurs in the 1st trimester. Infants with CRS can transmit virus for up to one year after birth.

Rubella vaccine (contained in MMR vaccine) can prevent this disease. Even though endemic rubella virus transmission has been interrupted in the Americas, rubella virus continues to circulate widely, especially in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Southeast Asian regions. In 2013, 2 large outbreaks were reported in Poland and Japan; cases were mostly among adolescent boys and adult men, but pregnant women were also affected, and their children subsequently developed CRS. In the United States, endemic rubella virus transmission has been eliminated since 2001, but cases continue to be imported. From 2004 to 2013, a median of 10 (range, 4-18) imported cases were reported annually in the United States, and 6 CRS cases were reported during the same period (excerpted from http://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/index.html).

Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County are in Yunnan province in the People's Republic of China. See map of Yunnan province at http://goo.gl/rGKtmp. - Mod.LK
