[1] UK: British nurse who recovered from Ebola back in hospital 3rd time

According to officials speaking on Tuesday [23 Feb 2016], Scottish nurse who recovered from Ebola virus disease (EVD) but then suffered life-threatening complications from it persisting in her brain, has been admitted to hospital for a 3rd time. She is stated to be in stable condition.

She contracted EVD in December 2014 when she was working in a treatment facility in Sierra Leone at the height of an EVD epidemic which involved the 3 countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone).

She was being transferred on Tuesday [23 Feb 2016] from the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow [Scotland] to the Royal Free Hospital in London [England], which has a unit especially set up to address any EVD cases in Britain.

According to a hospital statement, "We can confirm that she is being transferred to the Royal Free Hospital due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus. She will now be treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team under nationally agreed guidelines."

After being transferred from Sierra Leone to Britain, she initially recovered from the Ebola hemorrhagic fever and was sent home in January 2015. However, in October [2015] she again became ill and doctors found the virus was persisting in tissues in her brain. They later said she had developed meningitis caused by the Ebola virus -- the 1st known such case.

An experimental antiviral drug, GS5734, was administered. Doctors did not indicate whether they thought the antiviral had improved her condition.

She was last discharged from Royal Free in November 2015.

[This is very sad news. This poor nurse has suffered more than anyone deserves. One has to wonder whether her situation is unique or whether, more likely, this is occurring in West Africa, but either not recognized or reported. From the report below and previous publication, one suspects other survivors are experiencing serious medical complications following "recovery" from acute Ebola virus disease. - Mod.LK]

As 'Ebola nurse' returns to hospital, scientists' fears about virus living on in tissue are confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to experts, the Ebola virus can stay buried in hard-to-reach areas of survivors' tissue, and its effects could continue long after people have apparently recovered. This does not mean people can contract the Ebola virus disease (EVD) twice, and the risk of transmission to others is low. However, there is a risk that further outbreaks can be triggered.

Scientists are still not entirely sure about what the long-term effects of Ebola are. [See report below on sequelae. - Mod.LK]

"It seems that some of the ongoing health problems with people's eyes, joints and hair loss are actually caused not by the after-effects of Ebola, but by the small amounts of Ebola which is still residing somewhere in the body," Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told BBC Radio Scotland.

According to Julian Hiscox, professor of infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, "We know that Ebola virus can shelter in the body in what are called immune privileged sites such as the eye, central nervous system and testes. ... I think the persistence of the virus in asymptomatic individuals is a potential reservoir of the virus. We know that infectious virus is present in semen for a number of months. It's why men who have had Ebola and recovered are advised to abstain or wear condoms."

It is not clear what treatment [the nurse] is receiving in her latest hospitalization at Royal Free Hospital.

[3] Complications of Ebola virus disease in survivors
Date: Tue 23 Feb 2016

Ebola Survivor Study Yields Insights on Complications of Disease
----------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary findings from PREVAIL III, a study of Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors being conducted in Liberia, indicate that both Ebola survivors and their close contacts have a high burden of illness. However, the prevalence of eye, musculoskeletal, and neurological complications was greater among the individuals who survived EVD.

Initial results from PREVAIL III were presented this evening at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston [Massachusetts, USA] by study co-principal investigator Mosoka Fallah, Ph.D., M.P.H., with the Liberian Ministry of Health. PREVAIL III began in June 2015 and is co-sponsored by the Liberian Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The trial is expected to enroll 7500 people throughout Liberia, including 1500 EVD survivors of any age and up to 6000 of their close contacts, with participants followed for up to 5 years and study visits every 6 months.

Through 15 Feb 2016, the study had enrolled 1049 EVD survivors and 1034 close contacts with average ages of 30 and 26 years, respectively. On average, survivors enrolled in the study about one year after experiencing EVD symptoms. Investigators found that as self-reported by survivors, 60 percent experienced eye problems, 53 percent had musculoskeletal problems and 68 percent had neurological difficulties. Close contacts, who were potentially exposed to the Ebola virus but did not become infected, reported similar problems, albeit less frequently: 59 percent reported vision problems, 28 percent had musculoskeletal issues, and 48 percent had neurological issues.

97 male survivors provided 1 or more semen samples for analysis. Overall, 38 percent of these men had Ebola detected in their semen at least once. In 1/3rd of the 69 men who were tested more than once, virus detection in semen was intermittent (negative results then positive, or vice versa). The maximum amount of time between EVD symptoms and detection of Ebola in a semen sample was 18 months. Most survivors reported being sexually active. In a subset of 126 close contacts who reported sexual activity with a survivor, only 4 percent reported regular condom use, raising concerns about the potential for sexual transmission of EVD. However, so far, no cases of sexual transmission of Ebola have been detected in the PREVAIL III study.

These findings were presented today [23 Feb 2016] at the 23rd Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections at the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center in Boston.

[In Bundibugyo, Uganda: a retrospective cohort study indicated that long-term sequelae persist for more than 2 years after Ebola virus disease. They found that survivors of the Bundibugyo Ebola virus were at significantly increased risk of ocular deficits (retro-orbital pain [RR 4.3, 95 per cent CI 1.9-9.6; p less than 0.0001], blurred vision [1.9, 1.1-3.2; p=0.018]), hearing loss (2.3, 1.2-4.5; p=0.010), difficulty swallowing (2.1, 1.1-3.9; p=0.017), difficulty sleeping (1.9, 1.3-2.8; p=0.001), arthralgias (2.0, 1.1-3.6; p=0.020), and various constitutional symptoms controlling for age and sex. Chronic health problems (prevalence ratio [PR] 2.1, 95 per cent CI 1.2-3.6; p=0.008) and limitations due to memory loss or confusion (PR 5.8, 1.5-22.4; p=0.010) were also reported more frequently by survivors of Bundibugyo Ebola virus. [Clark DV, Kibuuka H, Millard M et al. 2015. Long-term sequelae after Ebola virus disease in Bundibugyo, Uganda: a retrospective cohort study. The Lancet Infectious Diseases 15(8):905-912 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309915701520)]

Note that Bundibugyo Ebola virus is a separate species of Ebola virus genus from Zaire, and the location is Uganda rather than Sierra Leone, Liberia, or Guniea. Nonetheless, in a comment on sequelae following infection is provided by Bausch DG. Sequelae after Ebola virus disease: even when it's over it's not over. The Lancet Infectious Diseases 15(8):865-866 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309915701659), he pointed out that similar findings have been shown from early anecdotal reports from the affected West African countries and published reports and smaller studies on Ebola virus disease survivors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire Ebola virus) and northern Uganda (Sudan Ebola virus).

This report on the frequency of sequelae following recovery from EVD is disturbing and does not bode well for full and rapid recovery of West Africa from this past epidemic. - Mod.LK]

[4] Research update

24 Feb 2016: Small study suggests ZMapp may boost Ebola virus survival
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MED_EBOLA_TREATMENT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-02-24-12-49-22
[According to a study released on Tue [23 Feb 20216], which included only 72 patients (less than half of the planned study due to the lack of available subjects), 22 percent of subjects given ZMapp died, compared with 37 percent of subjects who received standard treatments. The number of subjects is so few, the results could have occurred by chance. The vaccine was developed by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals. Mapp will continue testing with a goal of seeking approval to put the drug on the market.

Because ZMapp was well-tolerated and showed promise, the US Food and Drug Administration has asked Mapp to make its ZMapp available to any future patients as needed. Mapp Biopharmaceuticals plans to continue testing and seek approval to put the drug on the market as quickly as possible.]
