After enduring 3 years of war, hunger and disease, Yemenis could now be at heightened risk of catching malaria due to a collapsing health care system, aid agencies said on Thursday [18 Jan 2018].

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that malaria cases rose in 2016 to 433 000 from 336 000 the year before.

Poor access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation put more people at risk of the life-threatening disease, according to aid agencies. "Yemen is living with the catastrophic consequences of a protracted conflict that has destroyed much of its vital infrastructure and brought the health system to the brink of collapse," said Mirella Hodeib, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.

The conflict has killed more than 10 000 people and crippled Yemen's economy and healthcare system.

In an emailed statement, Hodeib said the situation in Yemen "provided the optimal conditions for the growth and re-emergence of communicable diseases" in a country that is already battling a million suspected cholera cases and a threatened diphtheria outbreak.

Abdullah Radman, deputy medical coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone that rural areas were most at risk because of limited healthcare facilities. "The numbers of malaria cases could increase. It will be more serious if there is no treatment or preventative measures. People will die," said Radman from the capital of Sanaa.

Malaria -- which peaks in the rainy season -- is endemic in Yemen, with more than 78 percent of people living in at-risk areas and a quarter of them in high-risk areas, WHO said.

Yemen's health ministry, along with aid organisations, has distributed protective items such as mosquito nets, but Radman called the deteriorating situation a serious issue.

"A failing sewage system, inadequate healthcare facilities and shortages in health workers and medical supplies, as well as restrictions on imports, further compound the healthcare crisis," said Hodeib of ICRC.

Aid agencies said this week that Yemen "faces a risk of famine."

[A map of malaria in Yemen can be found in the World Malaria Report 2016 (WHO), page 114: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/252038/1/9789241511711-eng.pdf?ua=1.

From the same report, it will also be noted that the incidence in Saudi Arabia, all _P. falciparum_, increased 100 percent from 2010 to 2015 (Table E and F, page 115). It is not discussed whether this is due to imported cases from Yemen.

A recent study of malaria in the Hadhramout, southeast Yemen, reported a presence rate of 18.8 percent, with 99.3 percent being _P. falciparum_ (18.8 percent with _Plasmodium falciparum_ as the predominant species (Bamaga OA et al. Malaria in Hadhramout, a southeast province of Yemen: prevalence, risk factors, knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs). Parasit Vectors. 2014 Jul 29;7:351 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074325).

It is worrying, but not surprising, that malaria is surging in Yemen. Lack of medicine for treatment of acute attacks and breakdown in control measures in an endemic area invariably have this result.

The limited distribution of impregnated bed nets will probably do very little. Vector control by spraying breeding sites and prompt treatment of acutely infected persons to prevent them from becoming gametocyte carriers and further spread the infection are mandatory but probably not possible under the present conditions.

Malaria will spread in Yemen with refugee movements, and without vector control, it can easily become established and increase in new areas. - Mod.EP
