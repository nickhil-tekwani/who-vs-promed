The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) links deadly _Listeria_ outbreak to deli meats and cheeses. A total of 16 people in 6 states have been infected with the _Listeria_ strain, resulting in one death and 13 hospitalizations, the agency said (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/index.html).

The outbreak sickened at least 16 people from 17 Apr 2021 to 29 Sep 2022, according to the CDC: 3 in Maryland, where the person who died resided; 7 in New York; 2 people each in Illinois and Massachusetts; and 1 each in New Jersey and California.

There may have been more recent cases, but it typically takes 3 or 4 weeks to determine if an illness is tied to an outbreak. The true number of sick people is most likely higher, and the outbreak "may not be limited to the states with known illnesses," the agency said in a news release (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/index.html).

The flulike symptoms of listeriosis -- fever, vomiting and diarrhea -- most often affect older adults, immune-compromised individuals and pregnant women, who can pass it on to their fetuses.

Symptoms usually start within 2 weeks after eating contaminated food, including meat, unpasteurized milk, raw vegetables and certain processed items like hot dogs and deli meats, according to the Mayo Clinic. The _Listeria_ bacteria can be found in soil, water and animal feces.

The agency said that one person got sick during their pregnancy, which resulted in pregnancy loss. Of the 13 people who shared information about their ethnicity to the agency, 11 are of Eastern European background or speak Russian. They range in age from 38 to 92, the agency said.

Pregnant women are 10 times more likely than other people to become infected, according to the CDC.

State and local public health officials believe that contaminated deli meat and cheese are the root of the outbreak. Of the 7 people who got sick in New York, 5 bought sliced deli meat or cheese from at least one NetCost Market, a grocery store chain. However, the agency said, "investigators do not believe that NetCost Market delis are the only source of illnesses because some sick people in the outbreak did not shop at a NetCost Market."

The grocery store temporarily closed the deli in one of its Brooklyn stores after New York City health officials notified them about the sampling results (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/alert/2021/listeriosis-cluster-brooklyn.pdf). The NetCost market reopened after a "deep cleaning" and after "further environmental testing did not identify _Listeria_," the agency said. NetCost Market did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Wednesday [9 Nov 2022] night.

In 2021, health officials in New York found the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ in several samples, including sliced salami purchased by a sick person from a NetCost Market deli on Staten Island and a NetCost Market deli in Brooklyn, where several open packages of mortadella and ham contained _Listeria_. The sick people from other states purchased deli meats or cheeses from other delis, the agency said.

The CDC advised people at higher risk of severe _Listeria_ illness "to not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter," unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or until steaming hot.

[The following has been extracted from the CDC report of the multistate listeriosis outbreak associated with deli meats and cheese on 9 Nov 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/index.html):

"Investigation notice

"Illnesses: 16
Hospitalizations: 13
Deaths: 1
States: 6
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

"Listeria in deli meat and cheese
----------------------------------
"Deli meats (cold cuts, lunch meats, hot dogs, and pâtés sold at the deli) and cheeses are known sources of _Listeria_ illnesses. This is because _Listeria_ can easily spread among food on deli countertops, deli slicers, surfaces, and hands. _Listeria_ is a hardy germ that can be difficult to fully remove once it is in the deli. It can survive and grow at cold temperatures in the refrigerator.

"Source of the outbreak
-----------------------
"Information collected so far shows that deli meat and cheese purchased at deli counters in multiple states are the likely sources of this outbreak.

"It is difficult for investigators to identify a single food as the source of outbreaks linked to deli meats and cheeses. This is because _Listeria_ spreads easily between food and the deli environment and can persist for a long time in deli display cases and on equipment. A contaminated food likely introduced the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ into delis in multiple states. Investigators are working to identify any specific products or delis that may be contaminated with the outbreak strain.

"Investigation details
----------------------
"CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.

"Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that meat and cheese from deli counters contaminated with _Listeria_ are making people sick. Investigators are still working to identify any specific products or delis that may be contaminated with the outbreak strain.

"Epidemiologic data
-------------------
"As of 9 Nov 2022, 16 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ have been reported from 6 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/map.html). Sick people's samples were collected from 17 Apr 2021 to 29 Sep 2022 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/deli-11-22/epi.html). The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Listeria_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

"Public health officials collect information about the age, ethnicity, and other demographics of sick people, and the types of foods they have eaten, to provide clues that can help identify the source of the outbreak. Sick people range in age from 38 to 92 years, with a median age of 74, and 62% are male. Of 13 people with ethnicity information available, 11 are of Eastern European background or speak Russian. Of 14 people with information available, 13 have been hospitalized, including one Maryland resident who died. One person got sick during their pregnancy, resulting in pregnancy loss.

"State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 12 people interviewed, 11 reported eating meat or cheese from deli counters. Among 7 sick people in New York, 5 bought sliced deli meat or cheese from at least one location of NetCost Market, a grocery store chain that sells international foods. Sick people from other states purchased deli meats or cheeses from other delis.

"Investigators do not believe that NetCost Market delis are the only source of illnesses because some sick people in the outbreak did not shop at a NetCost Market. A contaminated food likely introduced the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ into delis in multiple states.

"Laboratory data
----------------
"Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

"In 2021, health officials in New York state and New York City found the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ in several environmental and food samples:
- Environmental samples from a NetCost Market deli in Brooklyn
- Several open packages of mortadella and ham that were sliced at the same NetCost Market deli in Brooklyn
- Sliced salami that a sick person bought from a NetCost Market deli in Staten Island

"NetCost Market voluntarily closed the deli temporarily in Brooklyn after New York officials notified them about the sampling results (dated 10 Sep 2021, https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/alert/2021/listeriosis-cluster-brooklyn.pdf). NetCost Market performed a deep cleaning and then reopened the deli in Brooklyn after further environmental testing did not identify _Listeria_.

"In September 2022, the outbreak strain was found at the same Brooklyn NetCost Market deli; however, the most recent illness with NetCost Market exposure was in October 2021. After a deep cleaning, additional environmental testing did not identify _Listeria_ in the deli.

"Public health actions
----------------------
"CDC advises people at higher risk of severe _Listeria_ illness to not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter, unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot."

ProMED posted a report from the New York City Department of Health (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA (06): (NYC) ready-to-eat deli counter, alert 20210914.8668543) of a cluster of 3 listeriosis cases in the New York City borough of Brooklyn with _Listeria_ that had similar genotypes, based on WGS. A food history revealed that all 3 patients purchased ready-to-eat food from the deli counter at the same market; food and environmental samples collected at this market yielded _Listeria_ isolates that were highly related to the patients' isolates by WGS, confirming this as the common source. However, the exact food items were not mentioned in the 2021 news report.

We now learn from The New York Times and CDC reports that deli counter tops contaminated multiple food items (deli meats and cheese). The original source responsible for the deli counter contamination is still under investigation but is believed likely to have introduced the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ into delis in multiple states. This source was apparently responsible for contamination at a Brooklyn deli in September 2021; following decontamination ("deep cleaning") at this Brooklyn deli in September 2021, environmental testing failed to detect _Listeria_. Nevertheless, in September 2022 the outbreak strain was found again at the same Brooklyn deli. The most recent Brooklyn deli contamination was not associated with any new cases. However, we are not told of results of environmental sampling at deli markets in the other involved states.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
