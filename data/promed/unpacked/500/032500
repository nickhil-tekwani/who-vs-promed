Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - United Arab Emirates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [21 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 46-year-old, non-national female from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as she is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on [16 Jun 2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [18 Jun 2015]. She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, she is still asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.

2- An 11-year-old, non-national male from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as he is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on [16 Jun 2015]. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [18 Jun 2015]. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates also notified WHO of the death of the MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [16 Jun 2015].

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1350 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 480 related deaths.

[The above cases were detected through contact screening of the 65-year-old expat male reported by the UAE to WHO on 15 Jun 2015 and reported as a fatality in a media report on 18 Jun 2015 [see MERS-CoV (68): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO 20150616.3442296 and MERS-CoV (71): Thailand ex Oman, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE 20150618.3447481 for more details). In the same media report mentioning the death of this patient, there was mention of another case in stable condition expected to leave the hospital shortly. Clarification of this information would be greatly appreciated ... is this "other case" one of the 2 asymptomatic cases mentioned in today's WHO update, or is there yet another case hospitalized for MERS-CoV infection in the UAE?

According to the most recent ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Bulletin, as of 25 Jun 2015, the UAE has reported 79 cases including 11 deaths (reported case fatality rate 13.9 percent) (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-27-june-2015.pdf for full report). One presumes that the 2 newly confirmed asymptomatic cases were not included in this update. It is unclear if the fatality is included.
