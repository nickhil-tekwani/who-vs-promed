BSE - JAPAN (06): SOURCE

In the ProMED post "BSE-Japan (04)" on 22 Aug 2002, the moderator stated the
results of the investigation by the Japanese delegation to the Netherlands
regarding the animal fat have not been disclosed. This is not correct.
The results were press-released from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry &
Fisheries on 21 Jun 2002. However, the mass media did not report this. The
following is a brief summary of the press release.
The investigation was conducted from 8-15 Jun 2002 by the 2 governments'
staffs.
1. The Netherlands staff expressed the opinion that milk replacer as a
source of infection appears to be unlikely, and that cross contamination
with meat and bone meal during feed production is more likely.
2. The animal fat exported to Japan was used to feed some of the BSE cases
in the Netherlands, but the same manufacturer has a [market?] share of over
50 percent in the Netherlands, and millions of calves have been fed the
animal fat produced by this manufacturer. Therefore, they insisted that no
epidemiological relationship between the milk replacer and BSE can be
observed. [They may insist all they like, but just because they have over 50
percent market share in the Netherlands does not mean they were not be the
source. This statement is only circumstantial and is not proof. - Mod.TG]
3. The animal fat has been produced for animal use and not for human
consumption. The source of the animal fat was healthy cattle, and the brain,
spinal cord, and eyes were removed [by the processor] voluntarily. As the
[fat] production line was completely separated from the other lines, the
possibility that it contaminated the other animal protein [meat & bone meal]
is extremely remote.
Based on these results, the report concluded that they could not obtain
evidence for contamination of the animal fat by animal protein that can
cause BSE.
