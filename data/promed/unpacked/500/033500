On 22 Aug 2000, the State of Connecticut announced a third West Nile virus
positive pool of bird-biting mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were trapped in
Norwalk on 8 Aug 2000. This is the second positive pool identified in
Norwalk. Also, 26 positive crows from 8 towns were reported.
On 23 Aug 2000, the State announced 4 crows positive for West Nile Virus
collected in the following towns: Darien, Durham, Milford, and Stratford.
This is the first time Durham and Stratford have had positive crows. To
date the State of Connecticut has identified 91 birds (90 crows and one
robin) in 21 towns.
On 24 Aug, the State of Connecticut identified 5 additional West Nile virus
positive crows from Darien (1), New Canaan (1), Norwalk (1), Wallingford,
(1) and Westport (1). The birds were collected from 14 Aug - 17 Aug 2000.
This makes the total 96 birds (95 crows and one robin).
On 25 Aug, the State identified 12 additional birds positive for West Nile
virus. Nine were crows, from Darien (3), Greenwich (1) New Canaan (1),
Stamford (4). The 3 remaining birds were from Stamford, (1) robin, (1)
bluejay, (1) dove. The birds had been collected from 14 Aug - 18 Aug 2000.
The 3 birds from Stamford (dove, bluejay, and robin) were collected and
tested by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station as part of an
on-going research project on song birds and disease transmission.

Rockland, 3; Suffolk, 14. Fifteen positive mosquito pools also were
reported: New York City, 13 [Bronx 1, Staten Island 12; Rockland, 2. Two
additional human West Nile virus cases have been diagnosed in New York
City. Four human cases have been reported in Staten Island and on in
Brooklyn.
The total number of West Nile virus positive specimens for New York State
this year is 344 birds, 166 mosquito pools, 1 sentinel chicken, 6 live wild
birds, and 5 human cases.

New Jersey State
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/824results.htm>
A summary of New Jersey Department of Health Surveillance Results at 24 Aug
2000.
Human Testing: There have been no confirmed human cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection in New Jersey. Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 16
residents have been or are in the process of being tested for the presence
of WNV. To date, samples from 5 residents have tested negative and the
other test results are still pending. These individuals either had symptoms
or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of
the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows with the virus have
been discovered. Human testing for WNV is now being conducted at the New
Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services' Public Health and
Environmental Laboratory in Trenton. Samples collected earlier this season
are being or were tested for WNV by the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) or by public health labs in other states. The
department has also been contacted by doctors of more than 2 dozen patients
with symptoms that did not meet all WNV testing criteria. The physicians
were given the option of sending samples of their patients' blood to
private laboratories for analysis using the St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE)
screening test. Since SLE and WNV are closely related viruses, a WNV case
will most likely react to a SLE test. The department has not been notified
of any positive SLE tests to date.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing: To date, 322 birds (321 crows and a cockatiel)
found in 10 counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive
birds have been found in Bergen (84), Essex (39), Hudson (36), Mercer (1),
Middlesex (68), Monmouth (29), Morris (3), Passaic (27), Somerset (1) and
Union (34) Counties. The tests were conducted at the Department of Health
and Senior Services' lab in Trenton: the CDC confirmed early season
results. A total of 859 crows have been tested this year.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing: Four pools of mosquitoes collected in
Bergen County in late July by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control
Unit and analyzed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) as part of a research project have tested positive for the presence
of WNV. Bergen County has since intensified control activities and adult
mosquito populations continue to be low. For the research project, being
conducted by the CDC and the United States Geological Survey with the
cooperation of state and local agencies, more than 10 500 mosquitoes were
separated into groups of 1-50 by like-species and tested. The positive
pools included _Culex pipiens_ and _Culex restuans_ mosquitoes. In addition
to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed more than 1000 house sparrows. No
sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey. To date, 705 mosquito
pools collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and
tested by the Department of Health and Senior Services for the presence of
the WNV have been negative. Samples have been submitted from all 21
counties.
Sentinel Chicken Testing: Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken
flocks placed in all 21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture for the presence of WNV have all been negative to date.

New York City
Department of Health Press Release; Fri, 25 Aug 2000 [edited
<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press00/pr81-825.html>

New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
an 87 year-old woman from Borough Park, Brooklyn, and an 84 year-old woman
from Shore Acres, Staten Island, have tested positive for West Nile virus
(WNV). The Brooklyn woman is in critical condition; the Staten Island woman
is in stable condition. The laboratory results were obtained by tests
performed at the New York City Department of Health's laboratories, and
specimens have been sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for further confirmation. There are now a total of 5 New
York City residents, all of whom are age 63 years or older, who have tested
positive for West Nile virus in 2000. The 87 year-old woman from Brooklyn
was admitted to a local hospital for a surgical procedure on 7 Aug and
developed encephalitis on 15 Aug 2000. (There is a 3 to 15 day incubation
period from infection with West Nile virus to the onset of symptoms). The
84 year-old woman from Staten Island became ill with symptoms of
encephalitis on 18 Aug, and was admitted to a local hospital on 20 Aug
2000.
Dr. Cohen also announced that the New York State Department of Health
reported to the City Health Department that an additional 13 pools of
mosquitoes and 2 dead birds collected from New York City have tested
positive for the virus. 12 of the 13 pools of mosquitoes were collected
from Staten Island, with 2 of the pools collected from Staten Island on 20
Aug, subsequent to the last spraying effort on Staten Island. This
information, along with the evidence that Staten Island continues to be the
area with most evidence of viral activity, prompts a new round of spraying
on Staten Island to take place on Sunday, 27 Aug and Wednesday, 30 Aug
2000. The other mosquito pool was collected in Van Cortlandt Park in the
Bronx prompting spraying to take place in Van Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn
Cemetery tonight and in the community surrounding Van Cortlandt Park on
Sunday night.
Dr. Cohen said, "Additionally, while the _Culex pipiens_ species continues
to be the main carrier of West Nile virus, the City has also identified
West Nile virus in two other species of mosquitoes: _Culex salinarius_, and
_Aedes triseriatus_. While the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes is still
greatest during dusk and at dawn, and during nighttime hours, the _Aedes
triseriatus_ species, in which West Nile virus was identified in Staten
Island, may also bite during the day. While it is not yet known how
significant a role this mosquito plays in the transmission of West Nile
virus to humans, it is nonetheless recommended that individuals also take
precautions against mosquitoes during the daytime if in areas where there
is mosquito activity." The State Health Department reported 13 new pools of
mosquitoes and 2 dead birds to the City Health Department this morning. 12
of the mosquito pools were collected from various areas of Staten Island
including Rossville, Grasmere, Clove Lake and the landfill; the other
mosquito pool was collected from Van Cortlandt park in the Bronx. The 2
birds, a dead crow and a dead captive bird were collected from Midland
Beach and West Brighton, Staten Island, respectively.
Summary of West Nile Virus Findings: 5 humans, 66 birds and 77 mosquito pools.
