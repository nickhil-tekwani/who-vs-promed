Abstract
--------
The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian _Aedes_ species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.

[Background]
------------
Brazil has recently experienced its largest-recorded YF outbreak in decades, with 2043 confirmed cases and 676 deaths since December 2016. Between December 2016 and the end of June 2017, there were 777 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed human cases of YF across 10 Brazilian states -- mostly in Minas Gerais (MG) (60% of cases), followed by Espírito Santo (32%), Rio de Janeiro (3%), and São Paulo (3%) (18). The fatality ratio of severe YF cases was estimated at 33.6%, comparable to previous outbreaks.

Conclusion
----------
Epidemiological and genomic surveillance of human and animal populations at risk is crucial for early detection and rapid containment of YFV transmission. The YFV epidemic in Brazil continues to unfold with an increase in cases since December 2017. Longitudinal studies of non-human primates are needed to understand how YFV lineages disseminate across South America between outbreaks and how epizootics are determined by the dynamics of susceptible animals in the reservoir. To achieve the WHO's goal to eliminate YF epidemics by 2026, YF surveillance necessitates a global, coordinated strategy. Our results and analyses show that rapid genomic surveillance of YFV, when integrated with epidemiological and spatial data, could help anticipate the risk of human YFV exposure through space and time and monitor the likelihood of sylvatic versus urban transmission. We hope that the toolkit introduced here will prove useful in guiding YF control in a resource-efficient manner.

[The toolkit that the authors developed may be very useful when another yellow fever (YF) outbreak occurs. Readers interested in the details of the development of the toolkit can access them at the source URL above.

Interestingly, as this YF outbreak developed in Brazil, there was no mention of the virus being found in _Aedes aegypti_, which was abundant in the affected states with a risk of an outbreak in populated areas. That urban outbreak did not occur. The conclusion was that all cases resulted from spillover from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission and not the urban cycle. - Mod.TY
