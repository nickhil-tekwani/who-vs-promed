Hundreds of students have been struck down by a severe outbreak of mumps that is spreading across British universities. Public Health England figures show that more than 7200 suspected mumps cases have been reported in the UK since July [2019], almost triple the same period last year [2018].

Health officials said students were driving the surge and urged any who missed out on the MMR jab to get vaccinated.

More than 15 000 mumps cases have been reported so far compared with just over 6000 at this time in 2018, according to Dr Doug Brown of the British Society for Immunology.

In recent weeks, outbreaks of the highly infectious disease have been reported at universities including Edinburgh, Cambridge, Oxford, and Bristol.

The surge in cases is linked to a dip in uptake of the MMR vaccine 2 decades ago. The current generation of students were born at the height of a mass health scare triggered in 1998, when now-disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield made a link between the vaccine and autism.

The Daily Mail is running a major campaign to boost vaccine rates amid falling uptake of all 10 routine childhood jabs.

The biggest mumps outbreak in a decade shows no sign of abating, with 103 new cases reported last week. So far this year [2019], 2458 cases of mumps have been reported, compared to 563 notified in all of 2018, according to the latest figures.

With the current outbreak mostly affecting teenagers and young adults, scores of schools and colleges have been affected. The Health Service Executive advises those diagnosed with the disease to stay at home for at least 5 days after their salivary glands swell in order to prevent the infection spreading.

The worst-affected part of the state is the greater Dublin area, which accounted for 1126 of the cases so far this year [2019], according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. In contrast, just 84 cases have been recorded in the Southern Health Board area.

Men are slightly more affected than women, and 869 cases have been recorded among 15-19-year-olds alone.

Public health officials have blamed the current outbreak on a dip in the MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccination rates 20 years ago. This resulted from publicity surrounding the since-discredited claims by Dr Andrew Wakefield linking the vaccine to a rise in autism cases.

Doctors say the MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent the disease and its complications, though it is estimated to be only 88% effective in preventing mumps, and effectiveness wanes over time.

Since 1988 when MMR was 1st introduced, the largest outbreak of mumps was reported in 2009 when more than 3600 cases were notified.

Fortunately, there is no sign of a measles outbreak this year [2019]. Some 75 cases have been reported in the 1st 11 months of 2019, 40 of them in the greater Dublin area.

There's a new outbreak of the highly contagious viral disease mumps across the Auckland region, with localised clusters of cases diagnosed in Howick, Pakuranga, Auckland Central, and Ponsonby. The point of origin is unknown.

In its announcement, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) noted that those affected included gym instructors working in community facilities across Auckland. The ARPHS pointed out that gym instructors are "generally young adults who have lower vaccination rates and who also tend to mix and move between gyms."

In the 18 months to August 2018, more than 1200 cases were reported in the Auckland region. While that outbreak was ultimately controlled, there have been 120 cases of mumps in Auckland so far this year [2019], with 49 of those in the past 4 weeks. The ARPHS has not seen increased rates of rubella to date this year [2019], but it's a disease they routinely monitor. Those who haven't received the MMR vaccine are at risk of contracting all 3 diseases, 2 of which are on the rise in New Zealand. According to Southern Cross, since the national vaccination programme containing the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1990, there have been generally around 20-30 cases of mumps per year across the country. During the 1st big post-MMR outbreak in 2017, more than 900 cases were recorded.
