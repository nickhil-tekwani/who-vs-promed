Government begins expanded mad cow testing
-------------------------------------------
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began expanded
national testing for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, or mad
cow disease) Tuesday, intending to test about 220 000 animals for the
brain-wasting condition over the next year to 18 months.
Officials said the department was able to handle the 1st day's
samples even though most of the dozen regional laboratories aren't
yet equipped to perform the initial tests.
The government conducted tests on cattle tissues for BSE from 20 543
animals in 2003, virtually all of them cattle that could not stand or
walk and had to be dragged to slaughter. After the nation's 1st case
of the disease in December 2003, the department initially doubled the
number of animals to be tested this year to 40 000.
With many foreign governments still reluctant to ease bans on U.S.
beef, the testing program was expanded at a cost of $70 million to
include as many as 220 000 slaughtered animals, following
recommendations from an international scientific review panel. About
35 million head of cattle are slaughtered each year in the United
States.
The overwhelming majority of tests will be on animals considered most
likely have BSE -- those showing any sign of brain disorder, unable
to stand on their own or deemed unfit for human consumption for other
reasons. Tissue samples from those animals would be tested, as would
samples from animals that die on farms.
The department's testing plans also include about 20 000 animals that
appear healthy but are at least 30 months old, the age at which mad
cow disease appears. [Actually, the disease has been found in animals
much younger. Japan has found animals 21, 23, and 24 months old.
Information on these cases can be found in the ProMED-mail archives
as well as on the Bio-Rad website
<http://www.bio-rad.com/pages/CRP/JapanBSE21Mo.doc> - Mod.TG]
The 12 state-operated labs around the country will perform the
initial tests on brain and central nervous system tissue from
slaughtered cattle for BSE. Results from those tests will [allegedly]
be returned in 24 to 72 hours.
If that rapid-response test indicates the animal may have BSE, tissue
samples will then be sent to the department's National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for confirmatory testing
that could take 4 to 8 days.
7 of the rapid-test labs are able to handle large batches of tests,
at least 1000 per month, but only 5 of these were operating on the
1st day, department spokeswoman Andrea McNally said Tuesday.
The other 2 had "last-minute problems," she said. 5 other labs,
which would handle smaller batches, were not testing samples Tuesday
but are scheduled to begin the work later, she said.
The 5 working labs are "more than sufficient" to handle the initial
testing load, McNally said.
The department expects some rapid tests to indicate BSE, although
that does not necessarily mean the animal has the disease, said Dr.
Ron DeHaven, administrator of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.

[Most federal people and many state people attended a web-cast
training session for the BSE surveillance launch. However, the high
through-put laboratories were told that the information needed on the
samples would be on a particular website. This is apparently not up
and functioning, according to some of the laboratories that received
samples yesterday.
The laboratories doing the work have indicated that if samples are in
the lab by 9 AM that results will be available for faxing or
e-mailing by 5 PM that same day. That represents approximately a
48-hour hold for a carcass while test results are awaited. However,
USDA indicated the results are to be sent to NVSL, so the results may
be viewed by USDA and a press conference held prior to releasing the
results. Hence, a carcass and its associated viscera will have to be
retained for another 24-48 hours. In high-volume plants, this kind of
delay could cause quite a backup and seems to represent an
unnecessary delay.
Although, it is understandable that USDA wants to see the results
first, it would seem appropriate to make sure the website for the
laboratory and the USDA is functioning, and utilize that means of
viewing results as soon as they are available from the laboratories.
Undoubtedly, some difficulties must be overcome before this procedure
can be said to be operating smoothly. As Secretary of Agriculture
Veneman has stated, it is possible that with increased testing, there
will be more positives found. Certainly this has been true in other
countries. - Mod.TG]
