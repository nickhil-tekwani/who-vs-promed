A new wave of theileriosis also known as January disease is killing hundreds of cattle in Masvingo Province, while a lot of deaths are not reported. Provincial veterinary services officer confirmed the epizootic and said the 552 cattle that have been reported dead since 1 Jan 2021 are an understatement of the situation on the ground. However, he said that the Government was intervening by availing 146 tonnes of tick grease; 96.6 tons have already been released to farmers. Awareness campaigns on the importance of dipping are operated; people are urged to collect tick grease for their livestock.

The new wave of the pandemic follows another devastating one last year [2020] which left the province's total herd drastically reduced.

Gutu [district] is the epicentre of the disease. Zaka, Bikita, Masvingo, and Chivi [districts] are also affected; Chiredzi and Mwenezi recorded the fewest deaths. Most cases are unrecorded due to COVID-19; it is believed more cattle have succumbed to tick-borne related pathogens.

[East Coast fever [ECF], also known as theileriosis, is a disease of cattle, endemic in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, caused by the protozoan parasite _Theileria parva_. The primary vector which spreads _T. parva_ between cattle is a tick, _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_. ECF is of major economic importance to livestock farmers in Africa. The tick vectors can be found from sea level to over 8000 feet [about 2440 m] in any area where the annual rainfall exceeds 20 inches [500 mm].

A more acute form of East Coast fever called Corridor disease occurs when buffalo-derived _T. parva_ is transmitted to cattle. Another form, called January disease, only occurs over the winter months in Zimbabwe due to the tick lifecycle.

Theileriae are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites (order Piroplasmida, family Theileriidae, genus _Theileria_). They are most closely related to _Babesia_, from which they differ by having a developmental stage in leukocytes prior to infection of erythrocytes.

_T. parva_ is the most pathogenic and economically important species, followed by _T. annulata_, the cause of tropical theileriosis or Mediterranean theileriosis, and _T. orientalis_ which causes Oriental theileriosis or _Theileria_-associated bovine anaemia.
