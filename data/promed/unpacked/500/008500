While the recently FDA-authorized Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) was originally seen as a way to convince the unvaccinated to get their COVID shot, some researchers say its main role now likely will be as a booster.

The protein subunit vaccine -- a more traditional vaccination technology -- may be particularly appealing to those who were sidelined by side effects from mRNA vaccines, who may be hopeful for an easier booster experience; though whether it will produce fewer side effects in this setting remains to be seen.

Researchers have also raised earlier questions about whether mixing and matching boosters can lead to better immunity, especially as new variants evolve.

While the Novavax shot is not yet authorized by the FDA as a booster, several experts told MedPage Today it could be headed that way.

"Probably the best niche now for Novavax's purified protein vaccine is as a booster strategy for mRNA vaccines," Paul Offit, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who served on the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) on Novavax, told MedPage Today.

Robert "Chip" Schooley, MD, an infectious disease expert at the University of California San Diego who has served on VRBPAC in the past, said since there "aren't many people left who have been neither vaccinated nor infected ... it will likely be mainly used as a booster."

Schooley noted that there are no data yet as to whether Novavax-as-a-booster can provide as much protection as mRNA boosters, or if it can provide substantial protection against recent omicron variants.

"We'll not see efficacy (infection prevention) data any time soon, but one would guess that this vaccine would provide enough stimulation in a booster format to benefit the host," Schooley said.

During the VRBPAC hearing on Novavax in June [2022], Offit said the company confirmed it was studying its vaccine as a booster in various scenarios including on top of mRNA vaccines. Indeed, on [31 May 2022], the company announced that it had initiated a phase III trial of its vaccine as a booster in people who previously got mRNA vaccines.

According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the study will evaluate booster doses of monovalent or bivalent versions of its vaccine, on top of at least 2 doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.

However, that study lists an expected completion date of July 2023 and is listed as "active, not recruiting."

The company is also participating in an ongoing NIH phase I/II "mix and match" trial evaluating fully vaccinated adults getting booster doses of different COVID vaccines. [https://ir.novavax.com/2022-03-25-Novavax-Announces-Participation-in-Two-Booster-Studies-Using-its-COVID-19-Vaccine]

Novavax told MedPage Today in an email that it presented preclinical trial data to VRBPAC showing that homologous boosting with the initial vaccine, an omicron BA.1-specific vaccine, or a bivalent vaccine, "generated antibody levels that were consistent with dosing regimens in the phase III clinical trial."

Fewer Side Effects, Broader Immunity?
-------------------------------------
Questions remain about some of the key reasons people would want to boost with Novavax -- notably, for potentially fewer side effects, or for potentially broader immunity.

Katelyn Jetelina, PhD, MPH, an epidemiologist at UTHealth in Dallas, noted in an earlier Substack post that based on existing data, a Novavax boost may not be as powerful as she would have hoped. [https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/novavax-is-here-just-not-the-silver]

A study in The Lancet showed that a single dose of an mRNA vaccine plus a single dose of Novavax didn't produce as robust an antibody response as 2 doses of mRNA, she said. [Arabella S V Stuart, Robert H Shaw, Xinxue Liu, et al. Immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of heterologous COVID-19 primary vaccination incorporating mRNA, viral-vector, and protein-adjuvant vaccines in the UK (Com-COV2): a single-blind, randomised, phase 2, non-inferiority trial. The Lancet 399 (10319): 36-49, 1 Jan 2022. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02718-5]

A paper in Science found comparable antibody responses between 3 doses of mRNA vaccines versus 2 doses of Novavax plus 1 dose of mRNA. [John E. Bowen, Amin Addetia, Ha V. Dang, et al. Omicron spike function and neutralizing activity elicited by a comprehensive panel of vaccines. Science 19 Jul 2022. First Release. DOI: 10.1126/science.abq0203]

Finally, another study in The Lancet showed 2 doses of mRNA plus a Novavax booster didn't provide an advantage in antibody response over other vaccine and booster combinations, Jetelina said.

"This study shows that combining can be advantageous for certain vaccines, but that doesn't seem to be the case for mRNA and Novavax," she wrote. [Alasdair P S Munro, Leila Janani, Victoria Cornelius, et al. Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) following two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK (COV-BOOST): a blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial. The Lancet 398 (10318): P2258-2276. 18 Dec 2021. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02717-3]

She did note that effects on durability remain to be seen. It could be that a Novavax booster on top of mRNA vaccines slows the rapid waning in protection against infection of these vaccines, but this is an open question.

For those who are hopeful about diminished side effects, there's even less evidence to go on, said Alex Sette, DrBiolSci, of La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California.

"Certainly it would be an interesting possibility, as it would be expected that the mechanisms that cause reactions may be different," he told MedPage Today in an email.

That said, he warned, he hasn't seen any data on side effects comparing these booster strategies. "I am not sure one can say that side effects are less," he said. "Some of the mRNA side effects are very rare and Novavax has been in relatively fewer people thus far, so a balanced comparison is currently difficult."

"It should be noted that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines seem to have different reaction patterns, so in that respect a mix-match approach could also be considered," he added.

Offit agreed that the side effect profile of boosting with Novavax is unknown: "Fever, headache, pain might not be better," he said. "We'll have to see."

Jetelina warned against any delays in getting a booster for authorized groups as the latest omicron variant surge continues: "For now, I don't recommend using Novavax off-label as a booster, or worse, waiting for a booster because Novavax is coming."

[2] Long COVID

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/07/persistent-brain-fog-hair-loss-highlighted-long-covid-studies


Two new studies describe long-COVID symptoms, with one finding that 53% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients still had cognitive impairment ("brain fog") 13 months after infection, and another adding conditions such as hair loss and sexual dysfunction to the list of persistent symptoms among outpatients.

The 1st study, by University of Oslo researchers in Norway, was published yesterday [26 Jul 2022] in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. The team used 4 computer-based cognitive tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery to assess 75 adult COVID-19 patients' cognitive function 13 months after release from a single hospital. Included patients were, on average, 55.7 years old and were admitted to the hospital up to June 2020. [Knut Stavem, MD, MPH, PhD, Gunnar Einvik, MD, PhD, Christofer Lundqvist, MD, PhD, Cognitive impairment 13 months after hospitalization for COVID-19, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 2022, ofac355, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac355]

The 4 tests were delayed matching to sample (DMS) (testing short-term memory, visuospatial processing, learning, and attention), the One-touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS) test (executive function), rapid visual-information processing (RVP) (sustained attention), and spatial working memory and strategy (SWM).

Rates of cognitive dysfunction were 25% on the DMS, 24% on the OTS, 21% on the RVP, and 14% on the SWM. Overall, 53% showed impairment on at least one of the 4 tests.

Severe COVID-19, as evidenced by the receipt of supplementary oxygen, was associated with a higher likelihood of impaired cognition on the DMS only (odds ratio [OR], 9.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 57.74). Adjusting for the presence of underlying diseases only slightly changed the ORs and didn't affect the significance.

The researchers said there may be several reasons behind the impairments, including causes other than COVID-19. "It is possible that this could be explained by premorbid conditions, living in the epidemic, or psychological sequelae; however, this could not be determined in the present study," they wrote. The findings "should be ascertained in larger studies and with even longer observation times."

In the 2nd study, published earlier this week in Nature Medicine, a team led by University of Birmingham researchers retrospectively mined a UK-based primary care database to determine if outpatients had any of 115 COVID-related symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks, as well as the risk factors for having lingering symptoms. [Subramanian, A., Nirantharakumar, K., Hughes, S. et al. Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults. Nat Med (2022). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01909-w]

The cohort included 486 149 adult COVID-19 survivors and 1 944 580 matched uninfected controls from January 2020 to April 2021, before the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant surge began.

A total of 56.6% of COVID-19 survivors tested positive in 2020, and 43.4% did so in 2021. Overall, 4.5% of survivors and 4.7% of controls had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine before the index date. The most common vaccines received were Pfizer/BioNTech (2.8%) and AstraZeneca/Oxford (1.7%).

COVID-19 survivors were more likely than controls to report more than one symptom after 12 weeks from the index date (1 symptom, 5.6% vs 4.7%; 2 symptoms, 3.6% vs 2.9%; and 3 or more, 4.9% vs 4.0%).

Sixty-two symptoms were significantly linked to long COVID, with the largest adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for loss of smell (aHR, 6.49), hair loss (3.99), sneezing (2.77), ejaculation difficulty (2.63), and reduced libido (2.36).

Among COVID-19 survivors, the risk factors for long COVID included female sex, younger age, non-White ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and a wide range of underlying illnesses.

The most common associated underlying conditions were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR, 1.55), enlarged prostate (1.39), fibromyalgia (1.37), anxiety (1.35), erectile dysfunction (1.33), depression (1.31), migraine (1.26), multiple sclerosis (1.26), celiac disease (1.25), and learning disability (1.24).

The most common symptoms were loss of smell, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, amnesia, apraxia (impaired ability to perform familiar movements or commands), bowel incontinence, erectile dysfunction, hallucinations, and swelling of the arms or legs.

"This research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of Long COVID are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions," senior author Shamil Haroon, MBChB, PhD, of the University of Birmingham, said in a university news release. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/959482]

"The symptoms we identified should help clinicians and clinical guideline developers to improve the assessment of patients with long-term effects from COVID-19, and to subsequently consider how this symptom burden can be best managed," he added.

The researchers called for research into the natural history of long COVID, characterization of persistent symptom clusters, and clinical outcomes. "Further research is also needed to understand the health and social impacts of these persistent symptoms, to support patients living with long-term sequelae and to develop targeted treatments," they concluded.

'This study is instrumental in creating and adding further value to understanding the complexity and pathology of long COVID. It highlights the degree and diversity of expression of symptoms between different clusters. Patients with pre-existing health conditions will also welcome the additional analysis on risk factors.'

How long is COVID infectious? What scientists know so far
---------------------------------------------------------
Those with SARS-CoV-2 are often advised to isolate for only a few days. But evidence is mounting that some people can continue to pass on the virus for much longer.

When the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) halved its recommended isolation time for people with COVID-19 to 5 days back in December [2021, it said that the change was motivated by science. Specifically, the CDC said that most SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of the illness, in the 1 to 2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 2 to 3 days after.

Many scientists disputed that decision then and they continue to do so. Such dissent is bolstered by a series of studies confirming that many people with COVID-19 remain infectious well into the 2nd week after they first experience symptoms. Reductions in the length of the recommended isolation period -- now common around the world -- are driven by politics, they say, rather than any reassuring new data.

"The facts of how long people are infectious for have not really changed," says Amy Barczak, an infectious-disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "There is not data to support 5 days or anything shorter than 10 days [of isolation]." Barczak's own research, published on the medRxiv preprint server, suggests that one-quarter of people who have caught the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 could still be infectious after 8 days(1).

A numbers game
--------------
Although the question is simple -- for how long is someone with COVID-19 contagious? -- experts caution that the answer is complicated. "We always think of it as a black and white thing ... if somebody's infectious or not infectious -- but in reality, it's a numbers game and a probability," says Benjamin Meyer, a virologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

And that numbers game has shifting rules and baselines. Emerging variants, vaccination and varying levels of natural immunity provoked by previous infection can all influence how quickly someone can clear the virus from their system, Meyer says, and this ultimately dictates when they stop being infectious. Behavioural factors matter as well. People who feel unwell tend to mix less with others, he adds, so the severity of someone's symptoms can influence how likely they are to infect others.

Something most scientists are confident about is that PCR tests can return a positive result even after someone is no longer infectious. This probably occurs when the tests, which detect viral RNA, pick up non-infectious remnants left behind after most of the live virus has been eliminated.

By contrast, lateral flow (or 'rapid antigen') tests offer a better guide to infectiousness, because they detect proteins produced by actively replicating virus.

"There's still all of these things that we're not exactly sure about, but if I had to sum it up in one very concise message, it would be that if you're antigen positive, you shouldn't go out and interact closely with people who you don't want to be infected," says Emily Bruce, a microbiologist and molecular geneticist at the University of Vermont in Burlington.

What about somebody who has tested negative on a lateral flow test for a few days but still has a fever and a hacking cough? Bruce says it's important to remember that although lingering symptoms might look and sound serious, they do not indicate continued infectiousness.

"You can definitely have symptoms for longer than you test positive on lateral flow," she says. "And I think that's because many of the symptoms are caused by the immune system and not directly by the virus itself."

Transmission tests
------------------
In countries such as the United Kingdom, the relaxation of the isolation guidelines coincided with the withdrawal of free lateral flow tests. So, assuming that many of the people who follow the new recommendations are going to stop isolating after 5 days without testing, scientists have been investigating in particular how many people with COVID-19 are likely to remain infectious after this point.

It's not practical to track direct onward transmission of the virus from large numbers of people and to measure how it reduces over time, so researchers instead rely on proxy measurements to determine the point at which they would expect people to stop being contagious.

Researchers with access to a high-security biosafety level 3 laboratory -- as Barczak has -- can do this by running experiments to test whether live SARS-CoV-2 can be cultured from samples taken from patients over several consecutive days.

"If you're still shedding virus that we can culture out of your nose, there's at least a good chance you're still infectious to other people," she says. As different variants have emerged and various research groups have done these experiments, Barczak says, a consensus has emerged that it's very unusual for people to shed culturable virus after 10 days. "So, it's very unusual for people to stay infectious after 10 days," she says.

Other studies take a step further away from the real world, and use levels of viral RNA measured by PCR tests to infer whether someone is infectious. This makes it easier to work with large sample sizes. For example, a project run by the Crick Institute and University College Hospital, both in London, can draw on PCR tests carried out on more than 700 participants, obtained from when symptoms developed.

A study based on this group suggests that significant numbers of people retain viral loads high enough to trigger onward infection at days 7 to 10, irrespective of the variant type or how many vaccine doses people had received. The study was published on the medRxiv preprint server on [10 Jul 2022](2).

"We're not measuring live virus, but there is now a huge amount of work in the literature that provides a pretty good mapping of what constitutes a viral load likely to yield infectious virus," says David LV Bauer, a virologist at the Crick Institute who is co-investigator on that study. "So while it's not a perfect picture, it's a reasonable one."

'Rebound phenomenon'
--------------------
Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease specialist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who has worked on similar PCR-based studies of infectiousness, agrees that 10 days is a useful rule of thumb for when people should no longer be contagious. But he cautions that a small number of people could still be infectious beyond that point.

Some such cases in the United States have been linked to the common antiviral drug Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir), he says. "There's a rebound phenomenon where people will see that their symptoms seem to resolve and they may even test negative on a rapid test, but then a few days later symptoms and the virus come back."

Barczak says this is one of the key questions that researchers are now studying. "Antivirals change the dynamics of symptoms, change the dynamics of the immune response and change the dynamics of how you shed," she says. "I think this is really important, because people are out in the world thinking they're not infectious after 10 days. But if they have Paxlovid rebound they might be."

[Control of virus spread depends on infected individuals testing themselves to determine when they become antigen negative and thus much less likely to transmit virus. The current general assumption that 5 days following onset of symptoms is sufficient time to isolate oneself from others is problematic, as some proportion of people will still be able to transmit virus. With the lack of personal protective measures being applied (e.g., masking, distancing), virus transmission will continue. - Mod.LK]
