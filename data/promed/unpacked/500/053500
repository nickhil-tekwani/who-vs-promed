At least 3 human anthrax cases have been reported in north-central China, including one fatality, according to a RFA report (computer translated).The outbreak of cutaneous anthrax is reported in 2 towns of Zhongwei City, Ningxia region where the patients had consumed tainted cow and mutton. The 2 surviving patients are currently hospitalized and stable.

Upon discovery of the cases, authorities quarantined the area and closed the livestock market.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the spore (or possibly the bacterium) enters a cut or abrasion on the skin. It starts out as a raised bump that looks like an insect bite. It then develops into a blackened lesion called an eschar that may form a scab. Lymph glands in the area may swell plus edema may be present. This form of anthrax responds well to antibiotics. If untreated, deaths can occur if the infection goes systemic. 95 percent of cases of anthrax are cutaneous.

[As they comment on human cases in 2 separate towns and the sources being a cow and mutton, I think we can assume that a butchered moribund cow in one town and at least one dead sheep, and probably more, in the other were the background to this report. If that were the case probably at least 2 dozen people were exposed and are receiving treatment, and this report covers only those hospitalised. - Mod.MJH
