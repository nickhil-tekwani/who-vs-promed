USA: outbreak of norovirus infection at Yellowstone National Park
-----------------------------------------------
More than 130 visitors and workers became ill in Yellowstone National Park
in late June 2004 during an outbreak of a highly infectious virus at Old
Faithful and Lake. The cause of the illnesses appears to be a norovirus, a
group of viruses that can cause stomach flu, also known as gastroenteritis.
It is the same virus that has affected hundreds on cruise ships, and,
caused earlier outbreaks at Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks.
The virus can cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramping.
Symptoms can come on quickly, and, usually, last one to 2 days. "We're very
nervous system-wide about this virus. Not because it's life-threatening or
severe, but because it's so prevalent," said Charles Higgins, director of
the National Park Service's Office of Public Health. Most of the afflicted
people in Yellowstone started getting sick during the last week of June
2004. Employees at a clinic in the Park noticed the upswing in
gastrointestinal problems and contacted authorities at Park Service
headquarters. Investigators said it appears that the virus spread
person-to-person, and, through contact with objects such as doorknobs. "It
doesn't look like it got into the food service systems, which is really
almost a miracle," Higgins said. "That probably means (the concession
company) did something well."
The outbreak wasn't surprising, especially at a place like Old Faithful,
where people often congregate in close proximity, Higgins said. It affected
concession employees the most, because they live in dormitories and share
facilities, he said. It's still unclear where the virus came from and
exactly how it spread, but Higgins said it doesn't take much for this virus
to rapidly spread. "You might have a visitor who came in ill with the virus
and threw up in their room. Then, the housekeeper cleans it up, that person
becomes ill, and they go back to the dorm, throw up there, and then boom,
50 other people are ill," Higgins said. Park officials said 53 visitors
became ill, together with 71 concession employees and 8 Park Service
workers. Most people were sick for only a day or so, and the outbreak
tapered off sharply by the 4th of July weekend.
Park officials, including a federal Public Health Service worker at
Yellowstone full time, responded quickly to the outbreak, and, got
cooperation from the Wyoming Department of Health and the concession
company, said Cheryl Matthews, a Yellowstone spokeswoman. Xanterra Parks
and Resorts, the concessions company, took extra steps, including wiping
down door handles and cleaning bathrooms more frequently, she said.
Norovirus makes an estimated 23 million people ill every year, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is most commonly
spread through eating contaminated food, touching contaminated surfaces,
and having direct contact with people with symptoms. "The virus, formerly
known as Norwalk virus, is very infectious and tends to take advantage of
people living [in close proximity]," Higgins said.
In recent years, there have been outbreaks at Yellowstone's Fishing Bridge
and at Grand Canyon. Higgins said this year's [2004] outbreak at
Yellowstone is in the "midrange in terms of size and length of time." 4
investigators interviewed people who became sick, took samples, and looked
over medical records. The information will be sent to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. In the next week or 2, a
report will be issued about the outbreak, including an examination of how
it spread and what steps could be taken for preventing a similar outbreak
in the future.

[The challenges of preventing and controlling such outbreaks in the park
cannot be overstated. This moderator was involved in investigating an
outbreak of probable norovirus gastroenteritis in Yellowstone National Park
in the late '70s, and at that time, there was a "floating" denominator at
risk within the park during the peak tourist period of approximately 35 000
individuals daily. This included park employees, concession employees and
visitors. Visitors included daytime only visitors who came for the day and
left to stay elsewhere, those who were staying at lodges within the park,
those who were camping at park campground areas and those staying in
personal recreational vehicles. The overnighting visitors were there for
varying lengths of stay with the majority estimated to be approximately 4
days (reflected by the revolving menu at the park restaurants -- a 4 day
cycle). Hence, the population at risk of infection is rather large, as is
the potential for reintroduction of infection with high volume of new
arrivals on a daily basis. As mentioned in the starting sentence -- the
challenges of preventing and controlling such outbreaks in the park cannot
be overstated. - Mod.MPP]

Australia: gastroenteritis outbreak in New South Wales strikes 6000
-----------------------------------------------
More than 6000 people in New South Wales (NSW) have been hit by a virus
infection in 2004, in what health authorities are calling a gastroenteritis
epidemic. NSW Health today [Tue 13 Jul 2004] warned that 2004's outbreak of
the highly infectious disease, caused by norovirus infection, had already
overtaken 2003's total of 3570 cases. Noroviruses cause severe vomiting and
diarrhea.
The health authority's communicable disease director, Dr. Jeremy McAnulty,
said the increased incidence of the virus was placing added pressure on
hospital emergency departments. He said elderly people in aged care homes
accounted for more than 71 per cent of cases reported. Nursing homes,
hospitals, child-care centers and schools were worst affected, with the
upsurge possibly due to better reporting practices within those institutions.
"The symptoms tend to be a sudden onset of pretty violent vomiting, and
nausea, and then diarrhea ... and sometimes you get muscle aches and
fever," Dr. McAnulty said. "Most people bounce back pretty quickly, but
it's really important that you drink lots of fluids so you rehydrate."
Dr. McAnulty said the gastroenteritis virus known as norovirus is
particularly prevalent in winter, and is spread following direct contact
with an infected person. Symptoms sometimes took up to 3 days to appear. In
the worst case, dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea could be fatal for
anyone who was frail, he said. But most people recovered within a few days.
"There's no specific treatment except for re-hydration," Dr. McAnulty said.
Exposure to the virus could be reduced by thoroughly washing hands before
handling and eating food and before [and after] using a toilet. Anyone
contracting the virus was urged to avoid preparing food for others until at
least 2 days after recovering, and, to stay at home.

[3] Norovirus outbreak, hospital based - UK (Scotland)

UK: Sickness bug closes 2 wards at Royal Alexandra Hospital
--------------------
2 wards at the Royal Alexandra Hospital have been closed after a new
outbreak of a nasty stomach bug which is attacking patients and staff.
An infection which causes vomiting and diarrhoea is spreading throughout
the Paisley hospital and has so far hit 43 people.
Now children have been banned from visiting any of the wards affected.
A total of 37 patients - many of whom are elderly - have been affected and
6 members of staff have all fallen ill as a result of the virus.
The bug means that NHS bosses have had to shut wards 4 and 7 - both of
which are care of the elderly wards - to new admissions.
Patients in another elderly ward at the hospital - ward 3 - have also
fallen ill, while patients in wards 11 and 14 - medical wards - have also
been affected.
It's the 2nd time in just a few months that RAH bosses have had to deal
with such an outbreak.
A similar bug swept through the hospital in March and April, with more than
100 people being affected that time.
And 4 of the wards that were affected then have also been hit by the bug
again. Patients in wards 3, 4, 7 and 14 were all struck down by the virus -
which usually affects people for 2 to 3 days.
Hospital chiefs have set up a special control-of-infection team to deal
with the outbreak, which began more than a week ago.
Mary Morgan, the service general manager, explained that a series of
measures had been brought in to try to stop the infection from spreading
further.
Youngsters under the age of 12 have been barred from visiting family and
friends in the 5 affected wards and people who have been ill in the last
week are also being urged not to visit.
Ms Morgan said: "Infection-control precautions are in place and we suggest
that anyone who has experienced symptoms of diarrhoea or vomiting within
the last 7 days should not visit the hospital. Within the affected ward
areas we can only permit 2 visitors per bed and no children under the age
of 12 should visit."
She added: "The hospital's control of infection team is monitoring the
outbreak daily. The wards will be re-opened once we are sure that the
infection is clear - at least 48 hours after the last patient showed any
symptoms.
"We are providing visitors to each of the wards affected with relevant
information on the outbreak of infection."

[4] Viral gastroenteritis, shellfish - New Zealand (Bay of Islands)

New Zealand: Sewage virus in food supply
----------------------
An ESR scientist confirmed that viruses found in sewage have been
identified in shellfish at 2 sites in the Bay of Islands.
People are reporting bouts of food poisoning from pipi and cockles in Te
Haumi and Waitangi and the shellfish are being tested as part of a 3 year
study.
Gail Greening said samples taken at the sites earlier this year show the
presence of viruses that cause gastroenteritis.
Greening said the study is testing shellfish from around New Zealand for
viruses and other organisms that could be used as an indicator that viruses
are present.
Health protection officer, Tahi Morton, says people should not eat pipis,
cockles or other kaimoana from Opua to Te Haumi, for at least a month.
He says pollution in the area is ongoing, and signs which warn against
eating shellfish should stay up indefinitely until the water quality improves.
But for one Bay of Islands woman the warning is not new.
She has been campaigning for years against sewage pollution saying her
people are regularly poisoned by it.
She says testing since January has repeatedly found sewage viruses in
shellfish that many Maori depend on to feed their families.
The viruses found in shellfish around Paihia and Waitangi can cause
symptoms including severe vomiting and diarrhoea. [While the organism isn't
specified it is likely to be a member of the norovirus family. - Mod.MPP]
