On 9 Mar 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 59 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 17 fatal cases. Onset dates ranged from 21 Jan to 25 Feb 2015. Below is a breakdown of the 59 cases included in this notification by epidemiological week of symptom onset:

- Week 4 (19 - 25 Jan 2015) 5 cases
- Week 5 (26 Jan - 1 Feb) 13 cases
- Week 6 (2 - 8 Feb) 9 cases
- Week 7 (9 - 15 Feb) 15 cases
- Week 8 (16 - 22 Feb) 14 cases
- Week 9 (24 - 25 Feb) 3 cases

Of these 59 cases, 44 (75 per cent) were male. The majority (49 cases, 83 per cent) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of 6 cases is unknown or unavailable. Three family clusters were reported, each comprising 2 cases; 4 of the 6 cases had exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; one case had no exposure to poultry, and one case is still under investigation. Cases were reported from 9 provinces: Anhui (4), Fujian (1), Guangdong (35), Guizhou (1), Hunan (2), Jiangsu (3), Jiangxi (1), Shanghai (1), and Zhejiang (11).

The Chinese government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- Strengthen epidemiological and etiological monitoring and situation analysis.
- Strengthen case management and medical treatment.
- Further strengthen measures like disinfection of commercial live poultry markets, closure of live poultry markets in places where infections occurred, and promotion of centralized slaughter and frozen products.
- Provide information to the public.

WHO is monitoring the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not appear to have the ability to transmit easily among humans.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.

[This is a big jump in the number of reported avian influenza H7N9 cases, perhaps because confirmatory testing has now been completed on this group of patients. The level of activity in 2015 is concerning. Researchers have presented evidence of the genetic diversity and continual evolution of the H7N9 virus in Mainland China. The virus circulating in the "2nd wave," 2014, differed genetically from the virus circulating in the "1st wave," 2013. At least 26 separate genotypes were reported to have emerged as of June 2014, and now in 2015, 48 genotypes are reported (see reference below). As the number of influenza genotypes circulating increases, there is an increasing chance for reassortment with other influenza viruses in birds in the case of H7N9, but also swine in the case of swine flu.

The authors of a new paper in Nature that sequenced isolates of avian influenza H7N9 conclude: "This expansion of the genetic diversity of influenza viruses in China means that unless effective control measures are in place, such as permanent closure of live poultry markets, central slaughtering and preventing inter-regional poultry transportation during disease outbreaks, and backed by systematic surveillance, it is reasonable to expect the H7N9 and other viruses to persist and cause a substantial number of severe human infections. H7 is the only subtype, other than the pandemic subtypes, that has been established in mammals (Equine-1, H7N7)26. Therefore, H7N9 viruses should be considered as a major candidate to emerge as a pandemic strain in humans." - Lam TT-Y, Zhou B, Wang J et al. 2015. Dissemination, divergence and establishment of H7N9 influenza viruses in China. Nature Letter doi:10.1038/nature14348 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14348.html).

Abstract
-------
Since 2013, the occurrence of human infections by a novel avian H7N9 influenza virus in China has demonstrated the continuing threat posed by zoonotic pathogens 1, 2. Although the 1st outbreak wave that was centered on eastern China was seemingly averted, human infections recurred in October 2013. It is unclear how the H7N9 virus re-emerged and how it will develop further; potentially it may become a long-term threat to public health. Here we show that H7N9 viruses have spread from eastern to southern China and become persistent in chickens, which has led to the establishment of multiple regionally distinct lineages with different reassortant genotypes. Repeated introductions of viruses from Zhejiang to other provinces and the presence of H7N9 viruses at live poultry markets have fuelled the recurrence of human infections. This rapid expansion of the geographical distribution and genetic diversity of the H7N9 viruses poses a direct challenge to current disease control systems. Our results also suggest that H7N9 viruses have become enzootic in China and may spread beyond the region, following the pattern previously observed with H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses.
