An outbreak of acute intestinal infection has been registered in the
western Siberian Sverdlov region, a spokesman for the Russian Sanitary and
Epidemic Inspection Service said on Friday.
The outbreak occurred in the village of Kalinovka in the Kirov district,
the spokesman told Itar-Tass. It affected 150 people, including 105
children aged below 14. Among the other diseased are servicemen of a
communication regiment which is stationed in the village. By Friday, 54
people have been taken to hospital.
Epidemiologists believe the disease was caused by a breakdown at a local
sewerage pump station which resulted in sewage penetrating into a nearby
artesian well, the spokesman said.
Doctors are currently working to localise and eliminate the outbreak, he
added.
