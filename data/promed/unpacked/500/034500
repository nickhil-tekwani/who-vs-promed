[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland West)

There has been a rise in the number of cholera cases in President
Robert Mugabe's home district in Zvimba in northern Zimbabwe.

This is the worst time of the year for a cholera outbreak, as heavy
rains can spread cholera bacteria through water sources. Health
workers in Zvimba said that locals who should be using chlorine
tablets to protect themselves are refusing to do so because they do
not like the smell.

Up to 69 cholera cases have been detected so far in the Zvimba
district. Two treatment camps have been set up, and the authorities
insist they are much better prepared than they were during the 2008
outbreak.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Copperbelt)

Ndola has recorded the 1st cholera case since the onset of the rainy
season, District Health Management Team (DHMT) director Kapungwe
Simpungwe and District Commissioner Joshua Mutisa have said.

Mr Mutisa said a 4-year-old boy from Kawama Township tested positive
to cholera after being subjected to laboratory tests. He said the
results were certified by authorities from the DHMT and Tropical
Diseases Research Centre and that the patient was quarantined at
Arthur Davison Children's Hospital.

Mr Mutisa said the boy was suspected to have contracted the disease
from his neighborhood which has uncared-for pit latrines. He said the
DHMT had dispatched people to disinfect the pit latrines with lime and
that chlorine was also being distributed to people to purify their
drinking water from wells. Mr Mutisa called on the people to observe
hygiene as a way of preventing cholera.

[3] Cholera - Somalia (Ogaden)

<http://www.ogaden.com/hornnews/ogaden/1016-cholera-outbreak-in-fiiq.html>


Reports reaching our service desk from reliable sources in the town of
Fiq and its environs confirm the outbreak of cholera in the area. Many
people have died as a result of this outbreak of cholera. Up to the
time of going to press with this report, there has been no emergency
medical aid provided to the dwellers of Fiq town and its environs.

The cholera outbreak in the area started about a month ago; however,
due to the ongoing blockade of the movement of both people and goods
in all of Ogaden, it has been difficult to get accurate information
from the area before now.

Our reporter who traveled to the area on foot indicated that the lack
of clean drinking water and the un-availability of basic medical
necessities such as glucose have exacerbated the situation. Our source
indicated that many people who could have survived this cholera
outbreak are dying because of the lack of clean water.

[5] Diarrhea - Maldives

The northern islands of the Maldives are experiencing an epidemic
outbreak of diarrhea. An announcement issued by the Centre for
Community Health and Disease Control (CCHDC) said garbage was found on
the beaches of the islands causing a lack of cleanliness and a rapid
increase in the housefly population.

The centre stressed that steps such preventing flies from
contaminating food, drinking chlorinated or boiled water, safe
disposal of garbage, and keeping the islands clean have to be taken to
prevent such diseases.

[6] Diarrhea - Panama

Panama's health authorities are concerned about an increase in
diarrhea cases in recent days, coinciding with measures taken to
prevent cholera. The head of the emergency room in Hospital Santo
Tomas, Nestor Vega, confirmed there had been an increase in the number
of severe acute diarrheal cases in December 2010 attributed to
increased consumption of street food.

Consequently, he added, people should be careful where they eat,
especially now when there is a shortage of drinking water in many
parts of the country. Through November 2010, the Department of
Epidemiology, Ministry of Health had recorded 197 985 cases of acute
diarrhea in the country compared to 164 487 in 2009.
