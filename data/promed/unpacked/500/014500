Longitude Prize is a challenge with a GBP 10m [USD 15.3 million] prize fund aiming to conserve antibiotics for future generations, revolutionising global healthcare. It commemorates the 300th anniversary of the Longitude Act of 1714, the first British challenge prize, to determine longitude at sea. In June 2014 the public decided the focus of the new Longitude Prize, the UK's biggest science prize, to be antibiotic resistance.

To win, teams must develop a point-of-care test that will identify when antibiotics are needed and, if they are, which ones to use. It must provide a result within 30 minutes, be affordable to everyone who needs it, be accurate enough to inform treatment decisions and be easy to use in any location, anywhere in the world.

The first few submissions to the GBP10 million Longitude Prize have been made by registered competitors around the world. The submissions will be tested and evaluated over the next 18 months, during which we hope to see more registered teams delivering an application at 1 of the next submission dates, every 4 months throughout the 5-year period.

The Longitude Prize was developed and is being run by Nesta, being supported by Innovate UK, the new name for the Technology Strategy Board, as funding partner. Entries are assessed by the Prize Advisory Panel and the Prize is overseen by the Longitude Committee chaired by Lord Martin Rees and including Dame Sally Davies, and Professors Peter Piot and Jeremy Farrar.
