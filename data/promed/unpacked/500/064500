Spain - epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus
-------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 14 Nov 2022
Confirmed: 17 Nov 2022
Reported: 21 Nov 2022 [see epidemiological comments]
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location 1: El Pedroso, Cazalla de la Sierra, Sevilla, Andalusia
Started: 14 Nov 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 1098 / 6 / - / - / - / -

Outbreak location 2: Jimena de la Frontera, Campo de Gilbraltar, Cadiz, Andalusia
Started: 15 Nov 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 139 / 6 / - / - / - / -

Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors

Epidemiological comments: Note: The report date indicates 23 Nov [2022]; however, this immediate notification was initially sent by Spain on 21 Nov [2022]. Due to a technical problem, the report had to be re-entered, hence a later date (automatically assigned by the system at the time of creation).

Control measures at event level, domestic animals: movement control, control of vectors

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Algete Central veterinary laboratory / cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 17 Nov 2022 / positive

[The location of the outbreaks in Andalusia can be seen on the interactive map included in the WOAH report at the source URL above.

Please note that any discrepancies in event start, confirmation, and other dates in ProMED posts and the WOAH corresponding reports are the result of a technical problem already being addressed by WOAH. - Mod.CRD]

[Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is caused by a virus (EHDV) of the family Reoviridae, genus _Orbivirus_; there are 8 or more EHDV serotypes. The virus demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with other members of the genus _Orbivirus_, such as bluetongue virus (which has at least 28 serotypes), and is similarly vectorborne, transmitted between ruminant hosts by the same species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Infections, transmitted by the said vectors, are strongly seasonal. In the Mediterranean Basin countries and the Middle East, the vector active season is mostly July to December, peaking September to November.

Spain's Andalusia has become the third European territory suffering EHD in cattle. Prior to the current event in Spain, outbreaks have been reported, during the current season from Italy's islands Sicily and Sardinia. The reported start dates were 24 and 28 Oct 2022, respectively. Earlier, EHD was reported from Tunisia, where outbreaks started in August 2022. During the 2021 season, EHD started in Tunisia in October and was found to be caused by EHDV serotype 8. No case of EHDV infection has been reported in Europe before 2022. The serotyping results of the current (2022) outbreaks in Tunisia, Sardinia, Sicily, and Andalusia are pending.

Notably, the current EHD outbreaks in Spain and Italy have been preceded by outbreaks of bluetongue virus serotypes 4 and 3 in Spain and Italy, respectively. Most BTV serotypes cause clinical disease in sheep, sporadically in cattle. Difference between the clinical signs caused by BTV and EHDV in cattle are rather indiscernible. It has been suggested that both BTV and EHDV have been transmitted to the European territories by airborne vectors from the African continent/Maghreb.

EU member states and some non-members have been applying vaccination against certain serotypes of bluetongue virus, according to EU's regime. Similar policy may be considered in relation to EHD, to control its further spread within the affected territories and beyond. At present, no licensed vaccine against EHD in cattle is commercially available. - Mod.AS
