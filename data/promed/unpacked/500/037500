In a previous post Dr. Michael A. Sauni sought the opinions of contributors
to ProMED-mail on the potential role of refugees in the introduction of West
Nile virus into the USA. Mod. JW suggested that since the strain of West
Nile virus associated with the current outbreak in the New York region
resembled a recent strain isolated from a goose in Israel, it was unlikely
that the virus was introduced by refugees from the Balkans war zone.
Apart from the fact that the strain is not [an Eastern European [strain of
West Nile virus, another fact arguing against this source of introduction
is that if refugees were a significant origin, you would have expected the
disease to appear in other areas where refugees had been brought in (i.e.
Eastern Canada).
