Positive serologies have now confirmed dengue as the virus responsible
for a cluster of febrile illnesses with classic dengue fever symptoms
occurring in residents of East Maui. Confirmed cases included both
children and adults who have not recently traveled from the island. In
the past 6 months there have been 2 separate cultural exchange
programs between east Maui residents and Tahiti, and although other
sources of importation are possible, clinical histories suggest Tahiti
as the most probable source.
The dengue fever outbreak on east Maui was initially located in
Nahiku, a remote district on the northeast corner of Maui. The
topography is a tropical rain forest on a hillside running down to the
coastline. The area has abundant indigenous vegetation, many
introduced plants, and commercial tropical flowers including
bromeliads. Numerous streams are scattered over the hillside. In a
brief survey of the lower Makapippi Stream we noted no flowing water,
many small pools (50 cm to 2 m diameter) with standing water, with
approximately 5% of these having abundant mosquito larvae. _Aedes
aegypti_ was eliminated from Maui in the 1940's and _A. albopictus_ is
the predominant mosquito in East Maui.
While public health authorities are attempting to contain the
outbreak,we believe some aspects of this situation are unique and
challenging: rural rain forest containing a moderately dense and
mobile rural population.
We would appreciate information regarding the following:
1. descriptions of campaigns against rural dengue fever epidemics;
2. entomologic suggestions on vector controls; and
3. data concerning prevalence rates of asymptomatic viremic persons
during outbreaks.
We are aware of studies of urban dengue in Singapore showing high
seropositivities in persons who could not recall symptoms. If this
can be generalized, using symptomatic cases as markers of disease
spread / containment may inaccurately represent the evolving epidemic.
