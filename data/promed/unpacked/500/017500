During the epidemiological week number 25, 12 cases and 2 deaths were
reported from Mahurissi village, Namuno district, Cabo Delgado province in
Mozambique. A national team went to assess the epidemiological situation
and implement control activities. Cabo Delgado province was affected since
1996 by a meningococcal meningitis epidemic and since then, the Ministry of
Health (MoH) has implemented control activities. In 1997 the province was
affected but in less magnitude because prevention activities and this year
we are expecting an outbreak. The MoH started preparedness measures since
February 1998. Thus we consider the 12 cases in Namuno as a normal
epidemiological trend of the disease, however the MoH acts as [if it were
an epidemic.
Up to the epidemiological week number 26 a total of 45 cases and 9 deaths
were reported from Cabo Delgado province. During 1996 and 1997, a total of
3,700 and 544 cases were reported in this province respectively. I think we
should be more careful in dealing with the incomplete epidemiological
information.
