The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), or Folkehelseinstituttet, reported the 1st death in a child from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) from E. coli in more than a decade. The child, from Oslo municipality, was under 2 years of age. The source of the infections was not published.

Hilde Marie Lund, with the NIPH, said deaths in children related to HUS caused by EHEC infection are very unusual. In fact, the last death was reported in 2009, Dr Lund noted.

In 2019, 511 cases of EHEC infections were reported to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, of which 10 developed the serious complication HUS. So far in 2020, there has been a reduction in infectious diseases reported to MSIS, also for EHEC infections. This is probably due to infection control measures in connection with COVID-19.

So far in 2020, FHI has registered 169 EHEC infections, of which 4 cases have been registered by HUS, 2 of these notified in July 2020.

EHEC can cause diarrhea, which is sometimes bloody. This can last for 4-10 days in adults and somewhat longer in children. In rare cases, some forms of the EHEC bacterium cause serious complications in the form of the severe kidney disease hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The disease most often affects children and is due to the fact that some EHEC bacteria produce toxins that attack kidney tissue.

Health officials say EHEC infection can be prevented by good hand hygiene and the following:
- Cook all hamburger meat well.
- Whole pieces of meat (beef, roast, fillet, and the like) should be well cooked on the surface.
- Avoid non-disinfected drinking water.
- Avoid unpasteurized milk and products made from unpasteurized milk.
- Vegetables and salads that are to be eaten raw should be rinsed well.
- Imported frozen berries, herbs, minimais [mini corn], sugar peas, and asparagus should be heat treated.
- Store food at cooling temperature (4 deg C [39 deg F]); remember a cool box in the summer heat.
- Wash hands after using the toilet, after contact with animals, and before cooking and eating.
- Wash knives, cutting sensors, and kitchen utensils that have been contaminated with raw materials, before using the equipment for other food.

[In 2019, Norway reported a cluster of unusual EHEC cases that may have been O80:H2. The serotype of this case is not stated.

EHEC strain serotype O80:H2 has been described in Soysal N, Mariani-Kurkdjian P, Smail Y, et al. Enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ hybrid pathotype O80:H2 as a new therapeutic challenge. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 9: 1604-12, which brought forth more information regarding this unusually invasive hybrid EHEC. This hybrid contains a rare variant of the intimin gene and genetic determinants related to a plasmid, found mostly in avian pathogenic _E. coli_ and _E. coli_ that causes human neonatal meningitis, which is associated with extraintestinal virulence. This group, led by Stephane Bonacorsi, originally reported this atypical organism in an adult associated with HUS with a relapse associated with bacteremia (Mariani-Kurkdjian P, Lemaire C, Bidet P, et al. Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome with bacteraemia caused by a new hybrid _Escherichia coli_ pathotype. New Microbes New Infect. 2014; 2(4): 127-131).

The 2016 study reported that 96% of the cases were associated with HUS, but the authors do point out that the surveillance system for EHEC is voluntary in France, and PCR assays for Shiga toxin in stool are only done in cases involving diarrhea with HUS suspicion, so the denominator of total O80:H2 cases is not known. Likewise, whether this organism is zoonotic is also not clear, and the areas in France with this strain are not where most cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported.

Regarding the use of antimicrobials, the issue is relevant in these cases, since some of them are associated with bacteremia that requires antimicrobial therapy. In this study, azithromycin and ceftriaxone were not associated with increasing Shiga toxin production, whereas ciprofloxacin was. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, therapy was also used, especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain-specific is not clear at this time, so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain was a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and was not thought to be a zoonosis.

Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC will indeed introduce another layer of concern about these infections. - Mod.LL
