A donkey owner reported to Radio Dabanga from Nierteti that last week a mysterious disease broke out in the locality.

"More than 40 donkeys died, 32 around Nierteti town, and 10 at Khor Ramla. Suddenly, the donkeys could not eat or drink anymore and started shivering. After a day or 2, they fell dead," the donkey owner explained.

Veterinary authorities in the locality have confirmed that so far the causes of the disease are unknown. "They said that they would take samples of the infected donkeys to send for tests in Central Darfur's capital of Zalingei."

On 24 Feb [2014], Radio Dabanga reported that an unknown disease had spread among donkeys in the Nierteti South camp for the displaced. Of the then 146 animals infected, 36 died within a week. The symptoms were coughing, weakness, [lack of] appetite, and weight loss. Veterinary authorities advised vaccinating the donkeys, but the displaced could not afford the vaccination costs.

Radio Dabanga reported on 12 Feb [2014] that about 75 percent of the children living in Deleig camp, Central Darfur were infected with a mysterious disease. The disease affected children below the age of 12 years and donkeys. Four days later, 15 children and 47 donkeys had died.

[The apparent synchronic occurrence of a health problem in children and donkeys could be coincidental; otherwise, a common cause (biological or otherwise) should be sought. One of the etiologies which deserve to be taken into consideration in relation to the signs described in donkeys is botulism.

In any event, in view of the stubborn repetition of such information, investigation by a science-based international body (e.g. representatives in Darfur of FAO? WHO? Doctors/Veterinarians Without Borders?) is certainly clearly needed. - Mod.AS
