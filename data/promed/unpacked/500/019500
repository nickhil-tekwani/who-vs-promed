Antibodies against H5 and H9 Avian Influenza among Poultry Workers in China
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human infection with the H5N1 or H9N2 avian
influenza virus has been reported in the city of
Guangzhou in southern China [1,2]. To assess the
risk of avian influenza virus infection among
humans, we conducted a serologic surveillance
study in Guangzhou. A total of 2191 healthy
persons were recruited from 230 workplaces and 7
types of occupations from March 2007 through July
2008. This study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Guangzhou Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, and written informed
consent was obtained from the subjects.

Serum samples obtained from these subjects were
assayed for antibodies against H5 and H9 avian
influenza virus with a
hemagglutination-inhibition assay containing 4
hemagglutination units of inactivated H5N2 virus
strain A/Turkey/England/N28/1973 and H9N2 virus
strain A/Chicken/Shandong/6/1996. The results
were further confirmed, as described previously
[2,3], by means of a neutralization assay against
100 tissue-culture infective doses of H5N1
strains A/Hong Kong/486/1997 and
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and H9N2 strain HK/2108/2003.

The prevalence of anti-H5 antibodies was 0.2
percent and the prevalence of anti-H9 antibodies
was 4.5 percent. [The data in this and subsequent
paragraphs are presented also in tabulated form
in the original text, which readers should
consult for further information. - Mod.CP] All
anti-H5­positive persons were poultry retailers
or wholesalers, but anti-H9­positive persons were
identified in all study groups in this cohort. It
has been reported that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses were
co-circulating among poultry and humans in
markets [4]. Our results show that the positive
rate of anti-H5 antibodies was much lower than
that of anti-H9 antibodies among poultry
retailers (0.8 percent versus. 15.5 percent, P
greater than 0.001) and among wholesalers (0.8
percent versus 6.6 percent, P equal to 0.001).
This difference may be attributed to the wide use
of H5 vaccine in poultry, whereas vaccination
against H9 is not available. In addition, H9
avian influenza virus infection in poultry is
usually asymptomatic and associated with virus
shedding. Given that reassortant of H9N2 with
other subtypes of avian influenza virus has been
reported to occur in southern China [5], our
finding highlights the potential risk of H9 avian
influenza virus to public health.

The anti-H9­positive rate was highest among
poultry retailers (15.5 percent); this rate was
significantly higher than the rate among the
other 6 groups (P greater than or equal to
0.006). The significantly higher anti-H9­positive
rate among poultry retailers than among other
retailers in the same markets (15.5 percent
versus 1.8 percent, P greater than 0.001) may be
due to the direct contact of poultry retailers
with live birds, particularly during the
slaughter of poultry. It also suggests that
transmission of H9 avian influenza virus in the
markets was mainly through poultry-to-human but not human-to-human contact.

The anti-H9­positive rate was also significantly
higher among poultry retailers than among
wholesalers (15.5 percent versus 6.6 percent, P
equal to 0.002). This difference may be
attributed to the fact that retailers purchased
different species of poultry from multiple
wholesalers; thus, control of poultry-to-poultry
transmission of avian influenza virus in markets
with live poultry may be important to the
prevention of avian influenza virus infection in humans.

[Among 301 members of the general population 4
(1.3 percent) were anti-H9 positive and none
anti-H5 positive. Given that reassortant of H9N2
with other subtypes of avian influenza virus has
been reported to occur in southern China, the
authors suggest that their finding highlights a
potential risk of H9 avian influenza virus to
public health. The rarity of anti-H5 responses
may be a consequence of the widespread use of
anti-H5 vaccine in poultry. Despite the
relatively high frequency of anti-H9 antibodies,
the authors interpret their data to indicate that
transmission of H9 avian influenza virus in the
markets was mainly through poultry-to-human but not human-to-human contact.
