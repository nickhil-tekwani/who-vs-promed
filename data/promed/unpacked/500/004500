NJ State officials report human death from rabies
-------------------------------------------------
A 73-year-old woman who tested positive for rabies died Wednesday [20
Jul 2011] at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, The New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services reported. This is the state's
1st case of human rabies infection since 1997, when a Warren County
man died after removing several bats from his home and failing to seek
medical attention. Before that, the state's last human rabies case was
in 1971.

The 73-year-old woman was bitten by a dog in her native Haiti in
April [2011]. She developed neurological symptoms on 25 Jun 2011 and
had been hospitalized since 2 Jul 2011. She could have been infectious
as of 11 Jun 2011, officials said. New Jersey DHHS [Department of
Health and Human Services] and US Centers for Disease Control
officials are accessing the level of exposure among the woman's
family, health care workers at the hospital, and others.

CDC testing on Wednesday [20 Jul 2011] confirmed the patient was
infected with a rabies strain related to an individual infected in
Haiti several years ago.

"The risk of infection to health care workers and others who may have
been in contact with the patient is extremely low," said Acting Health
and Senior Services Commissioner Dr Tina Tan. "Given the infection
control precautions used in hospitals, exposures should be very
minimal."

Rabies is a deadly virus found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is
transmitted by a bite, scratch, or contact with infected saliva via
exposure to an open cut or wound. Initial symptoms can include fever,
pain at the site of the bite, lethargy, lack of appetite, nausea, and
vomiting. The incubation period is usually one to 3 months, but may be
longer. After the illness progresses to the point of encephalitis the
disease is almost always fatal. Rabies can be prevented with a dose of
immune globulin and a series of vaccinations.

Rabies cases in humans are rare in the US. Most are caused by contact
with bats or [as in this case] animal bites received in other
countries. In New Jersey, raccoons and bats carry the virus and cats
account for the vast majority of domestic animal rabies cases.

In 2010, there was one human rabies case in Louisiana, attributed to
exposure in Mexico. In 2009, there were 4 human cases diagnosed in the
US; one diagnosed in Virginia was attributed to a dog bite that
occurred in India. The other 3 were bat exposures in Texas, Indiana,
and Michigan. A stray cat captured on Sturgis Road in Kendall Park
tested positive for rabies on 24 Jun 2011.

[From 2007-2009, Haiti had the highest number of human rabies cases
transmitted via dogs in the Americas as well as persistent rabies in
the mongoose population. Repercussions after the earthquake have
included widespread breakdown in infrastructure and the administration
of essential health services. Many Haitians remain injured, homeless,
and living in tent cities. Similarly, many dogs in Haiti have also
been displaced, left without food and basic veterinary care. Such
conditions exacerbate the rabies situation and enhance the
opportunities for dog bites to occur. Given the enzootic nature of
rabies in Haiti, and the increased risk for canine and other animal
bites, improved awareness of rabies should be promoted when assessing
Haitian patients, immigrants, and refugees (see: CDC document --
Assessing Haitian patients, immigrants, and refugees for rabies, 28
May 2011,
http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/news/2010-03-01.html).

It is not stated in the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services report whether or not the deceased woman had received
post-exposure prophylactic treatment in Haiti, but it seems unlikely
in view of the prevailing conditions and her subsequent history. It is
unclear when she entered the United States, subsequent to her exposure
in April 2011.

Transmission of rabies virus infection occurs when virus is
introduced into a bite wound, open cuts in the skin, or onto mucous
membranes (such as the mouth or eyes). The CDC opinion is that
non-bite exposures from animals rarely cause rabies. Viral
contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes, or
theoretically, scratches constitutes non-bite exposures. Consequently
the risk of transmission of rabies virus infection from the victim to
her family members, other contacts, and medical staff involved in her
care is remote.
