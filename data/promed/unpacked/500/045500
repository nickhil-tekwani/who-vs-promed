We thank ProMED-mail for the opportunity to make a few corrections to the post (archive no. 20181202.6176860) and add some information for your readers.

Like herpesvirus in humans, elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) is a lifelong infection that often does not cause serious clinical illness. There may be occasional skin lesions due to EEHV or gammaherpesviruses (more often in African elephants and only rarely in Asian elephants), but these have not been seen associated with the serious EEHV hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD). At this time, we do not know where EEHV goes in latency, but blood cells are a possibility.

It is unknown at this time why some calves become ill from EEHV-HD, and some calves are exposed to the virus without illness. Suspected factors include variations in calf immunity or viral virulence, with the cause likely being multifactorial. Treatment at this time includes antivirals and supportive care, such as rectal or IV fluids, and IV plasma transfusions. Early detection is key, before there are clinical signs, through weekly blood PCR testing. Early treatment, prior to clinical illness, is currently the only option for helping elephants survive hemorrhagic disease. A vaccine, if developed, would decrease severity of disease, but would not prevent transmission.

Asian and African elephants get different subtypes of the EEHV: Asian elephants typically get EEHV1, EEHV4, and EEHV5, while African elephants typically get EEHV2, EEHV3, EEHV6, and EEHV7. These subtypes have most likely co-evolved with their elephant species over millions of years. It is not thought that EEHV1 in Asian elephants is due to a cross-over from African elephants. The original finding of EEHV1 in a few African elephant samples has not been repeated and was most likely due to laboratory contamination.

The National Elephant Herpes Laboratory, started in 2004, has provided diagnostic testing for the USA and more recently has been increasing EEHV testing capacity in the elephant range countries. Johns Hopkins University has been instrumental in elucidating the genetics of EEHV. Starting in 2009, Baylor College of Medicine and the Houston Zoo have teamed up to fight EEHV; their diagnostic tests are now used worldwide, and their work on the immune response to EEHV is being used towards the development of a vaccine. Internationally, colleagues in Europe, Asia, and Africa are also doing research into therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics; the collaborative response to this disease has been inspiring.
