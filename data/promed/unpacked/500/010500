Introduction
------------
A haemorrhagic disease occurred in 52 calves from 42 farms in Germany.
At the age of about 2 to 3 weeks, calves had conspicuous, spontaneous
transcutaneous petechiae and haemorrhages in mucosal surfaces as well
as excessive bleeding associated with trauma.

Results
-------
Blood analysis revealed a marked thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and
granulocytopenia. Severe haemorrhages in the skin and gastrointestinal
tract were the major findings at post-mortem examination. Histological
investigation indicated a severe bone marrow hypoplasia/aplasia.
Infections with bacteria, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, or bluetongue
virus were ruled out. Specific toxins such as Furazolidone, DCVC
metabolites or mycotoxins were not detected. Pedigree analysis gave no
indication for heredity of this syndrome. Using a broad-spectrum PCR,
a circovirus with high similarities to porcine circovirus type 2b
(PCV2b), was detected in several of the affected calves.

Conclusion
----------
The distinct cause of the disease still remains unknown. Potentially,
the pathogenesis is complex and includes components such as infection,
hereditary disposition, and immune-mediated destruction of blood cell
precursors. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the role
of PCV2.

[In the context of the data above on several positive PCRs for
circovirus, reference deserves to be made to the recent comment of
Prof Jeanne Brugere-Picoux (ENVA, Maisons-Alfort, France): "If we
consider comparative pathology, it is possible that an
immunodepressive virus with medullar aplasia and hemorrhagic syndrome
may be involved, like a circovirus (such as chicken anemia virus or
sometimes porcine circovirus); see ProMED-mail post 20091006.3465

Further details are anticipated, including the percentage of positives
among the tested samples, and the results of PCR for circovirus in the
other affected European countries.

Regarding circovirus in pigs, subscribers are referred to the recent
ProMED-mail post 20091004.3453, which addressed circovirus in Swiss
swine. - Mod.AS]

VLA investigates cause of fatal bleeding calf syndrome
------------------------------------------------------
The UK Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) is working with others to
discover the still unknown cause of blood sweating disease, also known
as idiopathic haemorrhagic diathesis of calves or fatal bleeding calf
syndrome.

[Signs]
-------
Recently similar cases were reported in Scotland, England, Germany,
Belgium, and The Netherlands and may possibly be ascribed to one new
emerging disease. Clinical signs in calves include bleeding from
apparently intact skin and also from injection and ear tagging sites
together with signs of bleeding from visible mucous membranes, nose
and rectum. Once affected calves usually die. Only calves less than 4
weeks old are affected.

Cause
-----
The [signs] are caused by an almost complete destruction of the bone
marrow. This seems to be occurring at or around the time of birth. The
cause is not yet known. To date no infectious agent (known or novel)
likely to have caused the condition has been identified in any of the
tissues of affected calves [but see German findings in item 1. -Mod.AS]

Actions
-------
VLA and the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) attempt to
comprehensively record and investigate the condition. Their research
is designed to identify the potential factors which might be causing
the disease.

The Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group, which
routinely meets to assess any risks to human health from emerging
diseases, has been briefed and is considering the available data.

UK vets are requested to submit calves to their local VLA or SAC
laboratory for a full examination.

For more information and images of affected calves, visit the Q&A page
on the VLA website [see item 3].

Blood sweating disease (also known as idiopathic haemorrhagic
diathesis of calves)
------------------------------
'This intriguing disease captures the imagination. The VLA will be
working with others to help discover the cause.'

Professor Peter Borriello, chief executive says:
'VLA plays a key role in identifying new and emerging diseases in the
national herd. Identification of blood sweating disease (also known as
idiopathic haemorrhagic disease of calves) is a good example of this.
Defra have already commissioned us to look at what might be causing
the disease and we will be working with our international colleagues
to find out what they know about the condition and how we might
collaborate.'

Q1: What does the disease look like?
Clinical signs in calves include bleeding from apparently intact skin
and also from injection and ear tagging sites together with signs of
bleeding from visible mucous membranes, nose and rectum.

VLA has made several images available [the following 4 images can be
downloaded at the above URL:
1. Hind limb
2. Skin
3. Ear tips
4. Head]

Q2: What causes the disease?
The [signs] are caused by an almost complete destruction of the bone
marrow of the calf, which produces the red and white blood cells vital
for the animal's immune system and blood clotting mechanisms.

This seems to be occurring at or around the time of birth, although it
is uncertain whether the damage is occurring in the womb or soon after
birth.

The cause is not yet known. There are a number of lines of
investigation being pursued, which include management and
environmental factors on the affected farms. Although there is
currently no evidence of an infectious cause it cannot be totally
ruled out at this point. [See German findings in item 1].

Q3: Does the disease lead to death?
Only a few calves have been affected in any one herd, but once
affected they usually die. However there are reports, mainly
anecdotal, of some affected calves making a full recovery. Only calves
less than 4 weeks old are affected. The mothers of the affected calves
are usually perfectly healthy.

Q4: How many case of this disease have occurred in Great Britain?
Up to the end of September [2009], 37 calves on 31 farms have been
diagnosed with the condition in England.

Since April 2009, 40 calves on 20 farms have been diagnosed with the
condition in Scotland.

The number of affected calves in each herd is very low. It is usually
less than 1 percent and there is no sign of spread between animals.

Q5: Is it on the increase?
Recent media coverage suggests that there is an increase in the number
of cases. At this moment it is not possible to confirm if there is an
increase in the frequency of the condition.

Greater numbers are likely to reflect better awareness by farmers and
private veterinary surgeons as a result of media interest and efforts
by VLA and the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) to comprehensively
record and investigate the condition.

Q6: Does the disease occur in other countries?
Yes, cases have been reported in Germany, Belgium, and Holland since
2008 although investigation suggests that the disease has been seen on
some farms in Belgium since 2006. Cases have also been reported in
France and Italy.

Q7: Is there any risk to humans through contact or food?
As the age of the animal affected is 0-4 weeks, they would not be
entering the food chain. The age they are affected is very consistent
and the disease has never been seen in older animals.

To date no infectious agent (known or novel) likely to have caused the
condition has been identified in any of the tissues of affected calves.

There has been no direct evidence or reports of any potential
transmission to people in Germany where the disease has been present
for at least 18 months.

There is currently no evidence to suggest that the disease is
infectious or contagious.

The Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group, which
routinely meets to assess any risks to human health from emerging
diseases, has been briefed and is considering the available data.

Q8: What is being done to find out more about the disease?
Research carried out by VLA and SAC, funded by Defra and the Scottish
Government, is ongoing and is designed to identify the potential
factors which might be causing the disease.

An international meeting is taking place in December [2009] to
consider what is known about the condition and to identify the best
way forward in collaborative investigation. [A satellite symposium on
the syndrome is planned for 2 Dec 2009 within the framework of the 1st
European Buiatrics Forum, scheduled for 1-3 Dec 2009 in Marseille,
France].

Q9: What should farmers do if they see the symptoms [signs] in their herd?
They should consult their own vet who can submit calves to their local
VLA or SAC laboratory for a full examination.
