A comment re: Influenza (04): Europe 20110114.0163
--------------------------------------------------
The recent WHO EuroFlu report can be also viewed in a historical
perspective of the behavior of previous pandemics. "All three 20th century
pandemics caused excess mortality in multiple waves over several years."

Pandemic influenza is not always like a sudden storm, followed by a return
to clear skies. Instead, mortality rates can remain elevated for several
years, during which time an effective vaccine would be in high demand. For
example, in the 1957 pandemic worldwide, and in the 1968 pandemic in North
America, much of the pandemic mortality impact occurred in a series of
smaller but still severe twisters in subsequent years"[1] and "...a pattern
of multiple waves, characterized all three 20th century pandemics, each of
which caused increased mortality for 2 to 5 years"[2].
