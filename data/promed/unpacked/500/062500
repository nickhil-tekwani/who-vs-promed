Yavapai County [Arizona] Community Health Service issued a warning to residents and visitors of the Mingus Mountain area to take extra precautions after the discovery of plague in a sick cat from Jerome.

"Educating the public about the symptoms of plague and avoiding dead animals is what we need to do right now," Public Health Protection Manager Cecil Newell said. "Plague is one of those diseases that naturally circulate in wildlife from time to time."

Plague can bring on severe and sometimes fatal breathing problems if left untreated. The bacteria live in the bloodstream and saliva of infected animals and can spread to other animals or humans through flea bites or when people are bitten or scratched by the infected animal.

"While it is possible, it would be extremely rare for someone to get plague by inhaling the drops of saliva sprayed into the air when an animal coughed," health service epidemiologist Stephen Everett said.

Respiratory plague cases will have flu-like symptoms plus a cough and may develop rapidly advancing pneumonia. Bubonic plague symptoms, which develop from 1 to 6 days after exposure, include a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms such as chills, breathing problems, fever, headache and extreme exhaustion or painful, swollen glands in the groin, neck or armpit areas.

Yavapai County Community Health Service took 2 additional cats from the Jerome area for testing.

Since 2000 there have been 2 cases of plague diagnosed in Arizona residents. The most recent Yavapai County resident case was in 1991.

"If residents see an unexplainable large die-off in local wildlife, we would like to hear about it," Newell said. Call 928-771-3122 if you notice large numbers of dead squirrels, chipmunks, rodents or other wildlife.

[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in your pet.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
