Concerning ProMED-mail post "BSE, bovine - Greece: (TC) susp, RFI 20140312.2329623," both cases were not confirmed by the European Reference Lab last week: They were false positives.

[The above information refers to brain material from 2 cows, thought to be 6 years old, reportedly found dead on a farm in Fthiotida [Phthiotis], Central Greece, probably during the week of 10 Mar 2014. See commentary in the posting.

If CNS symptoms had been observed in the affected cows prior to their deaths, rabies (currently circulating in Greece) deserved to be included among the differential diagnoses. - Mod.AS]
