["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a retroviral disease of equids that may be characterized by acute and/or chronic recurring clinical signs including fever, anemia, edema, and cachexia in some animals. Many horses have very mild or inapparent signs on 1st exposure, and carry this virus subclinically. The owners of these animals are unlikely to realize that they are infected unless serological testing is done. All infected horses, including those that are asymptomatic, become carriers and are infectious for life. Infected animals must either be destroyed or remain permanently isolated from other equids to prevent transmission.

"Equine infectious anemia is caused by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), a lentivirus in the family Retroviridae (subfamily Orthoretrovirinae).

"Equine infectious anemia has been found nearly worldwide. This disease appears to be absent from a few countries including Iceland and Japan.

"There is no evidence that equine infectious anemia is a threat to humans."
