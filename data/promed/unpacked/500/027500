Viet Nam: 2 More Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
As of 7 Jan 2005, an 18-year-old girl from Viet Nam's southern region has
been hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus, raising the number of confirmed and suspected cases of avian
influenza to 5, local health official told Xinhua on Fri 7 Jan 2005. "The
patient was admitted to our hospital yesterday after exhibiting symptoms of
high temperature and difficult breathing. We'll conduct testing to see
whether she is infected with H5N1 or not," said Tran Tinh Hien, deputy
director of the Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City. The girl
from Tien Giang province lives in an area where there are bird flu-infected
fowl, he said.
"To date, we've received reports from hospitals in other southern
localities about a total of 5 suspected cases of avian influenza virus
infections. Testing conducted by our hospital, not other professional
institutions, showed 3 samples were positive to H5N1," Hien said. He said
that among the 3 H5N1-positive cases, a 16-year-old girl from southern Tay
Ninh province is in very dangerous condition in the city-based hospital; a
9-year-old boy from southern Tra Vinh province died early this week; and a
6-year-old child in southern Dong Thap province died last month. All of
them had direct or indirect contact with sick poultry.
According to the Department of Animal Health, since December 2004, the
recurrence of bird flu has been seen in 11 localities, one in the north and
10 in the south, killing or leading to the forced culling of nearly 29 000
fowls. In late March 2004, Vietnam declared an end to the bird flu that
killed 17 percent of its poultry population and claimed at least 21 human
lives during the previous outbreak starting in December 2003. A total of
43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled, causing a total
loss of 1.3 trillion Vietnamese dong (82.8 million dollars) to the local
poultry industry.

[It would appear that there are 2 suspected human cases of avian influenza
A (H5N1) virus infection in addition to those reported yesterday in
ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human - East Asia: Viet Nam (02)
20050106.0032". Therefore the number of suspected and confirmed cases in
Viet Nam now becomes 33 (or 32 according to WHO figures). The number of
fatalities remains unchanged at 22. - Mod.CP]
