A 6 year old boy has died in Egypt after contracting avian influenza,
becoming the country's 24th human casualty of the disease since 2006, the
state-run Middle East News Agency reported today [21 Apr 2009]. The boy is
the 1st fatality attributed to the virus in Egypt this year [2009], the
news agency quoted Abdel-Rahman Shahine, a spokesman for the Health
Ministry, as saying. The boy had shown symptoms of the virus on 22 Mar 2009
after coming in contact with dead birds, Shahine said.

Egypt has the highest number of avian flu cases outside Asia, according to
the most recent data from the World Health Organization. With the newest
reports, the number of infected people there has reached 67. The Health
Ministry reported the 67th infection earlier today [21 Apr 2009], saying a
4 year old child has contracted the virus. He was in the hospital in what
was described as stable condition. He has received Tamiflu (oseltamivir)
treatment according to Shah.

Egypt has asked WHO to help investigate an outbreak of the so-called bird
flu after a dozen non-fatal cases of the disease this year [2009] prompted
speculation the virus may be becoming less virulent [and more
transmissible. - Mod.CP]

[The death of the young child in Qalyubia governorate is the 1st fatality
in the sequence of 16 cases recorded in Egypt since the beginning of 2009.
This death weakens the argument that the outbreak virus is less virulent
than in previous years.
