The number of _Shigella_ infections observed in the Netherlands reached an
'explosive' level during weeks 34 to 41 of 1998, according to an 'early
warning' computer application used by the national _Salmonella_ centre
since the beginning of 1998. The application compares the most recent four
weeks with the same period (plus and minus four weeks) in the previous five
years. The expected values and a tolerance level can be calculated, above
which an 'explosion' is indicated.
_Shigella_ infections show a seasonal fluctuation, which is related to
international travel. The incidence is usually high in September, just
after the summer holidays, when people travel to their home countries
(Turkey, Morocco, Tunis) and tourists visit exotic places (India, Egypt,
Indonesia, Nepal).
Data from 1991 to 1998 show that almost half of the cases of shigellosis
had been abroad but this is almost certainly a gross underestimation.
Sixty-two of the 90 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ infection identified between
weeks 34 and 41 of 1998 gave no information about travel abroad, 19 cases
had visited Turkey, five Morocco, and four had had a holiday in the Gambia
(a popular destination). Comparison of illness onset dates with travel
dates within age groups suggests that most infections in children under 10
years of age are secondary and appear within a week of primary cases
acquired abroad. The 'explosion' of shigellosis observed in the Netherlands
this summer appears to be related to travel abroad, and reflects a similar
but less pronounced peak seen in previous years.
