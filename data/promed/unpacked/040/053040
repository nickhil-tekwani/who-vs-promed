Conditional License Issued for Equine West Nile Virus Inactivated Vaccine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today that
it has issued a conditional license to Fort Dodge Laboratories, Inc., of
Fort Dodge, Iowa, a division of American Home Products, Inc., for a vaccine
intended to aid in the prevention of disease in horses caused by West Nile
virus. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service issues conditional
licenses for veterinary biologics products to meet an emergency situation,
limited market, local situation, or special circumstance. The special
circumstance addressed here is the need for a product to aid in the
prevention of disease caused by West Nile virus. Under these regulations, a
product that is shown to be pure and safe and demonstrates a reasonable
expectation of efficacy may be licensed while data to establish efficacy
and potency are still being obtained.
West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that was first detected in the
United States in 1999. The virus, which can cause encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain) in animals and in some cases, humans, has been
found in Africa, western Asia, the Middle East, the Mediterranean region of
Europe, and most recently in various parts of the eastern United States.
West Nile virus infection in horses may include both central nervous system
and peripheral nervous system signs. Although horses can be infected by the
virus, there is no documentation that infected horses can spread the virus
to uninfected horses or other animals. In 1999 and 2000, 85 horses were
infected with the virus, and 32 of these cases resulted in death. The most
common signs of West Nile virus infection in U.S. horses have been
stumbling or incoordination, weakness of limbs, partial paralysis, muscle
twitching and death. Fever has been detected in less than one-quarter of
all confirmed cases.
Conditional licenses are generally issued with restrictions and for a
limited period of time. At the end of the conditional license period, data
obtained in support of the efficacy, potency, and performance of the
product are evaluated to determine if the conditional license should be
renewed or if a regular product license may be issued. In keeping with
these regulations, the product described above has been issued a
conditional license for one year. The product is restricted to use by a
veterinarian in those states where use of the product has been approved by
the appropriate state regulatory authorities. Horse owners planning to ship
their animals to other countries should be aware that vaccinated animals
may not meet the import requirements of those countries due to the presence
of certain antibodies in [the horses' blood. While the presence of this
antibody is not permanent, it could lead to complications in shipping the
horse.
