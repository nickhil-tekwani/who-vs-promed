FMD: Byrne welcomes political agreement on improved Directive to control
outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------
The Council of Agriculture Ministers today achieved political agreement on
revised and improved legislation on EU measures to control outbreaks of
foot & mouth disease (FMD). FMD is not dangerous for human health, but
outbreaks of this highly contagious viral disease in livestock have an
exceptional economic and psycho-social impact on the rural and national
economy in the EU.

The amended Directive details the measures to rapidly control and eradicate
the disease and outlines procedures on recovering the status "free of FMD
and infection without vaccination", which is of crucial importance for
trade. Control actions are supplemented with measures to ensure a high
level of preparedness against the disease. The Commission is given a key
role in managing an outbreak in partnership with the Member States.

Welcoming the agreement and congratulating the Greek Presidency, David
Byrne, Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, said: "Outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease in individual Member States impact on the EU as a
whole, as we saw in 2001. The amended law aims to maintain or, in the event
of an outbreak, quickly regain the 'FMD-free' status that is of key
importance for trade in animals and animal products. Emergency vaccination
is moved to the forefront of control measures instead of being the last
resort. The agreement is a true reform."

The new draft law has broad support from the European Parliament, the
European Committee of the Regions, and the European Economic and Social
Committee as reflecting the lessons learned from the 2001 outbreak.

The details of the draft law range from the notification of a suspect case
through to the measures to be taken in relation to animals and their
products during an outbreak until disease- and infection-free status is
regained. It makes provisions for a high level of disease preparedness,
notably contingency planning and vaccine banks, and also covers the
possibility of infection in wildlife.

Being a carefully considered reform rather than a revolution, there is no
departure from the ban on prophylactic vaccination introduced in 1992, but
the emphasis on various control measures is shifted by moving emergency
vaccination closer to the forefront of the control strategy.

This approach is bolstered by modified international trade rules and
laboratory tests to distinguish vaccinated from infected herds, which
allows the use of vaccination in a much more flexible way, albeit always in
connection with rapid stamping out of infected or contaminated animals of
susceptible species.

Prior to the confirmation of an outbreak, veterinary services will be
empowered to establish suspect restriction zones and to impose a temporary
movement ban on large parts of affected Member States.

The draft law also provides for "regionalisation", limiting restrictions to
the particular regions of a Member State that are affected by an outbreak.
This is of particular importance where emergency vaccination has been
carried out. Vaccinated animals from herds which have been tested for
absence of infection may -- after regaining the FMD-free status -- move
within the Member State concerned but not be traded to other member States.

Detailed rules are laid down for the marketing of products such as milk and
meat from animals from restricted areas or from vaccinated animals. These
products are not dangerous to humans, and restrictions on their circulation
are kept to the minimum required to prevent spread of possible virus,
primarily through appropriate treatment or specific production conditions.

The draft Directive outlines the measures to be taken in order to prepare
for an outbreak. The main new elements are:

* Provisions are made for diagnostic facilities, in particular a Community
Reference Laboratory, including a bank for diagnostic reagents, test kits,
etc.

* Detailed provisions are laid down for the management of the European
antigen bank and for access to this bank by Member States and, where
required, third countries. Specific rules are laid down for the
confidential treatment of information on the quantities and strains of
antigens stored at the bank.

Emphasis is put on preparation of contingency plans, including the
preparation for a "worst case" scenario. Contingency plans have to be
regularly updated in the light of the results of alert exercises

[The Council of Agriculture Ministers' decision to allow emergency
vaccination is indeed a significant change in the prevailing "no
vaccination" policy of the EU. However, it is distant from the policy
prevailing until 1991 in several central EU member countries (e.g. Germany,
France, Italy, The Netherlands, and others), where annual mass vaccinations
of all cattle older than 4-5 months with a trivalent FMD vaccine were applied.

The UK Food Standard Agency (FSA) has welcomed the EU's reform. In April
2001, at the height of the FMD epizootic in the UK, the FSA declared that
it was satisfied that eating meat, milk, or other produce from animals that
have been treated with authorised FMD vaccines would not have any
implications for food safety. Nor did the FSA consider that there would be
any need to label meat products derived from animals that have been
vaccinated with the FMD vaccine.
