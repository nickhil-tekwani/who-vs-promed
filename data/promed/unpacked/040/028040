Death Toll Reaches 95 In Yellow Fever Epidemic
----------------------------------------------
At least 95 people have died of yellow fever in an epidemic that broke out
in central Guinea last month. The epidemic is centered in Mamou, 280 km
east of the capital Conakry, and has spread to Labe and Koubia in the same
region, the relief agency Hopital Sans Frontiere (Hospital Without Borders)
reported. Yellow fever, a hemorrhagic disease carried by mosquitoes, is
usually fatal and has no known cure, but vaccination is extremely effective
and lasts 10 years.
