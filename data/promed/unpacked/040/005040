50 Hospitalized After Chemical Emission in Stavropol
--------------------------------------------------
50 people were hospitalized after chemical emissions caused a fire in the
southern Russian city of Stavropol Sunday, the Ministry of Emergency
Situations has reported.
The Ministry issued a statement describing how "as a result of exposure to
sunlight, on 21 Mar 2004 a container with chemical wasteÂ… leaked, emitting
50 kilograms of an unknown substance over an area of 70 square meters. The
substance caught fire."
The fire was put out that same day, and the unknown substance was
identified as highly toxic white phosphorus, Emergency Ministry said in a
statement.
Sergei Vlasov, a spokesman from the Emergency Ministry, told MosNews that
excavating work was carried out in the area in January 2004, and the
container was found underground. He said that it remains unknown why the
container was left standing out in the open. Another source from the
Ministry told MosNews that the container had been underground for at least
20 years near a railway station. He declined to say who might be held
responsible for the accident.
On Tuesday, a piece of phosphorus that had not been neutralized caught fire
again, and the fire was put out.
However, sources in the Emergency Ministry told MosNews that yet another
piece of phosphorus caught fire Wednesday, and that the fire is currently
being brought under control.
As a result of the accident 12 rescue workers and firemen were
hospitalized. The other 38 people were mostly police and by-standers
affected by the fire. 9 of the people have traces of phosphorus in their
blood and urine, a statement from the Emergency Ministry said.
A source from the Emergency Ministry speaking to MosNews on terms of
anonymity said, however, that no injuries were sustained from the accident.
Meanwhile, sources in the emergency room of the local hospital confirmed to
MosNews that 50 people were indeed hospitalized with injuries sustained in
the fire.

25 people intoxicated with white phosphorus are currently in the Stavropol
hospital (Russia)
-------------------------------------------------
There are still 25 people hospitalized with white phosphorus intoxication
in Stavropol hospitals. According to information from the regional
emergency center, altogether 77 people were admitted to the hospital with
this diagnosis, 49 of them being treated in the outpatient department.
The iron container containing white phosphorus was discovered on the
grounds of the Stavropol railway station in January 2004. On 21 Mar, as a
result of breakage of the container and the effects of sunlight, 50 kg of
the toxic substance was ejected into the 70 square meter territory, with
further ignition.
Work is presently being done to decontaminate the soil in the area.
According to sanitary epidemiological surveillance center specialists, the
levels of phosphoranhydride are within safe ranges.

[White phosphorus burns when exposed to air. If tissue is exposed to it, it
produces a painful burning sensation. The white phosphorus can be removed
underwater, which would also prevent the spontaneous fires. Treating
patients who have ingested the substance is much more difficult and may
prove unrewarding. - Mod.TG]
