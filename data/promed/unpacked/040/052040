Help Requested Against Meningitis
----------------------------------
Burkina Faso's government has asked the World Health Organisation (WHO) for
help in its fight against meningitis. The request coincides with the start
of the 2002-2003 meningitis season.
The Ministry of Health reported that 123 cases of the disease, 16 of them
fatal, were reported by the country's 53 health districts from 9 to 15 Dec
2002. None of the districts had reached "warning stage" (5 cases for 100 000
inhabitants) or epidemic stage (10 cases for 100 000 inhabitants), Minister
of Health Alain Yoda said at a news conference in the capital,
Ouagadougou. "However, there is a regular increase in the number of
suspected cases since November 2002," he added.
The minister said analyses of the first cases revealed the "persistence" of
a new strain, W135, which killed 1474 persons out of 12 794 infected between
February and May 2002.
"Due to the non-availability of the W135 vaccine, the strategy of an early
vaccination campaign has not been carried out in the year 2002," Yoda
explained. "There is a risk of a W135 meningitis epidemic in the year 2003
since populations have not been immunized, while there is no sign that the
other strains will not occur."
The health minister called on WHO to provide Burkina Faso "as soon as
possible" with one million doses of W135. He said 500 000 doses ordered by
the government had not yet arrived.
Until last year [2001] the dominant strains of meningitis were the A and C
varieties for which vaccines exist. Only small quantities of Tetravalent,
which prevents the W135 strain, are available on the market but its high
price -- US $8 per dose -- makes it unaffordable for people in most African
countries.
WHO and its partners -- Doctors without borders, UNICEF and the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies -- launched
an urgent appeal in late September 2002 for 11 million euros (US $10.8
million) to contain potential meningitis outbreaks in Africa. The appeal
was made at the end of a meeting in Ouagadougou at which
strategies to fight meningitis and secure cheap vaccines were discussed.
WHO said at the time that the emergence of the W-135 strain in West Africa
earlier this year had given renewed urgency to the search for a more
effective and affordable vaccine. It said 5 million doses of Tetravalent
were needed immediately and about 50 million over the next 5 years, but it
could only purchase 2 million doses -- at US $2.75 each -- for 2003 because
of financial limitations. That price was still too expensive for African
countries, according to WHO and its partners, which said negotiations aimed
at having it reduced to $1 per dose were continuing.
Meningitis appears each year in the Sahelian belt (the countries just south
of the Sahara) at the onset of the dry season (December/January), when the
dusty harmattan wind blows southward from the Sahara.

Meningitis Outbreak in the South
--------------------------------
Several cases of meningitis have been detected in the southern Central
African Republic (CAR) city of Mobaye, on the border with the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, according to Medicos Sin Fronteras (MSF-Spain).
"A local religious community told us last week that 10 cases of meningitis
had been detected," Francis Coteur, the MSF-Spain acting coordinator, told
IRIN. He added that an MSF team would fly to Mobaye to assess the situation
to determine whether or not it was a contagious [meningococcal] form of
[bacterial] meningitis. "If the epidemic is confirmed, we will supply
necessary anti-meningitis drugs and vaccines," Coteur said.
Mobaye and other areas have been isolated from the capital, Bangui, ever
since the failed October 2002 coup attempt by [rebels] who still control
areas in the north and south. Stocks of medicines and vaccines in those
areas had already run out, exposing local populations to diseases and
epidemics, said Coteur.
In an endeavour to provide medicines, the representative of the UN
Children's Fund (UNICEF), Aboudou Karimou Adjibade, has started negotiations
with both the government and rebels on obtaining NGO and UN access to the
areas under rebel control.
"We have already contacted the representatives of the rebellion after having
had the government's agreement, in principle, and we are awaiting the
rebels' feedback," Adjibade said on Monday during a UN-NGO humanitarian
coordination meeting. He said UNICEF had already flown basic drugs to
Bambari, 385 km northeast of Bangui, from where they would be distributed
via Roman Catholic missions to surrounding areas. He said local vaccination
campaigns should be launched pending a nationwide effort.
