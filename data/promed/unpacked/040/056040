Director of the Mesa County Health Department Dr. Michael Aduddell said
that a case of vesicular stomatitis had been sustained by a 13-year-old
girl from Fruita, Colorado, in September of this year. According to
relatives, the girl became ill just after attending the State Fair in
Pueblo, where she showed one of the 15 horses her family owns. Cortisone
and antibiotics were used in the girl's 10-day recovery.
As reported by the Denver newspaper, Dr. Aduddell said that it was not
absolutely certain that the case was transmitted from horses, but was
certain of the diagnosis. "Humans contracting this from horses is
possible, according to the literature, but relatively rare." The case was
reported to the CDC for followup.

[This case occurred in the Grand Junction area (Fruita) of west central
Colorado, where many cases of equid vesicular stomatitis (VS) have been
reported this year. This newspaper report does not indicate which VS virus
was responsible for the young woman's illness or how the diagnosis was
made. We are assuming the diagnosis of her illness was not simply based on
clinical appearance and await further information from the Colorado
Department of Health.
VS Indiana virus was shown to be the etiologic agent of human infections in
1965 during an equid outbreak of that disease in Colorado and New Mexico
(MMWR 22:309-310, CDC, Atlanta; Fields and Hawkins, N Engl J Med
277:989-94, 1967). We later isolated VS Indiana virus from _Aedes_
mosquitoes (Sudia, Fields, Calisher, Am J Epidemiol 86:598-602, 1967),
showing that arthropods can at least harbor the virus. Many other isolates
of VS viruses have been obtained from arthropods but it is not known
whether these viruses can be transmitted mechanically or biologically (i.e.
whether they replicate in arthropods).
VS is an epizoologically fascinating disease. One (VS Indiana or VS New
Jersey) or two (VS Indiana and VS New Jersey) distinct viruses can
circulate concurrently.
As for the use of cortisone and antibiotics in the treatment regimen, well,
I am a Ph.D. and do not comment on such matters. - Mod.CHC
