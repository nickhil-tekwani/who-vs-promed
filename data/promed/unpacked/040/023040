Another Michigan horse tests positive for EHV-1, quarantine continues
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since a horse was euthanized last month [March 2015], 2 additional Michigan horses have tested positive for equine herpes virus type 1 [EHV-1], according to an update on the quarantine and disease outbreak posted Thursday night, 2 Apr 2015, by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD].

The 1st horse tested positive for EHV-1 on 19 Mar 2015 and was euthanized when he did not respond to treatment.

Both of the additional horses developed fevers and are under veterinary care. All 3 horses were diagnosed with the respiratory form of the disease, said Jennifer Holton, spokesperson for the MDARD.

One of these additional positive horses is from the same Livingston County stable in which the 1st horse diagnosed with the disease resided.

The other additional positive horse is at a separate stable in Saginaw County; horses from that stable attended a 7 Mar 2015 event in Barry County also attended by the initial positive EHV horse.

Currently 4 facilities remain under quarantine, including the 2 facilities in which the EHV positive horses reside. Horses in the quarantined stables are being monitored horses for signs of illness as they have had exposure to the index horse and a fever greater than 101.5 Fahrenheit.

State officials are not allowed to identify the quarantined stables nor the event at which the exposure took place.

None of the new cases of the virus have been of the deadly neurological strain of the illness, agriculture officials said. It was that mutated strain that led to the 1st horse's death.

MDARD continues to trace all contacts of infected horses to ensure no further disease transmission has occurred, officials said.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their horses and to contact their veterinarian if a horse has a fever greater than 101.5.

[Monitoring temperatures twice or more daily is a way to get an early indication that the horse may be infected with this disease. It is also an early indication that veterinary attention is necessary to give the animal the best chance of survival. Rest for the affected animal is very important to potential recovery.

This disease tends to move rapidly and vigilance is very necessary.
