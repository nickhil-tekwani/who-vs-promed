Cassava disease threatens food supplies
---------------------------------------
Agriculture officials and researchers in Uganda have warned of a
serious threat posed by a new strain of cassava brown streak disease
[CBSD], saying it could wipe out the entire crop. Mike Thresh, a
consultant on cassava viral diseases, said the disease was now
occurring in areas previously believed to be immune, such as high
altitude areas away from the Indian Ocean coastal belt of Kenya,
Tanzania and Mozambique.

"There was a sort of dogma that CBSD was not a problem once one
exceeded 1000m above sea level," Thresh said. "The gravity of the
situation is that almost all varieties bred or selected for
resistance to Cassava Mosaic Disease [CMD] are susceptible to the
'new strain' of CBSD occurring in Uganda, inland areas of Tanzania
and Western Kenya."

[In Uganda], the central district of Mukono has been hardest hit.
Stephen Mukasa, district agricultural officer, said almost all the
cassava crop had been affected. "We have tried to sensitize farmers
but it keeps on spreading. [Planting] materials that we thought could
be resistant have turned out to be susceptible to it. [Certified]
clean materials are very costly." Anton Bua, Ministry of Agriculture,
said CMD in the early 1990s had reduced to zero Uganda's cassava
output. "We are faced with a more serious situation than with the
mosaic disease," he added.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease (CBSD) is caused by
_Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus
_Ipomovirus_). It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan
Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms
may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown, corky
necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear
healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of
20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual root
weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible
cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and
is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease
management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants,
use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but
these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries.
Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local
requirements. The emergence of a new viral strain adapted to higher
altitudes is very worrying and adds to the pressure on food security.

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and
strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which are transmitted by whitefly
vectors and infected planting material. CMD has destroyed crops
throughout the region in the past and cassava varieties resistant to
different CMD strains were developed. In some areas these are being
wiped out by CBSD, and the joint management of both diseases has
become a major challenge (see, for example, ProMED-mail posts
20100507.1482 and 20090709.2463).
