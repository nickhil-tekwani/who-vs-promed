UNICEF DRC Ebola situation report 4: 25-31 Oct 2021
---------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- 292 of the 295 Community Action Cells (CAC) members visited 36 107 households, reaching 119 071 people (45 104 women and 24 352 children) in Beni Health Zone.
- The Code of Conduct, including PSEA [protection against sexual exploitation and abuse], has been signed by the Psychosocial, Vaccination commissions as well as the MoH coordination.
- Household and health care facilities surrounding new confirmed cases were decontaminated and mattresses have been replaced.

Situation overview
------------------
- As of 31 Oct 2021, 8 cases (5 female and 3 male) have been confirmed, the last case reported on 30 Oct 2021. 3 Health Areas -- Butsili, Ngilinga, and Bundji -- have now reported cases, all of which within the Beni Health Zone.

- 6 people have died, 1 has tested negative, and 1 is currently still under treatment at the temporary Ebola treatment center in the General Reference Hospital in Beni.

- As of 31 Oct 2021, children under 5 represent 50% of all cases (3 female and 1 male), however, only 10% of contacts are listed. Children under 5 are listed from 8 of the 19 Health Areas of Beni Health Zone.

- Preliminary sequencing conducted indicates that this outbreak is likely linked to the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri 10th Ebola outbreak and was initiated by transmission from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced a relapse.

- As of 31 Oct 2021, 552 active contacts are being followed from residing in 14 of the 19 Health Areas of Beni Health Zone. Of these contacts, 63.8% have been vaccinated either in the previous or the current outbreak.

[The number of confirmed Ebola cases has increased, now being 8, and the number of health areas within the Beni health zone has expanded to 3. It is good that 63.8% of the contacts have been vaccinated and most likely, the cases were all unvaccinated contacts.

It is very sad that children under 5 represent 50% of all cases. They were unlikely to have been vaccinated since the Ebola vaccine is indicated for use for adults over 18 years of age.

This outbreak represents another where the index case appears to have been infected sexually from persistent virus in the testes of a previously infected male or possibly a relapse of the original infection. This mode of transmission and virus persistence makes it extremely difficult to end an outbreak absolutely, making ongoing intensive surveillance and education of health care workers and the communities even more critical to the control of Ebola. - Mod.LK
