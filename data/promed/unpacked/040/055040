[1] Mucormycosis
[1A] Oman
Date: Wed 16 Jun 2021

Doctors in Oman have detected a potentially fatal fungal infection called mucormycosis -- commonly known as "black fungus" -- in the country, according to authorities.

The country's Health Ministry said on [Tue 14 Jun 2021] that 3 COVID-19 patients had become infected with the condition, which has spread among some coronavirus patients in hard-hit India.

Although relatively rare, the infection has raised alarm among authorities that its sudden increase could complicate efforts to combat COVID-19.

It was not immediately clear what condition the 3 patients, the 1st such known cases on the Arabian Peninsula, were in. The announcement came as the sultanate faces a surge in COVID-19 infections that has swamped its hospitals.

Omani health officials warned earlier this week that there was an acute shortage of hospital beds amid the spread of highly transmissible coronavirus variants, a lagging vaccine rollout, and relaxed movement restrictions. To date [Wed 16 Jun 2021], Oman has recorded more than 238 500 coronavirus cases, including 2565 deaths, according to data by Johns Hopkins University.

The fungal condition became a growing cause of concern during India's devastating coronavirus surge. Other countries, including Egypt, have reported scattered cases in recent months as infections spiked.

Black fungus existed in India before the virus wave, but it stoked fears as it took hold in thousands of infected or recently recovered COVID-19 patients.

Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air, and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It causes blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties, and coughing of blood.

Pain and redness around the eyes or nose, fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomit, and altered mental state are some of its other symptoms.

The fungal infection preys on patients with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions, particularly diabetes, as well as overuse of certain over-the-counter [?] coronavirus medications such as steroids. Uncontrolled blood sugar can put immunocompromised people at a higher risk of contracting the disease.

[1B] India (Tamil Nadu)
Date: Fri 11 Jun 2021

Tamil Nadu has so far reported 1196 cases of mucormycosis in 25 districts. Chennai has the most number of cases, with 420 patients admitted in government and private hospitals.

According to officials of the Health Department, as of [Wed 9 Jun 2021], as many as 1196 patients in the state have been affected by mucormycosis, while the total allocation of liposomal amphotericin-B from the centre is 7330 vials. "We received additional allocation on Wednesday [9 Jun 2021]. But we are still running short of the drug," a health official said. Earlier, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had written to the Union Health Minister, seeking immediate allocation of at least 30 000 vials to the state.

As of [Wed 9 Jun 2021], a total 25 districts in the state have reported cases of mucormycosis -- an invasive fungal infection affecting patients recovering from COVID-19. In Chennai, 380 patients have been admitted to government hospitals and 40 to private facilities. Madurai has 142 patients, while Salem has 139. [See numbers at end of report below.]

At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Dean E. Theranirajan said 10-20 patients were attending the mucormycosis clinic every day.

Authorities in government hospitals said they have managed to treat patients admitted with mucormycosis with the current supply of drugs. A senior doctor said the number of vials of liposomal amphotericin-B supplied to the state was "woefully low." Each patient requires 50-60 vials. "The supply is coming in small numbers. While liposomal amphotericin-B is not available, amphotericin-B emulsion is. The former has less toxicity. The emulsion is a replacement but needs watchful administration. We need to monitor renal function in patients. What we need is liposomal amphotericin-B," he said.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan took to Twitter on [Wed 9 Jun 2021] to point out the increased allotment of the drug to Karnataka when compared to Tamil Nadu. Karnataka, he said, had received nearly 40 000 vials so far. "Union Minister Sadananda Gowda, until recently, was releasing state-wise number of cases and allocation of vials. This has been stopped. There is no transparency with the Government of India. The allocation should at least be proportionate to the number of cases. The current allocation is very biased," he said.

He said he had already written to the Union Health Minister to import the drug as ramping up domestic production would take time.

As far as cases were concerned, Mohan Kameswaran, managing director of the Madras ENT Research Foundation and a member of the task force constituted by the state government for mucormycosis, said, "There is an increase in the number of cases, and we are still seeing patients. It usually occurs a couple of weeks after exposure to COVID-19. So it will follow the pandemic and dip after some time."

He, however, said patients were still coming in very late. "We have had patients who have come in with loss of vision. If a patient recovering from COVID-19 who is diabetic and was on steroids develops pain in the face, sinuses, around the eyes, or behind the eyes after a week or 2, they should seek medical help immediately," he said.

Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian told reporters on [Thu 10 Jun 2021] evening that the number of liposomal amphotericin-B vials allocated to the state had been increased to 9520. He added that thesState had paid for 90 000 posaconazole tablets that were prescribed as per ICMR guidelines. "Of these, we have received 42 000. We have 39 500 tablets in hand," he added.

[1C] Diabetes link

City hospitals have witnessed 370 cases of mucormycosis so far with a majority of these patients being uncontrolled diabetic and having received steroids in inappropriate quantities during the COVID treatment.

"At least 87% of the mucormycosis patients admitted to the PGI are diabetic. This is the most contributing factor for this fungal infection. At the same time, there is a fairly good number of patients who came with mucormycosis but were COVID positive in the RT-PCR test. They were asymptomatic for COVID-19," said Dr. Naresh Panda, head of the ENT Department, PGI.

There is now growing evidence that COVID-19 itself is triggering hyperglycemia in patients. Dr. GD Puri from the PGI said symptomatic patients even without history of diabetes had shown precipitation of diabetes at the PGI, Chandigarh.

Dr. Sanjay Badada from the Department of Endocrinology, PGI, said: "COVID-19 directly affects the beta cells of the pancreas, due to which sugar level of the patient skyrockets. Coronavirus directly damages beta cells, which causes hyperglycemia. In addition to this, cytokines storm caused by COVID-19 and steroid used for treatment also contribute to increased sugar level." He said uncontrolled diabetes triggers acidosis (too much acid in body fluids), and fungus likes to grow in this environment.

The latest study spearheaded by PGI doctors on mucormycosis, published in the CDC, US, revealed that inappropriate glucocorticoid use was associated with late COVID-associated mucormycosis. Appropriate steroid use was defined as dexamethasone-equivalent doses of 6 mg/day used for over 10 days. Any excess in dose or duration was classified as "inappropriate."

Dr. Panda said several patients had received steroids in excess quantities from outside. Their prescription cards were filled with high doses of steroids, which also triggered uncontrolled diabetic condition in these patients. "None of the patients, who were discharged from the PGI, came with mucormycosis, because they were all managed well as far as steroids and sugar levels are concerned. All these patients either took steroids in home isolation or in other private facilities," he said.

However, some doctors feel that the role of steam inhalation, unhygienic face masks, and oxygen humidifiers cannot be undermined in the increasing number of mucormycosis cases in the 2nd wave. Dr. Jagdish Chander, consultant microbiologist at the GMCH-32, said: "Overzealous use of steam inhalation for 6-7 times a day and reusing the same mask for one to 2 weeks also increased the risk of acquiring mucormycosis. A high index of clinical suspicion for mucormycosis should be kept in those who have recovered from the viral infection."

Dr. Badada, in his recently published research paper, also highlighted the possible speculated causes of mucormycosis. According to the paper, reusable oxygen humidifiers may also play a major role in the transmission of potential nosocomial pathogens via the generation of aerosol particles, for they reach deep into the lung immediately after inhalation. Use of steam inhalation as well as non-humidified oxygen can lead to damage of the respiratory mucosa, allowing easy penetration of mucorales. Hence, it should be limited in post-COVID individuals, it stated.

[2] USA: delta variant
Date: Wed 16 Jun 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/cdc-delta-variant-now-10-us-COVID-19-cases


CDC: delta variant now 10% of US COVID-19 cases
-----------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday [Tue 15 Jun 2021] said that delta, a highly transmissible COVID-19 variant first identified in India and currently sweeping through the United Kingdom, now makes up at least 10% of all US cases. On [22 May 2021], the variant had made up only 2.7% of cases.

The CDC also now designated delta as a variant of concern, which means the agency officially recognizes that the variant may carry a risk of more severe illness and transmissibility. In addition to delta, the CDC has noted 5 other variants of concern [VOC].

The rapid rise of the variant in the United Kingdom -- where it now accounts for 90% of cases -- has slowed that nation's reopening efforts by 4 or 5 weeks.

New York fully opens with 70% of adults having at least one vaccine dose
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the United States, both California and New York are now fully reopened after successful vaccination campaigns. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday [Tue 15 Jun 2021] that the state was relaxing all remaining COVID-19 restrictions after reaching its goal of vaccinating at least 70% of the population, according to Fox News. Masks will still be required in schools, subways, hospitals, nursing homes, larger venues, and jails and prisons.

Yesterday [Tue 15 Jun 2021], the United States reported 11 304 new COVID-19 cases and 339 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]. And the CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 375 186 675 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 312 915 170 have been administered, with 146 456 124 Americans fully vaccinated (64.7% of adults have had at least one dose). [https://COVID.cdc.gov/COVID-data-tracker/#vaccinations]

The country has 2.5 weeks until the 4th of July [Sun 4 Jul 2021], the deadline President Joe Biden has set for all Americans 18 and older to have had at least one vaccine dose.

To celebrate what Biden touts as the nation's Independence Day from the virus, the president is planning to hold a 4th of July celebration at the White House for first responders, essential workers, and military service members and their families to mark the nation's victory over the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. More than 1000 guests are expected, making this the largest White House event of Biden's presidency.

CDC offers 1st guidance on "long COVID"
-----------------------------------------
In a much anticipated move, the CDC published this week guidance for health providers on how to treat "long" COVID-19 infections, defined as patients experiencing symptoms of the virus at least 4 weeks after a confirmed acute infection. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/post-COVID-clinical-eval.html]

The CDC said primary care providers are most well-suited for handling these patients and that patients with post-COVID-19 conditions may share some symptoms that occur in patients who experience chronic fatigue syndrome, post-treatment Lyme disease, and mast cell activation syndrome.

Other US developments
---------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday [Tue 15 Jun 2021] cleared 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine that were produced at the Baltimore manufacturing plant run by Emergent BioSolutions, the Wall Street Journal [said]. The FDA had previously rejected 60 million doses from the plant because of possible contamination.

Congress and a private group are taking the 1st steps to investigate the pandemic and the nation's response to it.

[The delta variant is gaining ground in the US, having increased from 2.7% of cases on (22 May 2021) to 10%, less than one month later. Although the country is being declared free of the pandemic, we must keep track of the trajectory of the delta variant, which is more transmissible and possibly more severe.

"Public Health England figures show that the variant now accounts for 90% of UK cases, with the total number exceeding 42 000. Research indicates that delta is associated with an estimated 60% higher risk of household transmission than the alpha variant, which was already much more transmissible than the original version of the virus. There are also suggestions that delta could carry a much higher risk of hospital admission."

"Another concern is that the COVID vaccines seem to be less effective against the delta variant, especially after one dose. A PHE preprint found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca 60% effective against the delta variant 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, but both vaccines were only 33% effective against symptomatic disease from delta 3 weeks after the 1st dose (3). However, the most recent PHE analysis of 14  019 delta cases (14 Jun [2021]) indicates that 2 doses of either vaccine are still highly effective against hospital admission: 96% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 92% for Oxford-AstraZeneca (4)" (Mahase E: Delta variant: What is happening with transmission, hospital admissions, and restrictions? BMJ. 2021; 373: n1513; doi: 10.1136/bmj.n1513). - Mod.LK]

[3] Australia: transmission in quarantine hotel
Date: Wed 16 Jun 2021 6:09 a.m. AEST

https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/nsw-health-racing-to-solve-mystery-covid-19-spread-in-sydney-cbd-quarantine-hotel-c-3122661


NSW Health is investigating the source of a COVID-19 case diagnosed in hotel quarantine which has an identical viral sequence to 2 cases staying in an adjacent room.

The department said on Tuesday [15 Jun 2021] night it was unclear how and where transmission occurred from a couple to another returned traveller, who were all staying on the 4th floor of the Radisson Blu quarantine hotel.

Genomic sequencing has shown all 3 cases have identical viral sequences of the alpha strain (B.1.1.7).

The couple, who were asymptomatic, tested positive to COVID-19 on a routine day 2 test on [3 Jun 2021], NSW Health said in a statement.

The other returned traveller returned a negative day 2 test on 3 Jun [2021] before subsequently developing symptoms and testing positive for COVID-19 following a test on 5 Jun [2021].

The 3 cases were transferred from the Radisson Blu to the Special Health Accommodation, where they remain.

All 3 cases arrived into Sydney on the same flight from Doha on 1 Jun [2021] and stayed in adjacent rooms in the quarantine hotel.

"Early possibilities as to where transmission may have occurred from the couple to the secondary case include on the flight, on transport from the airport to the hotel, in the lobby of the hotel, or while in quarantine."

NSW Health said there was no evidence of further transmission.

"Out of an abundance of caution, all returned travellers who were on the same floor of the Radisson Blu hotel between 1 Jun and 5 Jun [2021] and were subsequently discharged are being contacted and asked to get tested and isolate at home pending further advice from NSW Health."

All staff who worked on the 4th floor of the hotel between1 Jun and 5 Jun [2021] have been asked to get tested and isolate pending further advice.

[The 2 groups of travelers, one a single traveler and the other a couple, both arrived in Sydney, Australia, on the same flight from Doha on 1 Jun 2021. Because the SARS-CoV-2 viruses from both the couple and the single traveler have identical viral sequences, a common source is presumed.

We are not told when the couple was previously PCR negative for COVID-19, but presumably they were tested for COVID-19 before traveling and tested negative within 72 hours before flight departure; otherwise, they would have not been permitted to travel. By the time they boarded the flight, however, they could have become contagious for COVID-19 at some point within the 72 hours before boarding and exposed the single traveler either in the Doha airport, while onboard during the flight to Sydney, or post-flight. We are not told about the in-flight seating arrangements for the couple and the single traveler, but other travelers on that flight were possible exposed and are also in mandatory quarantine and should have undergone the required post-arrival testing for COVID-19. Results of those tests may be informative.

Australia has strict entry criteria. People arriving in Australia are quarantined for 14 days and tested for COVID-19 in the 1st 48 hours and then between days 10 to 12 of quarantine. "All people travelling to Australia on flights departing on or after 22 Jan 2021 ... must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result at the time of check-in. Travelers must wear a mask while on the flight and while in the airport environment" (https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-COVID-19-restrictions/coronavirus-COVID-19-advice-for-international-travellers#quarantine-for-incoming-travellers). The pre-flight PCR test must be done 72 hours or less prior to the scheduled flight departure.

Because the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-14 days, it is possible that both the couple and the single traveler were exposed to the same contagious person either in the Doha airport, during the flight, on the bus to the quarantine hotel, or in the quarantine hotel. In this case, however, because the couple's incubation period would have been very short (2 days), more likely the single traveler was exposed to the couple in the 4 days either pre-flight in the Doha airport, on the plane, or post-flight, either at the Sydney airport, on the bus to the quarantine hotel, or while in adjacent quarantine hotel rooms. The air for the 2 rooms may be shared, and airflow between the 2 rooms should be checked. - Mod.ML]
