French doctors and international infectious disease experts have reported
what may be the largest outbreak of epidemic typhus since World War II.
The outbreak has thus far affected up to 100,000 persons, but appears
restricted to refugee camps in the highland provinces of Burundi according
to officials at the WHO Center for Rickettsial Diseases in Marseilles, France.
[The epidemic form of typhus is caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_. The
disease is carried by body lice, and can be easily treated with a single
dose of doxycycline. Untreated persons often die within three weeks [case
fatality rates estimated from 10-40%. Poor sanitation in the colder
regions of the central highlands of Burundi, where people typically wear
several layers of clothing are conducive to a high prevalence of body louse
infestation, and a high incidence of disease.
