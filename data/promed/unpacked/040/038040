On [21 May 2011], an outbreak of anthrax occurred in the Azul [Buenos
Aires province] Alert and Response Program zone, specifically in the
Paraje El Destierro, corresponding to the Avenamiento no.5 road, where
since 1989 there have been 5 sporadic outbreaks of this zoonosis.

The herd comprised 84 adult cattle which had been corralled in the
feedlot for more than 80 days. One of these animals died suddenly,
passing blood from all its natural openings. The animals had been
vaccinated 150 [days?] before against anthrax. Usually annual
vaccination is adequate since the establishment does not have a
history of the disease. _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated in a bone
(metacarpal), which was referred to the Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory [in Azul] for diagnosis. This isolate was sensitive to the
following veterinary antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin,
tetracycline, gentamicin, florfenicol and ciprofloxacin.

The carcass was not burnt. The veterinary officer acted in an
efficient manner for the (animal's) disposal by applying the method of
"a controlled covering" [a thick plastic tarpaulin, pegged down -
Mod.MHJ] and sprayed 5 percent formalin for the elimination of any
spores and vegetative forms of _B. anthracis_.

[Why a corralled animal should come down with anthrax is a puzzle.
Logically the 1st suspicion would be that the mineral supplement might
have been contaminated -- yet only one animal, not a number, was
clinically affected. So it would have to be a minimal dose with any
other animals having only a subclinical exposure. Or that there was an
unobserved nearby outbreak and a tabanid female fly with contaminated
mouthparts came by for a snack. Further investigations may resolve
this conundrum.

There is an unfortunate history of recently vaccinated animals
succumbing to this disease in Argentina. Why has resisted
investigation. They use a standard Sterne vaccine strain and standard
doses of the vaccine.
