Since the morning of Sat 11 Jul 2009, several reports from
practitioners have been received, seemingly indicative of an extensive
outbreak of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF).

The affected area is the southern coast and the western Shfella [see
comment; names of 13 villages within the said zone are included. -
Mod.AS].

The clinical signs include: milk production drop, lameness,
salivation, dorsal subcutaneous emphysema, breathing difficulties,
high fever and recumbency.

Recommended treatment - NSAIDs [Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
(encouraging results recorded).

The last year of BEF occurrence was 2004, when it appeared in the same
area as early as the end of June 2004.

[The 13 cattle farms named in the above report are located within
square 13 and the southwestern part of square 10 in the interactive
map available at <http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>.
Until confirmed in the laboratory (which should also exclude the
remote possibility of FMDV involvement), this outbreak remains
"suspected."

The report includes also a PowerPoint presentation on the economical
losses related to the 2004 epizootic, authored by Nadav Galon and
Israel Yeruham. Among other items, it provides the following
observations: Total losses in 31 analysed infected dairy farms were
estimated to be around 9.36 million Israeli Shekels [USD 2.4 million],
namely a mean of 149 000 Shekels [USD 38 205] per farm. The 3 main
contributing factors to the losses were: milk loss (43 percent),
mortalities (26 percent) and abortions (12 percent).

BEF is also known as bovine epizootic fever, 3-day sickness, 3-day
stiffsickness, dragon boat disease, lazy man's disease and dengue of
cattle. It is not zoonotic and not included in OIE's list of
notifiable diseases. The disease has been reported to be increasingly
active in several Middle-Eastern countries since the early 1990's; in
Israel, the mortality rate in 1990 was 3 percent and in 1999 almost 4
percent in affected dairy herds. The average mortality or
emergency-slaughter rates in such herds was 0.4 percent for calves (up
to one year old) and 4.4 percent for cows in production. Milk
production losses were estimated as 380 kg per milking cow in affected
herds. <http://www.isrvma.org/article/55_3_6.htm#EPHEMERAL%20FEVER>.

Additional data on the 2004 epizootic can be found in the paper by I.
Yeruham, H. Yadin, I. Abramovitch, and Z. Shama. Bovine ephemeral
fever in a dairy cattle herd in the Jordan Valley. Vet Rec., Feb 2005;
156: pp 284-286. Following the 2004 epizootic, the Israeli Veterinary
Services/Kimron Veterinary Institute undertook the production of an
inactivated BEF vaccine, which since 2008 has been put into limited
experimental field application.

The affected zone is along the Gaza strip and close to Egypt's Sinai.
It will be interesting to note if similar cases have been seen in the
Gaza strip and/or Egypt as well as in other countries in the region;
arthropod vectors know no borders.

BEF deserves enhanced attention, having -- like other arthropod-borne
viral diseases -- the potential of spreading into virgin areas, which
seem increasingly receptive.
