[NCD has a characteristic seasonal pattern in Israel, peaking during the winter months (November-April). During the years 1972-2010, the lowest number of outbreaks was recorded in September. The disease is regarded as endemic in all neighbouring countries. The seasonal pattern observed in Israel is demonstrated in the following recent OIE data, pertaining to the period 2012 to mid-2014, as included in the most recent available monthly reports (up to June 2014):

Jan / Feb / Mar / Apr / May / Jun / Jul / Aug / Sep / Oct / Nov / Dec // Total
2012:
10 / 11 / 11 / 5 / 6 / 0 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 3 / 9 // 48
2013:
7 / 1 / 2 / 1 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 1 // 20
2014:
2 / 4 / 3 / 14 / 7 / 4 / (periodic summary report July-December 2014 not yet available; see data from the follow-up reports, further)

On 12 Dec 2013, following the absence of cases since Sep 2013, Israel notified the previous epizootic "resolved since 30 Sep 2013". The disease recurred on 22 Dec 2013; since then, 59 new outbreaks have been reported, covered in an immediate notification and 17 follow-up reports, the most recent of which (No. 17) is presented in this ProMED-mail posting. Links to all 18 reports and a map indicating the relevant locations of the 59 new outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14571.

The disease was absent during September/October 2014. Since the start of the current seasonal upsurge, in November 2014, 21 new outbreaks have already been reported to the OIE, including the 4 new outbreaks covered in the current follow-up report No. 17.

The control policy applied in Israel is in line with EC's requirements: strict stamping out (owners compensated), surveillance and application of infected zones/severe quarantine measures. Vaccination is routinely applied, accompanied by scheduled antibody follow-up.

The extent of control activities may be apparent from the latest available (2013) annual report to the OIE:

Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
330 793 / 29 858 / 10 550 / 265 313 / 12 930

Since 2011, a certain decrease in the incidence of NCD was reported: 110 outbreaks in 2011, 56 in 2012, and 20 in 2013. As can be assumed from the accumulating data in the recent follow-up reports, there was an upsurge in spring 2014 (14 outbreaks in April alone; see above); since the start of the current winter's season, November 2014, and as of late March 2015, 20 new outbreaks have been reported. It remains to be seen if this season the decreasing tendency will (hopefully) return.

Subscribers who happen to master the Hebrew language, or are ready to apply machine translation, are referred to the recently published annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) for 2013, available at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doch_shnati_2013.pdf. For the NCD chapter (including the 2013 map), see pages 216-218. For a graph showing NCD outbreaks in Israel between 1998-2013, see the graph on page 244 (top left, in blue; "2012" should read "2013").

A local epidemiological assessment of NCD in Israel will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
