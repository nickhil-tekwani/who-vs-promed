British Columbia [B.C.] Health Minister Adrian Dix announced last month [February 2019] B.C. is considering a vaccination registration system in the province's schools after a measles outbreak. As of last week there have been at least 17 confirmed measles cases this year [2019]. In addition to the measles, there have been 2 reported cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, on Vancouver Island this week.

The spread of communicable diseases increases when less than 90 to 95% of the population is immunized. "That (a lower rate of immunization) is considered to be a contributing factor" to the increase of pertussis, said Dr. Manish Sadarangani, director of the vaccine evaluation centre at the B.C. Children's Hospital.

Children should be immunized against pertussis at 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, in preschool, and in Grade 9, he said. And pregnant women are immunized to protect their newborns up to the age of 2 months, he said. Pertussis after age 15 or so causes a bad cough that's annoying but not dangerous. But a baby with whooping cough could cough till they're blue or vomiting and that could lead to a lack of oxygen. In a worst case, that can be fatal, he said.

"There is a push to have requirements for people to have all their (vaccination) documents before they go to school," said Sadarangani. A Health Ministry spokeswoman said pertussis is among the diseases that it recommends immunizing against.

Pertussis in B.C., like elsewhere, "remains an endemic disease" that goes through cyclical peaks every 3 to 5 years, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control website. It says there has been a "gradual increase in overall pertussis activity" since 2012 and that "may reflect changes in population-level immunity."

In B.C., there were fewer than 13 confirmed cases per 100 000 population in 2017, which was slightly lower than the fewer than 20 cases in 2015 and 2016. But it's higher than rates of fewer than 5 to 10 per 100 000 in 2008 through 2014, according to the Centre. The highest rates were in Vancouver Island and Interior health authorities, particularly in Kootenay Boundary, South Vancouver Island and Okanagan regions, it said.

In 2017, the highest rates of pertussis were among babies one year and under, children 10 to 14 years old, and children 5 to 9. The lowest rates were recorded for children one to 4 years old, children 15 to 19, and adults 20 and older, it said.

An Angus Reid Institute poll released last month [February 2019] showed 70% of respondents believed vaccines against deadly diseases should be mandatory for schoolchildren. And a B.C. petition signed so far by more than 45 000 people is calling for mandatory vaccination for babies and kids. In its report, Angus Reid notes that reasons for not vaccinating children include philosophical, religious or personal reasons. It notes some parents believe chiropractic practices and naturopathy are alternatives to vaccination, which Health Canada says is not true.

Sadarangani said it's rare for people to receive a medical exemption for vaccinations, perhaps for a child sick with cancer, and it's important to immunize those who can be vaccinated to help protect those who can't be, the so-called herd immunity. He said if he would meet families who choose not to immunize, "I would try to talk to them to find out the reason."

The Health Unit was notified this week that one case of whooping cough had been confirmed with laboratory testing, and that 3 other family members in the same household are ill with symptoms. Those ill were either not vaccinated or partially vaccinated against the virus.

The current cases of whooping cough are recovering at home, Rock says, and the Health Unit has been following up with anyone who may have been in contact with the family. At this time, there does not appear to be any additional cases, but she encourages anyone who develops symptoms to contact their health care provider or emergency room to arrange for testing.

The Health Unit is also holding immunization clinics for students or people who do not have a health care provider. To learn more, or to book an appointment, call the Health Unit toll-free at 1-866-888-4577, ext. 1507.

Kanahooka High School parents have been urged to be on the lookout for symptoms of whooping cough after a confirmed case in a student at the school. In a recent letter to parents, Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District public health director Curtis Gregory said symptoms included a dry cough, sore throat, runny nose and a cough which was often worse at night or which came in bouts.

Health data reveals there were 69 confirmed cases of whooping cough throughout the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District in January and February [2019]. That compares to 13 cases in the first 2 months of 2018; although there were 105 cases in January and February 2017.

Across NSW [New South Wales], 1112 cases have been reported so far this year [2019].

Nearly 50 students at Harvard-Westlake School have been recently diagnosed with whooping cough, in an outbreak that has forced school officials to send students home at the 1st sign of illness.

But all of the sick students had been vaccinated against the disease, according to school officials. In fact, all 90 people who have recently come down with pertussis - the official name for whooping cough - in Los Angeles County this year had been immunized against it, according to county officials.

It turns out that 4 years after someone receives the booster shot in about the 7th grade, the vaccine's protection nearly vanishes, endangering high schoolers such as those at Harvard-Westlake, said Dr. James Cherry, a UCLA expert on pediatric infectious diseases. "It is not surprising at all," Cherry said of the recent cases.

The outbreak is a real-life example of something that experts have been noticing since doctors switched to a new form of the pertussis vaccine in 1997: Immunity wanes quickly.

The pertussis outbreak raises questions about how to best administer a vaccine when its protection fades so quickly. People now in high school are one of the 1st generations to receive only the new, shorter-lived form of the vaccine, making them test cases for these problems.

These recent whooping cough cases also serve as a contrast to the measles outbreaks across the country, which are mostly among people who declined vaccinations. In those cases, immunization probably would have prevented most of the illnesses.

Los Angeles County officials announced last month [February 2019] that there were 3 clusters of whooping cough cases among adolescents across the county: 46 students have been diagnosed with pertussis at Harvard-Westlake, where enrollment is about 1600. A total of 18 students there have not been vaccinated against pertussis, but none of them has caught the illness, school spokesman Ari Engelberg said; 10 students at St. Anastasia Catholic School in Westchester also caught pertussis. All had been vaccinated, according to school officials;

Under California law, children must receive all of their doses of whooping cough vaccine to be allowed to attend school, unless they have a medical reason not to be vaccinated. By the time they turn 6, most children have received 5 doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis vaccine, or DTaP. Then they must get a booster before entering 7th grade. The immunizations are concentrated in the earliest years of life because babies are the most likely to die from whooping cough, named for the sound people make when they're gasping for air. "Deaths virtually all occur in the first 2 months of life," Cherry said.

But studies have found that immunity drops quickly after getting the shot. One study from Kaiser Permanente found that protection fell an average of 42% a year after the last childhood dose at about age 6.

The rapidly waning immunity is linked to the kind of vaccine children receive, experts say. Before 1997, children received a form known as whole cell, which sometimes caused side effects, such as convulsions and severe fevers. So officials switched to the current acellular vaccine, which has fewer side effects but does not provide immunity for as long.

Even the middle school booster, intended to extend immunity, protects about 80% of people who receive it for about a year but mostly stops providing immunity after that, another Kaiser study found.

L.A. County public health officials said the recent cases may be focused in young adults because they are more susceptible to the illness because they received only the acellular vaccine.

"There is no increase in the current overall number of cases compared to past years, but the number of reported clusters has risen in 11- to 18-year-olds," officials said in a statement to The Times. "Waning immunity is a well-recognized phenomenon ... [and] seems to be the most plausible explanation for the recent clusters seen by the department."

Some scientists have suggested that it would make more sense to administer the vaccine in a targeted fashion, such as before an outbreak or when one has just begun. But Dr. Armand Dorian, chief medical officer at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, said waiting to administer it when an outbreak has begun doesn't make sense. At that point, antibiotics are needed. "It's too late to do brush clearance. You have to come in with a helicopter and douse a fire," he said. Dorian said that even though the vaccine's immunity wanes, increasing coverage rates in the community would help prevent pertussis outbreaks.

In the 2017-2018 school year, 96% of kindergartners had all their doses of the pertussis vaccine and 98% of 7th-graders had received the booster, according to state data. Both of those percentages dropped slightly from the previous school year.

Doctors recommend that pregnant mothers get an additional dose of the vaccine so they can protect their newborns. But only 52% of new mothers in 2016 were vaccinated, according to a report from the California Department of Public Health.

If vaccination rates were higher, Dorian said, pertussis would not be able to enter a community in the 1st place. The bacterium is much more likely to spread among people who have not been vaccinated.

People who have been vaccinated and still get pertussis also contract a less severe form of the illness that is likely to be less contagious. So it's possible that the recent outbreaks originated with someone who had not been immunized, even though the disease is now spreading among people who have been vaccinated, Dorian said. "Once there's a chink in the armor and that unvaccinated population grows, then the actual protection of the vaccination significantly drops, even for those who are vaccinated," he said.

The real concern now is that a baby could contract whooping cough. Pertussis kills about 20 people in the United States each year, almost all of them infants. The last person to die from pertussis in California was a baby in San Bernardino County in 2018. "It's a cough, a whooping cough, which means it loves to spread," Dorian
said.
