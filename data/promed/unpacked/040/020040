An outbreak of canine distemper has killed a lioness and a tiger at an exotic animal sanctuary in Wylie.

Since June 2013, the distemper virus has infected more than 20 big cats, according to officials at In-Sync Exotics Wildlife Rescue and Education Center. It killed Apollo, a 12-year-old male tiger, and Layla, an 18-year-old lioness, in the past week. Apollo's death "came out of the blue," said Lisa Williams, media director for the center. "Layla had been sick for quite a while." She added: "It's hard to say who's healthy and who's not."

In-Sync Exotics is a nonprofit rescue center on the southern shore of Lavon Lake. It cares for cats and offers paid tours to the public. The big cats there were vaccinated against feline distemper but not canine distemper, said Williams. Half of all dogs that contract the virus die, she said.

Large cats at In-Sync are being treated with antibiotics, vitamins and supplements, but there's no way to predict how successful those treatments will be. "Unfortunately, very little is known about how this disease affects big cats," said a statement on the rescue center's website. It added: "We are doing everything that we can, including working closely with our own vets and several vets who specialize in the treatment of canine distemper. There is no known treatment for the virus itself, so what we are primarily doing is supportive care: antibiotics to fight off secondary infections, fluids, and vitamins and other medications to help boost the cats' immune systems. We are also using some experimental treatments that may help."

Because of the dearth of information on how canine distemper affects big cats, "we are documenting everything, every day," the statement said. Daily logs are being kept to record each animal's symptoms, drug and vitamin dosages, and other medical information. Hopefully, these efforts will assist other facilities who may face this horrible disease in the future," the statement said. "Please be assured that we are doing everything possible to save our beloved cats, and they are receiving 24/7 dedicated nursing care by our tireless staff and volunteers."

The center has 59 cats, but only 32 are "big cats," tigers, lions and leopards. Smaller cats, such as cheetahs and cougars, have not been infected. Williams said they're immune to canine distemper.

Of the 32 big cats, 22 have the virus, she said. Three of the animals are in critical condition. "By the time we realized what was going on, the distemper had already spread out," said Williams. To keep the disease from spreading further, she said, volunteers who are working with the infected cats stay away from those that are healthy.

Williams said center officials think the virus might have been transmitted through the urine and feces of raccoons, which walk along the tops of the cats' enclosures. There has been an outbreak of canine distemper in raccoons in North Texas, she said. She said the infected cats are lethargic, ignoring their toys and bathing pools and not eating well.

Since the outbreak was discovered, volunteers have been preparing special meals for the big cats, pork loin, bacon, deer, elk, and so forth. The meals are a way to tempt them the take their pills, up to 50 a day.

"We do have some that seem a little depressed," she said. "We don't know if it's because they lost the cat that they were close to. But they definitely knew when they lost Apollo. You can tell by their behavior. They act a little funny. They're very perceptive."

Apollo had been at the sanctuary for more than 4 years after being rescued from a Kaufman private exhibitor. "Apollo had a really bad life before he came here," said Williams. "He had been neglected and abused. "Once we earned his trust, he became extremely friendly, not to everyone, but to those he trusted."

She said the tiger liked to push around a 50-gallon barrel to get it to stand upright. He also liked to play in his water tub, then roll in the dirt until he was muddied.

In-Sync is largely supported by donations. On its website, the organization has posted copies of the documents, known as Form 990s, that it files annually with the Internal Revenue Service to preserve its tax-exempt status. In 2010, the most recent year for which those documents are posted, In-Sync listed total revenues of USS 460 518, including USD 438 590 in contributions and grants. It listed total expenditures of USD 410 927.

Those wishing to help with the current crisis are asked to consider monetary gifts or donations of "meat (venison, duck, antelope, beef heart, chicken, turkey, Cornish hens, pork, steak, bacon, etc), and Vitamin C 1000 mg, along with regular supplies such as hand sanitizer, paper towels, large contractor trash bags, towels, blankets, bleach, and bottled water."

[Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly infectious morbillivirus within the paramyxovirus family, a family which also includes measles virus of humans, phocine morbillivirus of pinnipeds, rinderpest virus of cloven-hoofed animals, and peste-des-petits-ruminants virus of small ruminants (1). Canine distemper viral infections have been diagnosed in _Canidae_, _Mustelidae_, and some species of _Procyonidae_.

Naturally-occurring, CDV disease has been reported in a Bengal tiger (3) and a captive Siberian tiger (4) with clinical, serological, and neurological manifestations similar to those occurring in dogs.

Canine distemper can manifest itself in many forms; the clinical signs characteristic of virulent CDV infections include ocular discharge, nasal discharge, diarrhea, vomiting, cramping of the temporalis muscle of the jaw, and entire body tremors (7). In any one case, none or all of these clinical signs may be present.

At one point, there was concern that CDV vaccines used on dogs may not have been as safe as zoo officials may have liked. However, killed virus preparations appear to be safe, but not as effective as modified live products or perhaps some molecular products. In the past, chick embryo-adapted CDV vaccines were considered safe, as were the egg vaccines.

Vaccination may be advised, but killed virus preparations may be safer until modified live products have been tested in these animals. Because chick embryo-adapted CDV vaccines are in general safer than dog tissue culture-adapted CDV vaccines, the egg vaccines should be used for testing safety and efficacy in large cats.
