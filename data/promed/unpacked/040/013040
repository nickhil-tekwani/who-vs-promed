A flock of poultry that tested positive for bird flu has been culled in Angus, the Scottish government has announced. Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the avian influenza (H5N1) virus is very low.

However, a UK-wide bird flu prevention zone has come into force meaning bird keepers need to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. The move follows bird flu outbreaks in other parts of the UK. Temporary control zones have also been set up around the infected premises in Angus to limit the risk of the disease.

Rural Affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon said: "With the recent disease confirmations in wild and captive birds in the UK, it is not unexpected for avian influenza to be found in birds here. Temporary control zones have been put in place around the infected premises and we ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds."

Food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and that cooked poultry products including eggs are safe to eat.

Scotland's chief veterinary officer, Sheila Voas, said: "We are conducting further tests to establish the pathogenicity of avian influenza H5N1 in a flock of birds in the Angus constituency. "We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately."

[The affected animals, in Angus, referred to in the BBC report as "a flock of poultry", have been referred to in other media sources as "captive birds". Specified, official information, including species, number and husbandry data, would be helpful.

The locations of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks which have involved poultry, captive, and wild birds across Europe during the period 1 Sep 2021 to 2 Nov 2021, are presented in Map 1, page 3 of DEFRA's updated assesment document, 'Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in the UK and Europe', available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1030888/HPAI-assessment-UK-Europe-2-Nov-2021.pdf. The map includes an overlay indicating the migratory birds flyways. The affected countries in Northern Europe, located within the WestAsian flyway (lined black) are UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.

The DEFRA assesment includes additional information on the current H5 events in GB, as well as in northern and southern Europe, arriving at the following conclusions:

"Given the detection of several cases of HPAIV H5N1 in wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland with the increasing number of poultry outbreaks in the Netherlands and in northern Germany, the risk of incursion of HPAI H5 in wild birds in GB has been raised from MEDIUM (event occurs regularly) to HIGH (event occurs often).

"The risk of exposure of poultry to HPAI H5 in GB where biosecurity is sub-optimal has been raised from LOW (medium uncertainty) to MEDIUM (medium uncertainty).

"The risk of exposure of poultry to HPAI H5 in GB where biosecurity is stringent remains at LOW but the uncertainty is to increase from low to medium uncertainty. This emphasises the importance of maintaining good biosecurity.

"At this stage last year (30 Oct 2020) the wild bird risk was still medium and the poultry risk low. The wild bird risk was raised to HIGH and the poultry risk to MEDIUM on 4 Nov 2020, so events this year are about a week earlier than last year.

"We are currently in a period of rapid seasonal change with respect to these risks and will continue to closely monitor the situation as more wild birds from northern Europe will be arriving over the few weeks".
