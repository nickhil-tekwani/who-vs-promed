Cholera is a waterborne disease which is endemic to Yemen, and the war-torn country witnessed its worst outbreak in its modern history in 2017. Nearly 110 000 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in war-hit Yemen since the beginning of January 2019, including 190 related deaths, the UN said on Mon 25 Mar 2019.

The UN office for humanitarian affairs (OCHA) said children under the age of 5 make up nearly 1/3rd of 108 889 cases which were reported between 1 Jan 2019 and 17 Mar 2019. OCHA said the spike, which comes 2 years after Yemen suffered its worst cholera outbreak, was concentrated in 6 governorates including in the Red Sea port of Hodeida and the Sanaa province home to the capital.

Early rains could be blamed for the recent increase in suspected cholera cases, it said. "The situation is exacerbated by poor maintenance of sewage disposal systems in many of the affected districts, the use of contaminated water for irrigation, and population movements," OCHA added.

Yemen's brutal conflict, which pits Iran-linked rebels against a regional pro-government alliance led by Saudi Arabia, has left some 10 000 people dead since 2015 and pushed millions to the brink of famine. The war has created the perfect environment for cholera to thrive, as civilians across the country lack access to clean water and health care.

[This horrific outbreak of cholera has persisted since 2017, but usually the early months of the year have been relatively spared. Reporting almost 110 000 cases in about 11 weeks suggests that as time goes on, many more cases will occur. The low case fatality rate overall suggests that although cholera has been documented, the outbreak may be caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. - Mod.LL
