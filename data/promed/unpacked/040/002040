Hepatitis E continues to bite; 7727 cases registered
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 175 new cases of hepatitis E were registered in Epi week
35 (25 - 31 Aug 2008) reflecting a decline of 21 percent in the
number of new cases compared to Epi week 34.

In Epi week 34 220 new cases were registered. There are cases of
relapse because some patients are failing to complete treatment. In
the same week (Epi week 35), 4 people succumbed to the disease. A
cumulative total of 7727 cases and 121 deaths have been registered in
17 sub counties in Kitgum district since the onset of the epidemic on
25 Oct 2007. It should, however, be noted that there are deaths and
hepatitis E cases that are not reported to health centres.

According to the Branch Field Coordinator, Kitgum, Mr. Peter Opika
Opoka, health assistants in all sub counties have been asked to
follow up and clarify the case definition. The increase in the number
of deaths is attributed to late reporting to health facilities and
consumption of the local Herbs which add toxic materials to the
already infected liver. Mr. Opika says residents usually consume the
local herbs in KWETE (Local Brew) and this causes re-infection.

Of the 19 sub counties in Kitgum District, 17 have been affected. The
2 sub counties of Palabek Kal and Palabek Ogili that have not been
affected have in the past suffered cholera outbreaks but sanitation
in the areas has reportedly improved, a reason they could have
survived the Hepatitis E outbreak.

A team from Ministry of Health is holding several meetings with
stakeholders in Kitgum District to review strategies of fighting the
disease and coordinating resources. The team includes; one officer in
charge of Environmental Health, another in charge of social
mobilization and the in-charge clinical medicine.

Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) is continuing with interventions in
Agoro Sub County, one of the worst affected sub counties in Kitgum
District, through provision of safe water. URCS is chlorinating water
at 24 boreholes and as of 31 Aug 2008, 3 260 000 litres of water had
been chlorinated.

URCS is also conducting hygiene promotion through the village health
teams and the Local council one chairman. This is being done through
sensitization and clean-up campaigns; ensuring latrine cleaning and
safe water and food at household level.

The National Society is verifying village registers with the view of
distributing Jerry cans and soap to enhance hygiene and safe water
storage. IEC materials (Posters, Brochures and T-shirts) to create
awareness on the prevention and control of Hepatitis E are also being
distributed throughout the district. The interventions have helped to
scale down the rate of infections in Agoro.

[One hopes that the 21 percent decline in cases signals that the peak
of the epidemic has passed. The Ministry of Health/WHO/ Uganda Red
Cross Society efforts to provide safe water and improve hygiene in
the affected areas may be slowing the spread of this fecal-orally
transmitted virus disease. - Mod.TY]
