A woman suffering from Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) died of the disease at Shifa International Hospital (SIH) here [Fri 6 Apr 2018]. This is the 1st confirmed case of CCHF in Pakistan this year [2018].

Hailing from Mianwali, the middle-aged lady remained under treatment at SIH for 3 days. Her blood samples were sent to the National Institute of Health, which confirmed the suspected diagnosis. Animal handling was common in the family of the deceased, whose body was sent to her hometown for burial the same day. The government of Punjab is said to have taken stock of the situation and has instituted emergency interventions for the relevant area.

[This is the first reported case of CCHF from Pakistan in 2018. The case originated from southern Punjab region, with the history of animal handling in the case. Generally the case numbers of CCHF go up in the country from May onwards, due to a multitude of causes, including warmer climates, increased tick activity, increase in human and animal movements, etc.

CCHF provides the perfect opportunity for multi-sectoral collaboration in implementing control measures by both human and livestock/animal health sectors.
