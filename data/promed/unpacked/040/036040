As of 31 Oct 2005, WHO has received reports of 2 suspected deaths
from yellow fever in the region of Kayes. It was possible to obtain
laboratory confirmation of one of these cases, a boy 3 years old. The
tests were carried out at the national reference laboratory in Mali
and then confirmed at the regional reference laboratory, the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal.


A vaccination campaign is ongoing in the districts of Bafoulabe,
Kadiolo, Kolondieba, Selingue and Yanfolila districts, where 300 000
persons have been vaccinated to date. Plans are under way to extend
the coverage to more districts in the region.

[Mali is a landlocked country divided into 3 natural zones: the
southern, cultivated zone (referred to as Sudanese); the central,
semiarid zone (referred to as Sahelian); and the northern, arid zone
(referred to as Saharan). Mali borders Algeria, Burkina Faso, Guinea,
Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. Yellow fever is
endemic in Mali. A detailed map of yellow fever endemic zones in
Africa is available (see also:
<http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/images/map4-12.gif>).

There are recent outbreaks in Mali (this posting) and Guinea
(20051102.3207). In the commentary for the outbreak in Guinea, I
stated that "Yellow fever is endemic to this neighborhood and most of
the African continent". Obviously the word 'most' is a bit too heavy
to describe the extent of the yellow fever endemic zones in Africa.
