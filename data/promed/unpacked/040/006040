Mosquitoes in Maryland are malaria free
---------------------------------------
Mosquitoes trapped in Montgomery County, Maryland, near the Virginia state
line tested negative for malaria yesterday, offering the first results from
a series of follow-up tests being performed in Maryland after 2 teenagers
from neighboring Loudoun County, Virginia, were infected with the disease
over the summer.
The tests were conducted for Montgomery by military malaria experts from
the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences after Loudoun
officials announced last week that 2 pools of mosquitoes captured near the
Potomac River had tested positive for malaria. Government researchers from
Virginia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
continued their effort yesterday to analyze the 2 pools of mosquitoes in
Loudoun, and one pool near Herndon in Fairfax County (Virginia).
Clarke Environmental Mosquito Control, the contractor hired by Northern
Virginia jurisdictions, said it discovered the pools using a new technology
called a VecTest, which was developed for the army. It is designed to
indicate the presence of a protein associated with the parasite that causes
malaria. Federal researchers said the test has proved highly accurate in
field tests, but they said finding such a high number of infected
mosquitoes in an area that has had no evidence of a widespread malaria
outbreak made them suspicious of the results.
Garvey said the tests conducted in Maryland yesterday used the VecTest. Any
positives would have been confirmed using a more traditional testing
regimen, she said.
