[The described foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Taiwan
(designated by OIE as "Chinese Taipei"), is the 3rd outbreak during
2010. All 3 outbreaks have been caused by serotype O, affecting
swine. The 2 previous outbreaks, reported to the OIE on 13 Feb and 25
Jun 2010, involved clinical disease; both were eradicated by stamping
out, without application of vaccination. That, in difference with the
current outbreak which has been sub-clinical, did not require
application of stamping out, and has been followed by ring
vaccination. The reports, including maps showing the respective
locations of the 3 outbreaks in Taiwan, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=country_reports>.
