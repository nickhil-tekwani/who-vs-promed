International disease monitoring, July to September [2010]: Bluetongue
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are still no reports of bluetongue virus (BTV) from northern European
countries. [This situation is unchanged as of 27 Nov 2010. - Mod.AS]

Morocco reported outbreaks of BTV-1 and BTV-4 for the 1st time this year.
Vaccination with an attenuated vaccine for BTV-1 and BTV-4 is ongoing. Last
year (2009), Morocco reported the same serotypes from various regions and
applied vaccination in response.

BTV-1 has been reported for the 1st time in Algeria. Vaccination is not
being applied.

BTV-1
Italy reported one outbreak of BTV-1 in sentinel goats in Cagliari, Sardinia.
Spain reported an outbreak of BTV-1 in the Badajoz region. According to the
disease report, the cattle farm involved was part of a sentinel
serosurveillance programme. There is no information about whether the virus
has been isolated and what control measures are in place Â­- the report
suggests none, which indicates a lack of circulating virus.
Morocco reported 18 outbreaks of BTV-1 in sheep in the Sud, Centre Sud and
Tensift regions.
Algeria reported 24 outbreaks of BTV-1 in sheep in the Bouira, Mila, Jijel,
Tizi Ouzo, Setif and Bejaia regions.

BTV-2
Italy reported an outbreak of BTV-2 in Salerno, south of Naples, and 5
outbreaks in Sassari and Olbia Tempio (both in Sardinia) in sentinel sheep.

BTV-4
Italy reported BTV-4 in sentinel sheep in Sardinia (Olbia Tempio).
Two outbreaks of BTV-4 have been reported in the south of Spain
(Extremadura and Jaen) [But see archived regarding later outbreaks in
Andalusia. - Mod.AS]. Spain has reclassified its low-risk zone for BTV-4 to
a risk zone. Typing of the virus will determine whether it is a new
introduction of BTV from Morocco or a residual virus from previous outbreaks.
Morocco reported 210 outbreaks of BTV-4 in Sud, Tensift, Centre Sud and
Nord Ouest regions.

BTV-8
Spain considers the risk of introduction of BTV-8 to be very low and will
move to voluntary vaccination for this serotype from January 2011. [See
commentary].

[The good news is the complete absence of BTV-8 from western and north
Europe during 2010; this will lead to an alleviation of the disease
control/prevention measures, as already done in the UK (see the following
item).

On the other hand, several countries have reported BT cases during October
or November 2010.

Portugal reported 6 outbreaks of BTV-1, of which 5 in clinically suspected
sheep and one in cattle tested within slaughterhouse surveillance. The 1st
case was confirmed on 4 Oct 2010; see Portugal's presentation to SCFCAH
9-10 Nov 2010, at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/2010110910_bt_portugal.pdf>.


Cyprus conducts a BTV surveillance programme based on the serological
examination of sentinel animals. Sentinel animals (cattle, sheep and goats)
are tested on a monthly basis "from 17 farms spread evenly in the area
under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus."
From each of 17 farms, 10 sentinel animals are tested monthly by c-ELISA
for the present of antibodies against bluetongue virus.

According to Cyprus presentation to SCFCAH of 9-10 Nov 2010, on 22 Oct
2010, 7/10 sheep from a flock (294 sheep, 28 goats) located at Pegeia
village in the district of PAPHOS reacted positively to bluetongue virus
(seroconverted). 6 out the 7 reacted positively by RRT-PCR; none showed
clinical sign. Samples were sent to the Community Reference Laboratory
(Pirbright) for virus confirmation and typing (results pending). See
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/2010110910_bt_cyprus.pdf>.


Spain reported outbreaks of BTV-1 and BTV-4 during 2010. On 23 Nov 2010, a
newswire included details of one suspected outbreak of BTV-8 in Andalusia.
ProMED-mail's request for information on this puzzling case is pending
(archived 20101126.4267).

According to IAH (Pirbright) data, BTV-4 was identified in cattle in
southern Israel during Jan 2010.

According to a Turkish notification to the OIE dated 15 Oct 2010, clinical
BT outbreak in sheep had been observed in Antalya in May 2010, later found
to be caused by BTV-16. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue in Europe - changes to post import testing requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose
-------
To make livestock keepers and importers aware of the changes to DEFRA's
post import testing requirements for Bluetongue virus (BTV) susceptible
animals. These changes will take effect from 26 Nov 2010.

Background
----------
At present, every bluetongue (BT) susceptible domestic animal imported from
continental Europe [to the UK] is blood tested for BT after arrival in
Great Britain (GB). This surveillance requirement has allowed us to assess
disease incursion/spread through movement of infected animals from the
continent.

BTV cases have decreased significantly across Europe in 2009 and 2010. The
mass vaccination campaigns among Member States appear to have been
successful in controlling the spread of disease and we consider that the
threat of disease infection from the continent is now very low. GB is also
part of a Low Risk Zone which means that all imports arriving from a BTV
Protection Zone must be naturally immune or vaccinated.

In view of this changing risk DEFRA's post-import testing policy has
consequently been revised in consultation with BTV experts, The Devolved
Administrations and industry stakeholders.

Action
------
As from 26 Nov 2010, post import testing will change from single post
import testing for all BTV susceptible animals entering GB at 5-7 days to a
risk-based regime as for other diseases whereby imports will be tested
depending on the risk assessment of each susceptible consignment.

Given the change in risk from BT, 100 percent testing for BT will stop and
move to a risk based testing approach, based on:
- the BTV status of the country of origin;
- the level of midge activity in the country of origin which would vary by
season;
- random tests prioritising animals perceived to be at higher risk.

These risks will be regularly reviewed so that alterations to the checking
regime can be made in response to any emerging risks.

Animals imported from The Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland do not require testing for BTV.

We understand that on the few occasions when BT susceptible exotic zoo
animals are imported post import testing may pose some safety concerns for
both the animals and their handlers. In cases where zoos are expecting
imports of BT susceptible exotic animals we would advise that they plan
ahead and inform Animal Health in advance. In these cases, taking into
account circumstances of import, welfare, health and safety and BTV risks,
a decision on post-import testing will be taken accordingly.

[EU map on the declared BT Restriction zones has been last updated on 10
Nov 2010. Interestingly, Cyprus and several Aegean Greek islands, close to
the Turkish coast, are restricted in relation to BTV-16, which was
identified there in 2009; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.
As already mentioned, BTV-16 was recorded also in Turkey, during May 2010
(archived 20101018.3776).

It will be interesting to obtain the results of the laboratory tests of the
samples sent recently to Pirbright from Cyprus.

Updated information on the BT situation in Turkey, as well as on the
situation during the recent BT season (July-November) in other Eastern
Mediterranean countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
