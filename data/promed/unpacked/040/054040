Wildlife experts are investigating what could be the worst ever case of
bird poisoning in Scotland.
---------------------------------------------------
The remains of 22 buzzards, a goshawk, a tawny owl, and a heron were found
in a raid earlier this week after someone spotted signs of something
suspicious.
The RSPB think this could be the most birds they have ever found in a
single raid. The bodies are being tested to see how they were killed.
An RSPB spokesman called the incident "utterly disgusting."
Police and animal welfare officers took part in the raid, which lasted 12
hours.
Police say not only birds, but other wildlife and even people could have
been in danger from the poisoning.
