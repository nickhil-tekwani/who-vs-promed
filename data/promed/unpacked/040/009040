Egypt's health ministry has said 3 people have died in the past week after contracting the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Egypt has now confirmed 11 cases of the virus in people this year [2014], including 6 who have died. The most recent victims were a 40-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman from the central province of Minya, and a 25-year-old woman in nearby Beni Suef. A 2-year-old girl who had the virus was meanwhile said to have recovered.

H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds. Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 percent. Between 2003 and October 2014 there were 668 confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in 15 countries, leading to 393 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Egypt has reported 177 of the confirmed cases and 63 of the deaths. The al-Ahram newspaper reported that emergency procedures were put in place at hospitals in November [2014] after 2 deaths in the same week -- a 30-year-old woman in Minya and a 19-year-old woman in Assiut.

A Health Ministry statement said on [Mon 1 Dec 2014], 3 Egyptian women have died of H5N1 bird flu after coming into contact with infected birds. A 29-year-old woman from Minya province, south of Cairo, died on [Mon 1 Dec 2014] after suffering breathing difficulties and pneumonia, the statement said. 2 other women, aged 25 and 40, died in the Upper Egyptian province of Assiut. One of them worked in a bird farm. [This information is erroneous -- according to the report on the MOPH website, there have been 4 recent cases - a 2 year old girl in Minya who recovered, a 40 year old male in Minya who died, a 29 year old woman in Minya who died, and a 25 year old woman in Beni Suef who died. (see http://www.mohp.gov.eg/News_webpart/dispNews3.aspx?ID=580). - Mod.MPP]

The Health Ministry has confirmed a total of 11 cases this year [2014], including 6 deaths.

The statement urged people in direct contact with birds to go to the nearest hospital when feeling flu symptoms. It added there are stocks of the antiviral drug Tamiflu at hospitals across the country. Egypt's H5N1 infections usually take place in rural areas in the south of the country, where villagers, mostly women, breed and slaughter poultry in their homes.

On its website, the Ministry said the bird flu infection rate has dropped since 2012. Egypt reported 180 cases of bird flu in 2006-2012, of whom 66 died.

According to the WHO the overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses is the following: Whenever influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible, especially in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infections remain rare and these influenza A(H5N1) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains low.

An epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset is available at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_October14.pdf?ua=1. This reveals an overall decline in case numbers, Egypt excepted. - Mod.CP]
