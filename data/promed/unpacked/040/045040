The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 25 Oct [2016] [to] the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture 4 additional West Nile virus (WNV) cases in horses in that state.

The EDCC report said the following equids tested positive for the virus:
- An unvaccinated 8-year-old pony gelding located in Choctaw County showed severe neurologic signs, including leg paralysis, and was euthanized.
- An unvaccinated yearling Quarter Horse filly from Payne County was showed moderate neurologic signs, including hind-limb ataxia.
- An unvaccinated 16-year-old Quarter Horse gelding in Beckham County showed mild neurologic signs and is recovering.
- A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding located in Atoka County [that] showed severe neurologic signs, including hind-limb paralysis, and was euthanized. That horse's vaccination history is unknown.

The new cases bring Oklahoma's case total to 9 for the year [2016].

West Nile Virus is transmitted to horses and other equids via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[In many areas, equine vaccination rates seem to trend with the larger economy, as well as human vaccination trends, meaning once effective vaccination rates are achieved for an emerging disease such as WNV, they inevitably seem to decline over time due to the aforementioned issues. WNV vaccination also suffers the fate of many other vaccines that worked too well in that once the initial fear of the disease subsided after the introduction of the vaccine, many equine owners elected to skip annual vaccinations. - Mod.JH]
