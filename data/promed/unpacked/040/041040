[Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe have reported AHS almost every
year since 1996. Nearby areas including Mozambique (1995) and Zambia
(1991) have reported previously but not recently. Other countries in
Africa consistently battling AHS include Ethiopia, Eritrea -- located
in the Horn of Africa -- and Burkino Faso in West Africa. - Mod.PC]
