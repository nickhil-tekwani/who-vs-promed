Los Angeles [L.A.] county public health officials are warning residents of an outbreak of typhus while they investigate exactly where in downtown L.A. people are getting infected. There are now 57 cases detected, 9 associated with an outbreak in downtown L.A.

"Public Health is gathering additional information to determine the specific locations in downtown L.A. where the cases may have been," the County Public Health Department told L.A. Taco. "All of the cases associated with the outbreak have a history of living or working in downtown L.A. Some persons were experiencing homelessness; others were not."

People get sick when the infected flea feces are rubbed into cuts and scrapes in the skin. Animals such as rats, feral cats, and opossums can carry the bacteria and the infected fleas without becoming ill.

Pasadena reported "epidemic levels of typhus" on Friday [5 Oct 2018]. The city, which says it usually expects 1-5 cases of typhus per year, has 20 cases reported so far.

"Although typhus normally occurs throughout L.A. County, we are observing several cases in the downtown Los Angeles area," said Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County Health Officer in a press release published on Friday [5 Oct 2018]. "We encourage pet owners to practice safe flea control and encourage all cities in the county to ensure maintenance of their trash clean-up and rodent control activities."

L.A. County Public Health is recommending that people avoid direct contact with rats, possums, and feral cats. Pets, such as dogs and cats, that are allowed to spend time outdoors should be protected from fleas with veterinarian-approved animal flea control products, such as flea collars or spot-ons, to prevent them from coming into contact infected fleas, which they could then bring inside the home.

[Los Angeles County, California, is the most populous county in the United States, with more than 10 million residents as of 2017, and is the 3rd-largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a nominal GDP of over USD 700 billion, larger than the GDPs of Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Norway and Taiwan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). Its county seat is the city of Los Angeles (population almost 4 million); other cities include Long Beach (population almost 0.5 million) and Pasadena (population almost 150 000 residents) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). A map of Los Angeles County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Los+Angeles+County,+CA.

Prior ProMED-mail posts reported on outbreaks of murine typhus in the downtown area of the city of Los Angeles (9 cases), in Pasadena (20 cases), and Long Beach (12 cases) this year (2018, see "See Alsos" below). The above news report adds 16 more cases but does not give the location in Los Angeles County where these additional cases are occurring. Although 6 of the 9 cases of murine typhus in downtown Los Angeles were said to be homeless, we have not been told which segments of the population are affected by murine typhus in the rest of Los Angeles County.

More information from knowledgeable sources on the epidemiology of this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
