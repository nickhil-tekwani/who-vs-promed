The Ministry of Health (MoH) received confirmed laboratory report from the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) of 2 cases of monkeypox from Maryland and Rivercess Counties in November [2017]. The confirmatory tests were conducted by the Center for Disease, Prevention and Control (CDC), Atlanta, USA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in mid-2017, no death was reported.

Since January 2018, Liberia has recorded one suspected case and awaits result from CDC; no confirmed and no deaths.

The last Monkeypox confirmed case in Liberia was recorded in 1970 from Grand Gedeh County.

Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms in humans similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although less severe. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980. However, monkeypox still occurs sporadically in some parts of Africa.

Monkeypox was first isolated in human in 1970 in DRC [DR Congo]. Since 1970, it has also been observed in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivore including Liberia.

Though there are currently no reported cases of monkeypox, the MoH and the NPHIL have initiated enhanced surveillance and health promotion.

[It is not clear why Liberia's chief medical officer announced that there were 4 cases of monkeypox (MPX) in the country, when there have been 2 and those occurred in 2017 (see ProMED-mail post Monkeypox - Africa (07): Liberia 20180411.5740756). There have been 4 MPX cases in Liberia in Grand Gettah in 1970 and 2 cases in Rivercess and Maryland counties in 2017. There have been MPX cases this year (2018) in Nigeria and the Central African Republic.

The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occasional occurrence of cases can be expected.
