Chikungunya has spread to Ganjam from Puri and Nayagarh districts since
January [2007], said Dr Umashankar Misra, assistant professor of medicine
at MKCG Medical [College in Berhampur, Orissa] on Sunday [25 Feb 2007].
Dr Misra has treated over 300 patients with symptoms of chikungunya in the
past one and a half months [January-February 2007]. The blood samples of 10
patients were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which
confirmed it as chikungunya.
Distributing copies of the report to the media, Misra said the disease had
originated in Gajapati and spread to Ganjam and other districts during last
August [2006]. By the end of December [2006] it had affected more than 30
000 people.
Misra kept a tab on the patients and the mosquito "aeds" [_Aedes aegypti_
or _Ae. albopictus_ - Mod.TY], which caused the disease. He said the
morbidity by the disease is highest as it almost crippled its victims for a
long period, but its mortality is almost [nonexistent].
He said the mosquito stays in houses and bites between 0500 and 0800, and
1700 and 2000. Its victims are mostly from poor and middle class families.

[The chikungunya epidemic continues unabated in India, and seems unlikely
to end anytime soon. Fortunately, case fatality continues to be very low.
This area is in Orissa State, India, and a map can be accessed at:
