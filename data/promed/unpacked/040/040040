FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, GAZELLE - MONGOLIA (02)

During a short visit to Mongolia in July 1998, I was happy to be able to
watch 2 species of gazelles present in the country, the zeren or white-tailed
gazelle (_Procapra gutturosa_) and the black-tailed gazelle (_Gazella
subgutturosa_), as well as the Saiga or burhom (_Saiga tatarica_). I was
very surprised by their shyness, all flying away from a car even at a
distance of at least one kilometer.
In this situation it would be interesting to know which species is involved
and what this means. All species have different ecologies, distributions,
and, as far as I am aware, gazelles are known to be sensitive to FMD rather
than playing the role of reservoir.
