-----------------------------------
Abstract
A 53 year old woman with hypertension and raised cholesterol presented to Hospital Federal dos Servidores do Estado (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) on 9 May 2019, with a 2 week history of arthralgia and paresthesia in both hands. Three weeks earlier, she had had a 4 day episode of febrile illness with a diffuse, mildly pruritic rash, arthralgia, and joint oedema. A chikungunya infection was diagnosed by reverse transcription PCR. At the time of presentation, she had taken 500 mg naproxen and 20 mg esomeprazole for 7 days without improvement. On examination, she had oedema and symmetrical painful hypoesthesia of the hands involving the thenar eminence and the 1st 3 fingers of both hands, with normal power and tendon reflexes.
