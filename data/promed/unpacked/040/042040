Identification and host relations of Turnip ringspot virus, a novel
comovirus from Ohio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viruslike chlorotic ring spot symptoms and line patterns of unknown
origin were observed on a greenhouse-grown turnip plant. The
suspected virus was mechanically transmissible to plants in the
_Brassicaceae_. Electron microscopic analysis revealed icosahedral
particles approximately 28 nanometers in diameter. Reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses suggested
that the pathogen is a comovirus, an observation that was confirmed
by analysis of portions of the genomic sequence. This virus was
provisionally named Turnip ringspot virus (TuRSV). Based on the RNA 1
sequence, TuRSV is most similar to _Radish mosaic virus_ [genus
_Comovirus_], another pathogen that infects members of the
_Brassicaceae_.
_Arabidopsis thaliana_ [see comments below] is susceptible to TuRSV,
and 12 out of the 23 ecotypes studied showed symptoms when inoculated
with the virus. TuRSV induced a variety of responses on ecotypes from
death to no infection. Some ecotypes showed one or 2 rounds of
symptom display followed by recovery when inoculated with TuRSV.
About half of the ecotypes (11/23) analyzed showed no symptoms when
inoculated with TuRSV. Col-0 [_A. thaliana_ line from the University
of Missouri-Columbia] plants showed no symptoms, and infectious virus
was not recovered from systemic leaves, although it could be detected
by RT-PCR. Col-0 plants harboring mutations impairing the ethylene,
jasmonic acid, or salicylic acid signaling pathways did not show
symptoms when inoculated with TuRSV.

[Plant viruses belonging to the genus _Comovirus_ (type species
_Cowpea mosaic virus_) are transmitted by insects, grafting, and
mechanical inoculation. Some of them are also seed-transmitted.
_Radish mosaic virus_, to which the new TuRSV appears to be related,
is transmitted by several beetle species but not by seed, and affects
cruciferous and a few other species. The family of _Brassicaceae_
(previously _Cruciferae_) from which TuRSV is being reported includes
a number of important crop species such as cabbage, radish,
cauliflower, turnip, and oilseed rape. The fact that _A. thaliana_
strains (ecotypes) seem to vary dramatically in their response to
TuRSV infection suggests that resistant or tolerant germplasm may be
available in this host. Whether this applies also to affected
cruciferous crop species will need to be tested.
_Arabidopsis thaliana_ (thale cress or mouse-ear cress, family
_Brassicaceae_) is widely used in plant virology as an experimental
indicator species and is also used as a model species in other areas
of plant research. It is a small plant suitable for large-scale
propagation in a small space, has one of the smallest genomes in the
plant kingdom, genetic modification is easy, and homozygous lines for
research can readily be obtained.
