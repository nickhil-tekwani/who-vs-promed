Request for Information On Prevalence of Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody
------------------------------------------------------------
With regard to the case discussed in the ProMED-mail post "Hepatitis A -
USA: update: correction", although the cause of death in the Florida woman
may never be known, the case is reminiscent of a problem we have had
recently in California. This concerned the addition of hepatitis A virus
IgM antibody to a screening panel for liver disease.
We have heard of a number of cases of persons with no evidence of acute
hepatitis who have received such screening panels and have had positive
hepatitis A virus IgM antibody results. Although I have been unable to find
studies of specificity in the literature, I have been told that up to 10
percent of healthy persons will have a positive hepatitis A virus IgM
antibody test. Perhaps others can shed more light on this issue.
