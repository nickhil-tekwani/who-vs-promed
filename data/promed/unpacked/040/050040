Malaria remains far ahead of medical research in Africa, as new
drug-resistant strains kill more people every year despite efforts to
curtail it, according to a study presented at an international conference
in Durban, South Africa designed to foster the development of medical
exchanges between the northern hemisphere and Africa.
Infant mortality in children under five has at least tripled across the
continent due to the appearance of new strains of the parasite, according
to figures presented by Dakar-based researchers of the French scientific
institute Orstom. The research, carried out over a 12-year period in three
villages in Senegal, west Africa, allowed scientists to measure the
catastrophic effect of the parasite, which is carried by the _Anopheles_
mosquito, after it developed a resistance to chloroquine, the most widely
used anti-malaria drug.
"Paradoxically, the most affected areas are those which had earlier been
better protected, where mortality due to malaria had collapsed," said
programme leader Jean-Francois Trape.
The statistical study in the villages of Niakhar, in the Sahel, Mlomp in
the tropical forest, and Bandafassi, in the southern grasslands, was
corroborated by comparable data collected in other African countries.
In Mlomp, where health campaigns have made the use of chloroquine
commonplace, malaria killed 11 times more children under five in 1995 than
in 1993. But child deaths only doubled over the same period in Bandafassi,
one of the most remote regions in Senegal, where 8,000 inhabitants rely on
only one dispensary and where chloroquine's penetration is weakest.
The research is the first of its kind to quantify the consequences of
malaria's evolution since the appearance of the first resistant strain, in
Kenya in 1979. The resistance is spreading fast, and science is running out
of time. "Nowadays you have resistance all over the continent. We need to
find urgent solutions," said Kenyan researcher Kevin Marsh.
But researchers believe chloroquine's availability as a cheap counter to
malaria may in the meantime simply be playing into the parasite's hands.
"The worst thing is that chloroquine is cheap, useful and available, then
the next drug is more expensive," said Nigerian professor Ayoade Oduola.
Several studies have shown that the malaria has also developed a resistance
to other available medication such as quinine and amodiaquine, among
others. But more than just turning to substitute treatments, researchers
are studying a combination of different treatments, including genetics, to
block the process of the parasite's mutation.
The complementary use of a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine,
Artemisine, is one promising development, according to Trape.
Meanwhile, as the search continues, malaria is killing more than one
million Africans every year -- in the process costing an estimated two
billion dollars in 1997, according to the Multilateral Initiative on
Malaria (MIM).
