BACKGROUND
Despite the introduction of safe, effective vaccines decades ago and joint global public health efforts to eliminate measles, this vaccine-preventable disease continues to pose threats to children's health worldwide. During 2013 and 2014, measles virus was introduced into Denmark through several independent importations. This resulted in a number of secondary cases (n = 7), with 2 clusters in 2013 and 1 in 2014. In total, there were 44 cases of measles. Most cases (n = 41) were laboratory confirmed by detection of measles virus genome by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and IgM antibodies. The viruses from confirmed cases were genotyped by sequencing. Only 1 genotype circulated each year, i.e., D8 and B3, respectively. Sequencing of measles virus from different clinical specimens from the same patients revealed that sequence variants of measles viruses might co-exist and co-transmit during an outbreak. The majority of the cases were unvaccinated (n = 27) or recipients of 1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (n = 7). In addition, 2 fully vaccinated adult cases were reported in 2014. We demonstrate the transmission of measles virus in a population in which the 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage rate was 80 percent and how even vaccinated individuals may be at risk of contracting measles once transmission has been established.

INTRODUCTION
Measles is caused by a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the _Morbillivirus _ genus. The wild-type measles virus consists of 24 genotypes that are grouped into 8 clades. Measles is 1 of the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide: about 145 700 people died from measles in 2013, most of them children under the age of 5 years .

The 1st measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination programme was implemented in the 1960s in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set the goal of eliminating measles in Europe by 2015 and globally by 2020. In 2013, the WHO Regional Office for Europe produced a supplement for accelerated action during 2013 to 2015 [5]. In this supplement, WHO identified a number of acceleration strategies to achieve this goal by the end of 2015: (i) immunisation system strengthening; (ii) establishing and improving case-based surveillance; (iii) improving laboratory and epidemiological data integration; and (iv) improving outbreak response. These strategies have been adapted and are some of the key elements in the Danish national disease elimination efforts.

In Denmark, measles is a notifiable disease, and national measles surveillance is conducted through close collaboration between the WHO National Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella at the Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, SSI, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, general practitioners (GPs), hospital clinicians, regional hospital microbiology laboratories and public health medical officers. The public health medical officers perform contact tracing and give advice to hospitals and GPs on post-exposure prophylactic therapeutics.

In Denmark, the 1st dose of MMR vaccine has been given at the age of 15 months since its introduction in 1987. In 2008, the Danish Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) schedule was changed and the timing of the 2nd MMR vaccine dose adjusted from 12 years to 4 years of age. The rationale for the change was to increase herd immunity by increasing the immunity of children aged under 12 years [6].

Since 1996, MMR vaccination status in Denmark has been recorded in a national vaccination database, in which data are automatically entered when GPs use specific codes for reimbursement for performing the vaccinations. Since the introduction of this database, MMR vaccination coverage in Denmark has been estimated to be 88-90 percent for the 1st dose and 83-88 percent for the 2nd [7]. That is until 2013, when coverage decreased to 87 percent for the 1st dose and 80 percent for the 2nd, underlining the challenge facing the Danish EPI programme when trying to meet the goal of 95 percent coverage, as recommended by WHO [8]. However, a study in which parents of children not registered in the national database were interviewed about the vaccination status of their children documented under-reporting of coverage in the database, to the magnitude of 3-4 percentage points [7]. Given this, and the fact that the vaccination of some of children will be delayed [7], coverage may be higher in reality.

The advantage of molecular characterisation of measles virus followed by phylogenetic analysis during outbreaks has been demonstrated previously [9,10]. In our current study, we combine phylogenetic analyses of viruses from confirmed measles cases in Denmark during 2013 and 2014 with classical epidemiological investigations in order to investigate the consequences of imported cases of measles and the associated potential public health challenges in the attempt to keep a nation free of endemic transmission of measles virus.

DISCUSSION
In 2012, there were 2 measles cases reported in Denmark [16], whereas in 2013 and 2014, 17 and 27 measles cases were notified, respectively. In each of these 2 years, only a single genotype was detected: D8 and B3, respectively, which corresponds well with the genotypes dominating in Europe during these years [17,18].

The pattern of spread of measles in Denmark was very similar in the 2 years described here. In both years, a single case resulted in a large cluster. In 2013, an additional small cluster of 4 cases was observed in a day-care centre, and even though no epidemiological link could be established to the large cluster, the geographical and timely coincidence between the 2 clusters indicates that they could be a result of the same importation. If this is true, all cases in 2013 arose from just 4 importations, of which 3 were without secondary cases. Our study demonstrates that the importation of measles virus only sometimes leads to a cluster, most likely if the virus is imported by children of pre-vaccination age.

The period in which new measles cases were detected was more prolonged in 2014 and included 10 more cases than in 2013. This may be a result of the slightly different importation pattern observed during 2014, where at least 8 independent importations were detected. Of these, 1 resulted in the large cluster of 8 cases and 5 cases resulted in 1 or 2 secondary cases (Table).

The 2014 cluster shares many similarities with earlier reported outbreaks in Denmark during 2008 and 2009, which were believed to have started in GPs' waiting rooms [19,20]. This emphasises the need to rethink how to assemble potentially contagious people waiting to be examined and their relatives in small rooms -- not only in hospital settings but throughout the entire healthcare system. In Denmark, there is pre-screening before patients are referred to the hospital emergency room, either by the GP or by telephone interview by specially trained nurses outside of GP opening hours. If patients with symptoms of contagious diseases are referred to an isolation waiting room at this stage, situations like that in 2014 may be prevented. Another lesson to be learned from the 2014 outbreak is that when trying to reach traced contacts who may have been exposed to the pathogen (e.g., measles virus in this instance), using postal mail services may not be the most appropriate approach. In this digitalised era, other methods, such as a bulk text message, could have been considered, since most people own and carry a mobile phone and text messages are independent of people being able to answer the phone at a specific time.

The phylogenetic analysis in our study showed that despite the fact that multiple importations occurred from different countries, the measles viruses detected were very closely related. This may be a result of very low mutation rates found in the genome of measles virus [21]. An interesting finding was that in 2014, measles virus sequences obtained from different specimens collected from the same patient showed conserved sequence differences in several cases. Of the 7 cases infected with virus containing the mutation, 5 (2014-01 to 2014-04 and 2014-16) were epidemiologically connected to the large cluster (Figure 2), which supports the theory of simultaneous transfer of the 2 variants. This strongly indicates that different measles variants can co-exist and co-transfer simultaneously. How widespread this phenomenon is, is unknown since the MeaNS database only allows the uploading of 1 sequence per sample and does not allow the submission of ambiguous sequences. Furthermore, the result of Sanger sequencing is a consensus sequence: thus minority variants below the level of detection by Sanger sequencing (commonly estimated to be around 20 percent) are not reported. This finding could have important implications for the use of molecular data in cluster definitions. Cases might be discarded as not being epidemiologically linked if sequencing was only performed on 1 specimen. Deep sequencing using next-generation sequencing technology could be used to further elucidate the prevalence of co-existing sequence variants, and to epidemiologically link the transmission of such variants.
