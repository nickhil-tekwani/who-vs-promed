CFIA PLUM POX VIRUS SURVEY UPDATE
-----------------------------------
On June 23, 2000, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed the
presence of Plum Pox Virus (PPV) in an orchard in Niagara-on-the-Lake,
Ontario. PPV was discovered in 3 Fantasia nectarine trees at 2 sites.
Laboratory testing by the CFIA's Centre for Plant Health in Sidney, B.C.
confirmed the virus was PPV strain-D, the same as that found in Prunus
trees in Pennsylvania in October 1999.
As of 21 Jul 2000, the CFIA had sampled for PPV from areas immediately
around 2 initial positive sites in Niagara-on-the-Lake, and at a third
positive site in St. Catharines. In the past 2 weeks, CFIA sampling teams
have continued to survey PPV-susceptible trees in the Niagara Peninsula,
and as of 9 Aug 2000, had collected a total of 22 885 samples.
Of these, additional positive samples have been confirmed at the 3 original
sites. Positive samples have also been confirmed at 11 new locations: 9 in
Niagara-on-the-Lake and 2 in St. Catharines, bringing the total number of
positive samples to 423 (out of 17 647 tested), at 14 locations. Sampling
continues around the positive sites and at other orchards across the
Niagara Peninsula.
Along with the CFIA Centre for Plant Health in Sidney, B.C., samples are
also being sent for testing to the CFIA Centre for Plant Quarantine Pests
in Nepean, Ontario. A third laboratory in Charlottetown, P.E.I. should be
accepting samples within a few weeks.
A detection survey is currently being planned to allow for sampling across
the entire production area in order to determine the overall spread of the
virus in Ontario. A broader survey will also take place in other regions of
Canada, including B.C. and N.S., at the onset of cooler temperatures in
late summer.
As of Wednesday, 9 Aug 2000, the following data are known:
Total PPV - susceptible Prunus samples collected - 22 885
Total PPV - susceptible Prunus samples tested* - 17 647
Total PPV- positive locations (14)
- Niagara-on-the-Lake, 11
- St. Catharines, 3
Total PPV - positive samples - 423
Total PPV - negative samples - 17 224
*Sample testing always lags behind sample collection due to sample delivery
and laboratory test processing.

[A previous posting indicated that 3 CFIA testing centres were set up, but
it appears that only 2 are operating at the moment. The identity of the PPV
strain as a D strain is useful information. D-strain isolates are less
aggressive than other PPV strains, and they are not seed-transmitted. -Mod.DH
