The Foothills Animal Shelter has received a positive test result for bird flu, or avian influenza. That means the shelter is not able to accept any birds for at least 14 days from Friday [20 May 2022].

The confirmation comes from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory after the sudden death of 2 stray ducklings at the shelter. Foothills will not accept any birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, or exotic birds, for at least 14 days.

"As a Socially Conscious Shelter, Foothills is committed to protecting the people and animals in our community and will continue to follow the guidance of the Colorado State Veterinarian and the Colorado Department of Agriculture following this positive test result," said Foothills Animal Shelter Lead Veterinarian Dr. Claire Vaiden in a statement. "We are saddened by the outcome of this test and appreciate the support of our community during this challenging time."

According to the Colorado Department of Agriculture, this type of avian flu has a mortality rate of 90%-100% within just a few days. Foothills performed "humane euthanasia" on the remaining birds in its care that were exposed to the highly contagious and fatal virus. This included 3 ducks, a chicken, and one pigeon.

"Avian influenza has a high mortality rate and flock owners should actively monitor their birds for clinical signs of HPAI, such as ruffled feathers or swelling and purple discoloration of the comb, wattles, eyelids and legs," said Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin. "Anyone who notices any signs of illness or disease in their flocks should immediately notify the State Veterinarian's office at 303-869-9130."

An avian flu outbreak has been detected in Mesa County in wild great horned owls. What is referred to as bird flu was first detected here on 19 May 2022, according to a news release from Mesa County Public Health. The health risk to humans is low; however, some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection, the release said.

Wild birds can be infected with bird flu and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domestic poultry to the virus. The risk to domestic poultry is high, so monitoring the disease is critical to flocks, the release said.

In April [2022], an avian flu outbreak in Montrose County prompted a 60 000-bird flock at a commercial poultry operation to be euthanized. A quarantine order was issued at that time for parts of Montrose and Delta counties to limit movement of poultry and poultry products and try to prevent the disease's spread.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture is currently working with producers to protect flocks. People are encouraged to minimize contact with wild birds or sick or dead poultry, and to wear gloves and wash hands with soap and water after touching birds. Wearing respiratory protection, such as a medical facemask, is also recommended when in close contact with birds. Hunters should wear gloves when dressing game birds and wash their hands with soap and water after.

The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed in a flock of 57 000 commercial turkeys in Dakota County, Minnesota. The case was confirmed on 21 May 2022, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported.

This marks the 1st HPAI case in Dakota County in 2022, and the 59th overall in commercial poultry in Minnesota. Other Minnesota counties with confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry so far in 2022 include Meeker, Stearns, Lac Qui Parle, Morrison, Becker, Dodge Le Sueur, Big Stone, Waseca, Otter Tail, Renville, Swift, Yellow Medicine, Blue Earth and Lyon.

All but 2 of the commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI this year [2022] were operated by turkey producers except for 2 of the Morrison County flocks. One of those involved a flock of 42 905 commercial broilers, while the other was a commercial table egg layer flock, which included 216 236 chickens. Morrison County has had more HPAI cases than any other county in the state, with 10 cases in commercial flocks and one in a backyard flock.

Two more Minnesota poultry operations have been added to the list of those hit by bird flu this spring [2022].

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says this week a small backyard poultry flock in Clay County tested positive for H5N1 high pathogenic avian influenza, as well as a flock of 4744 tom turkeys in a commercial turkey operation in Kandiyohi County. It was Clay County's 1st flock in the current outbreak and Kandiyohi County's 9th.

More than 2.95 million birds have been impacted at 77 sites in 24 Minnesota counties. In 2015, more than 9 million birds had to be destroyed during the last H5N1 outbreak in the state.

A highly contagious bird flu has been detected by the Bayfield County Health Department in a backyard flock.

Birds can become infected and show no symptoms, so officials are encouraging those to keep domestic poultry away from wild birds. Some safety precautions they are recommending are to move domestic flocks indoors if possible, fence or contain outdoor flocks so they don't have contact with wild birds, move feed and water sources to a protected area, and wash hands thoroughly after cleaning, feeding, or caring for your domestic poultry.

Symptoms of this avian flu in domestic birds include sudden death without clinical signs, lack of energy and appetite or incoordination, decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs and nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing or diarrhea. If you find dead birds or wildlife, avoid handling them with bare hands.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture and Consumer Trade Protection (DACTP) has detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in 13 Wisconsin counties. They're asking the public to report sick birds to the DATCP at 608-224-4872 (during business hours) or 800-943-0003 (after hours and weekends).

[The more birds submitted for examination, the more outbreaks of avian influenza will be discovered. And as this virus is highly contagious, we will see clustering, quite apart from those cases following bird migration. - Mod.MHJ
