An outbreak of the equine herpes virus on the backstretch at Pimlico Race
Course has appeared in a previously uninfected part of the stabling area,
leading Maryland state veterinarian Guy Hohenhaus to say yesterday that if
one more case develops he will probably shut down the track.

A horse in Barn A, trained by Joseph Delozier , was discovered in its stall
yesterday showing signs of severe neurological distress. 11 horses on the
Pimlico grounds have fallen ill this month and 2 have been euthanized. The
horse trained by Delozier is stabled far from Barns 5 and 6, where the
other cases have occurred, causing Hohenhaus great concern.

"Did it spread from the numbered side to Barn A? I can't tell you if it
has," Hohenhaus said. "We probably will not have that answer, but I'm more
really interested in where it might go. We are looking to make sure no
horses from any of the barns, particularly from Barn A, were in contact
with other horses. We are tracking where the horses have been in the past
week. If a few more days pass and we have no more linked we may have passed
the probable time that that could have happened."

Barn A, like Barns 5 and 6, was placed yesterday under an "investigational
animal hold order," which bars its horses from mixing with the larger
Pimlico population. Of the approximately 500 horses on the grounds, 109 are
stabled in barns under isolation.

The outbreak of the virus at Pimlico has begun to affect the racing at
Laurel Park. Tracks outside of Maryland have placed severe restrictions on
horses shipping in and out of the state, and Maryland Jockey Club racing
secretary Georganne Hale said about 30 per cent of her regular entries ship
in from out of town.

The average number of horses per race has dropped from 8.5-9 in December to
7.67 this month.

[Pimlico Race track is where the Preakness, the 2nd leg of thoroughbred's
famed Triple Crown Race is run. The racing season and countdown to those 3
races has already begun. Closing the track may have an impact on the
preparation of some horses.

Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral disease
(EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe respiratory
infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease, or abortion in
pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The immunity inferred from the
disease or the vaccine are relatively short. Horses on the show or racing
circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months. - Mod.TG]
