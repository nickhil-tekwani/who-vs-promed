From:

I would like to comment on Kevin Johnson's article concerning food
irradiation. Most of his comments are right on target and accurate.
However, I take exception to his comment "The only impediment to
starting full scale irradiation of food stuffs is public opinion".
This is only partially true in my opinion. Another "impediment" is
the cost factor involved in setting up an ionizing radiation plant
and the inability at this point to compete with the cost of
non-irradiated food products, that is, consumers will buy the cheaper
product not considering the benefits of increased safety, increased
shelf life, etc. In reality, the consumer would probably not even
know which product had been irradiated and he/she would also not know
the benefits of the irradiated vs the non-irradiated product.
Therefore, to "sell" irradiated foods, we must do a better job of
educating the public, which might then demand this type of food.
Thus, the industry would develop the process because the driving force
in the American economy, "making a buck" could be realized.
The simple facts that irradiated food is safer, has a longer shelf
life and is quite safe to consume are not enough to convince the
producer to spend millions of dollars to build the necessary
equipment to do the job if his return on his investment is marginal.
