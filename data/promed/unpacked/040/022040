Officials from the Florida Department of Public Health (FDPH) are recommending vulnerable populations to get vaccinated against meningitis, as 3 new cases of the potentially deadly disease have arisen among young adults aged 18-22 in Tallahassee, Florida.

With 27 cases of meningitis in Florida in 2021 and 21 cases in 2022, according to the Florida Health Department, the spread of meningitis may not seem like a severe threat. However, once contracted, meningitis can induce inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, causing confusion, nausea, neck stiffness and severe headaches. Infants and young adults, particularly college students, are at a high risk of contracting the condition, particularly if they live with a friend or loved one with HIV.

"That rings alarm bells with epidemiology and they want to start making sure that it's known that there's a vaccine available for this," said Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for the FDPH, in a press release. As teens and young adults have an increased risk of meningitis, UM [University of Miami] students weigh in on how they feel the university could prevent the infection from reaching campus.

While the UM Public Health Department did release a post on their Instagram page, no follow-up communication was sent to students, a divergence from what has traditionally been done with COVID-19 updates. [AZ], a sophomore biochemistry major and student researcher, said [...] "I think vaccine incentives like getting the chance to win dining dollars and other prizes worked really well for COVID-19. Something like that for meningitis, especially since there's not a lot of people who haven't received the vaccine yet, could help prevent what happened in Tallahassee from happening at UM," [AZ] continued.

Based on the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] (CDC) guidelines, vaccination is recommended for children as young as 2 months, especially if they are traveling to specific countries where meningococcal disease is more prevalent, as well as for preteens between 11 and 12, with a follow-up booster dose being given at age 16.

While currently unknown, Redfern also noted that some of the meningitis cases have resulted in death. While uncommon, some of those who contract meningitis die in as little as a few hours after contracting the infection, according to the CDC.

Redfern added Florida epidemiologists are actively investigating cases and trying to identify which ones might be related. But, he said, "a for sure cause" for the outbreak is not known.

On 1 Apr 2022, the Florida Department of Health in Leon County (DOH Leon) issued a press release regarding the investigation of 3 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease in individuals in Tallahassee ages 18-22. DOH Leon confirmed that these 3 cases have been identified as having serogroup B meningococcal disease. Additionally, the cases are among college and university students.

DOH Leon's epidemiology team continues to contact people with potential or direct exposure to known cases and provide them with information and treatment options.

Most individuals vaccinated against meningococcal disease have received the MenACWY vaccine, which does not protect against serogroup B meningococcal disease. The following groups should consider vaccination with the MenB vaccine due to the recent serogroup B meningococcal disease cluster in Leon County:
- College and university undergraduate students
- Students living in on-campus housing
- Those who participate in a fraternity or sorority

Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease. Find meningococcal vaccines by contacting a healthcare provider, county health department, or pharmacy. DOH Leon offers meningococcal vaccines at its Roberts & Stevens (R&S) Clinic located at 1515 Old Bainbridge Road in Tallahassee. To schedule an appointment, individuals can call 850-404-6403.

Early symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, confusion, and rash. This is a rare but potentially devastating disease, and anyone who has been exposed or develops symptoms should see a healthcare provider immediately.

Meningococcal disease in Florida, 2022
--------------------------------------
In response to an ongoing outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal disease in Florida, CDC is encouraging gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men [MSM] to:
- Get a MenACWY vaccine if they live in Florida (1)
- Talk with their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine if they are traveling to Florida

In addition, CDC is highlighting that MenACWY vaccination is routinely recommended for all people with HIV in the United States (2).

In response to a cluster of serogroup B meningococcal disease cases in Florida, officials are recommending the following groups of college and university students in Leon County, FL, consider getting a MenB vaccine series (3):
- College and university undergraduate students
- Students living in on-campus housing
- Those who participate in a fraternity or sorority

The 2 most common types of meningococcal infections are meningitis (an infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and bloodstream infection, both of which can quickly become deadly. Three serogroups of meningococcal bacteria cause most meningococcal disease in the United States: B, C, and Y (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/causes-transmission.html).

If you have symptoms of meningococcal disease, seek medical care right away. Symptoms of meningococcal disease can first appear as a flu-like illness and rapidly worsen (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/causes-transmission.html).

Serogroup C outbreak among men who have sex with men
----------------------------------------------------
There is a large, ongoing outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal disease in Florida, primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, including those living with HIV (https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/04/20220407-md-english-pr.html). This outbreak is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida.

MenACWY vaccination offers the best protection: In response to the serogroup C outbreak in Florida, CDC is encouraging gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (with or without HIV) to:
- Get a MenACWY vaccine if they live in Florida
- Talk with their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine if they are traveling to Florida

Ideally, people would get vaccinated with one dose (or the 2-dose series for people with HIV) at least 2 weeks before traveling. Learn more about what gay and bisexual men need to know about meningococcal disease (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/17-275138C1-MeningococcalDis-ACWY-Outbreak-FS.pdf).

CDC is also emphasizing the importance of routine MenACWY vaccination for people with HIV. For the best protection, people with HIV should make sure they have gotten their 2-dose primary series of a MenACWY vaccine and are up to date with booster doses. Learn more about what people living with HIV need to know about meningococcal disease (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/17-275138B-MeningococcalDis-HIV-FS.pdf).

Serogroup B cluster among college and university students
---------------------------------------------------------
Leon County, FL, also reports an unrelated serogroup B meningococcal disease cluster among college and university students (https://leon.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/05/dohleon-update-meningococcal.html). This cluster has only been reported to affect people living in Florida.

Serogroup B vaccination offers the best protection: In response to the serogroup B cluster in Florida, officials are recommending the following groups of college and university students in Leon County, FL, consider getting a MenB vaccine series:
- College and university undergraduate students
- Students living in on-campus housing
- Those who participate in a fraternity or sorority

Learn more about what people need to know about serogroup B meningococcal (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/serogroup-b-factsheet.pdf).

Footnotes
---------
1. CDC routinely recommends MenACWY vaccine for children and adults at increased risk for meningococcal disease during an outbreak involving serogroups A, C, W, or Y. CDC also recommends a booster shot for those at increased risk due to an outbreak who received the vaccine more than 5 years ago.
2. CDC routinely recommends MenACWY vaccine for children and adults at increased risk for meningococcal disease, including those with HIV. People with HIV should get a 2-dose primary series of MenACWY vaccine, with the 2nd dose given at least 8 weeks after the 1st, followed by a booster dose every 5 years. If someone completed their primary series before the age of 7 years, they should get their 1st booster dose 3 years later and then get a booster dose every 5 years.
3. CDC routinely recommends MenB vaccine for people 10 years or older who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease during an outbreak involving serogroup B. CDC also recommends a booster shot for those at increased risk due to an outbreak who received the vaccine more than one year ago.

[The above reports from the Florida Department of Health and the US CDC update information on meningococcal disease in Florida so far this year (2022): There have been 2 unrelated outbreaks. One outbreak in Tallahassee, the state capital, involved 3 Florida college students and was due to meningococcus serogroup B, but we still have not been told how the cases in these 3 students were epidemiologically related to each other.

The other is a large, ongoing outbreak among men who have sex with men (MSM), some of whom are HIV-positive. This outbreak is due to meningococcus serogroup C, affecting mostly people who live in Florida, but also some tourists.

Molecular epidemiology has identified particular genotypes of meningococcus serogroup C as causing outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease among MSM in the USA, Canada, and Europe (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). We have not been told if the serogroup C isolates in the current Florida outbreak are genetically related to each other or to strains causing outbreaks among MSM elsewhere.

Also, when last posted by ProMED on 18 Apr 2022 (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (04): (FL) 2 clusters, students, MSM, RFI 20220418.8702691), there were a total of 22 cases. We are not told what the current total is. More information on meningococcal disease in Florida would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
