South Korea has confirmed a case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] at a hog farm, the country's 1st outbreak in more than 3 years, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on Thursday [24 Jul 2014]. The case comes as Asia's 4th-largest economy strives to contain a 6-month outbreak of bird flu, which has pushed pork prices to multi-year highs due to demand for alternative meat.

Testing confirmed a case of FMD at a hog farm in Uiseong county [North Gyeongsang province], more than 250 km (155 miles) south east of Seoul, said statements from the ministry and the provincial government. The ministry said the disease was unlikely to be widespread as it was one of the 3 types that the country inoculates against. The outbreak occurred in unvaccinated hogs and some 600 pigs were being slaughtered to contain the disease.

The outbreak could lead to a rise in pork and beef imports. The pork imports are already high after South Korea's worst nationwide outbreak of FMD in 2010-2011 led to the culling of 1/3 of the hog population.

Many consumers have also opted for pork instead of chicken due to the bird flu outbreak, pushing up pork prices. 3-year-high pork prices have led to forecasts of increased beef imports as consumers look for alternative meats, according to government data and industry sources. South Korea imported nearly 170 000 tonnes of pork -- mainly from the United States, Germany and Canada -- in the 1st 6 months of this year, up 7 per cent year-on-year, according to customs data.

The country's beef imports -- mainly from Australia and the United States -- also rose 8.5 per cent to over 138 000 tonnes in the 1st half of this year [2014] from a year earlier, the data showed. Its beef and pork exports are almost none.

[According to a new notification to the OIE, this case is caused by FMDV serotype O, which is included in the trivalent vaccine applied in South Korea. According to South Korea's most recent available periodic report to the OIE (January-June 2013), the vaccination covers cattle, sheep, goats, and swine. In case the vaccine strain applied is compatible with the field strain, there is good chance that the disease will not spread. Following the major 2010/11 epizootic, South Korea has developed an exhaustive FMD prevention policy, which includes intensified surveillance and mass annual vaccinations.

In January 2014, North Korea suffered outbreaks of FMD in pigs, caused by FMDV serotype O; subsequent to receiving (belated) information, South Korea undertook quarantine preventive measures; see ProMED-mail post 20140220.2289582. - Mod.AS
