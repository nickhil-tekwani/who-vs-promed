[2] countries [China and Ghana] reported fresh avian influenza outbreaks today from 4 different strains, 3 of them highly pathogenic, according to separate reports to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

China's agriculture ministry today reported 2 outbreaks involving 2 different high-path strains: H5N6 at a commercial farm in Guangdong province and H5N2 on a farm in Jiangsu province.

The H5N6 outbreak started on 6 Aug 2015 and killed 1350 of 2170 susceptible birds. The remaining birds were culled to curb the spread of the virus.

The H5N2 outbreak struck a commercial goose farm in Jiangsu province. The event began on 3 Aug 2015, and the disease killed 3106 of 53 358 vulnerable geese. Authorities destroyed the rest as part of their control measures.

Ghana reported the other high-path outbreaks, which all involved H5N1. The virus recently reemerged in the country after a several-year hiatus. The newest Ghanian outbreaks are all reported from Greater Accra region, with start dates in late July and early August 2015. Sites included a live bird market, a commercial farm, and backyard birds. In total, the virus wiped out 1178 birds, with authorities culling the rest to contain the spread.
