[See table at URL above with cases in each health zone.

This is very hopeful news and may signify the end of this latest Ebola outbreak in the DRC. But hope is tempered with caution, since there have been community cases, which increase the probability of spread, and the region is remote, making cases more difficult to detect. The news is nonetheless wonderful, and the country is on its way to declaring this outbreak over. - Mod.LK
