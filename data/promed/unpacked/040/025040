The Bady Bassitt Secretariat of Health, in the interior of Sao Paulo state, this Wed 4 [May 2016] confirmed the death of a 38-year-old man. The victim was hospitalized for the past 2 weeks in the Sao Jose of Rio Preto Base Hospital. It is suspected that the disease is sylvatic [forest transmission cycle], since in Brazil there have been no urban yellow fever cases since the decade of the 1940s.

In urban areas, yellow fever [virus] is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that [also] transmits dengue, Zika and chikungunya [viruses]. Because the victim frequented rural areas, he could have acquired the sylvatic form of the disease, transmitted by the _Haemagogus_ mosquito that inhabits the forest.

The state Secretariat of Health sent agents to the region to go to rural areas in order to identify the vector. According to the Bady Bassit administration, family members indicated that he went fishing frequently in rural neighborhoods, among them Mata dos Macacos, a very remote area.

The patient was hospitalized on 26 Mar [2016] with dengue symptoms, which are similar to those of yellow fever. Despite his treatment, he did not recover and died 12 days later, but the results of tests confirming the disease [yellow fever] did not come out until this week.

New tests were requested to leave no doubt about the cause of death. According to the Health Coordinator of Bady Bassit, Elizabeth Mendes, the city is on alert. The last yellow fever case in the region was registered in 2008.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in Brazil in its sylvan cycle, with the risk of human infections in the forest and subsequent spill over into urban and suburban human populations, but something that has not occurred in Brazil in some 70 years. This case illustrates the importance of taking thorough travel histories -- international, national and local. The patient's frequent fishing trips to isolated forested areas might have led to inclusion of YF on the list of diagnostic rule-outs. ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing what the findings of the field investigations are and if any monkey deaths have been occurring in the areas where the patient had been fishing recently, an indication of presence of sylvan transmission.
