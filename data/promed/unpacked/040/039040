The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has declared that a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been confirmed. The case is a male resident aged 50 years. The patient has been admitted to the hospital to receive the necessary medical care in accordance with the national protocol to deal with confirmed or suspected cases of the disease. He had direct contact with camels. All the contacts of the patient are free of symptoms and will be monitored for 14 days as per the national protocols.

The MoPH, in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment, is taking all necessary preventive and precautionary measures to control the disease and prevent it from spreading.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is caused by one of the coronaviruses (MERS-CoV), but it differs from the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. Both viruses differ in terms of the source of infection, mode of transmission, and the disease severity.

The MoPH calls on all members of public, and especially people with chronic diseases or those with immunodeficiency disorders, to adhere to public hygiene measures. This includes washing the hands regularly with water and soap, using hand sanitizers, as well as avoiding close contact with camels and seeking medical advice when experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath.

[MERS-CoV infections in humans have been sporadically reported in Qatar. The most recent prior case of MERS-CoV infection (with illness) prior to this case was in February 2020 (see MERS-CoV (08): Qatar, Saudi Arabia (RI,NJ) 20200219.7004969 for details). Prior to that report, there were 3 cases reported in 2019 (1 fatal and 2 asymptomatic) and 3 cases reported in 2017. Before then, there were several cases reported with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia. In total, counting this current case, Qatar has reported 24 cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans (see https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON254).
