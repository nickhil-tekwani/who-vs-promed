BARLEY VIRUS - SWITZERLAND
==========================
Date: September 1996
From: EPPO Reporting Service <hq@eppo.fr>

A new virus disease of barley has recently been observed in
Switzerland. Unusual symptoms of a yellow disease were seen in
1991 in winter barley in three localities near Friburg, and more
recently in two other places near Burgdorf (Canton of Bern). The
disease appears in patches and differs from barley yellow dwarf
by the absence of dead or severely stunted plants and by a very
bright and homogeneous yellows on all organs of the diseased
plants. It is not yet possible to evaluate the incidence of this
disease on quality and yield of barley crops. By using electronic
microscopy, virus particles were constantly observed in samples
from symptomatic plants. Immunological and biological tests were
also carried out. The causal agent has been characterized as a
nepovirus. Until now, nepoviruses were not reported as pathogens
of Gramineae. This new virus appears to be related to arabis
mosaic nepovirus (EU Annex II/A2). Concerns about the virus
transmission by nematodes and seeds are raised, but further
studies are needed to clarify the issue. The author has proposed
to call the disease 'jaunisse de l'orge' (barley yellows).

INRA in France, we have now obtained files for the past eight months
and will post the back reports most relevant for this conference.]
