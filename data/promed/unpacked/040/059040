1st reporting of Canadian human granulocytic anaplasmosis
---------------------------------------------------------
Investigations conducted in Calgary, Alberta, Canada have identified
the 1st Canadian reported case of human granulocytic anaplasmosis
(HGA) that is thought to have been acquired locally.

An 82-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital with fever and
progressive confusion. He was initially treated as having had
community acquired pneumonia and pulmonary edema. A fully engorged
_Ixodes_ tick was identified on the patient during his 2nd day of
hospitalization.

Laboratory findings revealed leukopenia/lymphopenia, progressive
thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes and creatinine kinase.
Peripheral blood smears revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions within
granulocytes consistent with morulae. Cerebral spinal fluid showed
increased protein but no lymphocytic pleiocytosis. A whole blood PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] confirmed the presence of _Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_. With the addition of doxycycline to his treatment
regimen the patient made a full recovery. He had not traveled outside
of the city of Calgary in many years. His tick(s) were thought to
have been acquired during repeated forays into local wooded
recreational areas.

While _Ixodes_ ticks are present in many parts of Canada, HGA has not
previously been described. However, there have been multiple
occasions in which anaplasmosis has been described in animals. Most
recently 3 separate cases of canine anaplasmosis were described in
Saskatchewan dogs presenting with fever, lethargy, vomiting, and
diarrhea (Dickson, R. Animal Health Perspectives 2008; 4: 2-3,
available at
<http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=56b43ea4-4d0b-41f4-9375-c3969be9ac5a>).
Furthermore, _A. phagocytophilum_ infected _I. scapularis_ ticks have
been infrequently identified in ticks carried by migratory birds in
Eastern Canada (Ogden NH et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 74;
1780-1790, available at
<http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/full/74/6/1780>). HGA is not a
reportable illness in Canada.

Patients presenting from tick endemic regions during times of tick
activity (May-August) with fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and
increased serum transaminases should have rickettsial diseases such
as HGA included in the differential.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Parkins for submitting this case.
HGA was formerly referred to as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and
the organism was then called _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ (or _E.
equi_-like agent). In addition to the citations provided by Dr
Parkins, it should be noted that the HGA agent was isolated from a
tick in Ontario (1) and from a dog in British Columbia (2).
