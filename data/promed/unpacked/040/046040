In the UK, serotype 14 seems to be in emergence since 1996: Vet Rec 1996;
139: 423-424, and Vet Rec 1996; 139: 450-451. You can contact Dr. P.J.
Heath, Veterinary Investigations Centre, Rougham Hill, Bury St Edmunds, IP33
2RX. In their reports these people mentioned that serotype 14 seemed as
virulent as serotype 2. The prevalence of serotype 14 was higher than that
of any other serotype. In a study on 13 serotype 14 isolates, all of them
possessed the suilysin gene, considered as a virulence factor.
