Anthrax spores have been found in the City of Jukovskiy (Moscow region), in
the vicinity of the state-owned Myasishev factory.
The deadly virus [sic] had been preserved in a leopard's skin. Spores have
been identified by physicians from the sanitary epidemiological center in
Ramensk rayon during preliminary analysis of the leopard's skin before
stuffing it.
Since the skin was imported, physicians were obligated to check it. It was
preliminarily checked by customs control and was held in a factory in
Narkomvod street that makes hunters' trophies. The factory staff hid the
[presence of the infected hide]. There was no quarantine established around
the factory.
Epidemiologists from the state surveillance center conducted additional
analysis of the leopard skin. It is planned to check for virus [sic;
presumably other _B. anthracis_ in] other skins preserved in the studio as
well.

[Unfortunately this report does not give the origin of this presumably
sun-dried leopard skin taken from an already-dead animal and sold at a good
price to an unsuspecting Russian, who may have thought he was getting a
bargain. The disease is not common in African wild felidae, where it is
more often reported in lions than leopards. In big cats the lesions are
usually oro-pharyngeal -- and lethal. Infected hides are much more common
from cows and sheep, because when these animals die or are found dead, the
only part that can be harvested is the hide, with the wool or hair of
course. This is why the disease is associated with tanneries, especially
when the tannery is processing imported hides.
I have long suspected that Zheng He's trading expeditions to East Africa in
the early 15th century may have been how anthrax reached eastern China,
specifically the Sterne-Ames group of organisms, which are otherwise found
in Natal. The Chinese were fascinated by African wild animals. He even
managed to present a live young giraffe to his emperor. Logically the
Chinese merchants and traders would have purchased hides. - Mod.MHJ]
