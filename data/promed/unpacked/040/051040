Six members of a Mro ethnic family died after suffering from vomiting, suffocation, and symptoms of poisoning in Thet Htin village in Pi Chuang area of Kyauktaw township, Rakhine state.

An official from Kyauktaw Hospital said, "One of them died yesterday [27 Nov 2022] in the village. The other 5 arrived at the hospital, but all of them died today [28 Nov 2022]. The initial investigation revealed they had eaten mushrooms and corn. So our preliminary investigation has concluded they may have died from food poisoning. We will send the stomach fluid samples to Yangon for more analysis."

Those who died were DAM (68), UTKA (54), his wife DKTN (54), his offspring, MST (27), MST (23), and MKNT (13), all from Thet Htin village.

The family members bought and ate corn from a nearby village on 26 Nov 2022 and they started suffering from shortness of breath in the evening. They were taken to Kyauktaw Hospital, but MST died at around 11:00 PM while undergoing treatment at We Gyee Daunt Regional Hospital.

The remaining 5 were taken to Kyauktaw Hospital and were provided oxygen support, however DKTN, MST, and MKNT died half an hour apart, a source close to the family said.

DAM died around midnight on 27 Nov 2022 and UTKA also passed away around 6:00 am on 28 Nov 2022.

"Now the police and doctors continue their investigation. The exact cause of death is currently unknown. All the family members have passed away", the person close to the doomed family said.

[It is difficult to comment on the type of toxin possibly involved when the signs/symptoms are general.

Consumption of corn does not point us toward much. While aflatoxin can cause liver failure it is never an immediate toxin as it takes time to develop. So this is not a helpful clue.

Mushrooms can cause various signs, depending upon which mushroom was ingested. Mushroom poisoning is caused by a wide variety of gastrointestinal irritants and toxins within the mushroom. The symptoms usually appear within 20 minutes to 4 hours of ingesting the mushrooms, and include nausea, vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea, which normally pass after the irritant had been expelled. Severe cases may require hospitalization. Some mushrooms are extremely toxic and known to cause death without immediate treatment. However, in this case, we are not told which mushrooms were consumed. So while this toxin remains unknown at the moment, we cannot completely rule out mushrooms, as there are 70-80 known mushrooms whose toxicity has been studied.

Hopefully, the exact issue will be identified so others may avoid it. We extend our sympathies to any remaining family members or relatives. - Mod.TG

Rakhine State is on the western coast of Burma, bordering Chin State to the north and Magway and other regions to the east; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State.
Much of the foreign news coverage of Rakhine in recent years has concerned the plight of the minority Rohingya ethnic group, many of whom have been expelled to neighboring Bangla Desh. The unfortunate victims of the above suspected poisoning event belonged to the Mro people, one of 135 ethnic groups recognized by the Myanmar government. There are very few reports of mycotoxin poisoning in historical Burma or present-day Myanmar. For a review of alfatoxin analysis in Myanmar, see https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/myco/advpub/0/advpub_73-1-1/_pdf. Local news articles have reported cases of fatal mushroom poisoning in neighboring Chin State https://khonumthung.org/english/two-persons-killed-in-mushroom-poisoning-in-chin-state/ and Magway region https://www.mdn.gov.mm/en/mushroom-poison-claim-one-dead-minhla. -Mod.LXL
