Mozambique has confirmed more than 3100 cases of cholera since the outbreak was declared in the wake of Cyclone Idai. Six people have died from the acute diarrheal disease in the last 2 weeks after the floods left tens of thousands of people stranded in camps with few toilets and little clean water. Health workers are now battling to carry out a mass vaccination in the storm-hit city of Beira following a delivery of nearly 900 000 doses last week.

It has been described as "the most ambitious campaign ever conducted using the one-dose oral cholera vaccine strategy" by the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders. The UN specialist coordinating the relief effort, Julien Graveleau, said he was "quite optimistic" of success despite the challenges. "Of course, the numbers will be increasing, but I believe we're ready for it," he added.

Mozambique's health ministry said that more than 70 percent of the vaccines had been administered by Sunday morning [7 Apr 2019], partly thanks to megaphone-wielding promoters handing out doses in busy streets in Beira and elsewhere.

Outside one cholera treatment centre in the Beira neighbourhood of Pioneros, a woman sold bottled water while passers-by stepped carefully around fetid pools of water in the street. "It's a big problem," said Rosa Zimbane, who reported herself healthy so far, as an ambulance arrived carrying 2 women with small children.

Treatment for cholera can involve simple rehydration, but the disease can kill within hours, and more severe cases need intravenous drips. Inside the centre, more than a dozen people lay on beds with 2 buckets at the ready. One was for vomiting.

Dr Katrien Duquet, also of Doctors Without Borders, said that they had seen fewer cases of cholera than expected overall. "It never spiked to the level we thought," she said. "But people are still afraid of cholera. We are not claiming this is over."

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017, pp 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
