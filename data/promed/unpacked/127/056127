Residents of Nkururu village in Mitheru ward of Maara constituency are now calling on the government to move with speed to tame the outbreak of anthrax in the region, which they say is costing the lives of scores of people. They are hoping that the county government will send health officers on the ground to help treat anthrax disease, which is increasingly affecting people every day.

Residents say that out of the 800 people in the village, not less than 200 had visited health centers, yet all of them had come into contact with contaminated meat.

[Even if somewhat exaggerated, this report, yet to be confirmed, is indicative of a worsening situation of great concern. So far, the following villages have reported cases: Nkururu [6 Jan 2019], Nyambene [14 Dec 2018], Karugwa and Muthingiki [31 Oct 2018], which indicates that the livestock outbreaks are also widespread throughout the Meru district.

Tharaka-Nithi County is one of the 47 counties of Kenya, located in Kenya's former Eastern Province. The county has an area of 2609 square km and had a population of 365 330 as of the 2009 census. Tharaka-Nithi County is home to the Chuka, Muthambi, Mwimbi and Tharaka sections of the Ameru (Meru) community. The county consists of 3 constituencies: 60. Maara, 61. Chuka/Igambang'ombe, 62. Tharaka. In 1992, Meru District, sometimes called "Greater Meru," was broken up into 4 pieces, Meru Central, Meru North, Meru South and Tharaka, with Meru South (also known as Nithi District) combined with Tharaka into a new Tharaka-Nithi District.
