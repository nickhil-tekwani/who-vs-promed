The Department of Public Health (DPH) today [27 Aug 2010] announced
the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Massachusetts
residents. The case is a 43-year-old man from Plymouth County who has
been diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The patient
developed symptoms on 21 Aug [2010], was hospitalized on 23 Aug
[2010], and remains hospitalized. His exposure to a mosquito infected
with EEE [virus] likely occurred in the southeastern section of
Massachusetts, which has been identified as an area of elevated risk
for mosquito-borne illness. Aerial spraying has been conducted in
Plymouth County.

There were no human cases of EEE during 2009; however there were 13
cases with 6 deaths from 2004 through 2006. EEE [virus] is usually
spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito with
symptoms beginning 5-7 days later. EEE is a serious disease in all
ages and can even cause death.

"Every year, we always hope that there won't be any cases of either
of these mosquito-borne illnesses", said DPH State Epidemiologist Dr
Alfred DeMaria. "But when they occur they serve to remind us of how
important it is to take steps to protect ourselves and our families.
We always recommend that people use mosquito repellant and cover up
when outdoors, no matter where they are."

People have an important role to play in protecting themselves and
their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes.

Avoid mosquito bites
--------------------
- Be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are
peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor
activities that occur during evening or early morning.
- Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long
pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.
- apply insect repellent when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N,
N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of
lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)], or IR3535 according to
the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be
used on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in
concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon
eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years of age.

Mosquito-proof your home
------------------------
- Drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water.
Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed
by either draining or discarding items that hold water. Check rain
gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and
change water in birdbaths frequently.
- Install or repair screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having
tightly-fitting screens on all of your windows and doors.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ellen Bidlack for bringing this report to our
attention. She pointed out that actually this is the 2nd human case
of EEEV attributed to the area. The 1st person lives in RI but had
travel history to the area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100816.2836).

This is the usual season for transmission of EEE virus, which is
likely to continue until the onset of killing frosts. A commercial
vaccine is available for horses but not for humans, so prevention of
mosquito bites is the only preventive measure that individuals can take.

Plymouth County is located in south eastern Massachusetts. Maps of
