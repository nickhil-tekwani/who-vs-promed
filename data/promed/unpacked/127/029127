Japanese encephalitis toll [of fatalities] touches 114 in 69 days
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The authorities in Malkangiri district [Odisha state] are finding it difficult to arrest the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the mystery disease, which the administration is suspecting to be acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), even as droves of children are being rushed to the hospitals and wails of anguish from relatives of victims fill the district headquarters hospital every day.

Two separate expert teams have investigated the mysterious deaths, ministers, secretaries of various departments and specialist doctors have made numerous visits to the tribal-dominated district in the past few weeks but all their promises and attempts have failed in controlling the killer disease.

With 4 deaths on Wednesday [16 Nov 2016], the unofficial toll has risen to 114 in 69 days. Officials have put the JE related toll at 31 and the non-JE [AES] deaths at 67. The deceased died while undergoing treatment at the district headquarters hospital, Malkangiri.

Expressing their helplessness, a senior official of the district said, "We are fighting the disease in a mission mode. All resources at our disposal have been mobilised, experts, technicians, ambulances from outside the district have been pressed to service."

[2] New AES diagnosis

Japanese encephalitis may not have killed Odisha children: Panel
----------------------------------------------------------------
A panel constituted by the Odisha government has said that the children, who have died in the state's Malkangiri over the last 2 months, may not have succumbed to Japanese encephalitis JE. In its interim report, the panel said on Friday [18 Nov 2016] that the children may have died of encephalopathy, which is caused due to consumption of a plant, 'bana chakunda' (_Cassia occidentalis_).

The state government had formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College, earlier this month [November 2016]. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant, was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. "This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant," he said.

Around 100 children have died in Malkangiri since September [2016]. The committee also recommended further investigation into relative contributions of JE and encephalopathy along with other causes that might affect the central nervous system.

[The encephalitis situation in northeastern India has been confusing for many years. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. Recent reports from Odisha indicate that only 1/3 of the reported encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections. The remaining 2/3 have been classified as AES with no specific etiology. At last, AES is being addressed. The cause of AES has been speculative with other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, having been proposed. Possible etiologies of AES are discussed in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161111.4621162). The team investigating the outbreak has come up with a reliable diagnoses for at least 5 of the dead children as due to consumption of the seeds of _Cassia occidentalis_ (known commonly as coffee senna, negro coffee, rubbish cassia, stinking weed), with folk medicine uses of leaves and roots (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025462990500044X). One hopes that the team's investigation will continue to ascertain the role of this plant as the cause of death in other children in this 4-month outbreak, so that measures might be taken to prevent additional cases and to optimise treatment for those affected.
