Mysterious Ailment Stumps New Mexico Researchers
------------------------------------------------------------------
Symptoms from nonfatal illness resemble those of Hantavirus
By Jackie Jadrnak
Journal Staff Writer

Researchers might never have noticed the illness if they
hadn't been watching so closely for Hantavirus, first identified
here in 1993. Since Hantavirus patients can slide into the
often-fatal cardiopulmonary syndrome within a 12-hour
period, researchers have concentrated on finding ways to
distinguish Hantavirus infections in the early stages, Dr. Fred
Koster, professor of internal medicine at the University of New
Mexico, said.
One of the few signs that makes Hantavirus different from
other flu-like illnesses is a low platelet count, he said. Platelets
promote clotting of the blood.
So UNM sent word to doctors around the state that if they
had patients with flu-like symptoms and a low platelet count,
send them in.
"A lot of patients didn't have Hantavirus, but they had low
platelet counts," Koster said. About three years ago, a
half-dozen researchers got together in Gallup and looked
over some charts of those patients. Interested in finding out
what was going on, they asked doctors around the state to
do more thorough work-ups on patients who showed those
symptoms.
"It starts off with fever, chills and muscle aches," Koster
said. "Many have headaches, nausea and vomiting. Some
have belly [abdominal] pain and diarrhea, loss of appetite."
[But later]
"They're aching so bad the pain isn't really bearable. They
say that they're going to die, they feel so bad," he said. "It's
really unusual." Patients might have a fever for five or seven
days and feel so washed out afterward they stay home from
work for a couple of weeks, he said.
The disease doesn't show any respiratory symptoms, such
as coughing, so influenza is not a suspect.
After the Gallup get-together, doctors started pursuing
possible diagnoses more aggressively, checking patients'
blood samples for evidence of diseases such as plague,
tularemia, relapsing fever, spotted fever, typhus or
parvovirus.
The extra attention yielded known causes of the symptoms
in 30 patients, he said. Another 80 cases collected since
1993 were still unsolved.
Five labs around the country that work on emerging
infectious diseases joined in the quest, looking for evidence in
patients' blood for any of the major viral groups, bacteria that
can be cultured, or antibodies that develop in response to
diseases.
"We were able to account for a few more patients," Koster
said. "But still more than half are without an identified cause...
"The good news is everyone recovers. The bad news is we
can't figure out what it is."
Koster said the cases have been isolated [not passed from one family
member to another].
[A] similarity to Hantavirus is that patients tend to
work outdoors and come from rural areas, he said. And the
few Albuquerque residents who developed the symptoms
had recent visits to rural areas, he added.
"That says there's something in the rural environment. Is it
an animal, an insect?" Koster wondered. An insect carrier
would not be a surprise, since many insect-borne diseases
cause low platelet counts, he added.
Usually, the number of cases peaks in August, although the
peak showed up a little earlier this year, he said. Several
patients showed up from the Socorro and Truth or
Consequences areas in May and June, he said.
Age, gender or ethnicity doesn't appear to make any
difference, he said. The illness has shown up around the state,
with perhaps the fewest in the southeast quadrant, Koster
said. As word spread through the medical community, cases
also have been detected in Colorado, Arizona, Texas and
Utah, he added.
While the illness has similarities to Hantavirus -- at least
before Hantavirus reaches the fatal stage -- Koster said he
doesn't think it is a new variety or mutated form of that virus.
Current Hantavirus tests are general enough to detect new
forms, he said.
A few other attempts to identify the cause of the illness
have hit dead ends. Since some patients had low white cell
counts, a sign that the bone marrow is affected, a few
unsuccessful attempts were made to find infectious agents in
bone marrow instead of blood, Koster said.
A couple of years ago, Koster injected blood serum from
infected patients into mice, but none of them got sick, he said.
"Now we're into a phase where all the standard techniques
have not been productive. Where do we go next?" Koster
said.
One of the people he went to is Paul Jackson, a molecular
biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who is working
on a technique to tease out foreign DNA or RNA from a
sample. Koster compared the process to looking for a needle
in a haystack. With all the genetic instruction in a person's
blood or tissue sample, how do you find the stuff that doesn't
belong?
[H]is technique ... is based, he said, on the polymerase chain
reaction, a technique commonly used to synthesize large quantities of a
The hope is that, with samples of blood serum from 14
New Mexicans who developed the illness, fragments of the
infectious agent will separate out. If that happens, those
fragments can be compared to genetic sequences of known
viruses, he said.
"If it's unknown, you see how close you can get it to
something that's been studied before," Jackson said. "That
would make it easier to learn how to culture it."
It's hard to say if the illness is a new, emerging disease or
something that's always been around and only been noticed
now because doctors have been looking so hard, said Brian Hjelle,
associate professor of pathology at UNM and primary developer of a
test for Hantavirus.
[The severe pain, low platelet count and prolonged convalescence
remind one of dengue -- had any of these cases travelled to
dengue-infected areas? I assume LCM infection has also been excluded
