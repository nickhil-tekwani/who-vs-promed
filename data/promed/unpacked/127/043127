Tests show that bird flu viruses found in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain are similar to one that devastated poultry flocks in South Korea earlier this year [2014], the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday [19 Nov 2014; see item 2].

"They are very, very close, which reinforces the theory of a transmission through migrating birds," OIE Director General Bernard Vallat told Reuters, adding that genetic analyses had pegged similarities at 99.8 percent.

Investigations were underway to determine which wild bird species, such as ducks, geese or swans, could be responsible for carrying the disease over to Europe.

"Every bird has a different migratory path and it changes every year," Vallat said.

On Monday [17 Nov 2014] the highly contagious strain of bird flu H5N8 was confirmed on an English duck farm, the same form of the virus already discovered in Germany and the Netherlands.

Health officials had said the H5N8 virus, which has never been detected in humans, may have been brought to Europe by wild birds migrating from Asia, notably South Korea, where millions of farm birds have had to be destroyed, but a direct link had not been clearly established.

Additional tests were being done on the H5N8 strains found in China and Japan earlier this year [2014].

Questions and Answers on Highly Pathogenic H5N8 Avian influenza strain
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the source of influenza A (H5N8)?

Based on the partial sequence data of the HA gene segment, the German, the Dutch and the British viruses were identified as closely related to the Republic of Korea H5N8 viruses. Investigations are continuing to determine the source. The viruses belong to the clade 2.3.4.6.

2. Have wild birds been identified as a carrier of the influenza A (H5N8) virus?

Wild birds can normally carry avian influenza [AI] viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. To date, the infection with avian influenza viruses subtype H5N8 has been detected in wild birds in China (Ref 1), the Republic of Korea (Ref 2) and Japan (Ref 3). The majority of avian influenza viruses does not cause disease in wild birds, but is very likely that wild birds might spread the virus via their migratory flyways.

3. How is influenza A(H5N8) transmitted and spread among birds?

All AI viruses can be transmitted among birds through direct contact with secretions from infected birds, especially faeces or through contaminated feed, water, equipment, and human clothing and shoes.

They are readily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of domestic live birds, people (especially when shoes and other clothing are contaminated), and contaminated vehicles, equipment, feed, and cages. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, especially when temperatures are low.

Several factors can contribute to the spread of all AI viruses including: the movements of people and goods, marketing practices (live bird markets), farming practices and the presence of the viruses in migratory wild birds.

4. What are the reporting requirements for influenza A (H5N8)?

As detailed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, all cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) found in any domestic or wild bird must be notified to the OIE by the competent authorities (Veterinary Services) in a country.

Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 in poultry are also notifiable to the OIE because, even though they do not cause severe disease, they have the potential to mutate readily into highly pathogenic viruses or to infect other species.

5. What are the basic requirements for worldwide AI prevention and control in animals?

All countries must maintain the public and private components of Veterinary Services, which comply with OIE standards on quality, including:

- Appropriate legislation;
- Early detection and response capacities in face of biological events in animals;
- Compensation mechanism establishment and management;
- Efficient veterinary laboratories;
- Use of vaccination in relevant epidemiological situations when appropriate.

6. Can culling be used as a control measure?

If the infection is detected in animals, generally a culling policy is used in the efforts to control and eradicate the disease.

Requirements include (and are described in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code):

- humane destruction of all infected and exposed animals (according to OIE animal welfare standards);
- appropriate disposal of carcasses and all animal products;
- surveillance and tracing of potentially infected or exposed poultry;
- strict quarantine and controls on movement of poultry and any potentially contaminated vehicles and personnel;
- thorough decontamination of infected premises;
- a period at least 21 days before restocking.

Culling of infected and susceptible domestic birds has been carried out by currently affected countries with respect to highly pathogenic H5N8.

7. What are the OIE recommendations for trade in poultry from a country infected with influenza A (H5N8)?

The risk analysis to be used by importing countries in order to protect their territory from pathogens introduction is very complex and is based on a long list of OIE standards.

In the case of outbreaks of high pathogenic avian influenza of the H5 strain in potential exporting countries, the trade recommendations that apply can be found in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Chapter 10.4; 2014). These measures are science-based and should not result in unjustified trade barriers; they include zoning and the testing of the animal populations of origin.

8. What compensation measures should be applied for the concerned farmers?

Systems for financial compensation of farmers and producers who have lost their animals as a result of mandatory culling requested by national authorities vary around the world; they may not exist at all in some countries. The OIE encourages national authorities to develop and propose compensation schemes because they are a key to early detection and transparency in reporting the occurrence of animal diseases, including avian influenza.

9. What are the food safety recommendations?

Animals which have been culled as a result of control measures in response to an outbreak of avian influenza, including the A (H5N8) virus, should not enter the food and feed chain as a precautionary and regulatory measure.

There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of poultry meat or eggs could transmit the AI virus to humans.

10. What is the public health risk associated with avian influenza?

AI viruses are highly species-specific, but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. This disease should not be confused with seasonal human influenza (flu), a very common human disease (generally caused by human H1 and H3 viruses). Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.

Currently there is no evidence of human infection from influenza A(H5N8) virus.

11. What prevention measures are recommended at the farm level?

It is essential for poultry producers to maintain biosecurity practices to prevent introduction of the virus in their flock:

- keep poultry away from areas frequented by wild fowl;
- do not provide elements on property that may attract wild birds;
- keep control over access to poultry houses by people and equipment;
- maintain sanitation of property, poultry houses and equipment;
- avoid the introduction of birds of unknown disease status into flock;
- report illness and death of birds to Veterinary Services;
- appropriate disposal of manure and dead poultry;
- vaccinate animals when appropriate.

With respect to how the virus could have been spread, hunters also deserve to be ruled out as well as direct wild bird infection or other fomite transmission. There is strong evidence from past outbreaks in Turkey (2007 and 2008) that whilst wild birds were the reservoir and how the virus was brought to the country, that it was hunting these waterbirds (ducks in this case) that brought the virus into contact with domestic poultry. Without that, the virus may not have done so. It is perhaps not probable that this is how the virus could have [infected] these 3 widely spread farms, but it would be worth ruling this out as a possible route. The earlier FAO comment pointing out the need for hunters to take care about the handling and disposal of hunted birds highlights this potential but perhaps under-regarded route of introduction.

And pity the swans; large white birds really do stand out against the background of far more numerous but often much duller winter ducks.

Bird flu found at 2nd Dutch farm
--------------------------------
A case of bird flu has been confirmed at a chicken farm in the Netherlands, the 2nd infection identified in the country this week.

The latest case was at a farm in the village of Ter Aar, in South Holland province, 15 miles from a farm where thousands of chickens were slaughtered this week following a bird flu infection.

Tests are being conducted to establish the exact strain of bird flu in the Ter Aar case. The earlier case and another this week at a duck farm in England were confirmed as H5N8, which British officials said posed a very low public health risk.

All 43 000 chickens at the farm in Ter Aar are being slaughtered and the government has banned the transport of poultry and eggs nationwide.

[5] UK: risk of spread to nature reserve

Experts believe the risk to wild birds at Saltholme [nature reserve, England] from the latest bird flu outbreak is minimal.

Culling of thousands of ducks has been taking place on a farm in East Yorkshire [England].

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the disease was the same strain as one confirmed at a chicken farm in the Netherlands and in Germany -- the "highly pathogenic" H5N8 bird flu.

Officials are still investigating how the virus reached East Yorkshire, whether it was the result of commercial transport of birds, or carried by wild birds.

And RSPB spokesman Graham Madge said the charity, which runs Saltholme nature reserve near Stockton, was keeping an "open mind" about how the latest outbreak spread.

"But when you look back at the outbreak several years ago most of them were linked back to poultry movement," he said. "Since the outbreak at the weekend we've not had any other reports of suspicious deaths.

"Saltholme does gets wild birds migrating from the Netherlands and across Europe, but at the moment we don't have any serious concerns.

"Bird flu is something we have to be increasingly vigilant about, but at the moment I don't think people have to worry about the birds on reserves or in their gardens."

Officials have been quick to reassure the public that the latest bird flu outbreak was not the H5N1 strain which has led to hundreds of deaths in people worldwide. Most types of bird flu are harmless to humans.

Experts have warned further outbreaks of bird flu could emerge in the coming days.

[While the H5N8-affected commercial poultry farms in Germany (turkeys) and the Netherlands (chickens) could have been exposed to wild birds, the breeding duck farm in Yorkshire was supposed to be protected from such exposure. Results of the investigation into the source of infection there is expected with interest. - Mod.AS
