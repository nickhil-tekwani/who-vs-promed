A federal food-safety watchdog has announced the recall of a hotdog relish because of the potential presence of a bacterium that causes botulism. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says Orange Blossom Farm is recalling its unbranded relish because it may permit the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_.

The product was sold in 500-milliliter bottles at the St. Jacob's Farmer's Market, near Waterloo, ON. The agency says food contaminated with the toxin may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure, and paralysis.

The CFIA says there have been no reported illnesses due to the relish.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
