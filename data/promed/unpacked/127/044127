A 2nd case of measles was recently discovered in Michigan. Officials with the Wayne County Department of Health want residents to know of a possible measles exposure from 1 of those 2 cases.

[Patrons at a restaurant named in the URL above] may have been exposed to measles. Officials say the possible contamination was due to a customer with measles at the restaurant, not due to a food safety or sanitation-related issue. There is no further risk at this establishment - only for those who dined there in the specified time on [Sat 8 Apr 2017].

Measles is a highly infectious respiratory illness that is spread through coughing and sneezing by a contagious person. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes that usually start seven to 14 days after exposure and last for 3 to 5 days before the rash appears. The rash, starts on the face and progresses down the trunk, arms and legs, and lasts 4 to 7 days. Measles can be serious, leading to pneumonia, or inflammation of the brain.

Individuals present at the restaurant during the specified time should monitor themselves for fever and rash and other symptoms consistent with measles for 21 days, or through [Sat 29 Apr 2017].

Officials have also issued an alert for a possible measles exposure at 2 restaurants in Washtenaw County. Further details about the 2 measles cases have not been given.

Wayne County Department of Health officials say having 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine is protective. The 1st dose of the vaccine is given to infants after their 1st birthday. A booster dose is given to children 4 to 6 years of age. Adults born before 1957 are considered immune by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

There are now 20 confirmed cases of measles in children under 5 [years of age] in Hennepin County, according to the Minnesota Department of Health [MDH]. At least 16 of the children are unvaccinated. MDH is still working to determine whether the other 4 children had received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. All of the confirmed cases are Somali children 5 years old or younger.

"This is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities," Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger said in a statement. "There are people of all backgrounds around the state who have chosen not to protect themselves or their children. Often that decision is based on good intentions and inaccurate information. It's the responsibility of all of us who care about the health of Minnesota children to make sure people have accurate information and take action to protect their families and their communities."

The last major measles outbreak in Minnesota occurred in 1990 - with over 450 cases and 3 deaths.

[The number of cases is now 21 [Tue 25 Apr 2017] and expected to rise. Health officials say the outbreak has been traced to a child care facility, where several children in the Somali community were exposed. The Somali community has been the target of misinformation regarding vaccines and a supposed link to autism. [This is not only true for the Somali community, but a hard held belief of too many parents.] Health officials and Somali community members say they are working to encourage vaccinations in the community.

[3] Europe outbreak

Parents are being urged to vaccinate their children against measles following a major outbreak in Europe. The outbreak, which has particularly affected Italy and Romania, has prompted the Health Department to call on parents to ensure that their children have received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Between [1 Jan 2016] and [31 Mar 2017], Romania reported 4025 cases of measles, including 18 deaths. The majority of measles cases have been concentrated in areas where vaccination uptake is especially low.

Dr Linda Diggle, head of preventive programmes at the Health Department, said: 'Uptake of immunisation is generally high in Jersey, however, the European outbreak and the deaths it is causing shows just how important it is for all children to be vaccinated.'

[4] Vaccination coverage

Gaps in vaccination coverage against measles have lead to several outbreaks of the highly-contagious disease in Europe in the past year [2016], with both children and young adults affected, health officials said on [Mon 24 Apr 2017].

During the first 2 months of 2017, more than 1500 measles cases were reported from 14 European countries due to "an accumulation of unvaccinated individuals", said officials from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In 10 countries -- Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden -- the number of cases reported in January-February 2017 was more than double that of the first 2 months of 2016.

"It is unacceptable to hear that children and adults are dying from [a] disease where safe and cost-effective vaccines are available," the EU's health commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis said in response to the ECDC's data.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through direct contact and through the air. It can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine, but due to immunisation gaps remains one of the biggest killers of children worldwide. The World Health Organization says measles killed 134 000 in 2015.

In the 12 months from [1 Mar 2016] to [28 Feb 2017], a total of 5881 cases of measles were reported in Europe. Romania accounted for 46 percent of those, while 24 percent were in Italy and 9 percent in Britain.

The ECDC's report said one of the most concerning aspects of the recent outbreaks in Europe was that they were in older age groups as well as children. In 2015 and 2016 around a 3rd of all measles cases in Europe were in adults over 20 years old. "Closing immunisation gaps in adolescents and adults who have not received vaccination in the past as well as strengthening routine childhood immunisation programmes will be vital to prevent future outbreaks," it said.

Public trust in immunisation is an important global health issue, with lack of trust leading people to turn down potentially life-saving vaccines. Experts say negative attitudes may be due to controversies over suspected side-effects and hesitancy among some family doctors. Many adults don't realize they are susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases such as measles -- falsely believing that they only infect babies and school-age children.

Interrupting transmission of measles requires at least 95 percent vaccination coverage with 2 doses.

The latest data for 2015 showed vaccination coverage for the 2nd dose of measles was below 95 percent in 15 out of 23 European Union/ European Economic Area countries which reported figures, the ECDC said. Coverage for the 1st was below 95 percent in 12 of 27 countries who reported data.

https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20517220/slovakia-reports-first-case-of-measles.html


Slovakia registered its 1st case of imported measles. The patient was examined and is stable, said spokesperson for the Public Health Authority Zuzana Drobová.

"The regional public health authority in Košice was informed by the University Hospital of Louis Pasteur in Košice about the hospitalisation of a 25-year-old patient with permanent residence in Italy with a suspicion of measles," Drobová told the Sme daily.

An Italian student who currently attends the Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice, he was not vaccinated against measles, she added. The student was probably infected in Novy Sad in Serbia, where he has been since [27 Mar 2017], specified the hospital's spokesperson Ivana Stašková. He was hospitalised on [7 Apr 2017] and released 11 days later, she told Sme.

The beginning of the illness was serious as the student suffered from a high temperature and noncancerous liver disease, while he had a rash on his body. The doctors also examined all people he was in touch with, and their health condition is still being monitored. The respective authorities also checked all employees of the university hospital whether they were vaccinated against measles, Sme reported.

Chief Slovak hygienist Ján Mikas meanwhile called an all parents who have not vaccinated their children yet to do so. They should visit their pediatrician and talk about the possibility. The call concerns mostly 4-year-old non-vaccinated children in Bratislava, Trenčín, Banská Bystrica and Košice regions as the vaccination rate there is below 95 percent of the whole population. Usually, children are vaccinated against measles between 15 and 18 months of age and then again when children are 11 years old. The vaccination against measles is compulsory. The vaccine used for this purpose is the MMR [injection], which is also used to vaccinate against mumps and rubella. It belongs among the vaccines parents refuse the most, said child doctor Miluša Džupinová from Prešov. The reason is that they are afraid of some harmful effects, Sme reported.

Currently, the countries which are suffering from a high number of measles cases are Italy and Romania, with 1020 and 1955 reported cases, respectively. From Romania, the disease spread also to Hungary where 52 cases were reported in mid-March [2017], Sme wrote.

Measles is sweeping through famine-threatened Somalia as UNICEF rushes to vaccinated 360 000 children in a month.

Thousands of children have been infected by measles in famine-threatened Somalia, already hit by an epidemic of cholera, the UN children's agency UNICEF says, as it launches a campaign to vaccinate some 360 000 children in 1 month.

The United Nations is racing to avoid a repeat of famine in the drought-hit Horn of African nation where more than 250 000 people died of starvation in 2011. "We know only too well from the 2011 famine that measles, combined with malnutrition and displacement, is an especially lethal combination for children," Steven Lauwerier, UNICEF's representative in Somalia, said in a statement on [Tue 25 Apr 2017].

"Among vaccine-preventable diseases, none is more deadly than measles."

Almost 5700 cases of suspected measles have been reported across Somalia since the start of 2017, more than the total number of cases in 2016, it said.

Measles, a viral respiratory infection [...] thrives in congested, unsanitary displacement camps, which have mushroomed across the country as people flee drought.

Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are 9 times more likely to die from diseases like measles than healthy ones, Lauwerier said. More than 6 million Somalis - half of the population - need emergency aid, including close to 1 million acutely malnourished children. Many of the children have never been immunised.

Somalia has been mired in civil war since 1991 and continues to face an Islamist insurgency.

The vaccination campaign is starting this week [24 to 30 Apr 2017] in the central city of Baidoa, where large numbers have been arriving in search of aid - at least 70 000 in March, UNICEF said.

The number of deaths from measles has fallen by 79 percent worldwide since 2000, thanks mainly to mass vaccination campaigns, but nearly 400 children still die from the disease every day, the World Health Organization says.

[Somalia is experiencing the worst drought in 40 years. It is critical to get humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, to the children. Malnourished children under 5 are the most susceptible to measles, where the disease exacerbated by malnutrition wears down their already weak immune system resulting in more complications, like pneumonia and diarrhoea. - Mod LK]
