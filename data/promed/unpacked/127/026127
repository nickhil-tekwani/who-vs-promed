Cows vaccinated after Malaysia foot-and-mouth scare
--------------------------------------------------
Malaysian authorities have vaccinated more than 200 cows in the northern
state of Kelantan after 12 became infected with foot-and-mouth disease, an
official said today.

The disease, which is highly contagious to animals but harmless to humans,
was detected last Tuesday in cows owned by 6 farmers at a local village in
Kelantan, which borders Thailand. "There's no outbreak. We have vaccinated
more than 200 cattle for safety reasons," said the official from the local
veterinary department.

"The 12 cows have also been treated. They are okay," he told reporters by
telephone. It was the third case of foot-and-mouth disease reported in
Kelantan this year. Local authorities have blamed the cases on the illegal
entry of infected animals, especially from Thailand, ahead of the Eid
Al-Adha Muslim festival last month.

[Kelantan is the northernmost state on the East Peninsular Malaysia. FMD
has been reported from Peninsular Malaysia each year during the last
decade; reportedly, 98 361 bovines and buffaloes were vaccinated there
during 2001. Hopefully, laboratory investigations of this suspected
outbreak will be carried out. Further information about the virus strains
involved and the composition of the applied vaccine will be useful. In
1995, Malaysia played a significant role in the evolution of the serious
pandemic caused by Type O FMD virus of a topotype which has been called the
"South Asian topotype", later spreading to Europe (see ref. 20000529.0857).

No incidence of the disease has been reported for years from the other 2
territories of Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. - Mod.AS]
