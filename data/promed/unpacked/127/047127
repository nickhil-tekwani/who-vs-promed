The 1st case of parvovirus in Oregon wolves has been documented by the Oregon State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab.

The wolf, known as OR19, found dead by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists on 19 May 2013, died of complications of canine parvovirus, according to the lab's preliminary report.

The disease is contagious in canids and usually fatal. Domestic dogs usually are protected by vaccinations, but parvo has been found in wolf populations throughout the west, causing short-term wolf declines, state officials said.

[Canine parvovirus (CPV) apparently evolved from a feline panleukopenia-like virus and was 1st detected in wolves from northeastern Minnesota in 1973. Since then, the virus has been detected in wild and domestic canids worldwide.

Mortality related to CPV in domestic canids primarily is associated with younger animals, but very little is known about the eco-epidemiology of this virus in wild canid populations.

In Minnesota, CPV is believed to have considerable demographic impact on wolf populations by reducing pup survival (Mech et al. J Wildl Dis 44: 824-836). - Mod.PMB
