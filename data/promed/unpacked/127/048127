SUMMARY

Guinea
----
3 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 25 Oct 2015, all in Guinea. The country also reported 3 cases the previous week. All 3 new cases are from the same household in the subprefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah, and are registered high-risk contacts linked to a case from the same area last week. There are currently 364 contacts under follow-up in Guinea (an increase from 246 the previous week), 141 of whom are high-risk. An additional 233 contacts identified during the past 42 days remain untraced. Therefore there remains a near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts. Sierra Leone reported zero cases for a 6th consecutive week, and will be declared free of EVD transmission on 7 Nov 2015 if no further cases are reported.

Case incidence has remained at 5 confirmed cases or fewer per week for 13 consecutive weeks. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. The phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola builds on existing measures to drive case incidence to zero, and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, and capacity for testing and counselling as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors are central to the phase-3 response framework.

The 3 new confirmed cases reported in the week to 25 Oct 2015 are members of the same family and household in the village of Kondeyah, in the subprefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah. The cases are a 25-year-old woman who is 7 months pregnant, and her 10-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. All are currently receiving treatment. They are the 7th, 8th, and 9th cases in the Forecariah branch of the Ratoma transmission chain. The branch was initiated after a 10-year-old girl who was not a registered contact travelled from Ratoma to Forecariah to seek treatment from several traditional healers who later became ill and were confirmed as EVD-positive.

Of 364 contacts under follow-up in Guinea on 25 Oct 2015, 43 were located in Conakry with 321 located in Forecariah. The 3 new cases have generated 55 high-risk contacts in Kondeyah.

Sierra Leone
----
In Sierra Leone, all contacts linked to the country's 2 most recently active chains of transmission, Bombali and Kambia, have completed 21-day follow-up. The last case to receive treatment was confirmed free of EVD after a 2nd consecutive negative test on 25 Sep 2015. The country will be declared free of EVD transmission on 7 Nov 2015 if no further cases are reported.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 644 new and repeat samples in the week to 25 Oct 2015. In Liberia, 1038 new and repeat samples were tested over the same period in the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1389 new samples were collected in Sierra Leone (the 4th consecutive weekly decrease) and tested by 9 operational laboratories.

CDC issues Ebola outbreak update
----------------
The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) released updated information regarding the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa on Wed [28 Oct 2015].

In this update, they reported a total of 28 575 cases associated with the outbreak. This includes 15 243 cases that have been confirmed by a laboratory along with suspected and probable cases. [Note that in the early stages, lab capacity was inadequate and very many cases were never lab tested. - Mod.JW] Since the outbreak began, 11 313 people [are reported to] have succumbed to the disease. It has also been reported that, if Sierra Leone does not see additional cases through 7 Nov 2015, it will be declared free of Ebola transmission. According to the report, all contacts associated with prior cases have completed the 21-day monitoring period. The last patient to have had the disease was cleared on 25 Sep 2015.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 3 confirmed cases of the disease in Guinea leading up to 25 Oct 2015. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been the countries to see the heaviest impact of this outbreak. Over the course of the epidemic, 36 cases were reported in countries outside of the outbreak's main zone.

The USA lifted specialized entry screening for travelers coming from Liberia, but these remain in effect for those traveling from Sierra Leone and Guinea. Liberia was declared free of transmission as of 3 Sep 2015.

Guinea records 3 new cases of Ebola, brings total to 9
---------------
[According to Fode Tass Sylla, a spokesperson for the national center for the fight against Ebola virus disease (EVD), who spoke on Wed (28 Oct 2015), 3 more people in Guinea have contracted EVD. The 3 new EVD patients were infected in Forecariah (western Guinea) from the family of a woman who died of EVD and whose body was handled without appropriate protection. According to Sylla, "In all, 9 sick people are being treated at our centers throughout the country and most are connected to the dead woman," he told Reuters. He also said authorities had known of the 3 new cases since Sat (24 Oct 2015)." Most -- but not all. - Mod.JW]

[A baby born to "healthy parents" has tested positive for the Ebola virus in the town of Forecariah in Guinea near the border with Sierra Leone, Fode Tass Sylla, the communication officer of the national response coordination against the epidemic confirmed on Sun [1 Nov 2015]. I wonder why the parents were tested in the 1st place - were they contacts? - Mod.JW]

29 Oct 2015 Spain: Guinean tested for Ebola in La Coruna

[The Galicia regional health authority released information on the afternoon of 28 Oct 2015 indicating that the 1st Ebola virus disease (EVD) test carried out on a 24-year-old man from Guinea had come back negative and a 2nd test will be submitted on 29 Oct 2015. The patient, who reached Lisbon from Guinea on 24 Oct 2015, traveled to La Coruna by road, reported to the casualty department of the University Hospital in La Coruna displaying worrying symptoms (fever, vomiting and diarrhea). He was taken, in a sealed unit, to Meixoeiro Hospital in Vigo where he was tested. The results of the 2nd test were negative on 29 Oct 2015 (Spanish language report).]

31 Oct 2015 UK: MoD test lifespan of Ebola and plague using spider web
http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/MoD-test-lifespan-deadly-diseases-ebola-black/story-28085661-detail/story.html
[Scientists have come up with a way to work out if a battlefield or terrorist site, where biological weapons have been used, is safe to go back to -- using spider webs. Under strict conditions, scientists based at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory are encouraging spiders to spin ultra-fine webs along a frame, which is then doused in deadly bacteria. They then put the frame in a special container and, because the web does not absorb the deadly micro-organism, such as the Ebola virus or the plague bacterium, the scientists can change atmospheric conditions in a bid to see how long it takes them to die. These condition changes -- temperature, humidity, or light for example -- can then be used to mimic how such conditions affect the persistence and survival of infectious aerosols in the outside environment.]
