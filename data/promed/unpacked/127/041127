During the past 3 years, the Astrakhan oblast was considered to have been a region free from measles. But now the situation has changed. According to the head physician of the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital, most new measles cases have occurred in the Leninsky district of Astrakhan oblast. Initially, these cases were believed to have been imported from other regions. But now there are indigenous cases of measles. This is due to the fact that many children have not been vaccinated against the disease in infancy. This situation is a consequence of deficiencies in the regional outpatient service. For instance, the most recent measles case, a child aged one year 2 months, was unvaccinated.

An ongoing large outbreak of measles in Merseyside, England, January to June 2012. (By Vivancos R, Keenan A, Farmer S, Atkinson J, Coffey E, Dardamissis E, Dillon J, Drew RJ, Fallon M, Huyton R, Jarvis R, Marsh G, Mason R, Shryane T, Stewart A, Ghebrehewet S.)
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
From 1 Jan to 30 Jun 2012, 359 confirmed and 157 probable cases of measles were reported in Merseyside, England. The most affected age groups were children under 5 years and young adults from 15 years of age. Most cases have been sporadic. There have been few outbreaks in nurseries; however, no outbreaks have been reported in schools. Of the cases eligible for vaccination, only 3 percent of the confirmed cases were fully immunised.

Summary
-------
From 1 Jan until 30 Jun 2012, 1339 suspected cases of measles were reported by clinicians (family doctors or hospitals) to the Cheshire and Merseyside Health Protection Unit (CMHPU) in England. Of these, 359 (27 percent) were laboratory-confirmed and 522 (39 percent) were discarded after laboratory results showed them to be PCR-negative.

Background
----------
Measles vaccination was introduced in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1968, with the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine being used since 1988 [1]. As uptake of MMR vaccination increased, the numbers of confirmed cases of measles declined. Confidence in the MMR vaccine has not always been good, as controversies about potential links between MMR vaccine and autism in the late 1990s, which were later proved unfounded [2,3], show uptake in the UK declined from 92 percent in 1996 to 80 percent in 2003 [4,5]. Outbreaks in recent years have mainly occurred in areas of the country or specific groups in which uptake of MMR vaccine is low [6-8].

Merseyside is an area in the northwest of England with a population of around 1.4 million people. Liverpool is the largest metropolitan area in Merseyside. In recent years, uptake of the 1st dose of MMR vaccine (given from 13 months of age as part of the routine immunisation schedule in the UK) by 24 months of age has been over 92 percent. Uptake by the age of 5 years of the 2nd dose (normally offered from the age of 3 years and 4 months to 5 years) has been around 85 percent. Despite recent small and localised outbreaks of measles in 2009 and 2011 in the neighbouring county of Cheshire, cases in Merseyside have been infrequent and sporadic.

Outbreak description
--------------------
Case definition: A measles case definition was adapted from national guidelines to reflect local epidemiology [1]. A case was defined as probable when the 3 following criteria were fulfilled:

- Clinical presentation: fever and measles-like rash and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, conjunctivitis, coryza, or Koplik's spots.
- Residence/reported from: residence in Liverpool or adjacent areas, or being a close contact of a confirmed or probable case of measles, or history of recent travel to endemic or outbreak areas.
- MMR vaccination status: patients who had not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (irrespective of age) or with unknown history of MMR vaccination.

As most cases at the outset of the outbreak were unvaccinated and partially vaccinated, MMR vaccination status was considered in the case definition for practical purposes.

All reported cases not meeting the above criteria were considered as possible. All reported cases were sent a salivary self-testing kit by post or tested in healthcare settings. Cases were considered confirmed if they were measles IgM-positive on saliva, or if they had a positive PCR result from urine, saliva or throat swab. After the 1st confirmed case of measles in January 2012, all patients were also asked to respond to questions on age, sex, travel history, place of residence, vaccination status, and whether they had been in contact with vulnerable individuals.

Epidemiology
------------
From 1 Jan until 30 Jun 2012, 1339 suspected cases of measles were reported by clinicians (family doctors or hospitals) to CMHPU, of which 359 (27 percent) were laboratory-confirmed and 522 (39 percent) were discarded after laboratory results showed them to be PCR-negative. Of the remainder number of cases, based on the case definition, 157 (12 percent) were classified as probable cases, and the rest of 301 cases (22 percent) were defined as possible. Although there is a statutory duty on doctors to report suspected cases of measles, the number of suspected cases that could have gone unreported is unknown. The epidemic curve shows a typical propagated outbreak pattern [This figure and others can be viewed by accessing the original text via the source URL. - Mod.CP]. Most cases have been sporadic with very few outbreaks in nurseries. Some family clusters were also identified.

Of the 54 confirmed cases reported before March 2012, at least 16 had documented exposure to another case in a healthcare setting (e.g. waiting rooms in clinics). To date, at least 8 confirmed cases out of 359 (2 percent) occurred in medical staff exposed to cases at work. The reproductive number (R0), estimated through Poisson regression in week 3 after the start of the outbreak was R0= 1.2 (95 percent CI: 1.1-1.3), which slowly came down to an R0= 1.00 (95 percent CI: 0.986-1.018) for confirmed cases in week 26.

Of the 359 confirmed cases, 175 (49 percent) were female, 84 (23 percent) were under one year of age and too young to be vaccinated, and 106 (30 percent) were 15-years-old or older. Of the cases aged less than 13 months, most were aged between 6 and 12 months (n=68) and only 2 cases were under 3 months of age. Most confirmed cases eligible for vaccination, i.e. over 12 months old, were not fully vaccinated (38 percent had no previous MMR vaccination, 16 percent had only one dose of MMR), and information was not available for 68 (19 percent) cases (Figure 2). 12 of the confirmed cases had been vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. There have been no measles-related deaths to date. Overall, 63 (18 percent) of the confirmed cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 3 (2 percent) of the probable cases needed to be admitted to hospital. Hospitalisation rates in confirmed cases were higher in the very young (29 percent in children aged under one year) and older patients (41 percent of those aged 15 years and older). These figures are likely to underestimate true hospitalisation rates as admission to hospital after a case is reported is unlikely to be captured. Work is ongoing to accurately estimate the number of cases hospitalised during this outbreak.

Most confirmed cases were distributed in and around Liverpool and the neighbouring areas (60 percent in Liverpool, 15 percent in Knowsley, and 12 percent in Sefton), although confirmed cases of measles have been reported in all 8 of the Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in Cheshire and Merseyside (Figure 3).

Laboratory results
------------------
The genotype of the measles virus identified in 86 cases in Merseyside is B3. This is the predominant genotype circulating in Africa, although it has been reported in 2011 in outbreaks in other parts of Europe [9,10]. Genotype D8 has been identified in 7 of the cases reported in Cheshire. D8 strain has also been identified in neighbouring areas: an ongoing outbreak in North Wales and sporadic cases in the Greater Manchester area. Both genotypes are distinct from that previously predominant in the UK (D4) [11]. Although the strain of measles is assumed to have been imported, it has not been possible to confirm this yet, as none of initial probable or confirmed cases reported since January 2012 in this outbreak had travelled abroad in the incubation period.

Public health actions
---------------------
To minimise secondary spread and complications in vulnerable cases, individual risk assessment and contact tracing were conducted and, where appropriate, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of vulnerable contacts (those under 13 months of age, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons) with either MMR vaccine or human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) was offered as per UK national guidelines [12]. Immunocompromised and pregnant contacts were offered HNIG if they were antibody-negative; infants from 0 to 5 months were offered HNIG unless their mother was born before 1970 or if the mother had natural measles and was born between 1970 and 1984; infants from 6 months of age were offered MMR vaccination. Over 1800 individual risk assessments have been conducted between January and June 2012 to ascertain vulnerable contacts and offer PEP. Over 1000 contacts were followed up on, and over 150 doses of HNIG have been issued to vulnerable contacts.

Increased vaccination efforts
-----------------------------
Existing initiatives to increase MMR vaccination uptake in children and young people have been intensified by primary care and community healthcare staff. Families of children not fully vaccinated have been contacted to encourage vaccination during March and May 2012. Effort has been made to make it as easy as possible for people to take up the opportunity to be vaccinated, e.g. through setting up community clinics at convenient times or home visits. Vaccination was offered at the small number of schools and nurseries where clusters of cases were reported. Coverage statistics for Liverpool, where the majority of the cases occurred, showed uptake improvements from the last quarter of 2011 (October to December) to the 1st quarter of 2012 (January to March): uptake for the 1st dose of MMR vaccine by 2 years of age improved from 95.1 to 95.5 percent, and for the 2nd dose by 5 years of age from 85.6 to 88 percent [13]. Provisional figures for the quarter from April to June 2012 suggest further improvements to 96 percent and 90 percent, respectively. Similar improvements have been seen in other areas in Merseyside. Additionally, in March 2012 alone, over 1500 children and young adults (aged from 5 to 24 years) were vaccinated across Merseyside. Quarterly coverage data for the period April to June 2012 are not yet available.

Awareness campaign
------------------
An intensive media campaign has been mounted, with regular press releases issued by the Health Protection Agency on behalf of the Multiagency Outbreak Control Team informing the public about the outbreak, persons at risk of getting the infection, what to do if infected to minimise exposure to others, and ongoing public health measures. This received coverage by most local and some national newspapers, radio and television on repeated occasions [14].

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
This measles outbreak is by far the largest in the North West of England at least since 1996 [15]. Around a quarter of cases have so far occurred in children too young to be vaccinated. This age group is normally dependant on passive immunity (maternal antibodies) or herd immunity for protection. Given that the uptake of the 1st dose of MMR vaccine locally in recent years has been relatively high, this large number of cases can partially be explained by the lower levels of immunity in older children and teenagers, and by lower levels of maternal antibodies passed on to babies from vaccinated mothers [16]. Therefore, a priority in the control of community outbreaks like this should be to target older children and young adults who missed vaccination in childhood. Lowering the age of the 1st MMR as a control measure was discussed by the outbreak control team, but it was discarded as it was thought that it could divert attention and resources from improving uptake of the routine vaccination programme and the catch up of older children and younger adults.

The low proportion of cases seen in infants less than 5 months of age is likely to be the result of passive immunity, which wanes later in the infant period [16], hence the larger proportion of cases in children aged between 6 and 12 months.

Exposure to measles in healthcare settings is described in the literature as a risk for acquiring measles and propagating outbreaks [17,18]. In the outbreak described here, a number of measles exposures occurred in healthcare settings due to the difficulty in clinically differentiating measles, particularly in its early stages, from other viral systemic illnesses and the challenge of maintaining airborne precautions in waiting rooms. After isolation of suspected cases and cohorting were put in place in emergency rooms and community clinics, exposures and secondary transmission have been reduced.

Interestingly, the genotype (B3) of measles virus seen in this outbreak is distinct from that of outbreaks seen in the UK in 2010 and 2011. Circulation of B3 in the UK was uncommon before this outbreak, but it has caused outbreaks in Europe in the last 3 years [10]. The genotype is assumed to have been imported, but it has not been possible to determine how it was introduced in Merseyside.

Bacolod city has the highest number of measles cases in Western Visayas with the number almost doubling in the 2nd quarter of this year [2012] compared to last year, as reported by the Department of Health (DOH) Assistant Regional Director Dr. Emelia Monicimpo, who was in the city Thursday [19 Jul 2012] to launch the School-based Outbreak Immunization at the Rizal Elementary School to fight the spread of measles among schoolchildren in the city. The program is a joint initiative of the DOH, Department of Education (DepEd) and the City of Bacolod.

"In 2011, Bacolod had 32 cases for the entire year, but in the 2nd quarter of 2012, it has almost doubled, with 51 laboratory confirmed cases," Monicimpo said. Monicimpo said children are susceptible to measles. She lamented that despite the many campaigns of the DOH that started in 1998, many children remain unvaccinated. Bacolod City Schools Superintendent Dr. Gemma Ledesma, who attended the program launching, said they were honored that the anti-measles campaign was launched at Rizal Elementary School. "We will benefit the most from this program. I hope that this strengthens the relations of DepEd, DOH and the city. We are one in saving lives. This program will save the lives of our schoolchildren," she said.

The event was also attended by Mayor Evelio Leonardia, Councilors Sonya Verdeflor and Em Ang, City Health Officer Dr. Salome Binas, Dr. Renilyn P. Reyes, and Rizal Elementary School Principal Mae Bautista also joined Monicimpo.

A case of measles has been diagnosed in a Flagstaff, AZ child. The child, who is recovering, was likely contagious from 4 to 12 Jul 2012, according to Coconino County public health officials. The respiratory virus is noteworthy because it is highly contagious and can be spread by coughs and sneezes, lingering in the air for 2 hours after an infected person has left a room. This child spends little time outside the home, so public health officials think the risk to others is low.

Measles is a respiratory illness caused by the rubeola virus. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes for a few days followed by rash. The rash typically starts on the face and progresses downward and outward, reaching the extremities last. The contagious period usually begins 4 days prior to the onset of rash but can occur even before symptoms start. Complications from measles can range from an ear infection to encephalitis, or death in children in rare cases. Pregnant women who develop measles are more likely to miscarry, deliver prematurely, or have a baby with a very low birth weight.

Vaccination is the most effective means of protection against measles, typically requiring 2 doses for those born after 1957. The measles vaccine is mandatory for children one year and older to attend daycare, preschool or school. Residents are urged to contact a healthcare facility or doctor's office prior to arrival if a measles infection is suspected, especially if a fever has lingered for a few days and a rash is now developing.

[The following comment has been received from Suzanne McEvoy regarding the moderator's statement in part [1] of Measles update 2012 (28) 20120715.1202611 with regard to travel alerts that: "It must be presumed that these alerts have achieved their propose, and the travelling public has responded positively." Sadly, this comment is incorrect. ProMED-mail appreciates Suzanne McEvoy's help in keeping the record straight. - Mod.CP]

"I am aware of several cases of measles in Australia that have been related to attendance at recent international sporting events. Firstly, a resident of the Northern Territory acquired infection while attending the Football World Cup held in South Africa in 2010.

Secondly, there were 3 cases of confirmed measles in Western Australians who independently acquired infection while attending the Rugby Union World Cup held in New Zealand in late 2011. All of these cases were young or middle-aged adult men. It seems likely that there are other such measles infections internationally that are not reported through the media or in the peer-reviewed literature, and hence may not come to the attention of ProMED."

Queensland Health is urging Brisbane residents to be alert for symptoms of the highly infectious measles virus as a case of the potentially deadly disease is confirmed. Rod Davidson, a Queensland Health physician says the person visited Chermside Shopping Centre on Thursday [12 Jul 2012] last week and the Brisbane Domestic airport on Friday [13 Jul 2012] while in the infectious period.

Dr Davidson says people should be cautious if they may have visited the public places. "We have one case, but we are worried that we could have an outbreak." He says the disease is hard to track, and health bodies rely on public awareness when cases are confirmed. "We're currently tracking all known contacts. But when they're in a public arena, we rely on getting the message out to the public and people becoming aware that they may have been in contact. The problem is, measles is a airborne infection, it transmits in small airborne droplets. Those airborne droplets can hang around for up to 2 hours after the person has coughed or sneezed. Initial symptoms include fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough and sore and red eyes, followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash. The rash starts on the face then becomes widespread. Many people are in bed for 2 weeks or more, with difficulty looking at the light, fevers, and a significant number of people get middle ear infections and pneumonia."

Dr Davidson says the infectious period begins 4 days before a visible rash. Queensland Health recommends anyone born during or since 1966 who has not had 2 documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles should visit their local GP to get a free vaccine for measles. If you are concerned you may have come into contact with the infected person in Chermside or at the airport, Dr Davidson advises you contact your GP to make an appropriate appointment time to be seen to avoid any potential further spread of the disease. For more information on the measles virus, contact your local GP or call Queensland Health's phone line 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84).
