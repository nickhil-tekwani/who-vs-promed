Horses are suffering from an unknown disease in 24 villages of
Alma-Ata. They are sneezing and coughing and vets are suspecting
horse flu. There is no certainty in the diagnosis since vets are
waiting for the results of the analysis of samples that were taken
from 300 ill horses. Horse owners are buying antibiotics.
The 1st mass outbreak was registered 26 Aug [2007] in one of the
villages of [Zhambyl province]. According to their owners, the horses
started to develop fever in a few hours and the owners consulted
veterinary doctors. A day later horse owners from another district
applied for care due to the same symptoms in horses. The chief
veterinary inspector of Alma-Ata, Serik Sembayev, said, "this can be
a highly contagious disease, but horses do not die from flu." A ban
on movement of horses has been imposed in all villages involved in
the outbreak. Ill horses are isolated and vets are treating symptoms.
According to the chief veterinary inspector, the horses probably got
infected by horses from Kyrgyzstan, because there are common pastures
at the foot of the [Tien-Shan] and [Dzungarian Alatau] mountains.
Vets are referring to the results of the monitoring service that has
predicted that the flu outbreak in Kyrgyzstan will spread to
Kazakhstan. Veterinary inspectors cannot completely close the
borders, so they are now focusing on population education activities.
The last outbreak of horse flu was registered in 1992. Unfortunately,
the disease has been removed from the list of diseases for which
state funds are available.

[The report contains contradictory information as it begins by
indicating the horses are suffering from an unknown disease, but in
the next sentence refers to the disease as "flu". The report states
that the "results of samples" are pending for 300 horses. Any
information to clarify the diagnosis would be appreciated.
As Mod. TG indicates in her succinct and very useful background
summary of Equine Influenza, antibiotics are commonly used to treat
secondary infections in Equine Influenza cases (see ProMED-mail
20060727.2077) Also included below are references to the concurrent,
but in all probability unrelated, outbreaks in Japan and Australia.
