Cases of a virulent stomach bug have rocketed in Scotland, leaving
scientists baffled.
-------------------------
In the past month more than 160 confirmed samples of cryptosporidium
infection have been reported to the country's main infectious disease
centre, more than 3 times the number in the same period in previous years.
Earlier in 2003, many Scottish tourists returning from holidays in Majorca
went down with symptoms of cryptosporidium infection, which is associated
with contaminated water. There has also been an outbreak linked to a
Glasgow swimming pool. But the Scottish Centre for Infection and
Environmental Health (SCIEH) said neither of those problems was large
enough to explain the massive recent rise.
The bug causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps, and fever and can be fatal to
babies, the old, and the sick. Up to 60 cases have been identified in the
worst-affected regions, such as Lothian. Only Orkney, Shetland, and the
Western Isles have not reported the bug in the past month. SCIEH officials
have looked at the pattern of cases to see whether there is any link or
common cause, but found none.
The centre says in an official report on the problem: "Although some recent
cases may have acquired their infection abroad, the increase cannot be
explained by tourists returning to Scotland from Alcudia [the affected
resort in Majorca]. Cases have been reported from all 12 mainland NHS board
areas. Some boards have reported as much as 44 percent of this year's
identifications during this 4-week period. SCIEH is aware of one recent
outbreak associated with a swimming pool in the Greater Glasgow area, but
this does not account for most of the present rise, the reason for which
remains unknown."

[The geographical distribution of the cases over a wide area point to
drinking water as a possible source, which has been reported from Scotland
by ProMED before, most recently in 2002 (see references below). - Mod.EP]
