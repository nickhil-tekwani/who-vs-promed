Cholera outbreak among refugees
----------------------------------
Cholera has struck in Aceh due to the unsanitary conditions left by the
tsunami devastation, according to the Islamic relief organization Mer-C,
which has teams of medics working in the worst-hit towns of Banda Aceh and
Meulaboh.
20 cholera cases were being treated in a refugee camp in Nagan Raya, in the
Meulaboh area, said Mer-C official Jose Rizal Jurnalis. 2 of the cases
were serious, with the patients severely dehydrated from constant diarrhea,
Dr Jurnalis said. One 12-year-old child had contracted the disease, while
the other cases were adults.
Dr Jurnalis said the disease had yet to become epidemic, but poor
sanitation and dirty water supplies made prevention difficult. "Vaccination
is not effective," he said. "A simple way to deal with the disease is by
having clean water and proper sanitation. But the wells are contaminated."
WHO epidemiologist Tom Grein said he had yet to document any cases of
cholera, although there had been cases of severe diarrhea along the west
coast, where Mer-C claimed to have found the disease. "We are very
concerned," Dr Grein said. "Cholera is high on our radar screen."
If the patients were given proper care, he said, cholera was only fatal in
about 1 percent of cases, with dehydration the most serious problem.
However, providing proper healthcare for the hundreds of thousands of
homeless Acehnese is proving difficult, with some districts still only
reachable by helicopter.
Dr Jurnalis said he was concerned the cholera would spread because people
were still using contaminated water to wash dishes, for cooking, and in
some cases for drinking.
Mer-C had tried to sterilize some of the water wells with chlorine, but an
adequate supply of bottled water was essential, he said. "If cholera
contaminates one refugee camp, it can wipe out that camp."

[To this point, diarrheal diseases in the tsunami-affected areas have not
been a major problem, but this report may signal beginning of a major
outbreak of cholera and other water-borne infections. - Mod.LL]
