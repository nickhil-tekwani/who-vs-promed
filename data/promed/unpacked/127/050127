Epidemiological comments: Suspected cases of FMD were detected at Ardlui farm, about 7km [4.34 miles approx.] south of Chegutu town, by the area veterinary extension workers (VEW) on [Wed 17 Jan 2018]. The VEW immediately alerted the district veterinary officer and provincial Veterinary Officer who both immediately drove to the farm and tentatively confirmed the disease on clinical signs. A total of 13 cattle in a herd of 239 beef cattle on the farm were seen with FMD lesions. Farm records indicated there were 4 movements into the farm and 3 movements out of the farm between [Fri 1 Dec 2017] and [Wed 17 Jan 2018]. Animals that moved into the farm were 2 bulls on [Sat 2 Dec 2017] from Pilosoff farm in Bulawayo, 8 cows on [Sat 9 Dec 2017] from Mt Hampden sale, 17 heifers on [Tue 12 Dec 2017] from Mt Hampden sale and 18 cows on [Sat 23 Dec 2017] from Aldington farm in Beatrice Seke district. Three of the outward movements were all to Mt Hampden Sale on [Sat 9 Dec 2017, Wed 3 Jan 2018 and Mon 15 Jan 2018]. Movement permit records were used to map out all destinations of cattle that were on the 3 sales that had animals from Ardlui farm. A list of all the source farms that sent animals to Ardlui farm and all destination farms that received animals from the 3 sales in which Ardlui farm participated has been compiled to facilitate trace back and trace forward investigations by respective provinces. Disease surveillance inspections on these target farms are still ongoing. The source of infection has not yet been identified as no evidence of disease has been detected at any of the source farms that sent animals to Ardlui farm in the recent past. Trace forward investigations have shown the Mt Hampden sales on [Wed 3 and Tue 16 Jan 2018] sold infected cattle as outbreaks have been detected at some of the properties that received animals from these sales. To date infection has been detected at 2 destination sites in Marondera (Maganga Estate) and Macheke (Nyadema farm) all in Mashonaland east province. Vaccinations are underway on the 3 infected areas while investigations continue.

[From Jun 2015 to May 2017, an FMD serotype SAT 2 event occurred in the provinces of Midlands, Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North. Sixty-four outbreaks affecting cattle were reported. The event was resolved on 13 Sep 2017. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17928

On 21 Jul 2017 a new FMD event was reported, however, the serotype has not yet been identified. Through the last
Maps of (Mashonaland East Province, Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe): http://h follow-up report submitted on 13 Sep 2017, 46 outbreaks have been reported in the provinces of Masvingo (24), Manicaland (11), and Midlands (11), again affecting cattle. This event is still continuing. According to the epidemiological comments made in the last report: "FMD infection continues to spread slowly in the affected districts. Limited vaccine available to deal with the outbreak. All the infected districts have been placed under quarantine with veterinary check-points also manned by police personnel placed at strategic areas to prevent cattle movement. Inspections and community education campaigns are currently on-going. All illegally moved cattle are being destroyed. This will deter farmers from illegally moving their cattle".
