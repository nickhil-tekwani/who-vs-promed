Two individuals undergoing treatment for Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) at the 19 Mayzs University Medical Faculty Hospital in the Black Sea
province of Samsun died on Sunday [10 May 2009], the Anatolia news agency
reported. One of the CCHF victims was an 82 year old woman and the other
was a 55 year old man.

Mostly infecting animals, CCHF is a viral disease transmitted by ticks. The
virus can infect sheep and cattle in addition to humans and is fatal if not
detected and treated early. It has been responsible for the deaths of more
people in Turkey each year since the 1st recorded infection in Turkey in
2002. Last year [2008] 55 people died in Turkey from CCHF, bringing the
total number of CCHF deaths in the country over the past 6 years to 147,
according to research conducted by the Turkish Healthcare Workers' Union.

[These 2 deaths appear to be the 1st fatal cases of CCHF reported in Turkey
this year (2009). The number of cases can be expected to increase from now
on with the onset of warmer weather and proliferation of the tick vector.
