On Mon 19 Mar 2007, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) sent
a team of gastroenterologist and laboratory technicians from the Seti
Zonal Hospital to Kailashmadaun of Dadeldhura and Jijadamaduan of
Doti districts after the death of a woman due to "a mystery disease"
on 18 Mar 2007. The team also included a rapid response group from
the Dadeldhura district hospital comprising 2 health assistants and 2
auxiliary health workers.
According to the reports received here, a 32-year-old woman died on
19 Mar 2007 on her way to the Seti Zonal hospital, while hundreds of
villagers are suffering from the disease with symptoms of diarrhea,
swollen feet, and hands. The patients have also been suffering from
shortage of blood [anemia] and kidney failure.
Dr. Manas Banerjee, acting director of the Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division (EDCD), said that the disease could be a result of
bacterial infection along with toxins. He said that nothing could be
said [until] the laboratory results were out. "We will take all
precautionary measures as soon as the lab results are out in the next
few days," said Dr Banerjee.
The disease has affected Kailashmadaun and Jijadamaduan VDCs [village
development committees] [over the past] week.
However, Dr Boglarka Remenyi, Paediatrics Registrar of the Royal
Children's Hospital in Australia, [in Nepal] on vacation, said the
"mystery disease" fits the classic description of hemolytic uremic
syndrome. Reacting to a news report about the "mystery disease" via
email to THT, she said, "hemolytic uremic syndrome is a triad of
diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, and renal failure. It is a consequence of
an infection by bacteria most commonly by _E. coli._
"It seems essential to try to get a prompt bacteriological diagnosis
and identify the source of this outbreak. The treatment for the above
mentioned condition is expensive consisting of rehydration, support
with blood products and renal dialysis," said Dr Remenyi, adding,
"The focus should be on identifying the source and educating the
locals on how to avoid becoming infected."

[ProMED would appreciate more information about this outbreak.
In yesterday's (19 Mar 2007) posting of what appears to be the same
outbreak (Foodborne illness, fatal, boar - Nepal: trichinellosis
susp., RFI 20070319.096), the symptoms noted were muscle pain, fever,
respiratory problems, swelling of hands and legs, as well as
difficulty swallowing, sore throat and "immobility" of upper and
lower lips. Additionally, the outbreak appeared to be foodborne,
associated with ingestion of meat of a wild boar.
In this report, diarrhea, anemia, and renal failure with swelling of
the hands and feet may have occurred "in hundreds of villagers".
Exactly how many individuals have anemia and renal failure is not
stated. The presence of fever, if it occurred, speaks against VTEC
(Vero toxin producing _E. coli_, also called STEC (Shiga toxin
producing _E. coli_), which usually does not have prominent fever and
no mention of bloody diarrhea or gross blood passed per rectum, also
speaks against VTEC. Also, in this report there is no mention of
ingestion of wild boar meat.
More information is needed including the results of stool cultures,
looking for VTEC, the presence or absence of eosinophilia (a hallmark
of trichinellosis), how many individuals had renal failure (hemolytic
uremic syndrome occurs usually in no more than 5-10 percent of
infections and renal failure in less), and if bloody diarrhea
occurred. In addition, an outbreak curve is needed to assess the time
span of the outbreak as well as any other epidemiological data
including any potential food vehicles. If there is an implicating
food vehicle such as the boar, is it still available for direct testing?
This posting now identifies 2 districts (Dadeldhura and Doti), which
are adjacent to each other in the Far Western region of Nepal and can
be seen at
