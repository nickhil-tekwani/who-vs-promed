The Department of Public Health has reported 4 cases of Powassan virus disease. The cases were identified from 1 Jan through 31 Aug [2019].

The disease is spread to people through the bite of an infected black-legged tick . Officials said, "This is a rare, emerging infection in the United States and human cases have been identified in Connecticut."

Officials said, "The virus can cause severe disease. There is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat Powassan virus infection. The best way to prevent Powassan virus disease is to prevent tick bites."

The DPH added Powassan virus disease to the list of state-wide reportable diseases in 2019.

[The only previous case of Powassan virus infection in Connecticut posted by ProMED was a previously healthy male infant aged 5 months from the eastern part of the state. It is not surprising that there is a case in Connecticut this year (2019), since there have been cases in the adjoining states of Massachusetts and New York. The vector of Powassan virus is the black-legged tick that is found in the areas in the USA where Powassan virus occurs. This report illustrates the need to avoid tick bites and to examine the body for the presence of ticks. Because the black-legged, _Ixodes scapularis_ is so small, it is easily overlooked.

The USA CDC notes: "Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall when ticks are most active. POW virus disease cases are rare but the reported number of cases has increased in recent years. All residents of and visitors to areas where POW virus activity has been identified are at risk of infection. People who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities in endemic areas are at increased risk of infection." (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html).

There is no commercially available vaccine for Powassan virus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid tick bites. - Mod.TY
