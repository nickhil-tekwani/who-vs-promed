2006 Saskatchewan Anthrax Death Toll Stands at 800
-----------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says there have been no
new cases in the past 2 weeks. CFIA Veterinarian Dr. Sandra Stephens
says even though a new case is possible, the likelihood is decreasing
as we move into late September and October.
It was a nerve-wracking summer for many cattle and bison producers in
north-central, northeast and east-central Saskatchewan. 153 farms in
45 rural municipalities were quarantined due to anthrax. The worst
anthrax outbreak on record in Saskatchewan killed 800 animals,
including 493 cattle, 254 bison, 29 sheep, 13 white-tail deer, 6
horses, 3 swine and 2 goats.
Dr. Stephens does not have a firm number of how many animals were
vaccinated. However, she says the last report from the vaccine
distributor indicated in excess of 400 000 doses were sent to
Saskatchewan. Dr. Stephens goes on to say anthrax is possibility
again next year [2007]. A lot will depend on spring weather
conditions.

[The change reflects bookkeeping more than epidemiology, with
corrections not to premise numbers but merely to new numbers of
animals affected and further results of laboratory confirmations on
past samples. If there are no new cases in the next week, we may
collectively uncross our fingers, especially if there is a frost or 2
to cut down fly activity. Thanks to Bob, Brent and Joe for the
information. - Mod.MHJ]
