Delaware environmental officials have confirmed the fungus associated
with white-nose syndrome (WNS) on bats in 2 locations in New Castle County.

The disease is characterized by a white fungus on the noses, wings,
tails and ears of bats. The fungus thrives in cold temperatures and
is seen on bats in caves and mines in the northeast, Canada and, more
recently, in Tennessee and Missouri.

Delaware does not have known hibernation sites suitable for the
fungus to grow; therefore WNS has not been detected here in winter.
Bats typically groom the fungus off when they leave their hibernation
sites at the end of the winter, making it more difficult to detect in
spring and summer. However, it may still be present and affect bats
after they return to their maternity colony sites, which can be many
miles from their winter homes.

The bats tested -- new arrivals to their summer roost sites in
Delaware -- had wing and ear scarring consistent with WNS, and tissue
samples were sent to the National Wildlife Research Center for
testing. Both samples came back positive for the fungus _Geomyces
destructans_. These were the 1st bats examined, and officials expect
it to be common and widespread.

WNS poses no health threat to humans but has caused the deaths of
over a million bats and has been detected from Canada to Tennessee to
Missouri. Many researchers and cave visitors have been in contact
with affected bats and caves, and no humans have become ill from this
disease. Although there will be no direct impact to human, pet or
livestock health, the anticipated loss of large numbers of bats could
have indirect impacts on humans. As the primary consumer of night
flying insects, bats help control the mosquito, beetle and moth (some
of which are serious agricultural pests) populations.

Some of Delaware's most common bat species, little brown, big brown
and tri-colored bats, are affected by WNS. Some less populous
species, such as the small-footed and long-eared bats, are also at
risk. Other bat species found in Delaware, such as the red bat,
silver-haired, hoary and evening bats are less at risk because they
do not typically overwinter in caves and mines where the fungus is
doing most of its damage.

The presence of the WNS-associated fungus in Delaware does not come
as a surprise to bat biologists because all of the state's summer
colonies of cave bats migrate here from other states with caves or
mines and all of the states within migrating distance of Delaware
have previously confirmed WNS.

Delaware officials will continue to search for bat colonies, monitor
bats for signs of the disease and assess possible changes in population sizes.

We ask that the public:

- Report bat roost locations;
- Report dead bats or bats exhibiting unusual behavior, such as
flying during the day;
- Do not touch bats. In addition to the possibility of the bat
carrying rabies, there is concern that humans can speed the spread of
WNS by unknowingly carrying the fungus from one location to another.

Individuals interested in helping can volunteer to track Delaware's
bat population. Please see <http://www.fw.delaware.gov/bats> for
information on Delaware's volunteer bat count project.

To report a bat colony or unusual bat behavior, please call 735-8651
or enter the information on-line at
<http://www.fw.delaware.gov/bats/> and scroll to the link at the
bottom of the page.

For more information, please call Holly Niederriter of the Delaware
Division of Fish & Wildlife, at 302-735-8651.

[In addition to the number of insects and agricultural pests that
bats consume, there are a number of bats involved in pollination of
crops. Thus far, those bats have not been found to be suffering from WNS.

The original article (reference the Source at the top of the page),
has a great photograph of what the white fungus on the nose of the
bats looks like. - Mod.TG]

[This appears to be the first report of this syndrome in
Delaware. For a more detailed discussion on the geographic spread of
the white bat syndrome and a status map of the geographic
distribution as of 29 Apr 2010, see
