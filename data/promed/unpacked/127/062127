Mystery toxin killing birds
---------------------------
Around the 1st 2 weeks of July 2004, more than 2 dozen birds have turned up
dead around the posh Long Boat Key Club on this barrier island's [Long Boat
Key] southern reach, leaving officials scratching their heads as they dig for
answers.
"The signs we're seeing are neurological, which would indicate some
sort of toxin," said Gary Morse, a Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission spokesman. "Whether that's manmade or
natural, we can't determine." They are determined, though, to solve a
mystery that has claimed victims from a variety of Florida's most
famous feathered species:
* roseate spoonbill
* great blue heron
* wood stork
* pelican
* egret
* ibis
and more.
The agency has launched an intensive investigation, enlisting the
help of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Florida's
environmental and agriculture departments.
Carcasses of the fallen birds have been sent to a federal wildlife
service laboratory in Oregon for necropsy -- the animal world
equivalent of an autopsy -- in an attempt to pinpoint the killing
agent, Morse said. "We have no idea when we'll receive results on
that," he said.
As that work has moved forward, Florida's wildlife regulators called
on their counterparts in the agriculture department to check for
traces of pesticides, or other contaminants, in soil or plant matter,
should carcass tests point that way. Researchers with the state's
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) last week [1st week of
July 2004] also took water samples from 3 ponds on and around the
club grounds, according to Merritt Mitchell, a DEP spokeswoman.
They'll test the water for traces of pesticides, nutrients and toxic
algae, such as red tide. "Results are expected in a couple of weeks,"
she said. [I never heard of red tide in a pond! I expect she said "toxic
algae like those that cause red tide". - Mod.JW]
"One possible culprit may simply be the nature of Florida's summer
and the microscopic killers it can spawn," Mitchell said. As spring
gives way to summer, the sun's path moves more directly overhead. The
intense sunlight produces powerful storms with heavy rains. If the
rains don't come, though, the sunlight works to reduce ponds, and
other water bodies, through evaporation. As the ponds reduce, fish
gulp down the oxygen dissolved in the water. Eventually, the oxygen
level dips to the point where fish can't survive. Bacteria then
multiply, leading to problems for any birds that swoop in for an easy
meal [of fish dead from botulism]. "It may be avian botulism, perhaps,"
Mitchell said, "though we don't know yet."
According to the National Wildlife Health Center, a branch of the
U.S. Interior Department, Florida has had periodic outbreaks of the
disease in the past 2 decades. The episodes, none of which occurred
in Manatee or Sarasota counties, killed pelicans, cormorants,
ospreys, grackles, green-backed herons, and others. And the disease
kills by attacking the nervous system, causing muscular weakness that
eventually leads to paralysis and death, according to a Mississippi
State University report.
But botulism is just one suspect, officials point out. The tests
might reveal a natural killer, or, they might yet point to an errant,
or malicious, pesticide or toxin application. The latter cause would
carry federal penalties and/or fines, Morse noted. Assuming, of
course, investigators can unravel this mystery. "We just don't know
at this time," Morse said.

[Neurological signs are relatively non-specific, as a number of pesticides,
as well as botulism, may cause these clinical signs. - Mod.TG]
[Rapid tests for botulism, taking less than one hour, are widely available --
I have them in my lab. So I wonder why diagnosis is taking so long. - Mod.JW]
