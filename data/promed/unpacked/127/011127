A poultry farm in Wallonia is the latest affected by the H3 virus, a very mild form of avian influenza currently present in Belgium, according to local media.

Since April [2019], dozens of farms have been contaminated in Flanders. The first 2 Walloon cases are located in Libramont and the province of Liege according to the Federal Agency for Food Safety.

Infected hens do not die as a direct result, but are more vulnerable and can catch other diseases. It also causes a drop in egg laying in the birds.

This disease poses no danger to humans and the food chain.

[The Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) published on 12 Jun 2019 an update of its earlier press release on the A(H3) outbreak in Flanders, as follows (in Dutch, trans., abridged):

"Since the beginning of April 2019, several dozen poultry farms have been affected by the H3 influenza virus. Most infected farms are located in West Flanders, some in East Flanders, 2 in Antwerp and one farm each in Liege and Luxembourg. The most common symptoms are depression, pale eggs, rapid decrease in egg production (from 20% to 100%), decrease in water and feed intake, and high mortality (sometimes up to 50% and higher).

1. What is influenza type H3?

The influenza virus type H3 is a typical bird virus. It is completely harmless to humans and the food chain. It exhibits all the characteristics of a low pathogenic virus, which means that it cannot in itself be responsible for the symptoms and death in chickens. Of course, this virus can help to exacerbate the symptoms of other pathogens.

Although originating from wild birds, the virus has meanwhile adapted to chickens. This explains its smooth multiplication and transmission.

In addition, research has shown that this virus has a certain preference for the laying organs, which may be at the basis of the established clinical problems and also explains why mainly laying hens and breeding animals are affected.

The virus is mainly transmitted through contact with contaminated material and between animals, which makes it more than strictly necessary to apply biosafety.

2. Measures

According to the new Ministerial Decree of 6 Jun 2019 prescribing urgent measures to prevent the spread of the influenza virus type H3 (Number NUMAC - 2019013193 - for the coordinated legislation), additional general preventive measures are imposed, together with additional specific measures for farms in which the H3 virus has been diagnosed.

In addition, the Decree repeats the measures of the earlier one dated 16 May 2019 concerning urgent measures to prevent the spread of avian influenza virus type H3.

These measures are effective from Thursday, 13 Jun 2019".
