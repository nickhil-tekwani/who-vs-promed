The public is being warned of an outbreak of "pink eye" on the island
[Saipan Island], an eye infection that could lead to vision loss. Marianas
Eye Institute director David Khorram, MD, confirmed with the Saipan Tribune
that the Institute has been getting at least 12 patients a day for pink eye
treatment and consultations this week. Most patients complain of pain and
itchiness in their eyes. Khorram said the current outbreak is one of the
more severe forms of pink eye infection, falling into a class known as
"hemorrhagic epidemic keratoconjunctivitis" -- with blood in the eyes.
Khorram said the disease is caused by virus that could be transmitted
through physical contact. The symptoms of the infection include redness of
the eyes, extreme irritation, swelling of the eyes, photosensitivity, and
presence of tears. This time, the viral strain is much more contagious,
Khorram said. A recent case involved a family of 4 who all came in with
pink eye. He said patients have to take time off for at least a week to
recuperate from pink eye, which normally lasts from 10 to 14 days.
The public is advised to take extra precautions to avoid contracting the
disease. Khorram advised people to always wash their hands. Other steps
that could be taken include
- not sharing of towels within the family or with anyone;
- not using the same pillows; and
- not touching the eyes.
Right now, the Institute is also treating patients who exhibit symptoms of
the disease. Pink eye is worse than the typical sore eyes. Also known as
conjunctivitis, pink eye is an infection of the outermost layer of the eye.
Khorram said the usual eye infections that people on [the] island contract
are the ones that infect the cornea of the eyes. He said an untreated pink
eye infection could lead to loss of normal vision because the infection
could leave a scar on the cornea tissue.
The 3 most common types of conjunctivitis are: viral, allergic, and
bacterial. Adults are the ones mostly infected with pink eye and the virus
is not airborne, so one will not be infected by just looking at the eyes of
an infected person.

[Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and the epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis
are self-limiting conditions that can be caused by several different
viruses including enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24, and human adenovirus
types 8, 11, 19, and 37. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis has been
associated particularly with adenovirus 11.
The outbreak in the Northern Mariana Islands is presumed to be viral, but
no precise diagnosis is reported. Recently outbreaks of "pink eye disease,"
which tends to occur in late summer and autumn, have been reported from
India and Taiwan and attributed to enterovirus 70 infection (see reference
below). Identification of the virus responsible for the Mariana outbreak
might indicate the route of transmission of this infection to these
geographically remote islands. - Mod.CP
The Northern Mariana Islands, officially the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, is a commonwealth in political union with the United
States. Saipan is the largest island and the capital of the Commonwealth. A
