There are no confirmed deaths of wild Antarctic penguins from
Newcastle disease. A few studies have isolated Newcastle virus, and
several other studies have found antibodies, but no deaths from
Newcastle disease have been reported in Antarctic penguins outside of
captivity. And certainly, no study has demonstrated that any of the
viruses in Antarctic birds have come through poorly disposed of chicken bones.

However, this is an ongoing concern of Antarctic researchers:
<http://www.geocities.com/coolrunnernz/WILDLIFE/Wildlife.htm>.

Unless you are a scientist who has special permission to get close to
animals for study reasons, humans must keep at certain distances from
all the wildlife. The New Zealand base and the American base have
slightly different rules concerning contact. One has to stay a
minimum of 5 feet away from the animal and is not allowed to get
close enough to cause the animal any stress or abnormal discomfort.
It all means the same thing: Do Not Disturb the Wildlife! This means
no pet penguins to those kids who have asked me repeatedly. No
petting penguins and no feeding penguins (or any other animals).

We also have to be careful about the food waste around Scott Base. It
was decided that chicken bones may be able to pass diseases onto
penguins; totally hypothetical, but all chicken sent down to Scott
Base will be boneless from this year [2009] on.

In ProMED post 20090403.1293, regarding the undiagnosed mortality of
Magellanic Penguins in Chile, Gary Miller writes that Newcastle
Disease (ND, infection with avian paramyxovirus-1 strains highly
pathogenic for chickens) has not been identified in wild penguins. In
2007, Chile reported to the OIE an outbreak of ND in Guanay
Cormorants, and the report stated that Magellanic Penguins also died
in this mortality event. It is not clear whether or not ND virus was
actually isolated from the penguins, so Gary Miller may well be
correct in his statement. Nonetheless, this species was identified as
part of an ND outbreak in Chile in 2007.

The report is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease_immediate_summary&selected_year=2007>.
The text of the report states "Guanay cormorants (_Phalacrocorax
Bougainvillii_): in which a velogenic strain of the Newcastle disease
has been isolated. Mortality on other avian species has been
observed: Peruvian pelican (_Pelecanus thagus_), Magellanic penguin
(_Spheniscus Magellanicus_) and Peruvian Booby (_Sula variegate_).
Bird mortalities have continued, and neurological signs have been
observed in 2 cormorants and Peruvian boobies. The infected area is a
rock situated on a beach, where cormorants and other species of birds
gather around and which is very close to a coast city of the VIIth
Maule region. No cases have been detected in domestic birds"
[Apparent mortality was less than one percent. - Mod.JW].

No indication is given as to the source of the ND virus infection.
Several cormorant species of the genus _Phalacrocorax_ have been
found infected with highly pathogenic (for chickens) ND viruses in
the past. ND virus appears to be endemic in the Double-crested
Cormorant (_Phalacrocorax auritus_) in North America.

[ProMED thanks Merritt Clifton and Ted Leighton for this additional
information. We still don't have the proverbial smoking gun: an
authentic report of a confirmed penguin death from NDV. The virus has
reportedly been isolated from them, and antibodies show that they can
survive infection with NDV (see previous post), but nobody has so far
produced a report of a single confirmed penguin death from NDV.
Unless someone can do that, this thread is now cut.

Readers who are interested in what the different bird species
mentioned above look like are encouraged to search Google Images for
them. - Mod.JW]
