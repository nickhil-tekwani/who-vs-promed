Michigan officials have set up a 3-mile [4.8 km] surveillance area around a Newaygo County farm after 1 of its steers tested positive for bovine tuberculosis.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) said the steer had been sent to slaughter when samples confirmed it had the disease, which is very rare in West Michigan.

MDARD tracked the 2-year-old steer to the farm through its ear tag. Through a whole genome sequencing test, veterinarians determined the bovine TB the steer had was similar to the bovine TB found in cattle and free-ranging white-tailed deer in northeastern lower Michigan.

According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, bovine tuberculosis can cause TB in people who consume contaminated unpasteurized dairy products or have direct contact with a wound, such as inhaling the bacteria during slaughtering.

However, the CDC says bovine TB is responsible for less than 2 percent of total human TB cases in the US. The number of cases has been curbed by disease control and routine pasteurization of cow's milk.

A Michigan official told 24 Hour News 8 this case is "not a food safety issue."

Bovine tuberculosis plagued Michigan's cattle industry from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, according to the Associated Press. A 3-year campaign to test every cow in Michigan for the disease was winding down in December 2003.

All farms within a 3 mile [4.8 km] radius of where the steer was raised will have 6 months to complete bovine TB testing, according to MDARD. The affected farms will be notified by letter.

MDARD plans to hold an informational meeting about the case of bovine TB at 7 pm on 27 Mar 2017. The meeting will take place at the Grant Community Center at 105 S. Front Street.

[Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present."

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.

We will be interested to see how this investigation develops. As the article pointed out, bovine TB has not been normally found in the lower portion of Michigan in some time. Previous postings in the ProMED-mail archives are almost all involving the upper portion of Michigan. Hopefully Michigan officials will share the origin of this case when the investigation is complete. - Mod.TG
