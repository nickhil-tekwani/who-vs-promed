Yemen - Cholera update, human rights (DG ECHO, WHO, media)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2 Apr 2017, 791 551 suspected cholera cases and 2142 associated deaths have been reported across the country (as of 4 Oct 2017). 119 020 suspected cholera cases were reported in the last 4 weeks, representing an average of 4250 notifications per day. In addition to being the fastest-growing cholera outbreak, it is now also the largest-ever (the Haiti 2010 cholera outbreak recorded 754 373 cases). The ICRC fears that suspected cholera cases could reach 1 million by the end of 2017. WHO emergencies chief, Dr Peter Salama, declared more should have been done in scaling up more rapidly the case-management work and sending more vaccines.

On 29 Sep 2017, the UN Human Rights Council endorsed the creation of a 'Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts' to conduct a comprehensive examination of abuses by all parties to the conflict since September 2014. The experts will report to the high commissioner within a year and discuss their findings with the Human Rights Council in September 2018. Human Rights groups welcomed the decision, considering it as a significant step towards enhancing accountability and ending war crimes.

In 2015 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
In 2016 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258910/1/WER9236.pdf, the total number of cases was 132 121 from 38 countries.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 21 weeks old and is 6.0 times the total number of global cases of 2016 and 2.32 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.27 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. There are now more cases in less than 6 months than the 1st over 5 years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the authorities estimate that the total will likely break one million by 2017's end. However, using the figure above of 4250 new reports per day, one million cases should be reached by about 23 Nov 2017, poetically the day of the American Thanksgiving.

Interestingly, on 3 Oct 2017, WHO published "Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030" written by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. The summary can be seen at http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap-summary.pdf and the entire document at: http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap.pdf. - Mod.LL
