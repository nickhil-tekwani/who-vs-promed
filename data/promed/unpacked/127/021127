Dutch health authorities reported two cases of legionnaires' disease being
treated in hospital in the Netherlands to the Health Inspectorate of the
French Community in Belgium on 17 June 1999. Both patients had attended a
reunion in southern Belgium between 4 and 6 June. A third case admitted to
hospital in Belgium was reported in the next few hours. All three had
stayed in the same hotel. On 3 July, another Belgian patient with
legionnaires' disease was reported, making a total of four cases (age range
42 to 86 years) who had stayed at least one night in the hotel between 28
May and 21 June, confirmed by culture and/or urine antigen detection and/or
serology. One case has died.
Preliminary enquiries made on 19 June revealed that all 3 initial cases had
stayed in the same building (A) of the hotel, which was a 300 room holiday
centre with two main buildings (A and B). The hotel had hosted more than
2000 people in the past 5 weeks. The rooms were cooled by a water-free
system and two cases had never been in or near the hotel's indoor swimming
pool. There were no whirlpools in the hotel. The only aerosol-producing
source was a decorative fountain in one of the restaurants. The hot water
system of part A was separate from that of part B: it had been installed 12
years ago, had long circulating pipework favouring water stagnation and a
recirculating hot water system, and the boilers had undergone no routine
maintenance.
Water samples and swabs were taken from taps, showers, and boilers on 21
June. The hot water temperature ranged from 42°C (bottom of boiler) to 46°C
(outlets), which would have facilitated contamination. The system was
decontaminated by hyperchlorination on 23 June (two hours at between 40-60
mg/L free residual chlorine and hot water taps were flushed for two
minutes). Boilers were drained, scale deposit removed, and tanks cleaned.
On 25 June, results revealed massive contamination of the whole system with
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (12 out of 13 positive water samples
with a concentration from 104 - 106/L). Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain
reaction fingerprinting revealed indistinguishable patterns in strains
collected from water samples and from two cases.
As the decontamination operation had been undertaken without specialised
supervision, and the contamination levels were so high, it was feared the
process might be incomplete. On 29 June every tap and appliance was held at
70°C temperature for five minutes to achieve thermal disinfection. Samples
taken between the two processes confirmed persistently high concentrations
of _L. pneumophila_ (>104) but samples obtained after thermal disinfection
were negative.
All hotel guests from 15 May onwards were contacted by letter and advised
to consult their general practitioner if they developed general or
respiratory symptoms. The medical community in Belgium was kept informed
through medical newspapers and the incident was reported to the European
Working Group on Legionella Infections (EWGLI).
In Belgium, there is currently no standard on the maximal authorised levels
of _Legionella_ spp. in water, nor on the frequency and type of control,
nor decontamination norms. Harmonisation of standards among European
countries would be beneficial and EWGLI is considering how this can be
achieved.
