A 27-year-old male patient from Afghanistan admitted at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) has been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

According to hospital staff, the man was admitted at PIMS with complaints of high fever and gum bleeding on 27 Jun [2015]. Patient samples were sent to National Institute of Health that confirmed that he had contracted [Crimean-]Congo [hemorrhagic fever] virus. The patient has been kept in isolation and his condition is stable, said the hospital staff treating the patient. On Tuesday a woman suspected of suffering from Congo virus was admitted to the Holy Family Hospital (HFH), Rawalpindi.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe disease with a high mortality rate. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

[The woman mentioned in the above report is probably the suspected CCHF patient mentioned in ProMED-mail post of i Jul 2015 (archive no. 20150701.3477885). CCHF virus is endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Interestingly, there was another case of CCHF infection acquired in Afghanistan who sought medical attention in Pakistan in 2015 and another in 2014. Cases of CCHF occurred in Sindh province, Pakistan, this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014).

Circumstances under which the patient from Afghanistan acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated in the above report. He probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
