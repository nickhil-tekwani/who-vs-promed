The Mayor of Guanare municipality, Portuguesa State, Mr. Rafael
Calles, confirmed the death of 8 persons because of yellow fever in
this community. He explained that a massive vaccination campaign was
carried out within the state and that in Guanare more than 65 000
persons have been immunized, which represents almost 90 per cent of
the total population in the area.
He pointed out that the majority of victims were from most distant
rural areas, so symptoms were not detected in a timely fashion, and
he declared unofficially that there were 8 deaths. In this way the
presumption of a yellow fever outbreak and the alert implemented
several weeks ago in this region of the country were confirmed.
Until yesterday, Portuguesa sanitary authorities had not recognized
the existence of affected persons, and they were referring to a
single case; however, the Mayor of Guanare, who was in Barquisimeto
yesterday promoting the Los Llanos International Fair, confirmed the
above account but pointed out that these were unofficial figures.
An emergency plan has been implemented, he indicated, and vaccination
is carried out in all health centers, in pharmacies, and even in city
councils. There is a regional campaign in order to educate and alert
people with respect to the disease.
2 suspected cases of yellow fever might have been treated in Pastor
Oropeza Social Security hospital in Barquisimeto, even though the
head of the hospital, Dr. Mario Jimenez, denied this version.
The alert came up yesterday morning, when a sign was placed in the
entrance to the Emergency Room, indicating that access was forbidden
because of contamination. The sign read "emergency consults are
suspended until further notice. We inform the public that the room is
contaminated. No trespassing". A woman who was about to enter the
hospital because of a severe stroke was turned away and referred to
another health center.
However, soon after trying to get information from the head of the
hospital, and when [Jimenez?] denied the [reports of a] possible
yellow fever outbreak affecting his patients, the sign was taken out.
With regard to the affected persons and that are hospitalized, it was
known that they are a couple from Maracay, Aragua state, and that
they have a child that may also undergoing medical testing.

week no.40, 2-8 Oct 2005. [trans. Mod.JGM; edited]

For this 41st Epidemiological Week, 2 cases of yellow fever were
notified: one in Apure State, San Fernando municipality, Arichuna
village, and the other in Bolivar State, Raul Leoni municipality,
Campo Grande area. Epidemiological surveillance continues in
high-risk states. In the mentioned areas no other human cases have
been reported, but it is suspected that there are epizootics, since
there are rumours about deaths of araguato monkeys in the area (45
minutes drive from the site of the case).
Epizootic rumors were investigated by state health personnel.
Surveillance flights were carried out, and a private plane was rented
in order to perform vaccination and control activities in these
hard-to-reach areas.
Up to Epidemiological Week 41, 5 cases of yellow fever had been
reported, corresponding to the following Epidemiological Weeks: 17 (1
case), 20 (2 cases in Merida state), 35 (1 case in Apure state), and
36 (1 case in Bolivar state). In the curve, there are 2 peaks for
investigated cases that correspond to epizootics reported by this
coordination and to the large number of cases investigated when there
was a leptospirosis outbreak affecting Carabobo, Miranda, and Aragua states.
With regard to the registry for 2005, up to 41st Epidemiological
Week, 507 suspected cases had been investigated, and 5 cases of
yellow fever had been reported. In 428 cases yellow fever had been
ruled out. Amongst them, 282 cases do not have a definitive diagnosis
yet, 17 were dengue fever, 86 were hepatitis A, 0 were hepatitis B,
35 were leptospirosis, and there are 72 pending results.

[There is a discrepancy in the counting of YF cases between the 2
reports. It may be due to the reason that the official weekly update
appears to be 2 weeks behind the current date. - Mod.RY]
