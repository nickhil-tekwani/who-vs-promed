The following clarification was shared by a veterinary colleague regarding the moderator's comment, "People at higher risk for RBF: - those who work with rats or other rodents, such as at animal research laboratories or pet stores":

We screen our rodents (as do the major lab rodent vendors) for this bacterium. Rats and mice are typically screened via PCR at least annually for _ Streptobacillus moniliformis_. The labs that perform this screen are typically willing to test pet animals as well. For example: https://www.criver.com/HealthData/na/H01W080M.pdf. As noted, _Spirillum minus_ is not as simple.

[The comment raises a valid question about relative risks associated with exposure to rodents.

The relevant comment is therefore amended as 'if you work with wild-caught rodents or in pest control, you're at a lot lower risk with a typical lab rodent'. - Mod.UBA

According to a review of streptobacillary RBF (1), although of 65 cases of documented rat bite fever since 1938 reviewed for this article, "only 8 (12 percent) were attributed to a laboratory rat exposure," "10 to 100 percent of domestic rats and 50 to 100 percent of wild rats carry _S. moniliformis_, and a known bite causes infection approximately 10 percent of the time. Thus, rat bite fever and rat colonization with _S. moniliformis_ represent a significant public health threat that remains unrecognized." With regard to mice (1): "Overall, there appears to be a low risk of rat bite fever from the bite of a healthy, inbred laboratory mouse. However, this may be different if the bite is by an outbred strain or wild mouse."
