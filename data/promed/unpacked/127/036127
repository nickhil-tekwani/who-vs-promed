** NO NEWLY REPORTED PROBABLE CASES WORLDWIDE**

[According to the WHO daily summary of reported cases, there were no
reports of probable cases of SARS worldwide for 27 Jun 2003. As of the
time of production of the daily summary table
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_06_27/en/>) there was a
cumulative total of 8445 probable cases with 810 deaths attributable to
SARS reported. This is a net decrease of 2 cases from yesterday's
report. This decrease is due to the exclusion of 2 cases by Brazil. In
the past 24 hours there was one new death attributable to SARS reported
from Canada (and reported in yesterday's ProMED-mail SARS update).
As a reminder, the most recent date of onset of probable cases of SARS are
15 Jun 2003 in Taiwan, and 12 Jun 2003 in Canada, 16 and 19 days ago
respectively. In 4 days, 2 incubation periods (20 days) will have passed
since the date of onset of the last reported probable case of SARS
worldwide. ProMED-mail will continue to cover new events as they occur with
respect to SARS. - Mod.MPP]

WHO Update 92  Chronology of travel recommendations, areas with local
transmission 1 Jul 2003
-------------------------
If no unexpected events occur, the last two areas in the world  Toronto
and Taiwan  to have experienced local transmission of SARS will be
declared later this week to have broken the chain of person-to-person
transmission. This achievement will mean that the SARS coronavirus is no
longer thought to be circulating in the human population.
From the outset, WHOs objective in combating SARS has been to seal off
opportunities for the disease to become established in its new human host.
Interruption of human transmission will be a milestone on the way to
achieving this goal.
However, scientists cannot at present guarantee that SARS has been
vanquished, as questions remain about the origins of the virus and its
possible seasonal occurrence. In addition, transmission may be occurring
somewhere in the world at such a low level as to defy detection.
In line with the WHO objective, recommendations to postpone travel to
designated areas were periodically issued. Evidence that SARS was being
exported from areas with local transmission was of particular concern, as
this contributed to further international spread and created a heavy burden
in terms of isolation and infection control, contact tracing, and quarantine.
The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to
support the case definitions of suspect and probable cases, as both
definitions depend on a history of close contact with a SARS patient.
Application of the case definitions required knowledge of areas where the
virus was spreading. Inclusion on the list also provided the basis for
recommended exist screening of all departing passengers as a measure for
preventing further international spread.
The chronology below provides a record of travel recommendations issued by
WHO and of changes in the status of local transmission.
Background
12 Mar 2003: WHO issues first global alert to cases of atypical pneumonia
rapidly spreading among hospital staff.
15 Mar 2003: WHO issues first emergency travel advisory, calling on all
travellers to be aware of the main symptoms and signs of SARS. The disease
appears to be spreading along the routes of international air travel.
24 Mar 2003: Hong Kong officials report 9 cases of atypical pneumonia among
members of a tour group that travelled together on 2 flights, raising the
possibility of in-flight transmission. Subsequent investigations revealed
that one infected passenger, on a 15 Mar 2003 flight from Hong Kong to
Beijing, may have infected 22 fellow passengers and 2 flight attendants.
25 Mar 2003: WHO reminds travellers to remain alert, but sees no need for
travel restrictions to any destinations. Most new cases are being quickly
identified and immediately isolated, thus reducing opportunities for
transmission outside confined areas, such as the health care setting.
27 Mar 2003: WHO recommends exit screening of air passengers departing from
areas where transmission is known to be occurring in local chains. No cases
of suspected in-flight transmission are reported following this date.
31 Mar 2003: A large cluster of almost simultaneous cases, linked to the
Amoy Gardens housing estate in Hong Kong, raises the possibility of an
environmental source of infection and provides strong evidence that SARS
has moved out of the hospital setting and into the community at large. In
addition, several areas link their first imported cases to a history of
travel in Guangdong or Hong Kong. These events set the stage for the first
travel recommendations.
Travel recommendations (postpone all but essential travel)
2 Apr 2003: Issued for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, China.
23 Apr 2003: Issued for Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and for
Toronto, Canada.
30 Apr 2003: Lifted for Toronto.
8 May 2003: Issued for Tianjin and Inner Mongolia, China, and Taipei, Taiwan.
17 May 2003: Issued for Hebei Province, China.
21 May 2003: Issued for all of Taiwan.
23 May 2003: Lifted for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province,
13 Jun 2003: Lifted for Heibei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin
provinces, China.
17 Jun 2003: Lifted for Taiwan
24 Jun 2003: Lifted for Beijing  the last area on the list.
Changes in the list of areas with recent local transmission
22 Mar 2003: Initial list includes Toronto, parts of mainland China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Viet Nam.
11 Apr 2003: Beijing added.
28 Apr 2003: Viet Nam removed  becomes first country to contain its SARS
outbreak.
1 May 2003: Mongolia added.
7 May 2003: Philippines added.
9 May 2003: Mongolia removed.
14 May 2003: Toronto removed.
20 May 2003: Philippines removed.
26 May 2003: Toronto added for second time.
31 May 2003: Singapore removed.
13 Jun 2003: Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu,
Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Tianjin (China) removed.
23 Jun 2003: Hong Kong removed.
24 Jun 2003: Beijing removed.
1 Jul 2003: Only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list.
