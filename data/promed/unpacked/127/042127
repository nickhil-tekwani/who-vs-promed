Banana farms are shrinking and so are the numbers of healthy banana plants, partly due to nematodes. You will find uprooted banana plants, the majority with immature bunches and destroyed anchoring roots. The problem is widespread. Areas prone to nematodes include many parts of Unguja and Pemba [islands, Zanzibar archipelago, Tanzania] and mainland regions of Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Ruvuma, Mbeya, and Kagera. The disease is also causing havoc in Ugandan districts neighbouring Kagera region.

Doreen Mmari-Mgonja, University of Dar es Salaam, has developed a simple and rapid DNA-based technique which easily detects nematodes. "A farmer needs to cut longitudinally the root of a banana plant. Reddish/purplish/ black colouration is an important signal that the plant is infected with nematodes," she says.

Three major [types] of nematodes have been detected. Local scientists are [also] involved in the regional banana breeding project trying to develop banana varieties which can resist nematode attacks and other infectious organisms. The research has been sponsored under a project funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

[A number of nematode species are known to cause disease on banana, including for example members of the genera _Radopholus_, _Meloidogyne_, _Pratylenchus_, and _Helicotylenchus_. Infestations have been reported to lead to up to 50 per cent fruit loss and plants may be killed outright. _Radopholus_ and _Pratylenchus_ species were identified to be of particular concern in Tanzania earlier (see link below), but is not clear which pathogens are being referred to above.

Soil nematodes can persist in fields for many years and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, eradication is extremely difficult and emphasis is often placed on keeping numbers below economically significant thresholds. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides and use of resistant crop varieties, if available.
