The presence of orange rust in sugarcane crops has alerted mills and
cane growers. The disease appeared in July [2011]. It is characterized
by drying of the leaves and reduces production levels.

Raul Castillo, Center for Research on Sugarcane Ecuador, said the
fungus was not very aggressive in Ecuador because of weather
conditions and environment. "It is a new problem facing the sector. We
have to create varieties resistant [to it]."

The country has 110 000 hectares of sugar cane crops.

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has
the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop.
Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an
orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur
on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base.
Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool
autumns, and by rain.

The rust spores are rapidly spread by wind, as well as by mechanical
means and with contaminated materials. Disease management includes
fungicides and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to
local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in
2000, a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most
widely grown sugarcane cultivar. The disease was reported for the 1st
time in the western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (ProMED-mail
post 20070731.2457), and it is not clear whether this was a similar
scenario with emergence of a new strain or whether the pathogen was
actually introduced at that time.

Orange rust has been reported since then from additional countries in
the Americas (see ProMED-mail posts listed below), but it has not yet
been clarified whether these reports represent the spread of the same
fungal strain or are due to separate incursions or mutation events
detected as a result of increased vigilance in the region.

The related species _P. melanocephala_ causes brown or common rust.
Colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and
development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain.
