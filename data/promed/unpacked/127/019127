Hendra Quarantine in North Queensland Released
----------------------------------------------
A quarantine put in place when a horse residing on a property between Cairns and Port Douglas, Queensland, Australia, tested positive for hendra virus in early September [2012] has been lifted. There are currently no hendra quarantines in Australia.

Hendra virus has been known to yield numerous clinical signs in horses including respiratory distress, frothy nasal discharge, elevated body temperature (above 40 deg C, or 104 deg F), and elevated heart rate; however, authorities caution that hendra infection does not have specific signs. The Australian Veterinary Association suggested that horse owners can reduce the risks of hendra virus in their horses by fencing off trees attractive to flying foxes (a type of fruit bat thought to spread hendra to horses), covering horse feed and water containers, and not feeding horses food that could appeal to flying foxes, such as fruit and vegetables.

The most recent case, confirmed in early September [2012], was the 7th incidence in Queensland this year, said Queensland Chief Biosecurity Officer Jim Thompson, BVSc, MACVSc, when the case was identified. In a press release, Thompson said horse owners needed to remain vigilant in taking steps to reduce the risk of infection as hendra virus can occur year-round but is more common during the cooler months.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately," he concluded.

[The fact that there are no more quarantines in Australia means most folks will take an easy breath for a change. However, it is critical to remain vigilant for this disease. Prevention is clearly the best weapon against this disease. Fencing off trees, removing things the bats may find attractive are some of the proactive things. Perhaps keeping horses in the barn at night may help. Additionally good husbandry including keeping all the normal vaccines up-to-date.
