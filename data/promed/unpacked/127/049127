A 7-year-old boy died of rabies on Saturday [21 Aug 2021] after he was bitten by a stray dog in Agaram Mel village, near Poonamallee, in Tiruvallur district [Tamil Nadu].

The victim was identified as M, son of R and a student of Class II at a private school.

50 days ago, when M and 4 of his friends were playing on the street, a stray dog bit them.

In July [2021], doctors confirmed rabies in a cat from Mezhyrichchya [Lviv Oblast]. This case was the 1st case in a cat in the last 10 years in Chervonohrad. The animal was treated in the district center, and rabies was diagnosed only after its death.

This case was discussed at a meeting of the State Emergency Anti-Epizootic Commission in the Lviv Regional Council. The territories of Chervonohrad and Mezhyrichchya with the adjacent lands were declared dangerous in terms of rabies. Quarantine restrictions have been introduced there since 30 Jul 2021. The village of Girnyk with adjacent fields, lands, pastures, and tracts was also identified as a threatening zone.

[4] South Africa (Gauteng): jackal, honey badger, human exposure
Date: Fri 30 Jul 2021

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said 2 cases of rabies were confirmed last month in jackal from the Cradle of Humankind area.

In addition, 3 jackals in the same area were suspected of rabies, but not confirmed.

Rabies vaccination campaigns in dogs have since been underway in the affected and surrounding areas of the Mogale City municipality.

In the past week, rabies was confirmed in a honey badger in the same area. "3 human exposures to the honey badger were reported," said the NICD. "All 3 cases have received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and wound care to prevent rabies infection."

The NICD said rabies is controllable and preventable, urging people to ensure that their dogs are fully vaccinated against the disease.

Rabies has been an endemic disease in South Africa for many years. It is reported in various parts of the country involving different animal species. Known, ongoing cycles of rabies exist in domestic dogs, black-backed jackals, mongoose species, and bat-eared foxes in certain parts of the country.

In Gauteng, rabies is reported infrequently in mongoose and jackal, and more often on the rural outskirts of the province.

In 2010, an extensive outbreak in domestic dogs was reported in southwestern Johannesburg, including Soweto. One human case was reported during this outbreak. The outbreak was controlled through extensive dog vaccination campaigns in the area.

In 2016, an outbreak of rabies in jackal was also reported from Mogale City, in the Muldersdrift surrounds, with few cases confirmed in domestic dogs and none in humans.

Around 99% of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies, therefore, means combatting it at its animal source. For OIE's communication campaign "Rabies ends here" toolkit, please refer to https://trello.com/b/66Bqv1ld/world-rabies-day-toolkit. - Mod.AS]

["From 1960 to 2018, 127 human rabies cases were reported in the United States, with roughly a quarter resulting from dog bites received during international travel. Of the infections acquired in the United States, 70% were attributed to bat exposures" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/human_rabies.html). - Mod.ML]
