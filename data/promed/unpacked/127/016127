[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States, most reports on West Nile virus
infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at
regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the
volume of such reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of
special significance will be posted immediately on receipt. - Mod.CP]

Infectious cDNA clone of epidemic virus from New York City constructed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pei-Yong Shi and colleagues at the Wadsworth Center, New York State
Department of Health, and the State University of New York at Albany have
reported the first full length infectious clone of the current epidemic,
lineage I, strain of West Nile virus (WNV) [Journal of Virology 2002;
76(12): 5847-56]. The full length cDNA was constructed from reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction products of viral RNA from an
isolate collected during the year 2000 outbreak in New York City. It was
cloned into plasmid pBR322 under the control of a T7 promoter and stably
amplified in _Escherichia coli_ HB101. RNA transcribed from the full length
cDNA clone was highly infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells,
resulting in progeny virus with titers of 1 to 5 x 10 to the power 9
PFU/ml. The cDNA clone was engineered to contain 3 silent nucleotide
changes to create a StyI site and to knock out an EcoRI site. These genetic
markers were retained in the recovered progeny virus. Deletion of the
3'-terminal 199 nucleotides of the cDNA transcript abolished the
infectivity of the RNA. The plaque morphology, in vitro growth
characteristics in mammalian and insect cells, and virulence in adult mice
were indistinguishable for the parental and recombinant viruses. The stable
infectious cDNA clone of the epidemic lineage I strain will provide a
valuable experimental system to study the pathogenesis and replication of WNV.

Louisiana: third equine death this year
---------------------------------------
A horse in south west Louisiana died last week from West Nile virus (WNV)
infection. This is the third horse in south west Louisiana that has tested
positive for the virus this year. Scott Willis, assistant director of
mosquito control in Calcasieu Parish, said the department began spraying
the infected area, west of Westlake, when blood samples were drawn from the
horse on 10 May 2002. WNV infection is mainly a disease in birds that is
spread by mosquitoes. Horses and humans can become infected with the
disease if bitten by a carrier species of mosquito, but the insects are
unable to pick up the disease from infected horses or humans.
WNV is getting closer to Texas. Although no cases in humans or animals have
been found in Texas, the Jefferson County [Texas] Mosquito Control District
director Lee Chastant said infection is imminent. There are about 50
species of mosquitoes in south east Texas, and the southern house species,
which transmits St Louis encephalitis virus, [is the most likely to
transmit WNV since it feeds on birds]. Chastant said WNV and St Louis
encephalitis virus are closely related and diagnostic labs have difficulty
telling them apart.
The disease first appeared in the United States in 1999, when 62 people and
25 horses were infected in the New York area. In 2000, there were 21 human
and 60 horse cases, again primarily in the north east. The spread south and
west became apparent in 2001 when 66 humans and 738 horses were infected in
20 states. Louisiana had one human case and 10 horse cases in 2001.

Illinois: Cook County crow positive for West Nile virus
-------------------------------------------------------
SPRINGFIELD: The Illinois Department of Public Health today reported that a
dead crow collected in Cook County has tested positive for West Nile virus
(WNV).
The crow was found on 15 May 2002 in LaGrange and submitted by the Cook
County Department of Public Health for testing. The University of Illinois
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Urbana/Champaign today determined the
bird was positive for WNV. Two other dead birds collected earlier this
month in Hampshire in Kane County have tested positive for WNV.
Due to the recent heavy rains and flooding in Illinois, questions have been
raised about an increased risk this year for mosquito-borne diseases. The
mosquitoes that may breed as a result of flooding are commonly called
floodwater or temporary pool mosquitoes and are not usually disease
carriers. The _Culex_ or house mosquito, which can carry WNV or St Louis
encephalitis [virus], breeds in warm, stagnant water and will begin to
increase in numbers early in the summer.
Since 1999, when WNV was first discovered in the United States in New York,
the virus has been detected in 28 states as far west as Iowa and Missouri.
WNV was first confirmed in Illinois in Sep 2001 when 2 dead crows from the
Chicago metropolitan area tested positive for the virus. A total of 138
birds from 7 Illinois counties (Cook, Crawford, DuPage, Kane, Lake,
McHenry, and Will) tested positive for the virus last year. In addition, 2
horses ­- one from Cook County and one from Kane ­- tested positive for the
virus in 2001. There have been no human cases of WNV encephalitis in
Illinois residents in 2001 or 2002.

Connecticut: first bird positive for West Nile virus in New Haven
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The State Mosquito Management Program today has identified the first bird
testing positive for West Nile virus (WNV) in Connecticut. The infected
crow was found on 16 May 2002 in the East Rock area of New Haven and tested
for WNV through the statewide bird surveillance system. The city of New
Haven has started mosquito control activity citywide. In 2002, WNV activity
has also been identified in seven other states including Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and the
District of Columbia.
As of Fri 24 May 2002, 8 birds have been submitted, including 2 robins and
6 crows, and testing has been completed on 4. Of the four birds tested, 2
robins and one crow were negative and one crow tested positive. Results on
4 crows are pending.
Surveillance for WNV infected birds began on 6 May 2002 and is coordinated
by the Department of Public Health (DPH). Birds submitted by local health
departments are evaluated by the Department of Environmental Protection,
transported to the University of Connecticut Department of Pathobiology and
Veterinary Science for further examination, and testing is completed at the
DPH Laboratory.

Massachusetts: first West Nile virus positive bird confirmed
------------------------------------------------------------
The year's first evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Massachusetts arrived
this week, 7 weeks sooner than last year, state health authorities reported
last night. A dead adult American crow found on Tue 21 May 2002 in
Wakefield has tested positive for the virus.
Disease specialists speculate that the late end of the WNV season last year
and the mild winter this year conspired to keep alive adult mosquitoes that
typically perish in a cold winter.The discovery of the crow this week, a
statement said, does not necessarily presage an outbreak of the virus. For
that to happen, there must be a complex cascade of events involving
mosquitoes, birds, horses, humans, and the weather.

WNV statistics, which is updated daily <http://db.state.ma.us/dph/wnile/>.

New Jersey: West Nile virus positive dead birds now total five
--------------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: Of more than three dozen birds tested so far this season by the
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, 5 crows found in
Monmouth (4) and Morris (1) Counties have tested positive for the presence
of the West Nile virus (WNV), Health and Senior Services commissioner
Clifton R Lacy MD announced today.
The 5 WNV positive crows announced today were collected in the Monmouth
County communities of Farmingdale (16 Apr 2002), Tinton Falls (18 Apr and 5
May 2002), and Wall Township (13 May 2002), and the Morris County
municipality of Lincoln Park (17 April 2002). Both counties have been
conducting mosquito surveillance and larval control since late Mar/early
Apr. As a result of the positive findings, both counties will be increasing
their surveillance for larval and adult mosquitoes in the immediate
vicinity where the crows were found.

USGS national West Nile virus surveillance maps: data analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------
The current West Nile virus maps compiled by the USGS/CINDI (United States
Geological Survey/Center for Integration of Natural Disaster Information)
reflect information that has been submitted and verified to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the week of May 17 2002. As of
Mon 20 May 2002 data from only 14 states had been submitted.
States reporting bird surveillance data were: Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Maryland, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Virginia and Washington DC. WNV positive data were recorded in 7 of the 11
(Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Washington DC).
States reporting veterinary surveillance data (horses in all cases) were:
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania.
WNV positive data were recorded in only one of these 6 states (Florida).
States reporting human surveillance data (negative in all cases) were
Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
The one state reporting mosquito surveillance data (negative) was Pennsylvania.
It is apparent from these figures that up to the end of the third week of
May West Nile virus surveillance has been far from comprehensive and
consequently does not allow at present any inferences about the immediate
course of the 2002 outbreak. A likely factor in this situation is that the
WNV surveillance programs of many states will not come fully on stream
until after the Memorial day holiday (27 May).

[Not included in the USGA/CINDI maps are reports posted in ProMED-mail
prior to 20 May 2002 (see refs. below) of WNV in birds in New Jersey and
Louisiana, and in horses in Louisiana. It is unclear whether this
discrepancy indicates that these results have not been verified, or merely
indicates delays in communication. - Mod.CP]
