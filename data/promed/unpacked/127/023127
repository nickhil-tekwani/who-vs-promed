Re: the statement by Tom Billy of USDA.

I have not come across aN HACCP programme apparently so specifically linked
to the number of employees(over 500). Here at Botswana's beef export
abattoirs we test for salmonellae in accordance with EU council decision
95/409EC, with negative results required for export of fresh meat to Norway
to be sanctioned. In this protocol, the throughput of animals is the
deciding factor in the number of samples to be taken, we must demonstrate
at a confidence level of 95% that the prevalence of salmonella in/on the
carcasses is less than 5%. With our large throughputs this involves very
extensive sampling indeed of both carcass swabs and meat pieces taken in
the de-boning halls.
Although all staff who enter the production areas are screened annually,
the excretion of salmonellae is notoriously intermittent so it is a very
much hit or miss affair. Given very good personal hygiene and sound
commercial practices I do not believe the members of staff involved to be a
significant source of salmonella on/in the product.
Has the criterion in USDA's HACCP testing protocol to limit it to plants
with over 500 employees been taken for financial or other purposes? The
throughput and rate of slaughter are the major factors together proper
bleeding, skinning and evisceration in producing hygienic carcasses with
low bacterial counts.
In Norway, I believe that sampling for salmonella is carried out at all
plants irrespective of number of employees, and the number of samples is
dependant on the throughput, thus giving a single standard rather than one
standard for the "big boys" (usually export premises) and a lower standard
for the rest - there have been occurrences of problems arising from small
as well as large plants.
Perhaps it will be possible to receive information on the rationale upon
which the USDA protocol is based?
