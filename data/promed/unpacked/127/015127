The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock & Provisions received today,
21 Oct 2005 at 18:00 hours, from the Agriculture Secretary of Parana
[state], a report of suspected FMD in animals in the townships of
Loanda, Amapora, Maringa & Grandes Rios, and immediately informed the
World Animal Health Organization (OIE), the Pan-American Center for
FMD (Panaftosa), and the countries with which Brazil trades, and
sent samples from the sick animals to the National Agriculture &
Livestock Laboratory (Lanagro) in Recife, Pernambuco [state, Brazil].
Preliminary investigations by the Veterinary Service of Parana state
show a connection between these suspected cases and the FMD
[outbreaks] in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.

[Since there is a preliminary connection between this outbreak and
the one in Mato Grosso do Sul, then it is likely Type O. Clearly we
will be looking for the results for the virus typing. - Mod.TG]
