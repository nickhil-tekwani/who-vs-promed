The recent deaths of 6 children in Miri have sparked public fears that the
Coxsackie outbreak in 1997 is making a comeback.
Health Ministry director general Dr. Abu Bakar Sulaiman today said that
after studying the deaths of the children, all of whom were under 5 years
old, 2 showed a similar pattern to the deadly outbreak 2 years ago where 31
children succumbed to heart failure. The 6 children died in Miri Hospital
between mid-February and mid-March 2000, and had suffered fever, vomiting,
body weakness and fainting spells before they passed away.
In mid-1997, the Coxsackie outbreak took the lives of 31 children under 5
years old, with 911 treated at hospitals and clinics.

Two children, a one-year-old girl and a 3-year- old boy, were suspected to
have died from a virus infection at the Miri Hospital recently. They died
shortly after being admitted on 15 & 17 Mar 2000. The health authority
today said it had yet to identify the virus that killed the two children,
adding that a test was being conducted on samples.
Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman said in statement
today that it was not clear whether the deaths were related to the current
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreak in Sarawak or "whether this is
a sporadic event." Dr Abu Bakar also said the two cases were similar to the
29 children who were suspected to have died of heart failure caused by
enterovirus 71 in Sarawak in 1997. "(The) two cases have a similar pattern
to the (4-month-long enterovirus 71) outbreak in 1997 with children dying
of heart failure," he said.
Dr Abu Bakar said doctors, including general practitioners, in Sarawak had
been advised to admit children who had breathing difficulty, fits,
drowsiness, poor feeding and vomiting to hospitals. "Parents are also
advised to co-operate with doctors and not to expose their ailing children
in public places," he added.
Meanwhile, deputy director-general of Health (Public Health) Dr Mohamed
Taha Arif said there had been "a remarkable increase" in the cases of HFMD
in Miri, Bintulu and Marudi [Sarawak this year. He said 317 cases were
registered in Bintulu from 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2000 compared to just one case
in 1999. He said 20 cases had been reported so far in Miri compared to 7
in 1999. Marudi, which did not register any case last year, has recorded 47
cases so far.

[In 1997 the deaths were first attributed to one of the Coxsackie group of
viruses, then to enterovirus type 71 (EV71), & a new virus was also
isolated. Consequently, the reports on ProMED-mail came out with a
confusing variety of titles. The Malaysian authorities are understandably
trying to defuse any panic and are stressing prevention. Whether or not
these deaths are in fact due to HFMD, which is caused by a variety of
enteroviruses, or to something else, the fact is that deaths with symptoms
of viral myocarditis have occurred in association with this HFMD epidemic.
It is hoped that adequate autopsy specimens have been available for
investigation Â– Mod.JW
