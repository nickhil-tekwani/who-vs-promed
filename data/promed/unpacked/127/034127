The serovars involved in human infections in the big Nicaragua outbreak are
still somewhat controversial.
Multiple serovars were involved in the outbreak, with serovar canicola and
something in the Pyrogenes serogroup predominating. There were a total of
four human isolates from the outbreak, two of these are serovar canicola
and the other two are in the Pyrogenes serogroup (probably a new serovar).
The most likely source of canicola was dogs as we isolated a genetically
and serologically indistinguishable organism from 7 of 10 dogs from
households that had human cases. In addition, we isolated canicola from a
mouse and pomona (kennewicki) from a pig in the area.
We did not identify the maintenance host for the Pyrogenes
[serogroup(despite extensive serologic surveys) in the area but the rats
in the area showed a very low incidence of leptospirosis. The lack of
definitive evidence of rat involvement is contrary to all the "hype" about
this outbreak. Millions were spent on rodent control (which is always good
thing) in an effort to stop the outbreak when the most likely source of
infection was dogs.
