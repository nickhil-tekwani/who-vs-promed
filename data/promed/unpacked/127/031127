Sea Lion Deaths May Have Peaked
The total number of New Zealand sea lion pups that have died on the
subantarctic Auckland Islands appears to have peaked, the Department of
Conservation says. DOC-contracted vet Nick Gales reported that there had
only been a slight increase in pup deaths - still at about 48 percent total
mortality of this year's pup production. The main cause of death was now
starvation, not the mystery disease.
DOC marine mammal expert Mike Donoghue said the cause of the mystery deaths
was still unknown. "We hope to hear by next week whether virologists in the
Netherlands have managed to isolate a virus from the samples that were sent
last Friday. If no traces of a virus are found, the search for a causative
agent will then be narrowed down to bacteria and or a biotoxins."

the NZ authorities can report the cause of this epidemic. - Mod.MHJ]
