The Ministry of Health, together with its collaborating laboratory in Atlanta, USA, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would like to inform the general public that investigations into the alleged ''strange disease'' reported in Mubende and Kibaale districts have been concluded.

[Unfortunately, the press release cannot be copied. The following is a summary. - Mod.TY]

As of Thu 9 Aug 2018, the investigating team has listed 23 cases, of which 9 died. Blood samples were taken from 7 suspected cases and tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, where they were negative for Sudan and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses, Marburg, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, Sosuga, and Zika viruses. One sample was positive for _Plasmodium falciparum_, which causes malaria. These samples were also tested at the USA CDC and were negative for all known hemorrhagic fevers; 3 were positive for malaria.

As of now, all patients who were previous isolated have been discharged from the Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.

[Of the samples from 7 patients, 3 were positive for malaria. That leaves 4 patients as undiagnosed. One wonders if these 7 patients reflect the same etiology of the disease of the 16 who were not tested, and especially the 9 who died. If there were postmortem examinations of the 9 who died, the results are not mentioned in the press release. Since the Ministry has declared the outbreak concluded, it seems unlikely that additional studies on the etiologies of the non-malaria patients will be done.

[That a minority of patient samples were positive for malaria is not proof of causation, particularly since the prevalence of even asymptomatic malaria is significant in endemic and holoendemic areas, and the sensitivity of malaria tests is quite high. Thus, the etiology (or etiologies) of this disease cluster remains unanswered, particularly for those cases that were negative for both malaria and a variety of hemorrhagic fever agents. - Mod.LXL
