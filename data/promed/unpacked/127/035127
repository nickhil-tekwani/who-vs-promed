------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Several studies report high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease; however, an important knowledge gap is the vaccine effectiveness against transmission (VET). We present estimates of the VET to household and other close contacts in the Netherlands, from February to May 2021, using contact monitoring data. The secondary attack rate among household contacts was lower for fully vaccinated than unvaccinated index cases (11% vs 31%), with an adjusted VET of 71% (95% confidence interval: 63-77).

An important question when making prognoses of the pandemic in the near future and of the need on non-pharmaceutical control measures is to what extent the vaccines reduce the likelihood of transmission from infected vaccinees. Based on routine contact monitoring data, we here estimate the vaccine effectiveness against transmission (VET) and the vaccine effectiveness against infection (VE) among household and other close contacts of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Netherlands, between 1 Feb and 27 May 2021. The alpha variant (phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.7) was the dominant variant in the area at that time.

Discussion
----------
We estimated a VET of 71% among household contacts of fully vaccinated index cases. Harris et al. found a VET of 40-50% for unvaccinated households contacts [5]. That study mostly included partly vaccinated index cases. A study among household contacts of healthcare workers by Shah et al. found a 30% (after the 1st dose) and 64% (after the 2nd dose) reduction in the risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among household members of vaccinated healthcare workers; however, these healthcare workers were not confirmed as index cases [6].

Martinez-Baz et al. recently estimated VE among 20 961 close contacts of confirmed cases in Spain [7]. In that study, the VE for 2 doses of Comirnaty was 65% (95% CI: 56 to 73) against infection, which is in agreement with our finding of 65% VE for this vaccine. These estimates are lower than VE from other observational post-marketing studies. Possibly, the VE against infection is lower when there is high and prolonged exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which is likely for household contacts of confirmed cases [8]. Of note, Martinez-Baz et al. showed an aVE for Comirnaty of 94% (95% CI: 60 to 99) against hospitalisation among close contacts of confirmed cases.

As the alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 dominated during the study period, an important question is to what extent these VET and VE estimates hold in the context of the delta variant (Pango lineage designation B.1.617.2) which is now dominant in the Netherlands. Also, further research is needed to determine whether the observed differences between the different vaccines are due to the small sample size or have real public health relevance. We will prospectively monitor both VET and VE among household contacts over the next months to address these questions.

Conclusion
----------
Our study showed that the COVID-19 vaccines not only protect the vaccinee against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also offer protection against transmission to close contacts after completing the full schedule. This finding underscores the importance of full vaccination of close contacts of vulnerable persons.

[2] Sturgis motorcycle rally
Date: Sat 7 Aug 2021
Source: NY Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/us/politics/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-covid.html


Although most large events shut down last summer [2020] because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally forged ahead, panicking health experts as nearly a half million motorcycle enthusiasts descended on the Black Hills of South Dakota. This year's [2021] rally, which began on Friday [6 Aug 2021], is expected to draw an even larger crowd, just as the infectious delta variant is producing more new virus cases nationwide than this time last year [2020]. What path the virus will take through Sturgis remains to be seen.

Transmission is more difficult outdoors, vaccines greatly reduce the risk of serious illness, and South Dakota has the fewest new virus cases per capita in the United States. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers delta as contagious as chickenpox, and people are traveling from across the country -- several southern states are in their worst outbreaks of the pandemic -- to a region with a relatively low vaccination rate.

Hundreds of new cases were linked to last year's [2020] rally, but because infected bikers returned to their home states, it made contact tracing difficult and obscured the true tally. Sturgis officials emphasized that this year's [2021] rally would offer coronavirus tests, free masks, and hand sanitizer stations. For the first time, attendees will be allowed to carry alcoholic drinks outside without fear of being fined, in an effort to limit crowds inside bars. Those precautions are being accompanied with warnings. "We are encouraging people who are in a high-risk category, whether it be age or because of comorbidities, that they come next year [2022]," Dan Ainslie, Sturgis's city manager, said.

On Friday [6 Aug 2021], the steady roar of engines signaled the arrival of thousands of bikers. By midmorning, Main Street was jammed with attendees, walking shoulder to shoulder on sidewalks or congregated near dozens of bikes parked outside of businesses. A parade kicked off the 10-day rally, in its 81st year, with the Budweiser Clydesdale horses leading the way.

Other large outdoor events have returned this summer, in part because of the availability of vaccines. Attendees at the recent Lollapalooza music festival, which packed people into downtown Chicago, had to either provide proof of vaccination or show a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. The motorcycle rally in Sturgis will not have a similar screening process. Vaccines will be made available at the event, including the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot, but it takes time for them to strengthen immune systems.

Meade County, which includes Sturgis, has a 37% vaccination rate -- significantly lower than the half of Americans who are fully vaccinated -- and the 6 counties that border it have even lower vaccination rates. "For us, all 100% of the cases have been unvaccinated people," Dr Kurra said of the recent surge. "We want to make sure people have access to testing so that if there's an outbreak, we can catch it early."

About a week before the rally kicked off, bikers from across the country began packing into hotels in Rapid City, said Steven Allender, the city's mayor. Mr Allender said he had been in touch with local health officials about how best to prepare for the influx of visitors, but his office had stopped short of trying to impose any restrictions on the event. "The government tried to help save lives, but it failed because of the political climate and debate" over the use of masks, he said. "I would say today there is no stopping it, that communities across the state have taken an every-man-for-themselves stance."

Late last year [2020], Mr Allender enacted a mask mandate in all city buildings and urged the city council to pass a broader ordinance requiring masks, a measure that ultimately failed. South Dakota was among several states that did not put in place a lockdown or a mandatory mask requirement during the height of the pandemic.

[The country is in better shape to handle SARS CoV-2 infections this year [2021] than last year [2020] when the rally took place, but the potential for a superspreader event is still very high, especially with the low rate of vaccination in Meade County. As crowds go into bars, the chance of such an event increases significantly. - Mod.LK]

[3] Delta variant: urban/rural disparity
Date: Fri 6 Aug 2021
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02146-w


As the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 sweeps across Asia, researchers are increasingly concerned about COVID-19 spreading beyond urban centres to rural regions that were largely spared in earlier waves of the pandemic and have less access to testing, health care, and vaccines.

"If the variants of concern, in particular delta, reach far-flung areas, it will really challenge the health care system," says Cynthia Saloma, a molecular biologist at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City, who heads the Philippine Genome Center. Saloma says so far only a few cases of delta have been sequenced in the Philippines, but the country is preparing for the worst. "The picture that is emerging in our neighbouring countries is really scary. We are all concerned."

Research from India now suggests that during the nation's brutal 2nd wave earlier this year [2021], the virus achieved much greater spread, beyond the urban sprawl, than during the 1st wave of 2020. This year's [2021] surge was largely driven by the delta variant, which first came to scientists' attention in India in December [2020]. "The variant is so much more transmissible, that health systems get overwhelmed with no time to prepare," says Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist at Princeton University, New Jersey, who is based in New Delhi. "The 2nd wave has been absolutely devastating in rural India."

Rural impact in India

From Indonesia and Malaysia to Thailand and Bangladesh, countries across Asia have detected delta in their communities, and many are experiencing their largest outbreaks yet. In Indonesia, where confirmed cases hit 50 000 per day in mid-July [2021], daily deaths have now surpassed 1700. But vaccination rates remain perilously low in many of these nations, leaving them highly vulnerable.

Researchers in India are only beginning to grasp the full scale of their 2nd wave, which hit a peak of 391 000 recorded cases a day in early May [2021], but this data could be crucial for understanding the risk the variant poses to neighbouring nations.

In a nationwide survey of about 28 000 people (2/3 of whom were unvaccinated and had therefore acquired immunity from infection) in June and July this year [2021], researchers found that 68% had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood. This represented a huge increase from the 21% with antibodies, recorded in a similar survey in December 2020 to January 2021, prior to the 2nd wave.

Although the previous survey found higher prevalence in urban areas, the latest estimates saw little difference between the numbers in urban and rural regions, which are home to 65% of India's population. This suggests that infections "have now penetrated very well in rural areas," says Manoj Murhekar, director of the country's National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai, which co-led the June [2021] survey.

The death toll in India has been immense and is probably much higher than official counts (see 'COVID's true toll in India?'). Studies of excess mortality suggest that up to 4.9 million people could have died in India since the pandemic began [1,2], much higher than 425 000, the official number of recorded deaths due to COVID-19. Half of these deaths probably occurred in just 3 months over the 2nd wave, say researchers.

Border regions

Researchers now fear that a similar scenario could engulf many low-income nations -- in Asia and other regions, such as Africa -- that also have large unvaccinated populations in rural regions with limited access to health care.

In Bangladesh, the 1st cases of delta were identified in travellers from India in Dhaka and rural western districts in late April [2021], and since then it has rapidly overtaken other variants. "It is like everything else has just disappeared," says Senjuti Saha, a molecular geneticist at the Child Health Research Foundation in Dhaka. Daily case numbers in Bangladesh have now hit an average of around 14 000, with daily deaths at a high of more than 230. "The numbers are bonkers," says Saha.

Most surprising to her has been the current outbreak's persistence in rural regions. "This totally new population is getting affected, who have been protected for whatever reason all this time," she says. Previous outbreaks in Bangladesh were largely restricted to cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong, despite people frequently travelling from cities of work to their families in rural regions, says Saha. This could be due to the lower population density outside cities and the outdoor lifestyle in those places, she speculates. But in this latest surge, rural regions appear to be no barrier to delta.

Lack of access to healthcare

The trend will make the pandemic much harder to control in Bangladesh, where health care and testing facilities are concentrated in large cities, says Saha.

In Indonesia, which is experiencing a massive 2nd wave, researchers are worried about the spread of COVID-19 to remote parts of the nation. Bimandra Djaafara, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Imperial College London who has modelled the pandemic in Indonesia, worries about a "lack of access to healthcare facilities and oxygen, especially in rural areas and areas outside Java with poorer facilities".

Henry Surendra, an epidemiologist at the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit in Jakarta, is concerned about the risk of death in children in rural regions of Indonesia. In a study [3] last year [2020], he found that about 10% of young children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Jakarta died of the disease. But even before the pandemic, child-mortality rates were higher in rural areas because of malnutrition and diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Children who already had other health problems could be at even higher risk of death from COVID-19, he says.

Charting the spread

Delta has been detected in almost every province in Indonesia and now makes up some 80% of all sequenced samples (see 'Delta's rise in Indonesia'). However, with limited genomic sequencing -- especially in rural areas -- tracking its spread has been challenging, says Safarina Malik, a molecular biologist at the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta.

The large majority of Indonesia's 3900 fully sequenced genomes -- a tiny fraction of the confirmed cases -- are from Jakarta and the surrounding island of Java, with only one sample each from the northeastern provinces of Maluku Utara and Papua Barat. Sending samples to Java for sequencing can be tricky, says Malik, as airlines sometimes refuse to carry live virus.

Other nations have even more limited sequencing. In Bangladesh, for example, some 2000 samples have been sequenced. Delta accounted for 89% of the 203 samples collected since June [2021], says Marufur Rahman, a molecular biologist and physician at the Center for Medical Biotechnology in Dhaka. Delta has been isolated in 43 of 64 districts but has likely extended beyond these regions, as samples are not collected from all districts, says Rahman.

The delta variant isn't the only reason for the pandemic's spread beyond urban centres, say researchers. Djaafara found that strict travel restrictions in Indonesia during Ramadan and Eid in 2020 helped to contain the spread of COVID-19 to rural parts of Java [4]. But cases were higher, and movement was much less restricted during this year's Eid holidays in July [2021], he says. In Bangladesh, too, a huge number of people this year [2021] travelled for the Eid holidays despite restrictions, says Rahman.

Vaccine gap

In Bangladesh, close to 6% of the population has received at least one dose of vaccine. In the Philippines, that figure is 11%. Indonesia has vaccinated some 17%, but most doses have gone to the more populated islands of Java and Bali, and getting doses to the nation's thousands of smaller islands will be logistically difficult, say researchers.

Malaysia, where there are more than 16 000 new cases of COVID-19 each day, is in a slightly better position. Yoke-Fun Chan, a virologist at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, says the country is "aggressively vaccinating": so far, 45% of its population is partially or fully vaccinated. "Rather than looking for the virus, now we are looking for solutions to stop the virus," she says.

Although India serves as a warning to nations with large rural and remote populations, cities remain at risk across the developing world, too. In Indonesia, "the concern is not only that it could reach rural areas, but also what is happening in the big cities", says Malik.

In May [2021], Thailand detected its 1st cases of the delta variant in Bangkok. Numbers have since surged to new heights, spilling to cities nationwide. Part of the reason Thailand was able to maintain relatively low case numbers in previous waves of the pandemic is "because most of the outbreaks were not in Bangkok," says Surakameth Mahasirimongkol, director of the departments of medical life sciences and genomic medicine at Thailand's Ministry of Public Health. But delta has now arrived in the heart of the capital and is proving very difficult to contain, he says.
