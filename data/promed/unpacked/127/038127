In the wake of a tiger in a New York zoo testing positive for Covid-19 recently, the death of 13 cats in Mananthavady last week has created panic among villagers of Lakshamveedu Colony, Kaniyaram and Kuzhinilam under Mananthavady Municipality [see comment]. In Lakshamveedu and Kuzhinilam areas, 10 and 3 cats were found dead, respectively.

However, in the primary investigation, the district veterinary epidemiologist confirmed that the cause of death was feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), also commonly referred to as feline distemper, a life-threatening viral disease in the cat population.

"The deaths were reported last Saturday, and we have taken samples, and they have been sent to the Regional Veterinary Clinical Laboratory, Kannur. This virus disease spreads during the summer season, and there is a vaccine to prevent it. But stray cats usually are not vaccinated," said Dr Dilip Phalgunan, district veterinary epidemiologist.

He further added that there was nothing to be scared of. "The only reported Covid-19 positive case in New York was spread through direct human patient contact. Such a scenario is not present in Wayanad district right now. If some quarantined people have pet cats, in case, we have directed them to avoid contact with the animals," explained Dr Dilip. The symptoms of FPV are diarrhoea, respiratory problems and weight loss.

[Feline panleukopenia (FP) is a highly contagious viral disease of cats caused by the feline parvovirus. The disease, also called feline distemper or feline parvo, was in the past a leading cause of death in cats. Today, it is an uncommon disease in industrialized countries, due mainly to the availability and use of effective vaccines. Vaccination is equally important for strictly indoor cats as well as indoor/outdoor cats because the virus is everywhere in the environment. Most young kittens receive their 1st vaccination when 6-8 weeks of age; follow-up vaccines are given until the kitten is around 16 weeks of age. Adult vaccination schedules vary with the age and health of the cat, as well as the risk of FP in the area. AVMA's information on FP is available at https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/feline-panleukopenia; see Ref. 1 for an updated review.

Cases of COVID-19 infection in cats and other felids have been sporadically recorded during the evolving pandemic. The domestic cats got, reportedly, infected from their clinically-affected owners. Some detail follows.

By the end of March [2020], the cat of a woman with COVID-19 tested positive in Belgium (see ProMED post 20200327.7151215). This cat presented clinical signs: diarrhea, vomiting and difficulty breathing. A few days later, a cat in Hong Kong, owned by a COVID-19 infected patient, also tested positive (post 20200403.7179945), although in this case no clinical signs were detected.

A 4-year-old female Malayan tiger with respiratory signs living at the Bronx Zoo was found infected on 3 Apr 2020. The swabs yielded presumptive positive results that were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory. One other Malayan tiger, 2 Amur tigers and 3 African lions reportedly developed respiratory signs over the course of a week characterized by a dry cough and in some cases wheezing, but no dyspnea or nasal or ocular discharge. Mild anorexia was noted in some cases; no laboratory tests were attempted/known to have been applied (see 20200406.7191352).

A recent experiment carried out in China, so far published as a pre-print (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1), found that cats and ferrets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal inoculation develop active infection, replicating efficiently. Moreover, in cats it was shown that the virus can be transmitted via droplets, as sentinel cats housed next to infected ones also became infected. Dogs, pigs and birds, on the contrary, proved to be poor hosts, with limited replication.

On 17 Apr 2020, 2 cats, reportedly exhibiting respiratory signs, owned by COVID-19 patients, were reported as suspected following initial PCR testing. Confirmation from NVSL, to which samples were said to be submitted, has not yet become available (20200418.7240811).

The COVID-19 panic among the villagers of Lakshamveedu, in Kerala's northeastern district Wayanad, can be understood in view of the global impact of the pandemic; however, it could have been excluded before establishing the FP diagnosis. The disease which affected the cats in the region was lethal, compared to the (admittedly, few) known COVID-19 cases in domestic cats elsewhere, in particular in view of Kerala's encouraging COVID-19 situation (as of 19 Apr 2020, a total of 2 deaths), as covered at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Kerala#Hotspot_districts (please refer to the table presenting details from Wayanad).
