In late September 2012, a pediatric department in a Central Copenhagen Hospital notified Statens Serum Institut (SSI) of 4 cases of hemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This led to the initiation of an outbreak investigation.

HUS and infections with verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) [VTEC and STEC are terms to describe _E. coli_ producing Shiga toxin, ProMED is now using the term enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ for these organisms - Mod.LL] are individually notifiable in Denmark. Furthermore, EHEC infections are laboratory-notifiable. Around 180 cases are reported each year, of which serogroup O157 constitute 15-20 percent (1). Previously, Denmark has experienced only 2 general outbreaks of EHEC infection. In 2006, an outbreak of EHEC O157 affected 25 cases, with organic pasteurized milk as the source (2). In 2007, an outbreak of EHEC O26 affected 20 cases, with an organic fermented beef sausage as the source (3). In addition, Denmark reported 26 cases during the large EHEC O104 outbreak in Germany in 2011 (4). The annual numbers of HUS cases in Denmark range from 2 to 6 (1). Subtyping of toxin genes are done at SSI as described in (5).

Outbreak investigation
-----------------
For this outbreak, we defined a confirmed case as an individual with a laboratory-confirmed infection with EHEC O157 eae, vtx1a, and vtx2a diagnosed after 1 Aug 2012, or a person diagnosed with HUS in the same time period and a serology-confirmed EHEC O157 infection. A probable case was a person without laboratory-confirmed EHEC infection, diagnosed with HUS after 1 Aug 2012, or a person diagnosed with EHEC O157 infection in the same period, but without subtyping, or a person diagnosed with EHEC eae, vtx1a, and vtx2a infection in the same period but without O-typing. The date 1 Aug 2012 was chosen in order to identify any early cases.

On 22 Oct 2012, after laboratory confirmation of EHEC O157 in 2 patients, SSI notified Danish clinical laboratories of a possible EHEC outbreak to increase case ascertainment and reporting. We interviewed patients (or their parents for children under 15 years of age) by telephone, using a structured trawling questionnaire. Early investigations had pointed to ground beef as the possible outbreak source, and information on purchase dates and other possible labeling information of ground beef was collected and presented to the supermarkets for further tracing of possible batch identification. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration traced back the ground beef.

SSI performed live-slide agglutination on the submitted isolates upon arrival, and all EHEC O157-positive isolates were typed immediately with the PCR protocol for subtyping of vtx genes (5). Further testing included conventional (and confirmatory) O:H serotyping, Vero cell assay, fermentation of sorbitol, production of beta-glucuronidase, presence of additional virulence genes by dot blot hybridization and/or PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We asked patients who were culture-negative for EHEC O157 to submit a serum specimen for serology testing for antibodies against EHEC O157.

Findings
-------
We identified 13 cases of EHEC O157 (11 confirmed and 2 probable). Eight cases had HUS. The cases belonged to 9 families. Eleven reported symptoms, whereas 2 were diagnosed when we screened healthy family members. Date of disease onset ranged from 18 Sep to 28 Oct 2012 (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The cases were distributed throughout the country; 8 were female, and the median age was 14 years (range: 3-68 years).

Hypothesis-generating interviews suggested that the source of the outbreak was food served in the households. Most affected families had young children, ate traditional (non-vegetarian) Danish food, and lived in provincial towns. The most frequent food exposure reported was ground beef: all cases had eaten ground beef during the incubation period, 6 in the form of pan-fried ground beef ("hakkeboffer"). Two households mentioned the beef still being red in the center when eaten. No other food items were common to all cases. The families had purchased food in a variety of different supermarket chains. Trace-back of the beef indicated that it was of Danish origin and narrowed the possibilities down to 2 major Danish slaughterhouses and to 2 consecutive slaughter days. However, identification of a single food producer was impossible, and no further action was taken.

We compared interview information from the current outbreak with that of a salmonella outbreak occurring in 2011 in the same months (to account for possible changes in eating habits with the seasons) (6), where a comparable hypothesis-generating questionnaire was used. The families involved in the 2012 EHEC outbreak reported similar frequencies of consumption as the 2011 salmonella cases for almost all food items. However, all 9 case-families in the 2012 EHEC outbreak reported eating ground beef, compared with 14 of 24 case-families in the salmonella outbreak (p=0.03; Fisher's exact-test).

The outbreak strain was a typical EHEC O157:H7, eae positive, non-sorbitol fermenting, negative for beta-glucuronidase. However, it had a rare toxin subtype profile including the genes vtx1a and vtx2a. All strains had the same PFGE profile, which had not been reported previously among Danish EHEC isolates. The Table [for table, see original URL - Mod.LL] shows the distribution of the total number of EHEC O157 cases diagnosed and sub-typed in Denmark from 1997 to 2012, stratified by toxin profile. For each toxin profile, the proportion of cases with HUS is shown. EHEC infections containing the vtx2a toxin profile were associated with a higher number of HUS cases (from 3 percent to above 20 percent), and EHEC infections containing the eae + vtx1a + vtx2a profile were associated with even higher frequencies of HUS cases (33 percent).

Discussion
---------
The present outbreak represents the 1st food-borne outbreak of a highly virulent EHEC O157 in Denmark. Subtyping of the toxin genes allowed rapid identification and classification of cases. In addition, toxin subtyping was of relevance for the overall risk assessment. The combination of vtx1a and vtx2a in the toxin profile of the outbreak strain is rare and appears to be associated with a high risk of progression to HUS, as also indicated by previously subtyped EHEC O157 strains. This emphasises that within the EHEC O157 group, there is a diversity of strains with different potential of causing HUS.

As a surrogate for an analytical epidemiological investigation, we compared case exposure to ground beef with similar exposure in a recent salmonella outbreak. This case-case comparison suggested that more families than expected had consumed ground beef in the present outbreak. In addition, these families had prepared it in a way that allowed for part of the beef to remain uncooked. This suggests that this outbreak was caused by ground beef, a common source of EHEC outbreaks. Ground beef has a short shelf life (7 days), which may have limited the size of this outbreak. If the vehicle of the outbreak had been a food item with longer shelf life, the public health impact of this high risk HUS-associated EHEC outbreak could have been much larger.

Based on the findings of this outbreak, we suggest performing toxin subtyping in similar outbreak situations in order to quickly identify high risk EHEC strains and thereby aid risk assessment of the outbreak.

[The Shiga (or Vero) cytotoxin is responsible for much of the disease caused by enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and is encoded on a lambdoid bacteriophage. The phage forms stable lysogens in EHEC, and toxin is produced following induction of the lytic cycle of the phage replication, which can occur spontaneously or in response to a variety of stressors including many antimicrobials.

The toxin belongs to a family of protein toxins that contain one enzymatically active A moiety and 5 nontoxic B moieties that bind to the trisaccharide part of the glycosphingolipid Gb3 (1). An outbreak with a higher amount of HUS as a complication of EHEC as described here can be produced by several mechanisms, including:

1. A particular Shiga toxin genotype may be more cytotoxic by virtue of a hyperactive A component or better receptor binding of its B subunits.
2. Overexpression of the Shiga toxin, especially type 2 (2).
3. Enhanced exposure of the toxin-producing organism to the colon lining, as appeared to have occurred in the 2011 large Northern Germany-centered outbreak of the chimeric toxin-producing _E. coli_ O104:H4 that had genetic characteristics of both EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (3)

Additionally, individuals may be more susceptible to complications of EHEC by expressing more receptor on target cells.
