At least 13 people in 8 states have died after eating cantaloupe
contaminated with _Listeria_ [_monocytogenes_], in the deadliest
outbreak of foodborne illness in the United States in more than a
decade, public health officials said on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011]. Many of
the deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to
the aggressive pathogen.

The cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which
issued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a
type marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in
Colorado, were sold around the country.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that
since the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had
fallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New
Mexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health
officials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being
part of the outbreak.

Officials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least
2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium
that can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very
young, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can
also cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have
so far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or
stillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times
as likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe
infection, according to the CDC.

John N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,
said that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,
like diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable
categories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the
gastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,
leading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that
reason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher
than with other forms of foodborne bacteria.

William Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne
illness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly
simply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.
Sometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food
that drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got
a lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.

The outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States
attributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of
deaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the
early 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then
occurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style
fresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52
deaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time
put the number as high as 84.

The 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at
least 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis
outbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put
the death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.

With the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford
cantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with
salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia
company, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew
a large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more
than 700.

The huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.
coli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50
people.

_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,
decaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called
_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to
food in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis
outbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The
majority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.

It can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to
fall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food
that carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also
grows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to
eliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.

The Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the
bacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's
packinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area
store. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination
occurred.

The FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including
cantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be
scrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with
a clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.

Dr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with
media that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of
_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also
confirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.

Both of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,
but 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also
suspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory
tests.

The CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to
premature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health
problems.

The CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to
increase, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to
2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.

The _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.

In this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of
_Listeria_ to melons of the "Rocky Ford" variety grown by Jensen Farms
in Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a
higher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of
Colorado during the late 1800's.

The state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the
refrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples
obtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen
Farms.

Jensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it
says were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to
Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,
Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

They carry stickers that say either, "Product of USA - Frontera
Produce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford" or "Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky
Fords."

Anyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is
advised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.

Additionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --
even inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may
have had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who
are at high risk.

The FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference
call, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to
cantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade
were connected to salmonella or a virus.

The worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced
back to Mexican-style cheese.

The FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an
environmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that
work, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,
and the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any
conclusions.

A couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because
of the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,
they are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and
sold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to
fall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug
2011.

In the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated
with _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible
for [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable
for having sold "food which was defective and not reasonably safe."

If you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department
of Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.

Anyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at
1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.

If in doubt, throw it out. Unless you can be sure of the source of
that cantaloupe in your kitchen, it's best to toss it. That's the word
from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is
trying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US
history.

So far, there are 72 reported cases of listeriosis linked to tainted
cantaloupes, and 13 deaths. State and local officials say they are
investigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll
could rise, according to the Associated Press.

The tainted melons that triggered the multi-state listeriosis outbreak
have been traced to Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado.

"If it's not Jensen farms, it's okay to eat," Dr Thomas Frieden, CDC
director, said in a media conference call today [28 Sep 2011]. "But if
you can't confirm that it's not Jensen farms, then it's best to throw
it out."

Some of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC
has been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the
affected melons.

This outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said
the CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also
participated in the media alert. "To date there's 72 cases and 13
deaths... We do expect that the number of cases will increase."

The single largest listeriosis outbreak occurred in 1985, and was
traced to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured by Jalisco Mexican
Products Inc. of Artesia. It killed at least 40 people, and also ranks
as one of the biggest food-contamination cases in California history.

Cantaloupes can rot within 2 weeks or so, and go bad even faster once
they've been sliced open. The cantaloupes at the center of this
outbreak -- first flagged on 12 Sep 2011 -- are nearing the outer edge
of their shelf life, making it less likely they will be eaten with
each passing day.

[Cantaloupes are said to have a shelf life of 2 weeks or so. Since
Jensen Farms, the source of the contaminated melons, voluntarily
recalled these melons, which it says were shipped between 29 Jul and
10 Sep 2011, there should not be many more of these melons being
eaten. However, because the incubation period of listeriosis can be up
to a month or more, there may be more cases, deaths, miscarriages, or
stillbirths reported in the future due to consumption of these
_Listeria_-contaminated melons. - Mod.ML]
