The Bauchi State Government has said that 95 butchers in the state have been infected with an animal-related disease known as brucellosis. The Deputy Director, Veterinary Services, Bauchi State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr Istifanus Irimiya, who disclosed this in Bauchi [Fri 9 Feb 2018] in an interview with journalists, added that the figure was out of the 224 butchers from Bauchi, Misau, and Katagum Local Government Areas where they tested positive in a laboratory screening.

He explained that brucellosis could be transmitted from ruminants to human beings particularly butchers, herdsmen, and veterinarians who interact with animals. According to him, "The disease is transmitted through consumption of unboiled milk, meat, raw meat, blood of the infected animals, as well as lack of proper sanitation and hygiene.

[As this is the report of a serosurvey, it is unclear how many of those antibody-positive butchers had symptoms consistent with brucellosis. - Mod.LL
