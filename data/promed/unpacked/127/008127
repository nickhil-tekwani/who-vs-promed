CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (12)
=============================
There is an enormous earlier literature on heat stability of scrapie
preparations. Considerable variation with strain (some reported more
heat stable than others, a lot of work in the 1960's by Alan Dickinson
at Moredun in Scotland, among others), and especially composition of
the preparation (infectivity much more heat-stable in crude brain
extracts, with all that protein (or whatever) than in more "purified"
preparations). The received wisdom was that, in crude preparations,
scrapie could withstand standard (15 min) autoclaving (of course,
perhaps 1 or 2 logs infectivity -- 90 or 99% -- would be lost, but if
you start with 10^8, or 10^7 infectious doses/g, then 10^5 is still a
substantial amount of infectivity).
It was generally assumed that 1 hr autoclaving would reduce
infectivity to undetectable levels (and, of course, there were some
"strains" and preparations that were far less heat stable, but one
only heard about the most stable). So all those hours of cooking,
as Jack suggests, MIGHT do it too (stew's the word for it, though).
Don't know if it was ever tested with BSE, but at least you know now
what you have to do to make your lamb stew safe.
Re the rendering processes, heat has an effect, but these agents are
fairly sensitive to lipid solvents (also to Clorox), far more than to
heat, so it was probably the change in solvent extraction procedures
to use less solvent (a result of price increases due to the oil
shortage in the 1970's -- anybody remember this?) that was most
significant.
