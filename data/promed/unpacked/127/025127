Three more suspected cases of swine fever were being investigated by
Government veterinarians last night, 2 of them more than a 100 miles from
the source of the outbreak in the east of England.
Tests were being carried out on pigs in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and near
Macclesfield, Cheshire. The first 2 farms are known to have connections
with BPQ, one of Britain's main pig breeding companies. All 5 confirmed
outbreaks, in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, were on farms linked to the company.
If the spread of the disease is confirmed, it will plunge the pig industry
deeper into crisis and destroy farmers' hopes of persuading the European
Commission to water down the export ban it imposed on Monday on live pigs
and semen from England.
Scientists will know within 48 hours whether the virulent disease, which
threatens about 7.5 million pigs throughout the country, has spread. So
far, between 10 500 and 12 000 pigs have been destroyed in an attempt to
contain the disease in the east of England since it was confirmed there
early last week.

An outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) may be spreading, it was feared
last night.
Farmers in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire reported to veterinarians
at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) their pigs were
showing signs of the disease. Until tests were completed, MAFF said, it
would be impossible to know whether the disease has spread.
Two of the farms in Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, however, are linked to
farms in East Anglia already having confirmed cases. There are about 12
reports every year of the disease but tests always prove negative. The last
confirmed cases before the present outbreak were 14 years ago. The latest
reports of CSF may be explained by farmers' fear of the disease resulting
in closer examination of livestock and seeing disease where none exists.
Scotland is to close the border with England to pig sales for the first
time after being granted immunity from the ban. The directive, which
recognises Scotland as a separate farming entity to England for the first
time, applies only to the "England region of the United Kingdom".
Government vets have so far identified 5 infected farms in Norfolk, Suffolk
and Essex. All 10 500 pigs on these farms have been slaughtered and
surveillance zones established around them.
Pigs are produced in a 3-tier farming system. They are born on breeding
units, transferred as piglets to nursery units and then taken to
"fattening" units. In this outbreak, the breeding unit in Norfolk and 4 of
the 7 nursery units it supplied have confirmed cases. These nursery units
in turn supplied 8 fattening units, which are being carefully monitored.
No cases have so far been confirmed at any of these fattening units. If no
further cases emerge by the end of this week, pressure will begin to ease.
Farmers will be paid the market price for each infected animal and up to 50
percent of the value of pigs slaughtered as a precautionary measure,
according to EU compensation rules. Mr Campbell said, however, he would be
looking for Government help over and above the statutory EU compensation
package.
The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) said last year Britain exported 155
000 pigs to other EU countries in a trade worth about BPS12.5 million. Phil
Saunders, MLC spokesman, said: "If the ban goes on for any length of time
it will certainly not be useful and the longer it goes on the worse it will
be." CSF is not dangerous for humans, but is lethal to pigs and highly
contagious. If not controlled by the most rigorous possible regime, it
could spread throughout Britain's 7 million-strong pig population.
Bulgaria has banned imports of live pigs, pork and pig offal from the UK,
following the outbreak of CSF. The ban does not apply to products that have
gone through thermal processing, however.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced it is to
put on hold all shipments of live pigs and swine products from Britain
following an outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF), the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported on Wednesday.
Canada would follow the U.S. lead in banning both live pigs and pork
imports, the BBC said after interviewing a U.S. Official.
It was not clear what would happen to pork products currently on their way
to North America.
Some 12 000 pigs have been destroyed in England since the outbreak of the
disease was announced last week, and the European Union (EU) has banned all
exports of live English pigs and pig semen.
Pork exports are as yet not affected by this ban.
