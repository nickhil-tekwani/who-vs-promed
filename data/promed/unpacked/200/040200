Comment: Possible Shortage of Bifurcated Needles
------------------------------------------------
Were bifurcated needles used for the smallpox diluted vaccine trial? Would
the proportion of takes be as high with cascade-trained staff using
conventional hypodermic needles?
Donald Henderson's chapter "Smallpox and Vaccinia" (Vaccines, 3rd edition,
Plotkin & Orenstein, 1999) states that "The vaccine is inoculated
intradermally with use of a bifurcated needle", and the Acambis website
includes a press release "Award of major contract for smallpox vaccine from
US CDC" (20 Sep 2000) which states that "OraVax will also supply complete
immunization kits for use of the vaccine including the bifurcated needles
necessary for vaccine administration."
The supply and distribution of bifurcated needles may be an issue for
countries with old stocks of vaccine if these are not held as complete
immunisation kits. Second, in an outbreak situation in countries with smaller
stocks than the US, vaccinees (including key workers) might wish to transmit
vaccinia virus from themselves to unvaccinated household members. A shortage
of bifurcated needles should be anticipated and planned for.

Aventis Pasteur Discovers Forgotten Stockpile of Smallpox Vaccine
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A pharmaceutical company has discovered 70 to 90 million doses of smallpox
vaccine in its freezers, instantly increasing the known U.S. inventory of the
vaccine 6-fold and ensuring the nation an adequate supply in the event of a
bioterrorist attack, according to government sources familiar with the find.
The immediate impact of the discovery is to buy time for the federal
government and its pharmaceutical contractors, which together have been
racing to produce tens of millions of smallpox vaccine doses as part of the
new biodefense initiative. Companies will be able use that cushion of time to
fine-tune some of the new vaccine candidates under development, instead of
rushing effective but perhaps less-than-perfect vaccines into production as
an emergency stopgap measure.
"It's a great insurance policy," said D.A. Henderson, Director of the newly
created federal Office of Health Preparedness. The liquid vaccine doses were
produced by Aventis Pasteur of Lyon, France, which has its U.S. operations in
Swiftwater, Pa. The vaccine has been stored in freezers since it was made
decades ago, sources said. It remained unclear yesterday why its existence
had gone undiscovered for so long, exactly when it was discovered or by whom.
Sources said the company is negotiating with the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) with the goal of giving the U.S. government access to
the supply. Among the issues to be worked out are how much money, if any,
would change hands in the transaction, and the extent to which the company
may be relieved of liability should problems with the vaccine arise. Calls to
Aventis were referred to HHS, which volunteered few details. "There are legal
things that still need to be finalized," said HHS spokesman Bill Hall. HHS
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson hopes to settle the deal before next week, Hall
said. "Until then, our hands are tied."
A global vaccination effort rid the world of naturally occurring smallpox in
1977, after which the vaccine fell out of production. But a few vials of
[virulent smallpox virus were saved in the United States and the Soviet
Union. Some experts fear that small amounts of the highly infectious agent
may have fallen into terrorist hands. The possibility that smallpox might
reemerge as an agent of terror recently inspired U.S. health officials to
take stock of existing vaccine supplies. That inventory concluded that the
nation has about 15.4 million doses, barely enough to deal with an attack on
a major city or two. The federal government contracted with various companies
to make more of the standard vaccine and to begin work on new and safer
versions. But no one knows whether the goal of producing 155 million new
doses this year is reachable, and even that would leave the nation far short.
At the same time, in an effort to make more with less, federal scientists
have been diluting samples of existing stocks and testing them to see if they
are still potent. U.S. health officials have said in recent weeks that
studies involving 5-fold and 10-fold dilutions are looking very promising.
Final results of those tests are to be released today [Thu 28 Mar 2002. But
even a 10-fold expansion of the previously documented 15.4 million doses
would produce only half the doses needed to vaccinate every American. That
shortage is more than covered by the Aventis discovery.
The Aventis vaccine is essentially identical to the previously inventoried
vaccine, which was made by Wyeth and went by the name Dryvax. Both were grown
from the same seed stock of vaccinia virus, a virus so similar to smallpox
virus [variola virus that it primes the immune system against both. The key
difference between the 2 products is that Dryvax is stored as freeze-dried
powder, which must be reconstituted by adding a liquid diluent, whereas the
Aventis product was reconstituted and then frozen in its liquid form. Ongoing
studies strongly suggest that the Aventis product is fully potent, according
to one government scientist familiar with the work. Indeed, the official
said, it's likely that the Aventis product can itself be diluted 5-fold if
necessary, creating far more doses than would be needed in this nation even
in the face of a full-blown bioterrorist attack. That does not mean it will
be easy to defend against such an attack or that deaths would be rare.
The vaccine must be given within a few days after exposure to smallpox,
posing a logistical nightmare if outbreaks were to occur in several locations
simultaneously. Smallpox has historically killed about a third of those it
infects. Another problem is that both the Wyeth and Aventis vaccines can be
deadly in people whose immune systems are suppressed by AIDS or other
diseases or as a result of their taking drugs for cancer or organ
transplantation. In fact, such patients are at risk of life-threatening
vaccinia virus infection simply by coming in contact with others who have
been vaccinated, since live viruses are shed from the injection site on the
arm. The discovery of the extra doses could escalate an already heated debate
over the wisdom of vaccinating doctors, public health workers and
other "first responders," a strategy that some have proposed as a way of
ensuring that key personnel would be protected in the event of a covert
attack. One expert yesterday expressed concern that the discovery of the
added doses, while reassuring, might lead to a federal decision to offer
prophylactic vaccination before a careful analysis of such a program's
scientific and social impact is conducted.

[The curious rediscovery of this additional quantity of smallpox vaccine in
Lyon (or where ever) is unexplained. The lack of detail may reflect some
reluctance on the part of the EU to release this material and to retain an
amount for the protection of the European population. - Mod.CP
