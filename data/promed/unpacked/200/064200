Six Romanians in hospital with anthrax -- edited
-------------------------------------------------
BUCHAREST, May 5 (Reuters) - Six people in northeastern Romania are being
treated in hospital for anthrax, state news agency Rompres said on Friday.
It said local authorities in the town of Buzau had ordered an investigation
into the outbreak. Preliminary investigations indicated it had been
transmitted to humans by sheep, it said. The medical staff who came first
into contact with the patients, now recovering in the Buzau hospital, had
been banned from entering the hospital again for seven days, it said.

[The report quoted an epidemiologist by name, whom out of a desire to not
embarrass a professional colleague will remain anonymous, but I must point
out that anthrax is not a contagious disease. The medical staff should not
have been put on forced medical leave for that reason. The disease is
enzootic in Romania with cattle, pigs and sheep cases reported regularly as
well as the occasional human case. Such human cases usually follow from the
shade-tree slaughtering and butchering of sick or dead animals. Anyone with
more detailed and hard information is asked to share it with us. - Mod. MHJ]
