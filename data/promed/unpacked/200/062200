MUSEUM EXHIBIT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE: REQUEST FOR INFO
******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: brickman@amnh.org (marla)

I am the content coordinator for an exhibition on infectious disease that
is being produced by the American Museum of Natural History in New York
City and will go on display in this museum in the early spring of 1999. It
will then become a traveling exhibit and will show at various venues for
several years. The exhibition is going to focus on the natural history of
infectious disease, specifically putting infectious disease into an
ecological and environmental context.
We are at a stage in the development of this exhibit that we need to start
collecting photos for use in the exhibit as graphic panels, in videos, or
in computer interactives, as well as for references for the development of
dioramas and other design elements that will go into the exhibit, and for
promotional materials related to the exhibit.
Images that we are looking for include:
Images of microbes that cause infectious disease and how these organisms
are studied in various parts of the world, from high level containment labs
to field settings; images of lab notes or field notes
Images that show treatment of people, worldwide, who are ill--hospitals,
clinics, at home
Public Health Posters
Images that show how humans affect the patterns of disease via global
travel and trade, impact on environments, urbanization, war
Since we are making every attempt to tell the global story of infectious
disease, we are especially in need of images from South America, Africa,
Asia and the Middle East. It is our hope to put a human face on infectious
disease and therefore images of how families are affected by disease and
how they cope with illness are especially requested.
We would like to hear from anyone who may own images that are relevant to
the listing above, and we welcome suggestions for places to go to obtain
these types of images. Any image used in the exhibit would be accompanied
by a credit line identifying the source of the image.
If you have further questions or concerns, please so not hesitate to
contact me.
