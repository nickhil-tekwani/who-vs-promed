[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 5 Sep 2011
remains 172. A total of 3 definite/probable patients remain alive, so
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases is 175.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and now 2 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 5 Sep 2011], there have been 108 referrals,
49 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS, 6 cases of familial
CJD, 2 cases of vCJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2841 referrals, 1264
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 172 cases of vCJD, 89 cases of familial
CJD, 67 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 44 cases of GSS.

confirmed fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one of familial CJD, and none
of iatrogenic CJD, or vCJD.

A total of 25 fatal cases of confirmed or probable vCJD have been
recorded in France since records began in 1992. There was one case in
1996, one in 2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, 2 in 2009, and there have been none in 2010 and

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 19 Aug 2011, and totals overall since 1996

During the 1st 8 months of 2011, there have been 216 referrals, 134 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 105 fatal
cases of sporadic CJD, 21 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD
or vCJD.

Overall, 4126 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending (but vCJD excluded in 8
cases or inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in
achieving unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 15-year period, a total of 2441 prion disease cases have
been screened, a figure which includes 18 cases with type
determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall, there were 2068 cases of sporadic CJD, 356 cases of
familial CJD, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases and in Saudi Arabia in the
other.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) biannual update (2011)
---------------------------------------
This 6-monthly report provides an update on reports of incidents of
potential iatrogenic (healthcare-acquired) exposure to CJD, and on the
National Anonymous Tonsil Archive. The data are correct as of 12 Jul
2011.

[Only conclusions are communicated here. Interested readers should
consult the original document via the source URL to view the full
text, tabulated data and figures.

For numbers of CJD case reports, readers should consult data provided
by the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU),
Edinburgh (http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm). The latest yearly
analysis of vCJD reports (onsets and deaths) is also available from
the NCJDRSU website (http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/cjdq68.pdf). - Mod.CP]

Reports of incidents of potential iatrogenic exposure to CJD via
surgery: 2000 to 30 Jun 2011
-----------------------------
A surgical incident occurs when a patient with or at increased risk of
CJD has undergone surgery without the appropriate infection control
guidance being followed [3]. This could happen if a patient undergoes
surgery during the incubation period of CJD, or because information
about CJD risk factors is not available at the time of surgery. If
this happens, surgical instruments that may be contaminated with the
infectious agent that causes CJD could pose a transmission risk when
they are re-used on other patients.

In June 2010, the CJD Incidents Panel changed its protocol for
reporting surgical incidents, and a new reporting algorithm was
published on the HPA CJD Section website. Under the new protocol, only
CJD cases (or patients at increased risk of CJD) who have undergone
surgical procedures which are thought to pose a possible transmission
risk (i.e. within the likely infectious incubation period and
involving medium or high risk procedures) are categorised as "surgical
incidents." Other procedures, either earlier in the incubation period
or involving low infectivity tissues, are categorised as "CJD
Reports."

Current at risk patients resulting from surgical instruments

There are 12 surgical incidents in which 141 patients are still
considered to be at increased risk of CJD. Currently, 119 of these "at
risk" patients have been notified that they are at increased risk of
CJD. Local decisions have been taken not to notify 4 patients in these
incidents.

Six-monthly update on the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive: end of
July 2011

The National Anonymous Tonsil Archive (NATA) was set up in 2004 to
prospectively collect 100 000 tonsils pairs obtained after routine
tonsillectomies in England and Scotland and to test these samples for
abnormal prion protein. Only tissue not required for patient care,
which would normally be discarded, is collected. Tonsils are tested
for abnormal prion protein by 2 commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs),
and a small proportion selected for other analytical tests. Initial
results from analysis of 63 007 of the tonsil samples indicated that
all tonsils were negative so far for the detection of PrPCJD protein
[5].

Up to the end of July 2011, NATA has received a total of 94 611 tonsil
pairs from hospitals in England and Scotland, about 17 849 of which
are from the birth cohort in which most vCJD cases have arisen
(1961-1985). A further 3000 tonsil pairs have been received from the
Medical Research Council Prion Unit at the UCL Institute for
Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.
Therefore, the total number of tonsil pairs in the archive as at the
end of July 2011 was 96 949. The number of collection forms that were
completed but where no tonsil tissue was collected was 2541 (1663 due
to patient objection and 878 due to clinical pathology being
requested).

[5] vCJD blood test
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2011
Source: eSCOPE, TSENews [edited]
http://escope.prionics.com/issue/2011-august-2/


The incidence of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) cases in
cattle has declined, but the risk of contracting the human form of
BSE, vCJD, remains a serious threat. In addition to eating
contaminated beef, the disease can be transmitted also from one human
being to another through organ and tissue transplantations and blood
transfusions. The latter harbors an extreme potential risk, since
blood from one donor can infect multiple receivers. Recent research
has demonstrated that sensitive detection of prions in blood is
possible. Using a combination of Prionics antibody 15B3 and prion
amplification, the blood test is 10 000 times more sensitive than
previously reported assays.

Prion diseases are caused by aberrantly folded prion proteins that
accumulate in the brain, resulting in serious brain damage. Several
scientific groups have reported long incubation times for vCJD before
clinical symptoms appear. Therefore, an individual incubating vCJD can
donate blood and spread the disease to multiple receivers. As low
levels of prions are expected to be present in the blood of vCJD
patients, sensitive detection of disease-specific prion proteins is of
great importance for the safety of human blood donations. A recent
publication by the group of Byron Caughey describes a new and very
sensitive method for the detection of disease-specific prion proteins
in blood or plasma. This eQuIC assay uses amplification of prions
together with a concentration step using the Prionics 15B3 antibody.

The monoclonal 15B3 antibody (mAb 15B3), developed by Prionics, has
been shown to specifically recognize the disease-specific form of the
prion protein (PrPSc). In the publication of Caughey and his group
[abstract reproduced below], the mAb 15B3 was used to "fish" PrPSc
from a blood sample. This concentration step alone, however, did not
suffice for the detection of prions in the blood. The researchers,
therefore, used the quaking-induced conversion method [see below] to
amplify disease-specific prions in the concentrated sample. This
combination of concentration and amplification, which the researchers
call eQuIC, resulted in a 10 000 fold more sensitive assay than those
previously reported. Dilutions of 1014-fold, containing around 2
attogram per milliliter of proteinase K-resistant prion protein, were
readily detected. [An attogram is a unit of mass equal to 10 to the
power minus 18 grams. - Mod.CP]

About the eQuIC method

The method used for prion amplification is the quaking-induced
conversion (QuIC) reaction. The method is a cell-free conversion
reaction of PrPC to PrPSc in multiwell plates. PrPSc present in the
(blood) sample acts as a seed for the conversion of recombinant PrP
added to the reaction as a substrate. PrPSc complexes formed in the
tube are then disrupted by shaking, providing further scaffolds for
prion protein conversion. In the real-time quaking-induced conversion,
detection of formed PrPSc is based on thioflavin T fluorescence, which
is enhanced when bound to prion amyloids. Caughey and colleagues
combined the real-time quaking-induced conversion with prior
immunoprecipitation using mAb 15B3 and called the method enhanced
real-time Quaking-Induced Conversion (eQuIC).

Abstract: A key challenge in managing transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases in medicine, agriculture,
and wildlife biology is the development of practical tests for prions
that are at or below infectious levels. Of particular interest are
tests capable of detecting prions in blood components such as plasma,
but blood typically has extremely low prion concentrations and
contains inhibitors of the most sensitive prion tests. One of the
latter tests is quaking-induced conversion (QuIC), which can be as
sensitive as in vivo bioassays but much more rapid, higher throughput,
and less expensive. Now we have integrated antibody 15B3-based
immunoprecipitation with QuIC reactions to increase sensitivity and
isolate prions from inhibitors such as those in plasma samples.
Coupling of immunoprecipitation and an improved real-time QuIC
reaction dramatically enhanced detection of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD) brain tissue diluted into human plasma. Dilutions of
1014-fold, containing around 2 attogram (ag) per ml of proteinase
K-resistant prion protein, were readily detected, indicating around a
10 000-fold greater sensitivity for vCJD brain than has previously
been reported. We also discriminated between plasma and serum samples
from scrapie-infected and uninfected hamsters, even in early
preclinical stages. This combined assay, which we call "enhanced QuIC"
(eQuIC), markedly improves prospects for routine detection of low
levels of prions in tissues, fluids, or environmental samples.

Importance: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are
largely untreatable and are difficult to diagnose definitively prior
to irreversible clinical decline or death. The transmissibility of
TSEs within and between species highlights the need for practical
tests for even the smallest amounts of infectivity. A few sufficiently
sensitive in vitro methods have been reported, but most have major
limitations that would preclude their use in routine diagnostic or
screening applications. Our new assay improves the outlook for such
critical applications. We focused initially on blood plasma because a
practical blood test for prions would be especially valuable for TSE
diagnostics and risk reduction. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD) in particular has been transmitted between humans via blood
transfusions. Enhanced real-time quaking-induced conversion (eRTQ)
provides by far the most sensitive detection of vCJD to date. The 15B3
antibody binds prions of multiple species, suggesting that our assay
may be useful for clinical and fundamental studies of a variety of
TSEs of humans and animals.

[The failure to detect vCJD prions in the tonsil tissue survey so far,
although a negative fining, is reassuring.

This "eQuIC" assay, if reproducible, could be a major advance in the
study of prion disease. It remains to be established whether the
specificity of the monoclonal antibody employed in this technique is
sufficient to interact with any other type of vCJD-like prion that may
be encountered. - Mod.CP]
