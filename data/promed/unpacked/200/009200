The outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, in Thirthahalli taluk has triggered anxiety among people of Malnad region [Karnataka state]. A source in the Health Department said that 8 KFD cases have been reported in the taluk so far. The laboratory based in Manipal, Udupi district, has confirmed that all the 8 persons are affected by KFD after examining their blood samples.

The department has started mobile health care units comprising doctors, which will visit villages where a large number of people are suffering from fever and administer vaccine to them. Blood samples of such persons are being sent to laboratories based in Manipal and Pune for medical examination.

Taluk health officer Kiran told DH that KFD cases are reported in Chiduva, Kodige and Nellisara under Kudumallige gram panchayat. People who visit the forest frequently have been directed to apply oil on their body given by the department. KFD cases are reported when the temperature is high. People should get vaccinated against KFD, he said.

[Thirthahalli taluk is located in Shivamogga district in the central part of the state of Karnataka in India.

The Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ and family _Flaviviridae_. It was 1st recognized in 1957, when an illness occurred concomitantly in monkeys (_Semnopithecus entellus_ and _Macaca radiata_) and in humans (http://www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/seajphv3n1p8.pdf). Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever, is endemic in 5 districts of Karnataka state, India. Recently there have been reports of the spread of disease to neighbouring districts of the Western Ghats mountain range, namely Chamarajanagar district in Karnataka, Nilgiri district in Tamil Nadu, Wayanad and Malappuram districts in Kerala, and Pali village in Goa (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/).

In order to prevent KFD in the local population, there is a need to create awareness on protection from tick bites particularly during May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Furthermore, vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD. The National Institute of Virology, Pune, has developed an inactivated chick embryo tissue culture vaccine against KFD (http://www.icmr.nic.in/pinstitute/niv/KYASANUR%20FOREST%20DISEASE.pdf). - Mod.UBA
