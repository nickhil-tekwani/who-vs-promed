Ringspot capture signals high risk looming
------------------------------------------
Disease pressure is building on brassica crops, with significantly
high levels of ringspot spores being picked up in monitoring traps
across east Lincolnshire, reports Andy Richardson of the Allium and
Brassica Centre.

The capture of high levels of spores in several traps, combined with
weather conducive to infection indicates a high risk of infection in
these areas. "Any crops that have not received a suitable fungicide
in the past 14 days should be treated as soon as possible," advises
Mr Richardson.

Furthermore, white blister remains at high risk, as a consequence of
extended periods with wet leaves. Crops must be regularly inspected
and treated at the 1st signs of disease, he adds.

[Ringspot disease on _Brassica_ crops is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella brassicicola_. Symptoms are small dark spots on
leaves, which become larger lesions with concentric rings of growth
and a definite margin. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid
conditions. The pathogen is spread by splashing water, mechanical
means and insects and overwinters in plant debris and biennial seed
crops. In the UK, fungal ringspot has become more damaging to
brassica crops in recent years especially in Cornwall and
Lincolnshire. The disease is managed mainly by timely fungicide applications.

Spore traps are used for determining identity and time of dispersal
of fungi. Spores can be identified by morphology to genus and
sometimes species. They can indicate the presence of a fungal
pathogen before disease is discovered in the field because symptoms
need time to develop and may initially be difficult to detect. Number
of spores and environmental conditions are used for risk assessment
of crop damage by a certain fungus.

White blister is caused by the fungus _Albugo candida_ and affects
most plants of the brassica (or crucifer) family. Disease management
includes phytosanitation, cultural practices, and fungicides. For
more information on this disease please see previous ProMED-mail post
