The Malawi Ministry of Health and Population has confirmed an outbreak of
bubonic plague in the southern border district of Nsanje.
The head of preventive health services in the ministry, Dr. Wilfred
Chalamira Nkhoma, told PANA Saturday in Lilongwe that by midweek last week
(week beginning 11 July 1999) the ministry had recorded 66 cases but no
deaths.
"In June the District Health Officer in Nsanje (which boarders Mozambique)
received a visit from his counterpart in Mutarara in Mozambique warning him
that there had been 200 cases in Mutarara which might filter in Malawi," he
said.
Chalamira Nkhoma said the first cases of the disease was recorded towards
the end of June and the disease has since spread to 7 villages in the
district.
He said the disease, which is infectious, is spread by rodents like mice and
rats whose fleas carry the bubonic plague-causing bacilli.
The disease's symptoms include enlarged lymph notes in the armpits, groins
and side of the neck, just behind the ear, which developes into painful
boils.
Chalamila Nkhoma said the disease is treatable with an antibiotic. He also
said it can be contained if there is less contact between those infected and
the uninfected.
Asked whether people in the affected district are being quarantined and
whether travel between Nsanje and Mutarara is being restricted, Chalamila
Nkhoma said that is difficult because the border is porous.
"People in Malawi and Mozambique enter each other's countries from anywhere,
not only in regulated border posts," he said. He also added that quarantine
is not necessary at the moment because the disease is not yet out of
control.
He said the ministry has stepped up its campaign asking people to limit
movement to and fro Mutarara and to report any suspected cases to health
authorities.
He said people are being encouraged to trap mice and rats and to keep cats
to control the rodent population.
Asked whether the cats cannot be infected when they eat the rodents and
therefore increase human suspectability to the plague, Chalamila Nkhoma said
the biological component of cats is different from homo sapiens (human
beings) and so they cannot contact the disease.
******[This is completely wrong -- cats can get plague and pass it to
humans -- see:

On whether human consumption of rodents like mice, which is quite a
favourite delicacy this time of the year most parts of Malawi, can increase
one's chances of contracting the disease, Chalamila Nkhoma also said that is
not possible because the the mice are boiled and dried before eating.
Bubonic plague was a serious problem in Zaire in the early 1990s. It then
filtered to other countries including Mozambique and Malawi. There have also
been outbreaks in the Malawi central district of Ntchisi.
