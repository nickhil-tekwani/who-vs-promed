The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [3 Dec 2014] investigating 2 cases of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) involving a man aged 84 and a woman aged 85.

The male patient presented with an injury to his right shin in mid-November 2014, which progressively became painfully swollen, leading to fever. He was admitted to United Christian Hospital (UCH) on 1 Dec 2014 and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit for management in critical condition. His clinical diagnosis was right shin NF.

The female patient presented with fever and painful swelling of left ring finger on 28 Nov 2014. She was admitted to UCH on 29 Nov 2014 and has been in stable condition all along. Her clinical diagnosis was left ring finger NF. Amputation of the left ring finger was performed on 1 Dec 2014.

The male patient's blood culture and the wound swab and left ring finger tissue culture of the female patient yielded _Vibrio vulnificus_, a bacterium which can cause NF, upon laboratory testing by UCH. Both patients, with underlying illnesses, have no recent travel history. Their home contacts were asymptomatic. Investigations by the CHP are proceeding.

[It is likely that the _V. vulnificus_-associated necrotizing fasciitis in the male patient did not begin at the time of the initial shin injury but rather contaminated the wound from exposure to salt water later in the course as necrotizing fasciitis has a rapid course as illustrated in the female case.

The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070473.htm:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism.

The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html). - Mod.LL
