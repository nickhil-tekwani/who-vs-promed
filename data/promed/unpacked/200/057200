Volunteer soybeans potential source of rust spores
--------------------------------------------------
While farmers in Mato Grosso are making final preparations for planting their 2012/13 soybean crop, they are also being reminded to redouble their efforts to eliminate any volunteer soybeans. The state department of agriculture visited the principal soybean production regions and found a significant number of volunteer soybeans had not been eliminated and virtually all of them were infected with soybean rust.

The technicians returned with a grim assessment saying it is the worst they have seen since the 90-day soybean free period in the mid-2000s. The concern is that these volunteer soybeans will serve as a source of the disease once the 2012/13 soybean crop is planted.

There are 2 main reasons why there are more volunteer soybeans this year [2012]. The principal reason is because the rainy season did not end until late in June [which] allowed soybeans spilled out of trucks to germinate much later than normal. Since the margins of the highways are not mowed, all these volunteer soybeans continue to be exposed to soybean rust. The other contributing factor is because farmers plant Roundup Ready soybeans, which makes controlling the volunteer soybeans with herbicides much more difficult.

Eliminating these volunteer soybeans at this late date is going to be difficult because it is recommended that the plants be removed manually and then either buried, put in plastic bags, or burned. It might be possible to eliminate the soybeans around buildings and storage units, but it would be impossible to manually remove all the soybeans along the edges of fields or highways. It is going to be something the farmers will have to deal with.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean crops of up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can also be affected and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long distances. Several epidemic cycles may occur in one cropping season. Fungicides may be used in disease management, but timing of applications is considered important. Partially resistant soybean lines are available. However, new fungal strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging. New fungal strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging in Brazil (ProMED-mail post 20090501.1644) and other soybean producing countries.

While the related species _P. meibomiae_ is also found in South America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms, this species is less virulent and considered of lesser economic significance.
