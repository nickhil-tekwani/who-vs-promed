Cambodia: Death Due to Avian Influenza Confirmed; Family Members Negative
--------------------------------------------------
The Cambodian Health Ministry stated on Sat 5 Feb 2005 that it has
confirmed that a 25-year-old [Cambodian] woman from Kampot Province who
died of a respiratory illness during January 2005 [while hospitalised in
Viet Nam] was infected with avian influenza virus. A joint statement
released by the Ministry, and the World Health Organization said it is the
1st human case of avian influenza in Cambodia.
"At this stage, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
Household members of the confirmed and suspected case have been tested for
avian influenza and preliminary results are all negative," the statement said.
Epidemiological surveillance for influenza-like illnesses has been
strengthened in Kampot Province, the only part of the country where the
virus has been detected, and healthcare workers are being trained in the
management of suspected avian influenza cases. "Although there are no other
suspected cases, we have to follow up closely on this matter," Ly Sovann,
head of Cambodia's Center for Disease Control, told Kyodo News by telephone
from Kampot.
The woman died on Sun [30 Jan 2005] from avian influenza at a hospital in
Vietnam, the Vietnamese government announced Tue 1 Feb 2005. She died after
being transferred to the hospital from a local Cambodian clinic in Kampot,
which is about 5 kilometers from the Vietnamese border.

[Previous reports have hinted at serious respiratory disease in household
contacts of the deceased, and her younger brother, who died from pneumonia
prior to her admission to hospital, was retrospectively assumed to have
been an avian influenza case. However, the above report, although still
preliminary, provides no evidence of onward human-to-human transmission of
the virus. - Mod.CP]
