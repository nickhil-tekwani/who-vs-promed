Ducks in Vietnamese capital contract bird flu virus
---------------------------------------------------
Two ducks in Viet Nam's capital, Hanoi city, have been infected with the
bird flu virus, local newspaper Labor reported on Wednesday [29 Aug 2006].
Specimens from the ducks in a market in Thanh Tri district have tested
positive for the bird flu virus strain H5, the paper quoted sources from
the country's Central Veterinary Center as saying.
Recently, Viet Nam has also detected some waterfowl in the 3 southern
provinces of Ben Tre, Long An and Tien Giang as having contracted bird flu
viruses, including the strain H5.
Viet Nam will form anti-bird flu task forces at both the central and local
levels to stamp out any disease outbreaks in a timely and comprehensive
manner. Bird flu outbreaks, starting in Viet Nam in December 2003, have
killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowl. The
last outbreak of bird flu among poultry in the country was in December
2005, according to the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
