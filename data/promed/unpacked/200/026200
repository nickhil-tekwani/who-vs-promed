The City of Contagem, in the metropolitan region, is investigating whether the death of a 42-year-old man last [Fri 20 Oct 2017], was caused by spotted fever. Days before, he had gone to the Ecological Park of Pampulha, in the capital [Belo Horizonte], and found ticks by the body, according to information received by the advisory of the municipal Executive. According to the Municipal Health Department, he was admitted to the Emergency Care Unit last [Mon 16 Oct 2017], and, on [Fri 20 Oct 2017], was transferred to the Municipal Hospital of Contagem, with the suspicion of spotted fever.

With the worsening of the clinical picture, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Center (ICU) of the hospital, where the "requests for serologies to confirm the initial diagnostic hypothesis" were initiated, together with the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (Funed). Due to the seriousness of the case, the patient died.

According to the Report, dengue and chikungunya were ruled out and the case was communicated to the Epidemiological Surveillance Department. The secretariat also reported that it awaits results from tests to confirm the diagnosis of the case.

In September 2016, a 10 year old boy died of spotted fever, days after visiting the Ecological Park of Pampulha. Since then, several measures to combat the disease transmitting tick have been applied at the site, such as isolation of areas for application of acaricides, weeding and irrigation. The Municipal Health Department (SMSA) of Belo Horizonte reported that, to date, it has not been reported on the epidemiological investigation of the case, nor on the possible location of transmission. The ministry said it was seeking concrete information to take measures that would help elucidate the case and initiate appropriate action.

The secretariat said that the city's capital is constantly developing education, prevention and monitoring activities and routinely distributes materials with information on ways to prevent contact with ticks.

In addition, the briefcase reported that it performs, 3 times a year, actions of acarological surveillance in the Ecological Park of Pampulha, as a form of prevention of spotted fever. The actions consist of the collection of ticks at points with greater risk potential, such as the presence of wild hosts, such as capybaras, and horses.

The parasites are sent to the laboratory and, when they are identified as a star tick (_Amblyomma sculptum_), an alert for monitoring, surveillance, and educational work is issued for on-site action.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also known as febre maculosa, SÃ£o Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (a flat rash with small raised bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric (small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin), involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpurae usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

Contagem is a city in the center of the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. It is located only 21 km (approx. 13 mi) from the capital Belo Horizonte and forms part of a metropolitan area with a population of 4.8 million. The state of Minas Gerais is found on a map at:
