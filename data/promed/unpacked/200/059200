Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A/H7N7, The Netherlands, 2003
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H7N7 began
in poultry farms in the Netherlands in 2003. Virus infection was detected
by RT-PCR in 86 poultry workers and 3 household contacts of PCR-positive
poultry workers, mainly associated with conjunctivitis. To determine the
magnitude of and risk factors for human-to-human transmission of influenza
A/H7N7 in the Netherlands, a retrospective cohort study among household
members of infected poultry workers was undertaken. In total, 33 (58.9
percent) of 56 (among 62) participants who provided blood samples had
positive H7 serology, using single convalescent serum samples obtained at
least 3 weeks after onset of symptoms of the index case. 8 household
members (12.9 percent) reported symptoms (conjunctivitis and/or ILI), of
which 4 of 5 (80.0 percent) tested seropositive. On univariate analysis,
significant risk factors for seropositivity included having at least 2
toilets, a pet bird, and using cloth handkerchiefs. It was not possible to
obtain a stable model for binomial regression for the outcome of A/H7N7
infection. Further seroprevalence studies among contacts of asymptomatic H7
cases should be conducted.
Background
----------
On 28 Feb 2003, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H7N7
(HPAI A/H7N7) was isolated for the 1st time in the Netherlands from poultry
on a farm, identifying the start of a large epizootic that also affected
Germany and Belgium. In the Netherlands, infected poultry on 255 farms were
culled, as well as poultry on 1094 surrounding farms, resulting in the
killing of more than 30 million chickens [1]. Hygienic measures and
application of personal protective equipment and antiviral prophylaxis were
advised. The following weeks, A/H7N7 was diagnosed by RT-PCR in 89 humans,
of whom 78 had conjunctivitis. A Dutch veterinarian reported having
conjunctivitis, which developed one day after he had visited an affected
farm, and he died a week later from respiratory distress [2]. 3 of the 89
cases were household contacts of A/H7N7 confirmed cases and had no known
exposure to A/H7N7 infected poultry. This strongly suggested human-to-human
transmission, either direct or indirect. All 3 patients had conjunctivitis,
and one also had influenza-like illness (ILI).
Influenza in humans and HPAI is caused by influenza A virus, belonging to
the family _Orthomyxoviridae_. All currently known influenza A virus
subtypes have been found to circulate in waterfowl [3,4]. Avian influenza
viruses have been known to infect humans, but transmission between humans
has so far only occurred sporadically [5,6,7]. Influenza A/H7N7 in humans
was 1st reported in 1959 [8]. In January 2004, human cases of influenza
A/H5N1 related to an outbreak of avian influenza A/H5N1 were identified in
Viet Nam and Thailand [9], and in September 2004, probable human-to-human
transmission was reported in a family cluster in Thailand [10].
Simultaneous infection of a susceptible host with a human and an animal
influenza A virus could lead to re-assortment of genetic material and
consequently cause the generation of a virus subtype capable of replicating
and spreading between humans and with surface proteins that are novel for
the human population (antigenic shift). Such strains could cause a major
influenza pandemic.
In order to measure secondary transmission of avian influenza A/H7N7 in
household members, to identify risk factors for transmission, and to
describe the clinical course of illness, we conducted a retrospective
cohort study among household members of infected poultry workers.
Methods
-------
Patients who were A/H7N7 confirmed index cases were contacted by telephone
for recruitment of their household members in the study. People living on
poultry farms or those who kept poultry in their gardens (backyards) were
excluded from the study.
Definitions
------------
An A/H7N7 confirmed index case: was a person who had conjunctivitis and/or
ILI, who had been exposed to influenza A/H7N7 infected poultry since 28 Feb
2003 in the Netherlands, and who had positive influenza A/H7N7 laboratory
results by PCR and/or virus isolation.
Conjunctivitis: a possible case of A/H7N7 conjunctivitis was a household
member with no known exposure to poultry and with 2 or more of the
following symptoms since 28 Feb 2003: red eyes, tearful eyes, itching eyes,
painful eyes, burning eyes, purulent fluid in eyes, or sensitivity to
light. A confirmed case of A/H7N7 conjunctivitis was a possible case of
A/H7N7 conjunctivitis with positive influenza A/H7N7 laboratory results by
PCR and/or virus-isolation.
Influenza-like illness: a possible case of A/H7N7 influenza was a household
member with no known exposure to poultry and with fever (if measured, then
= 38.5 C), and at least one of the following symptoms since 28 Feb 2003:
cough, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, myalgia, or headache. A confirmed case of
A/H7N7 influenza was a possible case with positive influenza A/H7N7
laboratory results by PCR and/or virus-isolation.
Seropositive: a serology confirmed case of A/H7N7 infection (symptomatic or
asymptomatic) was a household member who had an antibody titre of 1:10 or
higher for influenza A/H7N7 by hemagglutination assay [11].
Questionnaire
--------------
Information on demographics, occupation, smoking, medical history, pets,
contact with A/H7N7 confirmed index cases (including hygienic measures by
index cases and contacts), exposure to A/H7N7-infected poultry, influenza
vaccination status, and symptoms since 1 Mar 2003 were collected using a
standardized, self-administered, postal questionnaire.
Serology
--------
All participants were asked to provide single serum samples, at least 3
weeks after diagnosis of the primary A/H7N7 case in their household, to
ascertain (sub)clinical infection with influenza A/H7N7. Sera were tested
in a modified hemagglutination inhibition as described in detail by Meijer
et al [11].
Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Dutch Medical Ethics
Committee.
Statistical analysis
--------------------
Data were analyzed with STATA 8.0. For multivariate analysis of significant
or biologically plausible variables in univariate analysis, we preferred
binomial to logistic regression, because of high prevalence of positive
A/H7N7 serology in household members in this cohort study, which calls for
adjusted risk ratios rather than odd rations. Fisher's exact test was used
to calculate significance.
Results
---------
Description of study participants: Of 86 households of A/H7N7 infected
poultry workers, 63 (73.3 percent) households agreed to participate and 14
declined. 9 poultry workers could not be reached, of which 4 were immigrant
workers that had returned to their home country Poland. Of the 200
household members in the 63 participating households, 104 (52 percent)
completed and returned the questionnaire. Of these 104, 42 were excluded,
as they had either been exposed to H7N7-infected poultry, or were family
members who were not living at the same address as the index case. A total
of 62 household members of 25 A/H7N7 confirmed index cases were included in
the study, with one single A/H7N7 confirmed index case in each of these
households. The male:female ratio was 2:3. Mean age was 27.3 years, ranging
from 0 to 61 years. The mean household size was 3.5 people (range 2 - 8).
Clinical symptoms: 8 people (12.9 percent) reported health complaints. 2
met the case definition of conjunctivitis only, 4 met the case definition
of ILI only and 2 met both case definitions. The risk factors for
conjunctivitis among household members are summarized in a table; the
original text should be consulted. Attack rates were higher in those who
had allergies in their medical history than in those who did not (RR =
10.3, 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 - 91.0).
Results serology: In total, 56 of the 62 people in the cohort agreed to
provide blood samples, of which 33 (58.9 percent) had detectable antibodies
against H7. 5 of 8 household members with health complaints were
serologically tested; 4 (80.0 percent) had detectable antibodies against
H7, of which 2 had conjunctivitis only with onset 2 to 6 days after onset
of symptoms in the index case, and 2 had conjunctivitis as well as symptoms
of ILI with onset unknown or 5 days after onset of symptoms in the index
case. Out of 24 households serologically tested, 15 (62.5 percent) had one
or more household contacts with detectable H7 antibodies. The data are
presented as a table (Table 2) in the original text. A/H7 seroprevalence in
household members was higher among those who had pet birds (e.g., canary)
kept indoors at home and among those having any other indoor pets in their
homes (e.g., cat, dog, hamster) than among those who did not. (The data are
presented as Table 3 in the original text). Furthermore, seroprevalence was
higher among those who frequently used cloth handkerchiefs than among those
who did not. Conversely, those who used paper handkerchiefs had a lower
seroprevalence of H7 antibodies than those who did not. Seroprevalence was
higher among those who had at least 2 toilets in their homes, than among
those who had only one toilet. At household level, seroprevalence was
higher among the 17 households that had 2 or more toilets in the home than
among the 7 households with only one toilet at home (RR = 2.7, 95 percent
confidence interval 0.8-8.9, p = .061).
Family members of index patients who had their 1st poultry exposure on or
after 5 Mar 2003 had lower seroprevalence, showing borderline significance,
than household members of index cases with 1st poultry contact before 5 Mar
2003. 2 (3.2 percent) of 62 persons received the 2002-2003 influenza
vaccination. (These data are presented as Table 3 in the original text).
It was not possible to develop a stable model of significant and
biologically plausible risk factors in univariate analysis for binomial
regression.
The HI assay had a sensitivity of 85 percent and a specificity of 100
percent at a cut-off HI titre of =10. HI antibodies against influenza A/H7,
A/H1, and A/H3 were not cross-reactive with the heterologeous virus. None
of the human sera tested showed neutralization of the A/H7N7 virus in the
microneutralization assay.
Discussion
----------
We describe the occurrence of infection with avian influenza A virus
subtype H7N7 in household contacts of human A/H7N7 confirmed index cases,
in the absence of contact with infected poultry. 33 of 56 household members
(58.9 percent) had an A/H7N7 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or serology, 4
of 62 household members (6.5 percent) met the possible case definition of
conjunctivitis, and all 4 cases (100 percent) had positive H7 serology.
The authors assume that the presence of H7 antibodies is indicative of a
past AI A/H7N7 infection. This is supported by the results of another study
in which the prophylactic use of oseltamivir was found to significantly
reduce the seroprevalence of H7 antibodies in professionals exposed to
infected poultry using the same serological test [12]. In that study, a
significant association was found between the presence of H7 antibodies and
the occurrence of eye symptoms, after correcting for prophylactic use of
oseltamivir.
When using the adjusted HI assay, but not when using the
microneutralization assay, we detected a measurable antibody response in a
high proportion of sera from persons exposed to laboratory-confirmed A/H7N7
infected persons. Evidence that these antibodies are real comes from 3
observations. 1st, any cross reaction of the A/H7 specific HI-assay with
antibodies against A/H1 or A/H3 viruses would have been detected in the
sera from persons recently vaccinated with the seasonal human influenza
vaccine, but no reaction (0 percent) in the A/H7 HI assay was found. 2nd,
as the sera of the recently vaccinated persons were collected in autumn
2002, just before the H7 epizootic started, the anti-H7 antibodies in the
household contacts can not be explained as being the result of previous
circulation of A/H7 virus. 3rd, none of the samples collected in autumn
2002 from 100 recently vaccinated persons had reactivity with the adjusted
H7 assay [11]. This suggests that our results cannot be explained by a
specific reactivity of the adjusted HI-assay.
Our results suggest that during the outbreak of avian influenza A virus,
subtype H7N7, household members of poultry workers were at increased risk
of avian influenza either by direct (person to person) or by indirect
(fomite) transmission. Previous observations of influenza transmission
within households had shown secondary attack rates among household members
of influenza cases in the same high range as observed in our study [13].
These high secondary attack rates are in contrast with findings for subtype
A/H9N2 and A/H5N1, where no to limited secondary transmission was observed
among healthcare workers and household contacts of cases [5,6,7,14,15].
However, we used a method for the detection of antibodies against the H7
virus which has a high analytical sensitivity. Detailed studies to analyze
person to person transmission of H5 and H9 with the same methodology are
sparse. Interestingly, for H9, a recent publication showed that in 44.6
percent of suspected cases of H9N2 infection and in 33.5 percent of the
general population in Shantou city in China, antibody titres against H9
could be detected [16]. This observation suggests that secondary
transmission of H9 viruses may be more common than has previously been
assumed. In addition, the primary site of infection, the conjunctiva for H7
virus and the airway epithelium for H5 and H9 virus, and the possible
difference in virus receptor expression on the conjunctiva and the airway
epithelium together with the difference in affinity of the respective
viruses for these receptors, may also account for the observed differences.
Although sharing bath towels and washcloths, and using cloth handkerchiefs
seemed to increase the risk of clinical conjunctivitis, none of these
observations was statistically significant, presumably due to lack of study
power. However, it seems plausible to assume that patients with a viral
conjunctivitis are more likely to expose household members to virus when
sharing towels and washcloths or using cloth handkerchiefs. This is
supported by our observation of higher seroprevalence among people using
cloth handkerchiefs and of lower seroprevalence among those using paper
(disposable) handkerchiefs, all of which were statistically significant.
Studies on transmission of other viral conjunctivitis within households
identified crowding and high numbers of persons per bathroom as risk
factors [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Seroprevalence was significantly higher among those who had at least 2
toilets in their homes than among those who had only one toilet. We have no
explanation for this result. Hygienic measures, such as using soap for hand
washing and good hygiene by the index case, associated with seropositivity,
were of borderline significance. Although we observed higher seroprevalence
in those household members who had pet birds kept indoors at home, this
cannot account for all seropositive secondary cases, as only 7 of all 33
cases had indoor birds at home. However, this finding raises the question
of whether indoor pet birds could play a role in the household transmission
of avian influenza virus, especially since 6 of 7 cases with pet birds in
the home were part of the same household. It is conceivable that these
animals could serve as an amplifier for multiplication and shedding of the
virus in the home environment. This deserves further attention in future
outbreaks, for example, by monitoring and screening pet birds in the homes
of poultry workers. It was not possible to perform binomial regression for
the outcome of A/H7N7 infection, presumably due to low numbers in the cohort.
If the detection of H7 antibodies is indicative for human (subclinical)
influenza A/H7N7 infection, then the secondary spread of A/H7N7 to
household contacts is on an unexpectedly large scale. Although the
pathogenity of the A/H7N7 virus seemed to be low, the high transmissibility
is directly related to an increased risk for double infection and
reassortment. Current outbreak control measures did not take transmission
to household contacts into account. This also raises the question of
whether or not subclinical A/H7N7 cases can transmit the virus efficiently
to other close contacts, which would imply that outbreak control strategy
for A/H7N7 should be thoroughly revised. Consideration may be given to
early isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts. Prophylactic treatment
with oseltamivir should be considered for all household contacts of poultry
workers during outbreaks of avian influenza, although its role must be
further assessed in order to determine the risk of developing antiviral
resistance. Moreover, in order to assess the role of fomites in secondary
transmission of the A/H7N7 virus, further studies of contacts outside the
household should be performed, as well as investigations to obtain
background information on the spread of A/H7N7 in the general population of
the Netherlands.
The study had the following limitations. Non-response was high and may be
associated with rates of illness (selection bias), but we see no reason why
it would have differed between exposed and non-exposed members of the
cohort, therefore not biasing the estimate of the risk ratios. However,
selection bias is not likely to play a major role with respect to
seroprevalence, since most household members with detectable antibodies
were asymptomatic.
In conclusion, our study suggests that human-to-human transmission of HPAI
A/H7N7 can occur within household contacts in the absence of contact with
infected poultry. Monitoring of clinical symptoms alone in household
contacts of confirmed A/H7N7 cases underestimates the extent of
human-to-human spread. In addition, our results suggest that cloth
handkerchiefs, having indoor pet birds at home or having at least 2 toilets
at home could be risk factors for household transmission A/H7N7.
Taking all the results together, we recommend that during an outbreak of
avian influenza: 1) Household members should be encouraged to use paper
handkerchiefs instead of cloth handkerchiefs; 2) Household members of
poultry workers exposed to A/H7N7 should be advised on enhanced general
hygiene measures; 3) In the case that oseltamivir prophylaxis is offered to
exposed poultry workers in future A/H7N7 epizootics, this should also be
considered for household members of A/H7N7 cases; 4) Indoor pet birds of
poultry workers should be screened and monitored during future outbreaks of
avian influenza in order to determine the role of indoor birds in household
transmission of the virus; and 5) Further seroprevalence studies among
contacts of asymptomatic persons with positive H7 serology should be
conducted in order to assess the risk of person to person transmission, and
consequently the potential for a new pandemic strain, in the absence of
symptoms.

[The significant conclusion extracted from the above article applicable to
other situations, such as the A/H5N5 outbreaks in East Asia is that:
Current outbreak control measures did not take transmission to household
contacts into account. This also raises the question of whether or not
subclinical A/H7N7 cases can transmit the virus efficiently to other close
contacts, which would imply that outbreak control strategy for A/H7N7
should be thoroughly revised. Consideration may be given to early isolation
of cases and quarantine of contacts. Prophylactic treatment with
oseltamivir should be considered for all household contacts of poultry
workers during outbreaks of avian influenza, although its role must be
further assessed in order to determine the risk of developing antiviral
resistance. Some other factors, such as the higher vulnerability of
households with 2 toilets over those with one, are not easily
interpretable. - Mod.CP]
