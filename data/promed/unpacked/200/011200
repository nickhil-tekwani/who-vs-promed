Oyster herpesvirus (OsHV1, micro-var), United Kingdom
---------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Nov 2013 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 24 Oct 2013
Report date: 6 Nov 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Nov 2013
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 40 percent
Mortality: 40 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1, micro-var)
Serotype: Other

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Poole Harbour, Poole, Dorset, ENGLAND
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / 40 percent / 40 percent / - / - / - / 0 / 0
Affected population: Farmed population of diploid juvenile Pacific oysters _Crassostrea gigas_, grown in lantern nets. Only juvenile oysters affected. Adult oysters in adjacent oyster beds appear to be unaffected to date.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Movement controls in the form of a confirmed designation have been applied to the Oyster Herpesvirus Containment Area known as "CD17/2013 -- Confirmed Designation -- Oyster Herpesvirus Containment Area, Poole Harbour, Dorset." Under conditions of the designation, movements of _Crassostrea gigas_ are permitted for direct human consumption subject to hygiene regulations, and controls have been applied to any purification centres outside of the designated area which may receive animals from within the containment area. In addition, the controls stipulate that disposal of dead Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_) of all stages must be by an approved method for disposal of Category 2 animal-by-product waste. An epidemiological investigation is underway. Further sampling has been undertaken within the containment area and to date there have been no further positive results beyond that of the affected farm. In addition, the one source site to the farm has been sampled as a contact site and tested negative for the presence of oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1, micro-var). Further sampling of other contact sites is underway in both England and Scotland. The mortalities in the affected site appear to have ceased.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; Zoning; Tracing forward; Tracing back; Surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; Official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; Surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (National laboratory) / Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 24 Oct 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For background on oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1, micro-var) see commentary in ProMED-mail post 20131030.2030679.

The Pacific oyster is the most important species of oyster cultivated in the United Kingdom both in terms of volume and value, with an annual production of over 1100 tonnes (metric tons). Production greatly exceeds that of the native oyster _Ostrea edulis_. Oyster herpesvirus has devastated Pacific oyster production in France, Jersey and parts of Ireland, and it is important that the disease is contained to prevent its spread to other oyster growing areas in Great Britain (http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/QA-oyster-herpesvirus-2013.pdf).

In 2010 Great Britain experienced the 1st outbreak of oyster herpesvirus at a shellfish farm in Whitstable, Kent. This outbreak was contained through the application of statutory movement controls on the affected site (http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/OHV-CD.pdf).

In 2012 there was another outbreak of oyster herpesvirus in the Blackwater Estuary, Essex (http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/CD04-2012-Confirmed-Designation-Map-Schedule.pdf).
