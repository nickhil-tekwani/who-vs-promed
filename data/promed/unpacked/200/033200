Two laboratory accidents at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) within the past 16 months may have exposed 9 workers to a bacterium and a virus regarded as potential bioweapons, according to a report yesterday, 4 Jan 2015, in The Frederick (MD) News-Post.

In one incident, 6 people were potentially exposed to _Burkholderia mallei_, which causes glanders, when a plastic tube in a boiling-water bath popped open on 19 Sep 2013, according to the story. It is based on reports obtained from USAMRIID and other government labs at Fort Detrick, MD through requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act. One worker stayed in the room for 10 minutes as the staff discussed what to do, the story says, but it does not mention any illnesses associated with either accident.

Glanders mainly affects horses but can also strike humans. It has been eliminated from the USA and much of the world, but the story says _B mallei_ was used as a biological weapon in World War II. The CDC classifies it as a category B bioterrorism agent.

In the other incident, a USAMRIID microbiologist was working with TC-83, a virus derived from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), on 23 May 2014, when tubes of the virus broke and released the contents while spinning inside a centrifuge, according to the News-Post. The microbiologist, a lab technician, and a postdoctoral fellow were potentially exposed to the virus, the story says. The mishap was blamed on use of the wrong tubes.

VEEV is spread by mosquitoes and infects both horses and humans, mainly in South and Central America, according to background information on Medscape. The CDC lists it with certain other encephalitis viruses as category B bioterrorism agents.

The personnel involved in both incidents received additional training in the aftermath, and those exposed to _B mallei_ were given antimicrobials, the story says.

[As written by ProMED Mod.MHJ: "Reporting errors, both internally and nationally, takes courage and a level of trust that the messenger will not be punished. Thus, an absence of such reports should not be taken as proof that all is well. Anyone who has worked in a laboratory knows that accidents, minor and major, will occur, even with the best teams. They happen. And the only way to reduce their frequency is by being open so that all learn and corrections can be put in place."

The following was extracted from Van Zandt KE, Greer MT, Gelhaus HC: Glanders: an overview of infection in humans. Orphanet J Rare Dis 2013;8:131 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766238/pdf/1750-1172-8-131.pdf), with the citations removed:

Glanders is a highly contagious and often fatal zoonotic disease primarily of solipeds such as horses, mules, and donkeys. It was 1st described by the Greeks in 450-425 BC. Throughout history, glanders has been known by other names including equinia, malleus, droes, and farcy. Glanders is primarily characterized by ulcerating lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. Solipeds are the natural reservoir of _Burkholderia mallei_. Donkeys are prone to develop acute forms of glanders, while horses are more likely to develop chronic and latent diseases. Mules are susceptible to acute and chronic forms of the disease as well as latent infections. _B. mallei_, the etiological agent of glanders, is a Gram-negative, non-motile, facultative intracellular pathogen. At one time, _B. mallei_ infections occurred worldwide, but over the last 100 years, the occurrence of glanders has decreased with the reduced economic reliance on solipeds as the primary mode of transportation, the implementation of testing all solipeds for glanders, and euthanizing those that are confirmed positive.

Features of human clinical glanders:
General symptoms: Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routes of infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration [pus]. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods of time. However, localized infections may disseminate, leading to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection [9]. The most common clinical features of the 8 laboratory acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including backache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also clinically better for a period of time after the 1st wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months, then patients developed clinical signs of infection.

Focal involvement can include upper respiratory involvement with copious nasal discharge which can progress to invasion of the deeper soft tissues and bones; skin involvement with a lesion beginning as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic with inflammation, which can extend along regional lymphatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci of suppuration along their course as well as either acute or chronic lung infection and septicemia with multifocal abscesses [these latter manifestations also occur with the more common human pathogen relative of _B. mallei_, B. pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis.

TC-83 is a live, attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis strain that has been studied as a potential vaccine. The following is extracted from the introduction section of Phillpotts RJ: Immunity to airborne challenge with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus develops rapidly after immunisation with the attenuated vaccine strain TC-83. Vaccine 1999;17: 2429-2435, again with the citations removed:

An attenuated vaccine strain, TC-83, has been derived from the epizootic serogroup 1A/B strain Trinidad donkey by repeated passage through guinea pig heart cell cultures. TC-83 vaccine is not a licensed product, although it has American Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug status for use in humans (IND No. 142) and is recommended for those working with VEEV. The vaccine is reactogenic [causing a reaction] and may be teratogenic [causing developmental abnormalities]. Vaccination may fail to produce adequate immunity in up to 18 percent of recipients. TC-83 vaccination protects mice and hamsters against airborne infection with virulent VEEV, but it is unclear how long this immunity may take to develop. In the present studies, we examined, in TC-83-vaccinated mice, the kinetics of the development of protection against subcutaneous or airborne challenge with virulent VEEV. The antibody response to TC-83 in both serum and lungwash was followed, and evidence is presented which suggests that local antibody may be a key mediator in protective immunity. - Mod.LL
