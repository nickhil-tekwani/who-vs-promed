A pilot and a flight attendant working for low-cost carrier Tigerair Taiwan on [Sun 15 Apr 2018] tested positive for measles, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said, adding that it is investigating whether the infections are associated with recent cluster cases.

The 2 had come in contact with 2 other Tigerair flight attendants who had contracted the disease earlier this month [April 2018], the CDC said.

The cluster cases were traced to a Taiwanese man who was infected with measles during a trip to Thailand early last month [March 2018]. He was diagnosed with the disease after he went to Okinawa, Japan, on a Tigerair flight later in the month.

Five people who had come in direct contact with the man were confirmed to have measles, the CDC said.

However, the pilot and flight attendant both received measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines on [6 and 8 Apr 2018], respectively, so the CDC is conducting a DNA sequence analysis to distinguish whether the positive tests were caused by the vaccine or an infection, CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said.

Sometimes people develop rashes, coughing, rhinitis, or fever within 5-12 days of receiving an MMR vaccine, he said, adding that the 2 suspected patients are quarantined at their homes.

If the 2 are confirmed to be infected with measles, it might imply a 3rd wave of infection from the cluster cases, and the CDC would initiate enhanced disease prevention measures, he added.

The health conditions of 1282 people who have had direct contact with the confirmed measles patients are being monitored by local health departments, the CDC said.

Tigerair said it has not scheduled any staff members with suspected measles symptoms to work, adding that it does not compromise on issues concerning flight safety, passengers' hygiene and well-being, as well as corporate social responsibility.

[2] Australia (Western Australia): travel related, comment
Date: Tue 17 Apr 2018
From: Gary Dowse <Gary.Dowse@health.wa.gov.au> [edited]


Western Australia has had 2 cases of measles confirmed in recent days in infants who travelled on separate but connecting Malindo Air flights, as detailed below. The index case was almost certainly an adult who was infected in India and was experiencing prodromal symptoms during both these flights, and was diagnosed with measles (genotype D8), following arrival in Perth. Onset of illness in the 2 infants, who were too young to have been vaccinated, occurred 8 and 9 days, respectively, following the flights.

The flights were:
1. Malindo Air flight OD 272, departing Amritsar, India on 29 Mar 2018 at 22:30, and arriving in Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia] on 30 Mar 2018 around 07:00.
2. Malindo Air flight OD 151, departing Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia] on 30 Mar 2018 around 08:25, and arriving in Perth (Western Australia) on 30 Mar 2018 around 14:10.

Precise seating information was not available for any of the 3 cases, but it seems that the secondary cases were likely to have been seated in the same general area of the cabin as was the infectious case on each of the flights in common.

It is possible that there could have been transmission on either of these flights to nationals of other countries, and this information may be of value in determining the source of infection.

People at Hamilton [Waikato] branches of Bunnings, New World, and PAK'nSAVE are being urged to check their measles immunity status after a person with the viral illness was in the stores.

The Waikato DHB [District Health Board] Public Health team has confirmed a case of measles in a person who caught the disease overseas before returning to New Zealand. This is unrelated to the recent cases in the South Island.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Richard Vipond said measles is a highly infectious illness and people who share the same air as someone while they were infectious may be at risk of developing the disease if they are not already immune.

People who visited the stores listed in the URL above during the appropriate time periods are recommended to check their immune status with their General Practice.

People most at risk of contracting the disease are those who have not had the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or who have had just one dose of the vaccine. Anyone born before 1969 is likely to be immune from the disease without having had the vaccine.

Dr Vipond said "Measles is a serious illness, many measles cases require hospital treatment. Measles is infectious for several days before the characteristic rash appears and is very easily transmitted from one person to another through the air."

He said anyone who visited the stores at those times and feels they may be unwell should telephone their doctor or call Healthline on 0800 611-116 for advice. People should not go directly to a doctor's office or to a hospital emergency department, but call first because measles is highly infectious and people with measles can infect others in the waiting room.

"The only way to protect from measles and the best way to avoid its complications is to be fully vaccinated. People who visited the above stores should check that they have had two MMR vaccines. Catch up vaccinations are free, so we encourage everyone to check their immunisation status and if they are not immune to be vaccinated," said Dr Vipond.

How to protect you and your family against measles:
Make sure you and your children are fully immunised. It's the best way to provide protection against a number of diseases and complications. Check your immunisation status with your GP.

Measles can't be treated once you get it, so the only way to prevent the disease is through free immunisation.

A measles outbreak has hit Wajir and Mandera counties, claiming one life so far.

The latest Kenya Disease Outbreak Situation Report on 23 Mar 2018 said more than 39 cases of measles were reported in Wajir East subcounty and 73 cases in Mandera East subcounty.

The latest measles outbreak in Kenya was in April 2017 in Dadaab refugee camp in Garissa. Children under 5 were affected; no one died.

Head of Health Promotion Unit Dr Sam Mahugu yesterday [16 Apr 2018] said they are on the ground surveying the situation and putting in place measures to curb spread of the disease.

Mahugu urged residents to get routine immunisation services, especially for children. Lack of immunisation is a serious problem. "We need as many caregivers as possible to take their children for immunisation. People are not treating it with the seriousness it deserves," he said.

Mahugu and other officials from the Health ministry were meeting yesterday to devise strategies to contain the outbreak.

The report compiled by UNICEF also said 14 counties have reported confirmed cholera outbreaks since the beginning of 2018. Cumulatively, 2180 cases with 48 deaths have been recorded.

These counties include Mombasa, Garissa, Siaya, Tharaka-Nithi, Meru, Kirinyaga, Busia, Tana River, Turkana, Murang'a, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Nairobi, and Nakuru. [6] of the counties -- Kirinyaga, Busia, Mombasa, Tharaka-Nithi, Siaya, and Meru -- have contained the outbreak.

UNICEF has dispatched health supplies, antibiotics, and interagency health kits to Siaya, Busia, Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo, and Samburu counties. More than 5000 children under 5 and 26 000 people received treatment ...

Infants, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies are particularly susceptible to the serious and contagious viral disease.

After years of calm, measles cases spike in northern Israel Israel's health minister promises full child allowances to families that don't vaccinate babies.

A man with measles traveled from India to Israel last week [week of 9 Apr 2018] and the Health Ministry has been warning high-risk passengers from his flight about possible contagion -- particularly infants under a year old, pregnant women and people suffering from immune deficiencies.

On [Sun 15 Apr 2018] the Health Ministry's Tel Aviv office was notified of a measles patient who had been on Air India flight AI139 that departed New Delhi at 4:30 PM on 12 Apr 2018 and landed at Ben-Gurion International Airport at 9:45 PM the same day. The ministry is calling on passengers who come down with a fever or a rash to go to a doctor immediately.

Measles is a serious, contagious viral disease that causes a characteristic rash and general malaise. The virus is spread through an infected person's coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, or phlegm. The virus can remain in the air for several hours. The risk of an unvaccinated person getting sick after exposure is 90 percent.

Measles can cause serious respiratory and nervous system problems. Around 1/3 of patients develop complications such as middle ear infection, diarrhea, and corneal inflammation. Although it's not common, pneumonia, and brain inflammation can also occur. A very rare side effect that can occur up to 10 years after infection is a degenerative brain condition that causes irreversible damage to the central nervous system, leading to seizures and cognitive decline. The risk of complications is higher in children under the age of 5, adults over the age of 20, and patients with suppressed immune systems. For every 1000 measles cases there is around one death.

Over the past decade there have been several measles outbreaks in Israel, mainly among unvaccinated children in the ultra-Orthodox community. The largest was from 2007-2008. There were also cases among various unvaccinated populations in 2011 and 2012.

Health officials in the Czech Republic are reporting an increase in measles cases so far in 2018. For the 1st 2 months of the year [2018], 29 cases have been reported, according to a local media report (computer translated).

Principal hygienist Eva Gottvald explains that there are 23 infected patients in Prague, 5 in the Liberec region, and 1 in Pardubice. Half the cases were imported from Ukraine. The reason for the spread is insufficient vaccination.

How contagious is measles? Answer: Very

Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again.

However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

In Serbia, the number of victims of epidemic of measles has reached 15 people, from the beginning of the epidemic in the fall of 2017. The total number of cases is 4740, according to the representative of the Institute of public health of Serbia.

"Of 4740 cases, 15 people died, and 500 patients developed serious complications, including pneumonia and brain inflammation. In this case, it is difficult to predict, however in recent days there is a decrease in the number of infected that is on the one hand due to the success of immunization [and on the other the] warm time of the year when more people are outdoors," said the doctor.

The physician also noted that the measures taken have had some effect -- the number of vaccinated people in age from 12 months-14 years increased to 94 percent.

The epidemic began in the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, but in December [2017] the number of cases in Central Serbia for the 1st time exceeded the number of patients in this Autonomous region.
