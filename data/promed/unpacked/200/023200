A case of the deadly [Sin Nombre] hantavirus has been confirmed in Skagit County, officials said.

This case is one of 4 hantavirus [infection] cases this year [2017] that has been confirmed in Washington State. The disease can be deadly, and roughly one in 3 people who contract the virus have died.

Hantavirus is carried by deer mice and is found in their urine [saliva] and droppings. Individuals can become infected if they breathe in contaminated dust or particles or if they touch rodent urine, droppings or nest materials and then touch their eyes, mouth or nose, health officials said.

The virus is not spread through person-to-person contact.

The CDC recommends the following steps if you plan to clean potentially rodent-infested areas:

- Do not stir up dust by vacuuming, sweeping, or any other dust-generating means.
- Wear rubber, latex, vinyl or nitrile gloves.
- Thoroughly wet contaminated areas including droppings, dead mice, and nests with a bleach solution or household disinfectant. Bleach solution: Mix 1.5 cups [355 ml] of household bleach in one gallon [3.8 liters] of water. Use only freshly mixed solution.
- Once everything is soaked for 10 minutes, remove all of the nest material, mice or droppings with a damp towel and then mop or sponge the area with bleach solution or household disinfectant.
- Spray dead rodents with disinfectant, and then double-bag along with all cleaning materials and debris. Throw out rodent in an appropriate waste disposal system.

Symptoms of hantavirus [infections] appear between 1-8 weeks after exposure and include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms: Fever, head and muscle aches, followed by shortness of breath or other breathing issues. People who have recently been in areas where rodents are likely to nest, and are experiencing these symptoms, are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider.

[The hantavirus involved in the report above is not stated, but Sin Nombre virus is very likely involved.

Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Washington State. Deer mice commonly move into dwellings with the onset of cold weather. In the spring and summer, cleaning out areas with deer mice and their nests should be done with the same precautions mentioned above. Materials should be wetted down with a bleach solution and handled in an open-air space, with gloves and a mask worn.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.
