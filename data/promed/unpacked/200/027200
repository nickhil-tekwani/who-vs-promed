New yellow rust race threatens wheat
------------------------------------
A new race of yellow rust that infects Solstice wheat is being investigated
by NIAB [National Institute of Agricultural Botany]. Samples taken during
the United Kingdom Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS) last season
from the variety have been confirmed as virulent also in seedlings. NIAB is
now testing the isolates on adult plants in the field to determine the
level of susceptibility of Solstice and other varieties to the race.
Solstice was previously resistant to all known yellow rust races.

Wheat growers also face a resurgence of older yellow rust races, says NIAB,
because of an increasing area of varieties with yellow rust resistance gene
Yr6. "Despite predictions that yellow rust was unlikely to be a problem
because of the cold winter, outbreaks have been detected in wheat crops
particularly in the high risk areas of the East Midlands and East Anglia,"
says NIAB's Rosemary Bayles. "Reports suggest Robigus and Oakley are
particularly affected." Robigus is extremely susceptible to a specific race
that has dominated the yellow rust population for several years. But Oakley
has remained largely free to date, so the appearance of the disease may be
more of a surprise to its growers.

But UKCPVS results suggest it is moderately susceptible to a separate race
of yellow rust, which although once quite common, has become less frequent
in recent years. Unlike the "Robigus race" the types that infect Oakley
carry virulence for the resistance gene Yr6, says Dr Bayles. "Our
experience shows that as a variety becomes more widely grown on farm,
yellow rust races with corresponding virulence rapidly become more common.
We could, therefore, expect to see an increase in Yr6-virulent races in
response to increasing area of Oakley, and this would account for the
increased incidence of the disease in this variety."

[Stripe rust, also called yellow rust, of cereals is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow leaf stripes
and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. It affects
wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses.
Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season.
Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

Continuous resistance breeding is required to keep ahead of pathogen
adaption. New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been
reported in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, India and
are also suspected to emerge in China. Disease monitoring, such as the
UKCPVS mentioned above, is important to recognise new pathogen strains. In
the UK this has lead to the finding that the recent outbreak of stripe rust
in England and Scotland (ProMED-mail posts 20090417.1452 and 20090424.1543)
is due to at least one new fungal strain. The report above also illustrates
the interactive co-evolution of host and pathogen strains (races) in the field.
