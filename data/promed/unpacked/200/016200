Greek health officials have reported 9 autochthonous non-_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria cases since August [2018].

Case investigation of the 9 introduced cases (8 _P. vivax_ and one non-_P. falciparum_) showed:
- 1 _P. vivax_ case with probable exposure at the municipal unit of Tichero, municipality of Soufli, regional unit (RU) of Evros, with onset of symptoms the week of 20-26 Aug 2018;
- 1 _P. vivax_ case with probable exposure at the municipal unit of Feres, municipality of Alexandroupoli, RU of Evros, with onset of symptoms in the week of 13-19 Aug 2018;
- 7 cases (6 _P. vivax_ and 1 non-_P. falciparum_) with probable exposure at the municipal unit of Echedoros, municipality of Delta, RU of Thessaloniki, with onset of symptoms of the patients within the weeks of 15 Sep-10 Oct 2018. All cases of this cluster are considered introduced, that is, 1st generation transmission from an imported case (as the time interval between symptom onset of the cases was limited, within 3 weeks).

In 2018, 47 total malaria cases have been reported in Greece as of late October [2018], with the remainder being imported (37) or unclassified (1).

Among the 37 imported cases, 23 were immigrants from malaria endemic countries (17 from the Indian subcontinent and 6 from Africa) and 14 cases were travellers (from Africa).

Greece was declared free from malaria in 1974. However, since 2009 a number of locally acquired/introduced _P. vivax_ malaria cases have been recorded in various areas of the country (that is, among patients without travel history to a malaria endemic country), mainly as sporadic introduced cases but also in clusters (in 2011-2012).

[Greece experienced an outbreak of autochthonous _P. vivax_ malaria in 2011-2012; see the ProMED posts below. The malaria was introduced by farm workers from southeast Asia and the transmission was interrupted by case and contact tracing and finally mass drug administration (ProMED 23 Nov 2015 Malaria - Greece: P. vivax, mass drug administration: 20151123.3813119). ProMED will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
