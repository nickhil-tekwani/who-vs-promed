The Office of Epidemiological Surveillance (DIVE-SC) confirmed another human yellow fever case this year [2020] in the state. The patient, a resident of Pomerode in the Vale do Itajai, is 45 years old and has not been vaccinated. As of this Thursday (20 [Feb 2020]) he was interned in the intensive care unit of the Nereu Ramos Hospital in Florianopolis. He was in stable condition as of this afternoon. He was sent to the [state] capital the same day since the Nereu Ramos Hospital is the reference facility for infectious diseases.

The other confirmed human yellow fever cases are in Blumenau, also in Vale do Itajai, and 2 other cases are in the north of the state, in Jaragua do Sul and Sao Bento do Sul. In 2019, there were 2 cases, and both died.

Vaccination
Everyone from 9 months of age and above needs to receive a dose of the vaccine that protects for life against the disease. A dose of the vaccine is free of charge and is available in health units in the entire state.

Yellow fever
Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus that can lead to death in a week if not treated rapidly. It is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes. In the forest, the vectors are insects of the _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethe_ genera. In the city it is _Aedes aegypti_.

The symptoms of the disease are
- initially, a rapid rise in fever
- chills and fever
- intense headache
- back and body pain
- nausea and vomiting
- weakness and fatigue
- abdominal pain
- yellow skin

Monkeys
In addition to humans, monkeys in the state also have yellow fever. There were 2 cases in Blumenau, another 2 in Pomerode, and one each in the following municipalities: Timbo, Gaspar and Indaial in the Vale do Itajai, and Jaragua do Sul, according to the most recent DIVE-SC bulletin issued on Monday [17 Feb 2020]. All were found dead.

Monkeys do not transmit the disease [directly] to people but are indicators that yellow fever virus is circulating in the region.

[In 2019, 2 cases of yellow fever [YF] were the 1st since almost one year ago. There were several yellow fever epizootics confirmed in non-human primates in 2020. In other words, it is more than predictable that, without effective and timely preventive actions, cases of yellow fever in humans would reoccur: no surprise. As we have mentioned numerous times, for yellow fever, in the current epidemiological scenario of sylvan transmission, as (or more) important as prioritizing goals of high rates of vaccination coverage in the general population in the short term is vaccinating the right people in the right places at the right time, that is, susceptible individuals residing or visiting the areas at greatest risk. Not infrequently, this is only feasible with differentiated strategies, including active searches. The question: Have the 4 confirmed cases so far not been vaccinated due to refusal, misinformation, or difficult access? - Mod.RNA]

[The human cases this year (2020) are due to YF virus spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. The dead monkeys indicate that the virus has been circulating in the state for over a year. It is important that the human population YF vaccination coverage reach the 95% goal set by the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is the only way to avoid these sylvan cases, since elimination of the forest YF virus transmission cycle is not feasible. Without prevention of these human sylvan cases, there is the risk that YF virus could be introduced by them into the urban cycle of virus transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and spread quickly. - Mod.TY
