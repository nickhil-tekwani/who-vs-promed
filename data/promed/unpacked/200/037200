Fever, Jaundice, and Multiple Organ System Failure Associated With
17D-Derived Yellow Fever Vaccination, 1996--2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------
At the June 2001 meeting of the Advisory Committee for Immunization
Practices (ACIP), 7 cases of multiple organ system failure (MOSF) in
recipients of 17D-derived yellow fever (YF) vaccine were presented (1--3).
In response, an ACIP working group was formed to review the cases, assess
the risk for serious adverse events following YF vaccination, and consider
revision of the 1990 YF vaccination recommendations (4). This notice
summarizes these cases and describes an enhanced surveillance program
designed to refine risk estimates and improve histopathologic documentation
of MOSF potentially associated with YF vaccination.
Derived from the original 17D YF vaccine strain, the live, attenuated
17D-204 and 17DD YF strains are the most commonly used YF vaccines (5). In
1999 and 2000, 2 Brazilian residents aged 5 and 22 years became ill after
receiving 17DD YF vaccine administered during a campaign initiated in
response to a local YF epidemic. During 1996--2001, 5 persons aged 56--79
years, including 4 U.S. residents and one Australian resident (2 countries
where YF is not endemic) became ill after receiving 17D-204 YF vaccine
administered in anticipation of international travel. Of the 5 ill persons,
2 were planning to travel to countries where local YF transmission had
never been reported.
All 7 persons became ill within 2--5 days of vaccination and required
intensive care; 6 died. None had documented immunodeficiency, and all were
in their usual state of health before vaccination. Illness was
characterized by fever, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild-to-moderate
elevation of hepatocellular enzymes, hypotension with poor tissue
perfusion, and respiratory failure. Most patients also had headache,
vomiting, myalgias, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal failure requiring
hemodialysis.
In the Brazilian and Australian cases, histopathologic changes in the liver
included midzonal necrosis, microvesicular fatty change, and Councilman
bodies, which are characteristic of wild-type YF. Using
immunohistochemistry (IHC), YF viral antigen was identified in areas of
midzonal necrosis in liver specimens from the 2 17DD recipients. In a liver
specimen from the third patient (a 17D-204 recipient), electron microscopy
showed flavivirus-like particles in the areas of midzonal necrosis.
Vaccine-type YF virus was isolated from blood and autopsy material (i.e.,
brain, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, or skin) of these 3
persons, who died 8--11 days after vaccination. Vaccine-type YF virus was
isolated from the blood of 2 of the 4 U.S. patients (17D-204 recipients)
7--8 days after vaccination. Viremia after vaccination with YF may occur in
healthy persons. Virus also was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
of one of these 2 patients, although the presence of red blood cells and
absence of white blood cells in CSF may suggest that blood contaminating
the CSF was the possible source of virus. No hepatocellular necrosis was
observed in a liver specimen from the only U.S. case-patient who underwent
biopsy; however, IHC revealed rare YF virus antigen within Kupffer cells.
The 17D-204 and 17DD YF vaccines are among the safest and most effective
viral vaccines (5). Since 1965, approximately 8 million doses of
17D-derived YF vaccine have been administered to U.S. travelers and
approximately 300 million doses have been administered to persons in areas
where YF is endemic. Although 2%--5% of persons who receive vaccine report
headaches, myalgia, and low-grade fever 5--10 days after vaccination, <1%
report having to curtail their usual activities. The frequency of
anaphylaxis attributed to YF vaccine is approximately one in 130 000
vaccinees (4,6). Reports of other severe illnesses attributed to YF
vaccination (including encephalitis, primarily in infants) are rare. Since
1965, post-YF vaccination encephalitis has been reported in one U.S.
resident aged >9 months (estimated incidence: one in 8 million) (5). MOSF
associated with 17D-derived YF vaccination was not reported before 1996.
The frequency of febrile MOSF cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) after vaccination with 17D-204 YF vaccine in the
United States during 1990--1998 is approximately one in 400 000 distributed
doses (7).
An estimated 200 000 cases of YF occur each year in South America and
Africa (5). As a result, YF is an important vaccine-preventable disease
among travelers to areas where YF occurs on these continents. In 1996 and
1999, 2 U.S. and 2 European unvaccinated travelers to areas where YF is
endemic died of YF viral infection (1,8). The risk for YF in unvaccinated
travelers probably is increasing because potential YF transmission zones
are expanding to include urban areas with large populations of susceptible
humans and abundant competent mosquito vectors. Vaccination is the most
effective preventive measure against YF, a disease that has no specific
treatment and may cause death in 20% of patients (5). Despite a rare,
possibly causal relation between YF vaccination and MOSF, YF vaccination of
persons traveling in areas where YF transmission occurs should continue as
currently recommended, at least until more definitive and complete data are
available and analyzed by the ACIP working group. However, health-care
providers should provide YF vaccine only to persons planning to travel to
areas reporting YF activity or areas in the YF endemic zone. More
information on YF activity and appropriate indications for YF vaccine is
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/yfever.htm>.
A causal association between MOSF and 17DD YF vaccination is supported by
histopathologic studies for 2 cases. Because of a lack of tissue specimens
from most U.S. cases (recipients of 17D-204 YF vaccine), no definitive
histopathologic support for a causal relationship exists. However, the
temporal association with recent receipt of YF vaccine and the similarity
of the clinical presentations in all 4 U.S. cases suggest the possibility
of a causal association. The 17DD and 17D-204 YF vaccine strain genomes
are >99% homologous; however, the strains differ in the amino acid sequence
of some of the structural proteins (9). The pathophysiologic mechanisms
causing MOSF may differ among recipients of 17DD and 17D-204 YF vaccine. To
clearly define a causal association between 17D-204 and MOSF, more tissue
histopathology and molecular virologic studies of specimens from 17D-204 YF
vaccinees with MOSF are needed.
To refine estimates of the risk for MOSF following YF vaccination, enhanced
surveillance is essential. Additional information about this enhanced
surveillance is available at:
