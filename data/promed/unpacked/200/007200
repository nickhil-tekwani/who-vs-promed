A 24-year-old post-graduate student of social work at Madras Christian College [MCC], Tambaram [Tamil Nadu state], died of rabies early on Friday [21 Feb 2014]. He was bitten by a rabid pup on the college campus in November 2013. He was a dog lover.

In November 2013, he and his classmates were walking to their department when they came across the pup. He and a classmate played with the pup, which bit them both. He and his friend went to general physicians to get treated. "The girl's physician recommended that she take the anti-rabies vaccine, but the man's doctor seems to have said a tetanus toxoid shot would suffice," said Durai Jasper, public relations officer of CMC Vellore, who confirmed that he died at the hospital at 1:00 a.m. on Friday [21 Feb 2014].

A post by MCC's department of social welfare on a social networking site on 13 Feb [2014] said the man complained of shoulder pain after 2 days, and his parents took him to a doctor close to their home. The doctor informed them that the man was displaying symptoms of advanced stage of rabies and told them to take him to a government hospital.

[Unfortunately, human rabies cases of canine origin are not rare in India, and a case occurred last year (2013) in Tamil Nadu state. It is not clear why the female classmate was given post-exposure treatment for rabies, but the young man was not. This case underscores the need to have the source of the virus, in this situation the puppy, tested for rabies. Had that been done, the young man undoubtedly would have been treated for rabies exposure.
