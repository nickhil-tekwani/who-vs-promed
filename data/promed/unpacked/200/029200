The Italian veterinary authorities have reported another outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at another commercial layer farm located in Emilia-Romagna.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) received follow-up report no. 1 on Wednesday, 21 Aug 2013.

According to the report, out of 584 900 susceptible birds, one case was identified. No deaths were reported, and no birds were destroyed.

On the basis of the monitoring activities implemented after the detection of the primary outbreak in Ostellato, Ferrara province, notified on 15 Aug 2013, a secondary outbreak has been confirmed in Mordano, Bologna province, affecting a commercial farm of layer hens belonging to the same company.

According to the OIE, in the secondary outbreak HPAI subtype H7 has been detected at RT-PCR and no clinical signs have been identified.

Restriction zone has been established, depopulation will be carried out and epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The depopulation operation in the primary outbreak, in Ostellato, Ferrara province, was completed yesterday, 21 Aug 2013, followed by cleaning and disinfection.

The National Reference Laboratory in Padova confirmed that the virus isolated is an HPAI H7N7 showing an IVPI [intravenous pathogenicity index] of 3.0 [see comment].

Genome sequencing as well as the epidemiological investigation are ongoing.

Preliminary information would suggest that an LPAI virus entered the farm (possibly via wild birds) where it mutated to an HPAI strain.

The source of the outbreaks remains inconclusive.

[The OIE follow-up report, with map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13955. It indicates a single infected bird and includes the following additional information:
1. Affected population
"On the basis of the monitoring activities implemented after the detection of the primary outbreak in Ostellato, Ferrara province, notified on [15 Aug 2013], a secondary outbreak has been confirmed in Mordano, Bologna province, affecting a commercial farm of layer hens belonging to the same company."

2. Epidemiological comments
"In the secondary outbreak HPAI subtype H7 has been detected at RT-PCR and no clinical signs have been identified. Restriction zone has been established, depopulation will be carried out and epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The depopulation operation in the primary outbreak, in Ostellato, Ferrara province, will be completed today [21 Aug 2013], followed by cleaning and disinfection. The National Reference Laboratory in Padova confirmed that the virus isolated is an HPAI H7N7 showing an IVPI of 3.0. Genome sequencing as well as the epidemiological investigation are ongoing. Preliminary information would suggest that a LPAI virus entered the farm (possibly via wild birds) where it mutated to a HPAI strain."

HPAI is characterised by an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2. Technical details on this test are available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.

It would be interesting to obtain details on the background leading to the suggestion that an LPAI H7N7 virus mutated in the 1st farm, becoming HPAI. - Mod.AS
