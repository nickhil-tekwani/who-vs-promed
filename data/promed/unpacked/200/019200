CDC reports rise in resistant _Salmonella_ infections
-----------------------------------------------------
The annual incidence of resistant nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ infections was 40% higher in 2015 and 2016 compared with the years 2004 to 2008, according to a study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

"_Salmonella_ is a major cause of foodborne illness in the USA. Antimicrobial-resistant infections pose a particular threat to public health because they are linked to more severe illness," Felicita Medalla, MD, MS, an epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, told Healio. "For the study, we estimated changes in the incidence of _Salmonella_ infections resistant to antimicrobial drugs recommended to treat severe infections during 2004-2016," Medalla explained. "These data will help public health practitioners set targets and priorities for reducing the number of antimicrobial-resistant _Salmonella_ infections in the USA population."

Medalla and CDC colleagues used models of culture-confirmed _Salmonella_ infections between 2004 and 2016 from 2 CDC surveillance systems to estimate changes in the national incidence of resistant nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ infections. Overall, the researchers estimated that, from 2004-2008 to 2015-2016, there was an estimated 40% increase in the annual incidence of _Salmonella_ infections with clinically important resistance to any of 3 antimicrobial drugs recommended to treat severe infections. Medalla explained that the increase translates to approximately 63 000 more resistant infections per year.

The study also demonstrated that changes in incidence of resistance varied by serotype, with 2 serotypes being responsible for 2/3 of the increased incidence of clinically important resistance during 2015-2016. Additionally, ciprofloxacin-non susceptible infections accounted for more than half of the increase. "An increase in the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant _Salmonella_ infections is a concerning trend. Although most _Salmonella_ infections result in self-limited illness, antimicrobial treatment is recommended for patients with severe infection or at high risk for complications," Medalla said. "Prevention measures that can reduce the risk of _Salmonella_ infection include proper hand-washing, safe food handling, avoiding contact with animals more likely to carry the bacteria (such as baby chicks, turtles), and practicing safe food and drinking habits when traveling abroad."

The serotypes I 4,[5],12:i:- and Enteritidis were the ones responsible for most of the increased antimicrobial resistance increase.

Many cases of human salmonellosis are self-limited and do not require specific antimicrobial therapy but clinicians should be aware of increased resistance in choosing therapy when needed. Ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were the antimicrobials reported on. - Mod.LL
