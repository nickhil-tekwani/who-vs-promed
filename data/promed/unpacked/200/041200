Azerbaijan: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update
--------------------------------------------------
As of 14 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Health in Azerbaijan has reported
its 1st 3 cases of human infection with the H5 subtype of avian
influenza virus. All 3 cases were fatal.
Testing was conducted using a portable PCR field laboratory provided
by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) based in Cairo,
Egypt. NAMRU equipment and staff arrived in Azerbaijan on Monday [13
Mar 2006] to strengthen a WHO team that has been in the country since
late February 2006.
NAMRU-3 serves as a WHO collaborating center for emerging infections.
Test results are considered reliable.
In line with WHO policy, arrangements have been made to send samples
to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for
diagnostic verification and further analysis. WHO will adjust the
figures in its cumulative table of confirmed cases following the
results of this external verification. Test results from the UK are
expected later this week [3rd week March 2006].
H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to cause human
infections. It is highly likely that the H5N1 strain will be detected
in further tests.
2 of the cases were from the southeastern rayon [district] of Salyan, but
resided in different settlements. The cases occurred in a 17-year-old girl,
from Sarvan settlement, who died on 23 Feb 2006, and a 20-year-old woman, from
Daikyand settlement, who died on 3 Mar 2006.
Poultry deaths have been observed in the settlements in recent weeks,
but the cause of death has not yet been determined.
The 3rd case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the central-western
province of Tarter. She died on 9 Mar 2006.
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was 1st reported in the
country, in wild birds, on 9 Feb 2006. Outbreaks in poultry were
reported on 24 Feb 2006 but not in the Salyan or Tarter rayons.
The WHO team, which was augmented on Monday [13 Mar 2006], is
currently investigating the situation in close collaboration with the
Ministry of Health. Heightened surveillance throughout the country
has resulted in the detection of some additional patients with severe
pneumonia, including some recent fatalities. Strengthened diagnostic
capacity within the country is expected to expedite the detection or
exclusion of additional cases.
The Ministry of Health has already introduced a good system of
patient notification, transportation, treatment in isolation, and
tracing and management of contacts. Daily house-to-house surveillance
for cases continues.

[2] Azerbaijan - Deaths take global total over 100

Azerbaijan Deaths Take Global Bird Flu Deaths Beyond 100
--------------------------------------------------------
Avian flu was thought to have claimed another 3 lives in Azerbaijan,
taking the death toll from the virus beyond 100.
The Azeri victims, who died earlier this month [March 2006], fell ill
after contact with sick birds and were not thought to have infected
each other, local health officials said. Azerbaijan, which lies on a
crossroads between Asia and Europe, reported its 1st bird flu deaths
overnight, citing results from tests at a mobile laboratory borrowed
from a U.S. naval facility in Cairo. The World Health Organization
(WHO) said it believed the tests were reliable, adding it awaited
results from a British laboratory before confirming [that] the H5N1 virus
was to blame.
Local officials said they believed the Azeri victims contracted the virus from
sick birds. "The (deceased) fell ill as a result of contact with birds," said
Shyakar Babayeva, head nurse at the Lung Disease Research Institute in the
capital, Baku, where they were treated. "I do not believe the virus passed
from human to human," she told Reuters.
Azerbaijan is located on the Caspian Sea, sandwiched between Russia
and Iran. It also shares a border with Turkey, where 4 children died
from bird flu in January 2006. The 3 victims were from a village in
the Salyan region, in the south of the country near the Caspian Sea
coast.
Details were sketchy, but local media said 2 of them were teenagers,
a girl of 17 and a boy aged 16. It was not clear whether all 3
victims came from the same family.
