A woman in her 20s became the 1st in 2011 to fall ill with [a]
hantavirus [infection] in Weld County, the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment said on Friday [15 Apr 2011]. The woman,
from the south central part of the county, is the 2nd case in the
state this year. Another woman in her 20s in south west Colorado died
[see ProMED-mail archive number 20110409.1105].

Hantavirus [infection] is a respiratory disease [virus] carried by
deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. The mice are commoner in rural
areas but are indigenous to all areas of the continental United
States. Domestic animals are not at risk for hantavirus [infections].


Sara Evans, environmental health manager for the Weld County
Department of Public Health and Environment, said everyone needs to
take precautions if they see any mouse droppings. "If we were to see
the mouse, it's more brown than the typical house mouse, which is
gray," Evans said. "People need to understand they are not going to
see the mouse most of the time. So you have to assume it's a deer
mouse if you come across droppings, just to be safe."

Evans said the Four Corners region of the United States [south
western corner of Colorado, north western corner of New Mexico, north
eastern corner of Arizona, and south eastern corner of Utah] is most
at risk. Weld doesn't always have cases of hantavirus [infections],
she said, but it has seen 2 a year in the past couple of years. In
2010, 5 cases and 2 deaths were reported in Colorado.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus causes death in nearly half of all cases.
Initially, there are no respiratory symptoms, and it begins with a
high fever, severe body aches, a headache and vomiting. The onset of
symptoms can begin 1-6 weeks after exposure, but on average show up
between 2 and 3 weeks, Evans said.

Evans said preventing mice from getting into the home by plugging up
holes with a heavy-gauge steel screen is the best way to avoid
exposure. However, if mice get into the home, the old-fashioned traps
are the best way to catch them. She also said to dispose of the mouse
and trap using a plastic grocery bag and not reuse the trap. "We never
recommend poison because they eat it and go off and die somewhere in
the house, and you're left to deal with that," she said. "Peanut
butter with a little bit of oatmeal that they have to pick off the
peanut butter placed on one of those cheap wooden snap traps is the
best way."

[As is often the case, these types of reports suggest that there is
just one species of hantavirus, when, in fact, there are many, several
capable of causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The virus involved
in this fatal case is most likely Sin Nombre virus.

This afternoon [21 Apr 2011], after having sent samples to the
capital, the Public Health Institute confirmed that a 38 year old
woman from the Maullin community is infected with [a] hantavirus. The
[cause of the] disease had been detected by a rapid test with positive
results and was confirmed by more rigorous tests [in the Institute].
The woman has been interned in the Puerto Montt Hospital since Sun 17
Apr [2011] and there is a slight improvement in her critical state.

[The most likely hantavirus involved in this case is Andes virus.
