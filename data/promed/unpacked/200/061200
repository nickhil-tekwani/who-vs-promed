Abstract
--------
Biotic constraints cause major crop losses and, hence, food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. This study documented farmers' perceptions on the severity of biotic constraints and the impact of related crop losses for the key root, tuber, and banana (RTB) crops (cassava, potato, sweetpotato, and banana) in 2014 in Rwanda and Burundi. Farmers were asked to estimate crop loss due to pests and diseases.

Cutworms and late blight in potato, weevils and _Xanthomonas_ wilt in banana, whitefly and cassava mosaic disease in cassava, weevils and virus disease in sweetpotato were the most predominant reported. Crop losses due to pests and diseases for sweetpotato, banana, potato and cassava were estimated at 26%, 29%, 33%, and 36%, respectively, in Rwanda and 37%, 48%, 38%, and 37% in Burundi.

Pests and diseases reduce the profitability of RTB crops, threaten food security, and constitute a disincentive for investment. Sustainable and affordable integrated pest management packages need to be developed.

[Crop pathogens mentioned above are or are likely to be:
- Potato: late blight, caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_, can cause 100% crop loss in potato and tomato; cutworms are caterpillars of different nocturnal moth species.

- Banana: _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana bacterial wilt (BXW) in central Africa with reported yield losses of up to 90%; the banana weevil _Cosmopolites sordidus_ is considered one of the most serious pests of the crop.

- Cassava: Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and strains in the large genus _Begomovirus_ and has destroyed cassava crops throughout whole regions in the past; whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_) spread CMD as well as other viruses and are also a serious pest of many crops in their own right.

- Sweet potato: a number of species from the genera _Crinivirus_, _Potyvirus_, _Ipomovirus_, _Cucumovirus_, and _Carlavirus_, as well as co-infections of these can affect the crop with a reported yield reduction of up to 60%; the sweet potato weevil _Cylas formicarius_ is a serious pest of the crop worldwide.
