Mystery fever mimicking dengue confounds doctors
------------------------------------------------
The sudden spurt in cases of a viral fever that is resistant to treatment has flummoxed doctors in the city [Ahmedabad, in Gujarat state]. Children are its easy prey. Constant high fever, body ache and -- in some cases -- declining blood platelet count, have made it difficult for doctors to diagnose the causative virus. The common adage, "4 days of rest for viral and then back to work", is now a concept of yesteryears.

Physicians across the city are encountering 30 to 40 such cases a day. Even municipal hospitals, like the VS Hospital in Paldi, are reporting 60 such cases every day.

[The etiology of these cases has not been determined. Dengue is mentioned in the headline, but it is not clear if it has been ruled out by laboratory tests, nor if have any other of the many pathogens associated with febrile disease. The limited information provided does not permit reasonable speculation concerning which agents might be involved in these cases. An earlier series of cases of undiagnosed febrile disease were reported in Tamil Nadu state this year (2013) and in December 2012. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more details, and especially any additional laboratory results for the current outbreak, as they become available.
