Viral Disease Mars Bean Production in East Africa
-----------------------------------
A viral disease is hampering production of common bean (_Phaseolus
vulgaris_) in East Africa, threatening the livelihood of millions of people
who depend on the crop for income and food.
According to a study conducted last year in Tanzania, the disease is caused
by Bean common mosaic [poty]virus (BCMV) and is transmitted by several
aphid species including _Myzus persicae_ and _Aphis craccivora_. Symptoms
of the disease include severe mosaic leaf malformation, plant stunting, and
vein banding.
Researchers said that the virus can also be transmitted through seeds, with
an infection rate of up to 83 percent.
The disease is widely spread in bean plantations, adversely affecting most
people in East Africa, since it is a staple food for most of the people in
the region.
A survey in 2002 of bean crops in the Lake Victoria basin of Tanzania
showed that all surveyed fields were affected by the disease.
Affected plants produced few pods and fewer seeds per pod than the healthy
plants. Although BCMV-resistant varieties have been developed and evaluated
world-wide, farmers in East Africa have not adopted them for various
reasons, including their unpalatability and relatively low yields.

[The fact that farmers in East Africa prefer the currently grown bean
cultivars is not surprising. Traditions die hard! I participated in a
discussion in 1980 in Kenya concerning properties of maize cultivars
adapted to Reunion Island conditions, and the suggestion was made that the
Reunion Island cultivars would supplant the local maize cultivars in Kenya
if they were to be introduced. The decision taken at that time was to stay
with the Kenya cultivars. - Mod.DH]
