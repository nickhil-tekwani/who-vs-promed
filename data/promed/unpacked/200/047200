One more Ebola case has been reported from Nzerekore, where the country's latest outbreak has been under way since the middle of February [2021], Ibrahima Soce Fall, assistant director-general for emergency response at the World Health Organization (WHO), said today [5 Mar 2021] at a briefing.

The new case brings Guinea's outbreak total to 18, which includes 8 deaths. Fall said [that] about 100 WHO staff have been deployed to the region. 8 of the 18 cases were reported in the past week.

Michel Yao, WHO's director of strategic health operations, said the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is stable, but it's too early to say if the situation in Guinea is the same. He said response components are still getting up to speed in Guinea.

The DRC currently has 11 cases, 4 of them fatal. 3 of the cases were reported this week.

ref: Madad S, Spencer C. The USA's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak could have informed its COVID-19 response. Lancet Online First. Published: 5 Mar 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite multiple warnings and the inevitability of infectious disease outbreaks, preparedness has [not received due priority] in the USA. From severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 to Ebola in 2014, the USA has confronted many outbreaks -- each should have served as a wake-up call to the importance of preparedness, knowing that these were not one-off events but part of a looming trend. Since their creation 15 years ago, the International Health Regulations of 2005 have been used 5 times to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Preparedness is, by definition, proactive. Yet the way we often respond to outbreaks is reactive. To reap its remarkable dividends, preparedness must remain an active and ongoing commitment. Investments in preparedness will strengthen health care systems and better protect health care workers all across the globe. Emerging infectious diseases do not respect borders, making it critical that such preparedness happens in unison, with coordination among national and international partners.

Yet, as we have learned with COVID-19, preparedness alone is not enough. During outbreaks, public health experts must be given the platform to provide politicians and the public alike access to prompt and accurate information. As a global community, we must recognise that our response to such outbreaks must be global--no country or community is safe until we are all safe. Outbreaks are inevitable, and it is essential that we recognise these fundamental truths about the role and importance of preparedness before we confront the next pandemic.

There are also clear financial benefits to prioritising preparedness. Since October, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has an interim economic price tag of USD 16 trillion in the USA (1). Had the USA invested just an additional USD 5 per person annually in preparedness (2), both domestically (USD 1.65 billion) and internationally (USD 39 billion), it would have taken 970 years to spend as much on investing in global preparedness as the USA is spending in response to COVID-19.

There are foundational elements in epidemic preparedness that should have been gleaned from the USA's previous outbreak responses and subsequently applied to all future health threats, including COVID-19. 5 lessons learned from the USA's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak should have informed the country's COVID-19 response, given its roles in responding to both epidemics previously and currently.

First, infectious disease outbreaks expose the shortcomings in healthcare systems. The Ebola outbreak pointed to gaps in training and resources as not all US hospitals were ready and equipped to manage a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola. With COVID-19, all 6090 US hospitals became battlegrounds. Given that pandemic preparedness has not been part of routine health care delivery, nor has there been an incentive to build a better infrastructure, there must be specific federal funding allocated that is sustained in perpetuity to ensure biopreparedness. A return to pre-pandemic normal is what got us here in the first place. Americans must invest in long-term solutions, build back better, invest in preparedness, and sustain the gains. Regardless of the cost, this investment will pay massive dividends during the next pandemic.

Second, health care worker safety must be prioritised. Protecting the health care workforce should always be a top priority. Simply put, there is no patient care without providers. Health care facilities that were caring for patients with Ebola had a provider-centred approach, containing the virus within a dedicated unit and with a limited number of health care personnel as part of the care team. With COVID-19, nearly every provider is on the front line and must be supported, and the strategy must be shifted from containment to community risk mitigation. Health care worker safety goes beyond just physical safety. It must also encompass psychological and mental health support.

Third, a coherent national plan is vital to combat a pandemic, and collaboration with national and international partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Agency for International Development, and WHO -- all of whom collaborated at the forefront of the fight against Ebola in 2014 -- is necessary. That collaboration was 2-fold: to work together in mitigation and containment of the contagion, and to share knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned that would better inform processes, public health guidance, and health-care responses. Responding to pandemics by prioritising nationalistic tendencies over global goodwill is doubly damaging -- it undermines the USA's important leadership role in global health, but also makes the USA less safe for Americans.

Fourth, health experts must be placed at the forefront to educate the public. Science and risk communication during a public health crisis is crucial. With every epidemic comes the contagion of misinformation. Health experts, such as those in public health and health-care services have a central role in addressing misconceptions, risk behaviours, preventive measures, and providing the latest science-based information. Although the risk of Ebola transmission within the community in the USA was low in 2014-16, the public perceived the threat as much greater (3), requiring a coherent, one-voice approach from the federal government to better inform the public. COVID-19 is, however, a substantial public health threat with ongoing community transmission in the USA. Sharing conflicting information and largely politicizing the pandemic has led to greater loss of trust in science and life-saving public health measures with constant undermining of public health professionals.

Finally, training and hands-on experience are critical. During the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, academic (medical and public health) institutions across the world contributed faculty and staff to aid the response. This global assistance was crucial to ending the outbreak and provided unparalleled real-world and hands-on experience to thousands of health professionals who would subsequently use those skills to lead future responses at home and abroad. Although case studies and simulated exercises are helpful didactic tools in preparedness and response, they do not reliably mimic the on-the-ground complexity of response activities during a disease outbreak.

Compared with their counterparts across the globe, the academic institutions and public health schools in the USA were more restrictive and less likely to send faculty and staff, often for logistic or legal reasons. This situation meant that the USA had fewer front-line providers with real-life experience in a rapidly changing disease outbreak. Had more Ebola-experienced providers been on the front lines during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we would have responded better, faster, and more efficiently.

The United States, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing more than USD 3.5 million in rapid response Ebola assistance to support efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea. The assistance will support disease surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, contact tracing, community awareness and social mobilization, and logistics management.

On 7 Feb 2021, the Ministry of Health in the DRC confirmed an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu Province. Separately, on 14 Feb 2021, the Guinean Ministry of Health also confirmed an Ebola outbreak. At this time, DRC reports 11 confirmed cases including four deaths and Guinea reports 173 confirmed and probable cases including eight deaths. The US assistance will complement the ongoing response efforts of the governments of DRC and Guinea.

USAID is working closely with other US departments and agencies, US embassies, the ministries of health in Guinea, the DRC, and neighboring countries, WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, the Africa CDC, and other multilateral and bilateral partners to ensure efforts are well integrated and aligned with each country's Ebola response plan. Ending these Ebola outbreaks is a priority for the United States. USAID is committed to helping affected communities control outbreaks quickly and effectively. Swift outbreak control will help prevent the spread to other countries.

Between 2014 and 2020, the US government was the largest bilateral donor to respond to multiple Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and the DRC. The US Government's coordinated, whole-of-government response to the current Ebola outbreaks incorporates lessons learned from past outbreaks, including best practices to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse in response efforts. Affected countries, the United States, and the world are more prepared to cope with infectious disease outbreaks -- including COVID-19 and Ebola -- due to ongoing investments to improve global health security across the region.

[4] IFRC: resistance to response high
Date: Sat 6 Mar 2021 10:18 GMT
Source: Daily Mail, Agence France-Presses (AFP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-9332981/Resistance-Guinea-Ebola-response-remains-high-Red-Cross.html


"What we are seeing on the ground is quite a lot of community resistance and also some religious resistance," [Emanuele Capobianco, the health chief at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)] told AFP [Agence France-Presses] in an interview Friday [5 Mar 2021]. This is not surprising, he said, pointing out that "Ebola is a disease that scares people. It is a dramatic disease that kills a lot."

Ebola, which is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. Death rates are high, at around 50 per cent on average of those infected, and up to 90 per cent for some epidemics, WHO data show.

Guinea recorded new Ebola cases on 13 Feb [2021] near the town of Goueke, in the south eastern Nzerekore region, and declared an epidemic shortly after. To date, 18 cases have been reported, 14 of which have been confirmed to be Ebola, including 4 people who have died, WHO said on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. These mark the 1st Ebola cases to surface in West Africa since a devastating 2013-2016 epidemic that left more than 11 300 dead in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

"There is a lot of anxiety naturally for the comeback of this disease," Capobianco said. "We do have a lot of trauma," he said, adding that in some cases this "actually manifests in some resistance." During the last epidemic, communities across West Africa, but particularly in Guinea, revolted when outsiders in hazmat suits initially arrived to help halt the spread. In 2014, 8 members of an outreach team in the southeastern town of Womey -- just 50 kilometres [31 mi] from the current epicentre in Nzerekore -- were killed by protesters.

The resistance sparked a shift in the response, with more efforts made to engage communities and seek assistance from traditional and religious leaders in explaining the disease and the necessity of the measures taken. And IFRC, which is deeply involved in many aspects of the response, helped develop an approach to burying people possibly carrying Ebola safely while still respecting traditions as far as possible.

People infected with Ebola are at their most contagious right after death, making traditional funeral practices that often include washing, touching, and kissing dead bodies dangerous. The current outbreak in Guinea, for instance, began when several people were infected at the funeral of a 51 year old nurse, who was the 1st known case.

But Capobianco said IFRC were running into resistance when seeking to conduct so-called safe and dignified burials of anyone who dies in communities where Ebola is spreading. Such burials "have a massive impact in terms of reducing transmission", he said, adding though that "we have not always been able to perform (them) because the community simply refused to have the burials performed by the Red Cross teams."

While this was worrying, Capobianco stressed that the resistance was "a problem that can be solved. It can be solved by listening to the communities, by reflecting on their fears, by explaining what this disease is, and by showing that actually people are not condemned to death by having Ebola," he said. Those battling Ebola in Guinea today had tools not available during the last epidemic, including vaccines and therapeutics driving down the fatality rate, he said.

More than 1600 people, including contacts of cases, their contacts, and health workers have been vaccinated so far, according to WHO. Capobianco said the 1st IFRC health workers received their jabs on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. "This time we have tools that are very powerful that we can deploy," he said. "As long as we can win the communities over and ensure they are part of the response, we should be able to bring this under control."

[5] Nigeria: alert
Date: Sat 6 Mar 2021

The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recently disclosed that the country is at moderate risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak. The Centre also said that Nigeria is in such a situation due to her proximity to Guinea after an outbreak was declared in that West African country on 14 Feb 2021. According to the NCDC, many cases and deaths were reported in the Nzerekore region of the country. At this time Nigeria is still battling with the COVID-19 pandemic.

We recall that the dreaded Ebola virus was introduced into Nigeria on 20 Jul 2014 when an infected Liberian arrived by air in Lagos. He died in a Lagos hospital 5 days later, and set off a chain of transmission that infected a total of 19 people of whom 7 died including the doctor who diagnosed him [with] the disease.

According to WHO recommendations, the end of an Ebola virus disease outbreak in a country can be declared if no new cases [have been reported for] 42 days. The 42 days represents twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola (21 days). This 42 day period starts from the last day that any person in the country had contact with a confirmed or probable Ebola case. Consequently, on 20 Oct 2014, Nigeria reached that 42 day mark and was considered free of Ebola transmission.

However, since February last year [2020], the country has been battling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else around the world, it has impacted negatively on the economic and social life. As at [4 Mar 2021], Nigeria had 156 960 coronavirus cases, 1939 deaths, and 135 812 recoveries. In the considered opinion of this newspaper, Nigeria cannot afford to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola at the same time. It will, without doubt, be a very dangerous combination with unimaginable negative impact that may lead to a total collapse of the nation's health system. Sadly, most health challenges have been relegated to the background since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Ebola cannot be joined in the mix and that is why we cannot afford to treat the NCDC warning about the disease with levity.

To be sure, Ebola virus, officially called _Zaire ebolavirus_ (EBOV) [infection], is an infectious disease that can affect both humans and animals. The disease is rare but very severe and potentially lethal. In Africa, more than half of the infected do not survive. After being infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms occur within 2-21 days. Usually, the 1st signs occur within a week. Ebola often starts with symptoms of severe flu or malaria: diarrhoea, fatigue, vomiting, muscle pain and headache.

Also, the Ebola virus attacks the immune system, once infected, the virus spreads and multiplies at lightning speed. It causes bleeding in various places in the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. It can be transmitted through body fluids. The Ebola virus is transferable through direct contact with (any kind of) body fluids, such as blood, saliva, or faeces. To prevent further spreading of the virus, it is important to avoid any kind of direct body contact with patients. Rapid patient isolation is, therefore, necessary and essential. The virus does not spread through the air or mosquitos. Ebola is still very difficult to battle: no specific cure or medical treatment is available yet. New treatment methods and the use of vaccinations are currently still in the experimental phase and therefore not yet available to everyone. In view of the foregoing, we call on the federal government to increase surveillance at the nation's international airports and land borders with heavy traffic.

It is gratifying to note that the NCDC has laid out plans to forestall the Ebola outbreak in the country. Already, the Centre claims "Several measures have been put in place to prevent and mitigate the impact of a potential EVD outbreak in Nigeria. A National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) operating from NCDC's Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) is on alert mode. We have a team of first responders on standby, ready to be deployed within 24 hours in the event of an EVD outbreak in Nigeria. We have also established testing capacity for EVD at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory. The NCDC will continue working with states to strengthen preparedness activities across the country."

In our opinion, these measures by NCDC are proactive enough and will need to be sustained. What is required at this time, in our view, is intensive public enlightenment campaign to educate the populace to be on the lookout for any possible index case. This is not only important but also urgent.
