Norwalk Virus Outbreaks Continue to Affect Canadian Hospitals
-------------------------------------------------------------
Norwalk virus struck back with a vengeance at Cambridge Memorial
Hospital [Ontario] this weekend, forcing officials to restrict access
to emergency care. Since early last week, 65 staff members have
developed the fast-moving illness that causes severe vomiting,
diarrhea, and cramps. The latest outbreak struck on Saturday night
mainly among emergency room staff. "We've never seen anything like it
in our hospital," said Dr. Verne Glavin, an infectious disease
specialist at the hospital. "It's a nasty virus." Last week's
outbreak, which caused the closure of 2 hospitals units and the
cancellation of in-patient surgery, was expected to pass over the
weekend. But late Saturday night, several nurses developed the highly
contagious virus [infection].
Though there are still 30 patients with confirmed Norwalk virus
infection, Glavin said the main problem is a lack of staff. Once a
staff member becomes ill, they can't return until at least 2 days
after their symptoms dissipate. The hospital has room for more
patients, but just doesn't have enough staff to monitor the beds,
Glavin explained. Hospital officials debated closing the emergency
room because of the lack of nurses, but decided for the sake of
public safety to limit service to patients requiring urgent care.
Until staff are back on their feet, Glavin said people with
non-urgent problems are asked to seek care at other hospitals or
clinics. Visitors are also being restricted to close family members
to prevent further contamination.
Grand River Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital remain clear of Norwalk
virus infection and are helping pick up the slack until the virus
passes, hospital officials said last night. A small outbreak at
Freeport Health Centre in Kitchener last week also appears to be
over. Cambridge has re-opened the pediatric ward, which was the first
hit with the virus. But the medical unit is still closed, except to
patients who already show signs of the virus. In-patient surgery
continues to be postponed.
The viral infection, which usually lasts 24 to 48 hours, has spread
across southwestern Ontario causing hospital ward closures in
Toronto, Hamilton, Brantford, and Niagara. The reason for the
outbreak continues to puzzle medical professionals, Glavin said. "Why
Norwalk? Why this year? Nobody knows." Cambridge hospital experienced
a Norwalk virus outbreak a few years ago, but it was highly isolated
and passed quickly. The force with which this outbreak has spread
caught everyone off-guard and will be a valuable lesson for the
hospital, which already has strict sterilization procedures, Glavin
noted.
