Wheat killer spreads from East Africa to Yemen -- new partnership
formed to monitor and prevent spread of dangerous fungus
---------------------------------------------------------
A new and virulent fungus that attacks a wide range of wheat
varieties has spread from East Africa to Yemen on the Arabian
Peninsula, FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organization) reported today
[12 Apr 2007].
The wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_), also known as wheat black
rust, is capable of causing severe losses and can destroy entire wheat fields.
It is estimated that as much as 80 percent of all wheat varieties
planted in Asia and Africa are susceptible to this new strain. The
spores of wheat rust are mostly carried by wind over long distances
and across continents.
"Global wheat yields could be at risk if the stem rust spreads to
major wheat producing countries," said FAO Director-General Dr Jacques Diouf.
"The fungus can spread rapidly and has the potential to cause global
crop epidemics and wheat harvest losses of several billion dollars.
This could lead to increased wheat prices and local or regional food
shortages. Developing countries that are relying on wheat and do not
have access to resistant varieties will be particularly hit," Dr Diouf said.
FAO has joined the International Center for Agricultural Research in
the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT), which are leading the Global Rust
Initiative (GRI), an international consortium to fight the spread of
rust fungus diseases around the world. Canada, the United States, and
India are the main donors to the GRI.
Ug99
------
The new pathogen first emerged in Uganda in 1999, and is therefore
called Ug99. It subsequently spread to Kenya and Ethiopia.
A recent FAO mission in the field has confirmed for the first time
that Ug99 has affected wheat fields in Yemen. It appears that the
Ug99 strain found in Yemen is already more virulent than the one
found in East Africa. Samples of the pathogen were sent to the United
States and Canada for further analysis. There is a high risk that the
disease could also spread to Sudan.
Past epidemics
--------------
Wind-borne transboundary pests and diseases can cause serious damage
to crop production.
In the late 1980s, a virulent strain of yellow rust, a wheat disease
similar to stem rust, emerged in East Africa and crossed the Red Sea
into Yemen. It then moved into the Near East and Central Asia,
reaching wheat fields of South Asia within 4 years. Major yellow rust
epidemics were recorded with wheat losses of more than one billion US dollars.
Based on monitoring of Desert Locust pathways, FAO does not exclude
that wind currents could carry Ug99 stem rust spores from Yemen
northwards along the Red Sea to Egypt or through the Saudi Arabian
Peninsula towards countries in the Near East.
On alert
--------
FAO urges affected countries and countries at risk to increase their
disease surveillance.
Yemen in particular should be on the alert, step up field monitoring
and training and prepare for direct control interventions in disease
hot spots. Most important, control measures in affected countries
should include the introduction of more resistant wheat varieties and
restricting planting dates to break the disease cycle.
FAO, ICARDA, and CIMMYT will support countries in developing
resistant varieties, producing their clean quality seeds, upgrading
national plant protection and plant breeding services and developing
contingency plans.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_. It
occurs worldwide throughout wheat producing areas. Grain is shriveled
due to the damage to the conducting tissue of the stems. Yield losses
of up to 70 percent occur, some fields are totally destroyed.
Dispersal is by wind and with infected straw. New races are emerging
with increased virulence against resistance genes previously used for
breeding new wheat cultivars -- see
<http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=14649> for an overview.
The most threatening appears to be strain Ug99.
