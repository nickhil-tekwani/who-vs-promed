AEDES AEGYPTI - GREECE: ABSENT

In an earlier posting on the history of dengue hemorrhagic fever (Dengue,
DHF/DSS: etiology: Correction 991103144632) Moderator Jack Woodall commented
"Perhaps one of our knowledgeable readers would like to update us on the
_Aedes aegypti_ situation in Greece and the potential for a repeat [of the
DHF/DSS outbreak in Athens in 1928]."

Samanidou Voyadjoglou, A. Darsi_R_F_Jr (1993) An annotated checklist and
bibliography of the mosquitoes of Greece (Diptera:Culicidae),
Mosq_Systematics, 25(3):177-185
This paper is a checklist giving 7 genera, 15 subgenera, 53 species and
2 subspecies known to occur in Greece or that the authors believe will be
found. Notes are given on distribution and bionomics. The authors
mention that _Ae. aegypti_ was, at one time, widespread [in Greece] but
none were found during a 1992 survey by the authors.
In 1997, the same two authors (J. Am. Mosq. Control Assoc. 13(3):247-254)
provide keys for the identification of mosquitoes in Greece and make the
same statement as in their 1993 paper. They added that they think _Aedes
albopictus_ will soon be found in [Greece].
I have seen no recent reports of _Ae. aegypti_ in Greece but [the
mosquito] would find larval habitats suitable for it. Holstein, in 1967,
thought the species was only present in Turkey at that time but it is
periodically found almost everywhere in the Mediterranean basin and has
been reported since that time from Italy (1972) and Israel in 1975. There
have been no further reports from either country that I am aware of.

_Aedes aegypti_ has not been collected in Greece for many years
[Samanidou-Voyadjoglou and Darsie (1993) Mosq. Systematics 25:177-185], or
elsewhere in countries adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea.
For information concerning the distribution of _Ae. aegypti_ in southern
portions of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin prior to 1945, see Figures
5-A through 5-D in:
Mitchell, C.J. (1995) Geographic spread of _Aedes albopictus_ and
potential for involvement in arbovirus cycles in the Mediterranean Basin.
J. Vect. Ecology 20:44-58.
_Ae. albopictus_, a vector of dengue viruses, is present in Albania and
Italy.
For a recent review of the current status of _Ae. albopictus_ in Italy, see:
Romi, R., M. di Luca, and G. Majori (1999) Current status of _Aedes
albopictus_ and _Aedes atropalpus_ in Italy. J. Amer. Mosq. Control Assoc.
15:425-427.

[So, unless _Aedes aegypti_ is in Greece but has not been identified there
recently, or it invades Greece, or another competent vector is in Greece or
invades Greece, there is little likelihood that we will see a repeat of the
earlier dengue epidemics in Greece. - Mod.CHC]
