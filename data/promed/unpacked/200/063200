A fresh positive polio case was detected in Afghanistan's eastern province of Kunar, bringing the number of confirmed cases of poliovirus to 8 since January this year [2019], a public health official said on Wednesday [29 May 2019]. "A new polio case has been reported from Watapur district of Kunar province which permanently paralyzed a 3-month-old boy," Wahidullah Mayar, spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health, tweeted.

The latest case is the 1st case from the eastern Afghan region this year [2019], and the rest of 7 cases have been reported from southern provinces, he added. Poliovirus can be rapidly transferred, and the only way [to prevent the disease] is vaccination, according to the official.

The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country, as more than 1 million children from areas inaccessible to vaccination teams missed the latest vaccination drive.

[As this media report is based on a governmental announcement, I suspect this case will be in next week's global update, providing information on the date of onset of paralysis. It is noteworthy that this is the 1st case reported in Kunar province this year (2019). This represents the 8th case of WPV1-associated paralysis reported by Afghanistan with date of onset since 1 Jan 2019.

Poliovirus weekly update, 29 May 2019, WHO
---------------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 2
Environment: 8

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 1
Environment: 3

Headlines
- Following the group's meeting earlier this month, the latest report of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee is available online. The committee evaluated the latest global poliovirus epidemiology and concluded that the effort to eradicate polio remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/public-health-emergency-status/.

- In Cameroon, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was detected from an environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only; no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. See "Lake Chad basin" section below for more details.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Afghanistan - 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample;
- Nigeria - 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive environmental samples;
- Somalia - 1 cVDPV2 case;
- Cameroon - 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample; and
- Iran - 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week [see section [1] above for details of a newly confirmed case announced 29 May 2019]. There are 7 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Hilmand province, collected on [25 Apr 2019].
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week from North Waziristan, KPTD (with onset of paralysis on 3 May [2019]), and Dera Ismail Khan (DI Khan), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (with onset of paralysis on 5 May [2019]), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 to 19. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 12.
- 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 4 from greater Karachi and 1 from Hyderabad, Sindh province, and 1 from Multan, Punjab province, all collected in early May [2019].

Nigeria
- 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Kwara state, collected on [24 and 27 Apr 2019]. There are 8 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported in the country since the one detected from Borno state with a date of onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- Recent confirmation of spread of the cVDPV2 outbreak, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- In Cameroon, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was detected from an environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only; no associated cases of paralysis have been detected.
- The affected province borders Borno, Nigeria, and genetic sequencing confirms it is related to cVDPV2 circulating in neighbouring Nigeria. This outbreak originated in Jigawa state and had previously spread to other areas of Nigeria, as well as internationally to the Republic of Niger.
- Cameroon had already been participating in outbreak response to the Nigeria cVDPV2 across the Lake Chad subregion.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required.
- This event further underlines the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 across the Lake Chad basin.
- In Niger, the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with a focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). So far, 1 cVDPV case has been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri; and Kasai.

Horn of Africa
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week from Togdher, Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [21 Apr 2019], bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in Somalia in 2019 to 2.
- The Horn of Africa is affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 14 cVDPV cases (7 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks.
- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Iran
- 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Sistan and Balochistan province, collected on [11 May 2019]. In total, 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported this year [2019], both from the same province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[Reading the global report from this past week, I found myself very disconcerted about the status and prospects for global eradication of polio. There continue to be cases of WPV confirmed in the known endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan). In addition, there continue to be positive environmental samples in geographic zones in these countries, where recent cases have not been identified in these countries, and a 2nd positive environmental sample was identified in Iran. These positive environmental samples serve as indicators of WPV1 circulation in the geographic areas where the samples are taken from.

With respect to the cVDPVs, the situation is analogous to that seen with the WPV1. While only one new AFP case has been officially confirmed in the past week (Somalia), there was a report yesterday [29 May 2019] of another cVDPV2 case occurring in the Central African Republic (see Poliomyelitis update (40): Central African Republic (MP,UK) cVDPV, WHO, RFI 20190529.6493464 for details); there have also been positive environmental samples in Nigeria and Cameroon, with the latter identifying a cVDPV2 genetically related to the cVDPV2 outbreak ongoing in Jigawa, Nigeria (with prior known spread to Kwara state, Nigeria, and Zinder region of Niger). As it takes an estimated minimum of one year of circulation of a VDPV before it reverts in neurovirulence to a cVDPV and has enhanced human-to-human transmissibility (a virus that can cause AFP in susceptible individuals infected with the virus and is easily transmitted through the same transmission routes of the wild poliovirus), as long as any form of OPV is in use (monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent), the risk of silent circulation of the vaccine virus(es) in susceptible individuals (increasing globally related to civil unrest, where infrastructure is weakened, the global antivaccer movement, and campaign fatigue after 20-plus years of countrywide vaccination campaigns) and the risk of development of cVDPVs will continue.

So where are we now, and what needs to be done to ensure interruption of transmission of poliovirus (wild and vaccine derived) globally? There are now 12 countries that have reported either positive AFP cases for WPV or cVDPV and/or have reported positive environmental samples for WPV or cVDPV.

Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, while there was civil unrest in the Americas' region, the anti-vaccinate movement was much smaller and localized to the northern countries in the region, and both sides of the ongoing conflicts were willing to put down their munitions and guarantee safe passage for vaccinators to reach populations in the conflict zones with the vaccines. Transmission of the WPV in the region (both WPV1 and WPV3) was successfully interrupted (the date of onset of the last case of WPV was 20 Aug 1991 in a Peruvian child). The world has changed, and in areas of civil unrest, warring factions are preventing vaccination activities and spreading rumors of western and/or governmental plots using the vaccines against the populations, vaccination workers are being injured and killed during their activities, and the global antivaccer movement has discovered social media and is introducing scare tactics into the usually well-protected populations and reducing the vaccination acceptance rate among previously accepting populations.

Where are the social scientists, the medical anthropologists, sociologists, and those working with humanitarian crises?
