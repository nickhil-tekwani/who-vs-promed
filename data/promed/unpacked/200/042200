Soybean rust - Zimbabwe: first report in 2004 [edited]
------------------------------------------------------
This is just to inform everyone that soybean rust [caused by _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_] has been confirmed today (23 Jan 2004) within the Lions' Den
area of Zimbabwe in several commercial plantings. This is the first
confirmation of the disease for this season. There is also an unconfirmed
report in the Kwekwe area (I am awaiting samples).
Although the level of severity at Lions' Den is very low, initial infection
is likely to have taken place at least 15 days ago under very dry, hot
conditions. The disease, however, will most likely spread very rapidly on
any unsprayed crops under the very wet, humid conditions that are now
prevailing.
Farmers who have not already started spraying are urged to follow fungicide
control recommendations as soon as possible to avoid yield loss.
