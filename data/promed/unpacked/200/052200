In the little town of Castiglione di Cervia (province of Ravenna,
Italy), since mid July 2007, several people have been attended at the
hospital and health centres with high fever and arthralgia, joint and
muscular pain, severe headaches, body aches and, in some cases, a
rash was also noted.
Since the beginning of August 2007, an increasing number of febrile
syndromes associated with arthralgia have been recorded in the
general population of the area. Initially, only dozens of residents
were infected; now that number has jumped to about 100-150. Many of
the sufferers are already better, but the number of new infections is
still on the rise.
The patients had been suspected of being infected with chikungunya
virus based on the clinical presentation. Health authorities had
fumigated the village to kill the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes that
infest the area, had taken blood samples from patients, and sent the
samples to the laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita --
E0-ISS (the leading technical and scientific public body of the
Italian National Health Service). However, we have not yet received
the results of the lab tests.
Castiglione is few km south southeast of Ravenna, in Emilia Romagna
Region, Italy.

[There have been numerous cases of chikungunya virus infection
imported into Europe within the past 2 years, originating in the
massive Indian Ocean outbreak. Until this current suspected outbreak
in Italy, none of the importations has resulted in subsequent
transmission of the virus. It is not surprising that a chikungunya
virus outbreak has likely occurred in a European area where a
competent mosquito vector, _Aedes albopictus_, is abundant. This
should serve as a warning for other localities where this mosquito is present.

[By the clinical description, this could also be dengue, which is
also vectored by _Aedes albopictus_. Dengue is imported all over
Europe & to the USA by travelers -- see ProMED 2006 & 2003 archives
below -- just waiting for its chance to get into a competent vector
in the northern summer season. - Mod.JW]
