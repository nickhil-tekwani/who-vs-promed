13 cases of undiagnosed disease, 4 of them fatal, have occurred in the last
3 months on Barra do Caboclo, a farm in Pancas, 190 km from Vitoria, capital
of Espirito Santo State, NE Brazil.
Reported by Teresa Cristina Cardoso, epidemiology coordinator for SESA
(State Health Secretariat).
Differential diagnosis: spotted fever or leptospirosis.
Laboratory results on blood specimens from residents of the farm & farm
animals: one case positive for _Rickettsia rickettsii_, the agent of spotted
fever; 4 cases positive for _Leptospira interrogans_ [it was not stated
whether these were all from patients.
Symptoms: for spotted fever, high fever, red blotches on the skin, headache,
vomiting & body pain. For leptospirosis, fever, diarrhea, renal failure,
bleeding, severe body pain, headache & vomiting. [This is a description of
the classical symptoms; the report does not specify which of them were shown
by the patients.
Transmission: spotted fever is carried by the star tick, which is common on
capibaras [aquatic rodents as big as the average dog which share the
pastures of the farm with the cattle.

[Dr Luiz Jacintho da Silva, ProMED-PORT moderator, comments that hantavirus
infection is another possible diagnosis, also spotted fever is probably
under-diagnosed in Brazil, and if only autopsies had been done (rare in
Brazil) they should have provided a definitive diagnosis.
Spotted fever is known as Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the USA. It also
occurs in Canada, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil & Argentina.
The rash may be hard to see on dark skin. It is treatable with tetracycline
drugs.  Mod.JW
