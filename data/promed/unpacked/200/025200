A comment
---------
It is a mistake to blame the lack of latrines for hepatitis E, which is
transmitted primarily by animal feces, not human feces. It means that the
water supply is not being well protected from contamination and the
authorities should address that rather than fining individuals without
latrines.

It can also mean that people are eating salad vegetables -- that have been
fertilized with animal feces -- raw.

We have seen multiple cases of hepatitis E in wealthy expatriates in China
who ignore the old rule: "Peel it or Cook it or Forget it."

[While it is true that identification and characterization of swine
hepatitis E virus in several countries and their close relationship to
locally characterized human hepatitis E virus isolated in the same areas
indicates that it is a zoonotic virus, it is still likely that transmission
in human communities in Africa is predminantly waterborne. In background
data derived from the Gideon Database (see: Hepatitis E virus - Sub-Saharan
Africa 20080305.0909) hepatitis E virus infection was considered to be
water-borne in 4 of 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Construction of efficient latrines is an essential factor in the provision
of clean water supplies. - Mod.CP]
