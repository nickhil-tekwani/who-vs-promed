Table 3. As of 1 Mar 2014, 9 cases of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever [VHF]

[Table 3 is titled "suspected cases", so it is not certain if these 9 cases are confirmed. Additional information would be of interest for the 9 VHF cases such as locations, dates when infection occurred or was diagnosed, ecological setting where the infection occurred, rodent reservoirs likely involved, and sex/age of infected individuals.

Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever is caused by Guanarito virus, a rodent-borne virus. Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever has occurred sporadically in that country, with a 40 per cent case fatality rate. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally convulsions.

Guanarito virus is an arenavirus related to 3 other South American arenaviruses that are of significant public health concern: Machupo virus (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Junin virus (Argentinian hemorrhagic fever), and Sabia virus (Brazilian hemorrhagic fever).

The rodent reservoirs of Guanarito virus are the Alston's cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ (see image at http://www.planet-mammiferes.org/Photos/Rongeur/Myomo/Sigmod/SigmAls2.gif) and the short-tailed cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ (see image at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/Heideman_Paul/Zygod_brevicauda/medium.jpg).
