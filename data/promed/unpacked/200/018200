I'm wondering what type of brucellosis this is. _B. melitensis_? _B. abortus_?

1. Serological tests were done only with _B. abortus_ antigen.
2. There were some doubts regarding species identification in some cases,
but at least in 26 cases we were sure that the isolates were _B. abortus_.
3. In India there is no reference laboratory for _Brucella_ and we are the
only persons working on human brucellosis not only in Calcutta but probably
in Eastern India.
4. Our initial investigation regarding the sources of infection indicates
possibility of its spread through intake of foot washings of deities in
temples where raw milk is frequently used along with water. But the
progress of our work is very slow as this is not a project work and we are
studying this with our personal interests.

[The original report in this thread, cited above, indicated that a total of
77 cases had been identified from 1995 to date. Thus, Dr. Das indicates
certainty about the identification of _Brucella abortus_ in about one third
of the cases. - Mod.ES
