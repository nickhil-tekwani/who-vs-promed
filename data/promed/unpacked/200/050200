Orange County [OC] health officials are reporting the discovery of a 2nd rabid bat in the last month [September 2022].

A bat found Thursday [29 Sep 2022] outside the main lobby of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Building on Alton Parkway in Irvine has tested positive for rabies, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.

Given the location and circumstance, the OC Health Care Agency urged residents to be on alert and avoid contact with any bats.

"Contact with bats should be avoided and any potential bat bite should be discussed with a medical provider," the agency said.

Anyone who may have had physical contact with this bat or who saw someone else having contact with the bat was asked to call the agency's Communicable Disease Control Division at 714-834-8180 to determine the risk for rabies.

Owners of pets who may have had contact with this bat should contact their veterinarian.

On 14 Sep 2022, a bat found in a parking lot at Pickleball Court No. 1 at the Fountain Valley Tennis Center on 16400 Brookhurst St tested positive for rabies.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, the rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, being infections almost always fatal unless treated. Also, a dog, cat, or ferret infected with a bat rabid virus can infect a human, so keep your pet's vaccination against rabies updated. - Mod.PMB
