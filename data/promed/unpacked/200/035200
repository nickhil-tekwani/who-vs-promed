Agriculture Minister Mustafa Tasar disclosed that part of the wheat grown
in the Marmara region is not fit for consumption because it contains a
carcinogenic substance called Aflatoxin due to a plant disease caused by
too much rainfall.
He made that announcement 15 days after the Soil Products Office (TMO) and
private dealers started buying this year's wheat crop from the producers.
During the 15-day delay, the contaminated wheat was sold, mostly to mill
owners who would grind it and sell it to bakeries and to animal feed dealers.

[Aflatoxin is produced by a fungus that grows on spoiled crops, famously
including peanuts (groundnuts). This is a sad story that points out the
importance of reporting infectious diseases & toxins as soon as possible to
avoid widespread infection or intoxication; something that we hope
