A batch of Danish pigs has been diagnosed with influenza A H1N1, or
the more appropriately nicknamed swine flu.

The Danish Food and Veterinary Administration (DFVA) has confirmed
that about 3000 piglets and 700 sows from 2 mid-Zealand pig farms have
tested positive for the virus.

The DVFA has restricted the movement of animals from the affected
farms for a period of a week until all signs of the infection have
disappeared.

Thousands of people have been infected with the virus over the last
year, and veterinary experts have warned that poor hygiene among some
farm workers could be to blame for passing the virus on to the pigs.

The spread of the virus within pigs is not uncommon, and many other
countries, including Norway and Britain, have already experienced
outbreaks.

[The Danish Veterinary Services notified the OIE on 9 Jan 2010 of 2
outbreaks of "Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) (New Unknown Disease)"
in pigs. The reason for reporting was said to be "Emerging disease."
For the report with map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_imm_0000008838_20100109_145846.pdf>.

Since mid-2009, the following 19 countries have already reported
pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) in animals to the OIE: Argentina,
Australia, Canada, Chile, China (People's Rep. of), Chinese Taipei,
Finland, Germany, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea
(Rep. of), Mexico, Norway, Russia, United Kingdom, United States of
America. Denmark has become the 20th. Undoubtedly, pandemic influenza
H1N1 infections in animals, of human origin, have occurred in many
other countries but remained undiagnosed or not notified.

Singapore detected the infection in pigs imported from Indonesia (see
20090904.3114). - Mod.AS]
