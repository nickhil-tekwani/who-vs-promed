Democratic Republic of Congo: monkeypox outbreak in South-Central region
------------------------------------------------
A monkeypox virus epidemic has been reported near Mbuji Mayi [which is
located in the South-Central region of the Democratic Republic of Congo].
More than 50 people have been [treated at the] Kanama health center, but no
deaths have been reported.
The provincial health inspection office has reported 56 cases, which
include 14 children of less than 5 years and 2 of other age groups. All
these victims are from Kanama in the Kabinda District of the central region
of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

[Human infection with monkeypox virus has been reported in rural areas of
the tropical rain forests of west and central Africa, especially in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. The signs and symptoms are similar to those
of smallpox, with generalized pustular rash, fever, and toxemia. The
disease, which is rare, became apparent only after the eradication of
smallpox. Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic agent and is acquired by humans
through direct contact with the presumptive natural hosts: squirrels and
monkeys. Person-to-person transmission has been recorded, but the secondary
attack rate is low. Nonetheless, the fear has been expressed that monkeypox
might evolve to become an endemic human infection. Determination of the
complete sequence of the genome of monkeypox virus, however, has indicated
that monkeypox virus lacks some of the immunomodulatory genes possessed by
smallpox virus, which suggests that monkeypox virus is unlikely to become
endemic in the human population.
In a comment relating to an outbreak in the same region of the Democratic
Republic of Congo in the year 2000 (see: Monkeypox - Congo, Dem. Rep.
(Mbuji-Mayi): comment 20000506.069), Francois Merouze wrote that:
"Monkeypox is a zoonosis among African tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_,
_Funisciurus_). Human cases happen by direct contacts with sick animals.
Human to human subsequent cases are not very frequent. The usual mode for
this disease is anademic. There is no really prove[n] example of an
important outbreak of monkeypox. The clinical diagnosis of monkeypox is not
so easy, and chickenpox can be mistaken for monkeypox. Moreover, varicella
(chickenpox), which is considered as an ordinary mild disease, can wear a
very different clinical aspect and even be a fatal disease for an
immunodepressed organism. In DRC, the prevalence rate of HIV is quite high."
It would be relevant to know whether chickenpox virus (a herpesvirus) has
been excluded as the possible cause of this outbreak, since chickenpox is a
vaccine-preventable disease. - Mod.CP]
