Many cattle have been killed by an unknown disease at K Leihaoram village located within Ukhrul district but close to Nongpok Sekmai of Thoubal district. The matter came to light when a team of the United Naga Council (UNC) visited Kasom Khullen block.

More than 60 cattle have been killed during the past 3 weeks. With the villagers unable to bury all the carcasses, many of them were disposed of on road sides and other vacant places. As the carcasses have started decomposing, a very offensive stench has enveloped the whole village.

Although the cattle were quite healthy, they grew weak suddenly and died. However, the villagers are yet to inform the veterinary department about the mass deaths of the cattle.
