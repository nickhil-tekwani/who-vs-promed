The [incidence of gastroenteritis and cholera, which have begun to spread
in the capital [during [recent has been increasing [daily. The number
of patients admitted daily to the infectious disease hospital at Teku has
already [exceeded seventy. Of them, symptoms of cholera have been noted
in twenty-one patients.
In the Kanti Children' Hospital, fifty patients suffering from
gastroenteritis are admitted daily, out of whom the symptoms of cholera
have been seen in twenty-nine patients. [This compares to one week ago,
[when 35/40 children [were admitted in Kanti Children's Hospital and the
symptoms of cholera were noticed among sixteen patients.
The situation was the same in the Teku Hospital a week ago. According to
[the Director of Teku Hospital, Dr Tarananda Jha, the reason behind this
epidemic is polluted water. "Lack of awareness about the effect of stale
food has attributed to the cause of this epidemic." Dr. J. K. Dhakwa of
Kanti Children's Hospital, Gastroenteritis Section expressed similar views
Guardians of the patients have complained of a lack of proper services to
patients in the government hospitals of Kathmandu. So far only forty beds
are available in the Teku Hospital. However, the pressure of patients is
double. Dr Jha said the hospital has managed to provide extra beds as well
as regular doctors and nurses.
There are only thirty beds available in the Kanti Children's Hospital but
fifty patients come daily for treatment.
