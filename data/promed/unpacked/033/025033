The number of Vietnamese localities stricken by foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] has declined to 6 now from 17 early last month, local
newspaper People said on Wed, 25 Oct 2006.
As of 24 Oct 2006, a total of 439 cows, bulls and buffaloes and 27
pigs in the 4 northern provinces of Thai Nguyen, Ha Giang, Son La &
Lang Son, and the 2 central provinces of Ha Tinh & Quang Ngai were
infected with the disease, the newspaper quoted the Department of
Animal Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development as reporting.
Vietnam is intensifying control over cattle transport and trade in
affected areas, surveillance of the disease, and vaccination of
healthy animals.
Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the
government in 2005, the country will, by 2010, have 35-40 million
pigs, 6.5-6.7 million bulls and cows, 2.8-3 million buffaloes, and
380-390 million poultry.
