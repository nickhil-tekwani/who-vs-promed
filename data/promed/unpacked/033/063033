State wildlife managers are puzzling over the deaths of javelinas in the
Tucson area that could be the result of the same bacteria that causes food
poisoning in people.
Since November 2004, at least 35 javelinas have been reported dead by
hunters and residents throughout the Tucson basin. The animals are
suffering from gastric bleeding, diarrhea, runny eyes, and damaged lungs.
Officials with the Arizona Game and Fish Department say the problem is
serious enough that they just earmarked USD 10 000 to get to the bottom of
it. They haven't yet alerted the public because they're still figuring out
what they're dealing with -- and haven't wanted to cause alarm.
The last time a disease killed off significant numbers of javelinas, it was
distemper in the early 1990s, said Elissa Ostergaard, an urban wildlife
specialist with Game and Fish in Tucson. But none of the current dead
javelinas has tested positive for distemper.
Some but not all of the dead animals have tested positive for salmonella,
which are bacteria people can get from eating undercooked chicken or raw
eggs, and another type of bacteria called clostridium, which causes gastric
symptoms a lot like the [protozoa] giardia and is linked to food poisoning.
Lisa Shender, a veterinarian and a wildlife specialist with Game and Fish
in Phoenix, said it's unlikely that people would become exposed to either
type of bacteria unless they actually ate an infected animal. Depending on
the strain of clostridium, pets or livestock could be affected if they're
exposed to contaminated feces or watering holes. Still, she says, "I
haven't come across too many animals that have died from this."
Jim deVos, chief of research for Game and Fish, said people would be wise
to steer clear of sick javelinas -- but he sees no cause for alarm. "We're
not finding it in any other wildlife species," he said. "We're not getting
reports of pets getting affected. In our mind, it hasn't risen to the point
where we need to provide a health advisory."
Ostergaard said the javelinas are probably being exposed to the bacteria
through feces, perhaps at watering holes. "If there's a pond that livestock
can stand in, they could get it from that," she said. What's not clear is
why the animals are dying from bacteria that they may normally encounter in
the wild. It's possible that a particularly virulent strain is making its
way through the javelina population -- or that some other more elusive
disease agent is weakening the animals so that they're more vulnerable to
the bacteria. It's also possible that some environmental stressor is
weakening the population.
Although the animals have been dying for some time, deVos says it has only
been recently that his agency has been able to secure reliable samples.
That's because after a few days, carcasses become hosts for many bacterial
types -- and it's hard to tell what caused problems for the living animal.
And because wildlife tend to try to hide from predators when they're sick,
it's difficult to find a fresh disease victim. So far, a lab at Colorado
State University in Fort Collins has ruled out both distemper and hog
cholera, another early suspect.
On Tuesday, Game and Fish received an otherwise healthy javelina that was
injured to the point that it could not be released in to the wild. They've
taken tissue samples from that animal to address the question of whether
salmonella and clostridium indeed occur naturally in wild javelinas.
As more samples come in, Game and Fish intends to continue sending samples
to Colorado and to veterinary labs at the University of Arizona for
testing. Whatever is causing the deaths, it's cutting fairly wide swaths
through the herds it hits. "I'd say where this has been affecting the
javelinas, in each herd it's killed anywhere from 2 to 12 javelinas,"
Ostergaard said. "There are times when we've found 6 to 10 javelinas dead."
Ostergaard said she's not concerned yet that the disease could jeopardize
the javelina population as a whole. "Javelina have only been in the Tucson
area 200 or 300 years, and are expanding their range northward," she said.
"They're pretty adaptable and able to do pretty well." The animals are
probably good for the environment because they help spread the seeds of the
cacti they eat, and may help dig out water sources that benefit other
wildlife, she said.

[The javelina is also known as the collared peccary, _Tayassu tajacu_. It
resembles a wild pig, in that it has cloven feet, a pig-like snout and
coarse, thinly distributed hair. But its physiology differs from that of
pigs. Their main food is prickly pear cactus, or other succulent cacti, and
they are desert dwellers. They are fascinating to observe, as they are both
affectionate to their family members and fiercely protective of them. -
