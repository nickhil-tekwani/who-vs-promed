Dengue in Venezuela is showing an increase, as in other parts of Latin
America. From the beginning of the year until March 15th, 2,166 cases were
reported, 489 (23%) of which were hemorrhagic disease.
[This is a huge percentage of hemorrhagic cases, and suggests that either
DHF -- dengue hemorrhagic fever -- is being overdiagnosed, or that dengue
cases are being drastically under-reported. Can someone tell us whether
Venezuela is using the PAHO case definition for DHF? Low platelet count
alone is not sufficient - Mod.JW
Infection rates (per 100,000) in various states are: Lara (36.6), Falcon
(17.8), Merida (16.3), Yaracuy (12.9), Barinas (10.8), Aragua (10.6) and the
Distrito Federal (9.9); overall the national rate is 8.8.
Investigators in the National Institute of Hygiene (NHI) note that the
epidemic is principally due to serotype II. Although serotype III has not
been demonstrated, its
presence is not discounted; it exists in Central America.
The increase in the population of _Aedes aegypti_ [the mosquito that carries
dengue has been due to neglect ... of control [activities according to
Jesus Querales, chief of the Diagnostic Division of the NHI. Clinical
surveillance should be continued throughout the year rather than simply
reacting to outbreaks, affirmed Querales. The Panamerican Health
Organization (PAHO) has a plan for the elimination of _A. aegypti_ from the
continent. From 1948 to 1972, this mosquito was eradicated from 21 nations
of the Americas, but almost all have been reinfested. Despite Venezuela's
having subscribed to participation in the plan, Querales emphasized that it
will not be easy. "These are very costly campaigns, and the mosquitos do not
recognize borders."
