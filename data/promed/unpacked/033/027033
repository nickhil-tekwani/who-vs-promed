WHO Update number 149
---------------------
Summary
-------
-- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains at low levels, with sporadic activity reported in
Canada, the United States of America, and some European countries.
-- Countries in the tropical zone mostly reported low influenza
activity except Costa Rica, primarily influenza A(H3N2), and Cameroon,
which is experiencing transmission of A(H3N2) following on recent
peaks of A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B.
-- Influenza activity in the temperate countries of the southern
hemisphere is at inter-seasonal levels.

Sporadic reports of influenza activity have been reported in the
temperate areas of northern hemisphere, though no country has yet
crossed it's seasonal threshold. Canada reported localized influenza
activity in 8 regions, 3 outbreaks of influenza or influenza-like
illness (ILI), and 3 influenza-related hospitalizations. In the United
States, nationally, ILI consultations remained below the baseline and
the percentage of samples positive for influenza was <2 percent, with
sporadic detections of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza type B. In
Europe, consultation rates for ILI continue to be low but 9 countries
have reported increasing trends. Only 1.8 percent of sentinel
laboratory specimens tested were positive for influenza; A(H3N2) was
the most common virus identified. Influenza activity in north China
increased slightly as compared to the previous week with influenza
type B as the predominant type.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas
----------------------------------
No notable influenza transmission has been reported in the majority of
the Caribbean and Central America with the exception of Costa Rica,
which has continued to report increasing numbers of influenza A(H3N2)
detections.

Sub-Saharan Africa
------------------
In sub-Saharan Africa, only sporadic detections of influenza viruses
were reported with the exception of Cameroon. Influenza type B
transmission began in June in Cameroon and appears to be declining
overall since peaking in early September. Transmission of influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09, which began about 6 weeks after influenza type B,
appears to have peaked in early November, coincident with a rise in
influenza A(H3N2) detections, which appears to be peaking only now.
Sierra Leone, which has recently begun influenza surveillance,
experienced a peak of A(H3N2) transmission in late August, which has
now subsided. Kenya has reported continuous detections of influenza
viruses throughout the year, which is now predominantly A(H3N2) with
smaller numbers of A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza type B.

Tropical Asia
-------------
The overall influenza activity in the tropical Asia remained low with
some notable localized areas of transmission. India has reported
influenza type B circulation since September. In Lao People's
Democratic Republic, 11 of the 88 samples were tested positive for
influenza A(H3N2) during 20-26 Nov 2011. Transmission of the
previously reported A(H3N2) in Thailand has now returned to very low
levels of virus detection. Other countries of southern Asia continue
to report small numbers of both A(H3N2) and influenza type B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America
-------------
In the temperate regions of South America influenza activity has
declined to inter-seasonal levels. Paraguay and Chile reported low
numbers of influenza A(H3N2).

Southern Africa
---------------
Influenza detections in this region are at very low levels.

Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific
----------------------------------------
In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity is now at
inter-seasonal levels. As was seen in the last year, inter-seasonal
low level activity persists in Australia with low detections of
influenza type B and A(H3N2). In the Pacific Islands, there was
sustained levels of activity in American Samoa, Fiji, Marshall Islands
and Northern Mariana Islands.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response
System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member
States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and
quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

situation. Other maps and graphs (real time) are available at the WHO
website.

Influenza transmission remains low or at inter-seasonal levels
throughout the world. Influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B appear
sporadically with no predominance of the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The
Northern hemisphere vaccine is well matched to the influenza strains
currently in circulation.
