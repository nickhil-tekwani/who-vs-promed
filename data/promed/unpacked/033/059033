Hundreds of pigs dying recently in the Mekong Delta, supposedly of
foot-and-mouth disease, could actually have contracted [hog] cholera.
Sai Gon Giai Phong newspaper quoted Bui Quang Anh, head of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's Animal Health
Department, as saying that initial tests on dead pigs from Tien Giang
and Long An provinces indicated cholera. The flurry of inoculations
against bird flu had diverted attention from pigs which also needed
vaccinations against cholera in winter, he added.
Since the middle of [December 2005], around 380 pigs have died in
Tien Giang province, mostly in Cho Gao district. Neighboring Long An
also saw many pigs dying.
Dinh Van The, head of the Long An Department of Animal Health, said
categorically there was no prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease.
However, Le Van Tai, a quarantine officer in Cho Gao district, told
Thanh Nien that several pigs in Tien Giang tested positive for
foot-and-mouth disease and were destroyed on the spot.
Nguyen Van Khang, director of the province's Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development, has promised assistance of 70-80
percent of the value of culled pigs.
On Wednesday the central Animal Health Department sent a mission to
the 2 provinces to vaccinate and test pigs. If found infected with
foot-and-mouth disease, they would be culled immediately and affected
areas isolated, Anh promised.
Sick pigs have been shipped illegally to Ho Chi Minh City for sale in
the past few days, Phan Xuan Thao, deputy head of the city Department
of Animal Health, said. The ailing pigs were bought cheap from the 2
provinces and resold at much higher prices -- in some cases, 10 times
higher -- in HCMC after their diseased parts were cut off to give the
impression they were healthy, Thao added.
Since late 2003 mouth-and-foot disease had broken out on a small
scale in several places in the Mekong Delta but was quickly
controlled, the central Department of Animal Health said.
The pig die-off comes in the wake of a "pig flu" outbreak in China,
which is alleged to have exported a large number of sick pigs to Vietnam.

[At this time we must accept, with caution, the official diagnosis of
CSF. The anecdotal report of FMD in Tien Giang may be no more than
that. According to OIE, CSF occurs widely in significant numbers
every year in Vietnam though they carry no reports of it there for
2005. Apparently this is the 1st report in SE Asia in about a year.
Obviously the disease is under-reported. The final statement, "The
pig die-off comes in the wake of a 'pig flu' outbreak in China,"
raises a number of questions though again it may just reflect the
quality of the journalistic reporting. - Mod.MHJ]
