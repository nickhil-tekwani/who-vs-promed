A Torrance County woman was in critical condition Fri 21 Jul 2006
with the state's 5th human plague case of 2006. The bubonic plague
case was confirmed by the state Health Department, which said it was
the 1st case from the central New Mexico county in 2006.
New Mexico has had one plague death so far in 2006. A woman from
Bernalillo County died of the septicemic form of the plague in May
2006. The other 3 victims, a Bernalillo County teenager, a Santa Fe
County man and a San Miguel County child, all recovered.
The Department of Health was investigating the Torrance County
woman's home to determine whether the area poses a continued risk for plague.
"Plague infection continues to be prevalent in rodents, especially in
north-central counties in New Mexico," state Epidemiologist C. Mack
Sewell said.
