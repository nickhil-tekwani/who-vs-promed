Lumpy Skin Disease in South East Europe: Outbreak Assessment 2 (updated 4 Jul 2016)
----------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
Lumpy skin disease is causing more outbreaks in the South East Europe region, with Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Serbia reporting outbreaks, while further afield, outbreaks have also been reported in Russia and Turkey.

In Bulgaria, there have been nearly 200 affected herds, with around 10 percent morbidity (high temperature and skin nodules). Greece has reported nearly 70 outbreaks this year [2016]. Macedonia has reported 335 outbreaks and around 5 percent morbidity, while Kosovo has reported just a single outbreak this week. Russia has reported over 50 outbreaks (10 percent case fatality rate). Serbia has reported over 80 outbreaks, again with low morbidity rates. Turkey has reported nearly 80 outbreaks this year [2016]. Disease control measures are in place, including movement controls and culling infected animals [a map included, presenting current outbreaks in Europe].

2. Situation Assessment
The disease continues to spread across the Balkans, and more outbreaks can be expected. As with any vector-borne disease, movement restrictions and even culling susceptible animals alone will not be able to prevent spread, while vector control is too problematic to implement over large regions. Vaccinating such large numbers of susceptible animals will also depend on vaccine availability for authorised products. EU control measures are based on Council Directive 92/119/EEC; however, this is a relatively new disease to the European region, and these control measures would benefit from being reviewed in light of the current epizootic. As disease spreads, this is becoming a priority for member states as well as countries neighbouring the EU.

The UK Met Office provides the UK Government with weather predictions for up to 3 months in advance, and current forecasts suggest that above average temperature conditions for the region are set to continue, which will mean more outbreaks are likely.

3. Conclusion
Although the risk of introduction of LSD into the UK remains very low and has not significantly increased as a result of these outbreaks in South East Europe, it highlights the general concerns for the region with respect to transboundary diseases and ability to control vector-borne diseases. We will continue to monitor the situation.

[Lumpy skin disease is a growing concern in Europe. A new initiative called Standing Group of Experts on Lumpy Skin Disease in South East Europe (hereafter referred as SGE LSD) was launched on 4-5 Jul 2016 under the GF-TADs (FAO/OIE Global Framework for the progressive control of Transboundary Animal Diseases) umbrella to build up a closer cooperation among affected countries and thereby address the disease in a more collaborative and harmonised manner across the region and discuss common/harmonized mitigation measures based on scientific and technical grounds.

The Standing Group of Experts on LSD builds on the successful experience of a similar mechanism for African swine fever in the Baltic and Eastern Europe region established in 2014 (see http://tinyurl.com/j4cyebm).

The LSD SGE is chaired by the President of the GF-TADs for Europe. The members are the LSD-affected and at-risk countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Kosovo, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Russia. There are observers from other European countries.

A 1st meeting of LSD SGE was planned to take place on 4-5 Jul 2016 in Brussels, Belgium. Its objectives were to set up the Standing Group of Experts on LSD, provide a 1st update of the situation in each country, provide general recommendations for the region, and agree on agenda, date and venue of the next meeting (SGE LSD2) to be held before the end of 2016.

The web-site of LSD SGE includes, at present, the following presentations, which may deserve the attention of interested subscribers:
- 17 countries' presentations (Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Kosovo, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey);
- 3 expert presentations (LSD Epidemiology, LSD Laboratory diagnosis, LSD Control and eradication);
- FAO presentation on LSD,
- Outcomes of the joint EFSA-SANTE workshop (11-12 May 2016) and recent EFSA activities on LSD.

The LSD SGE web-site is available at http://web.oie.int/RR-Europe/eng/Regprog/en_GF_TADS%20-%20Standing%20Group%20LSD.htm. - Mod.AS]
