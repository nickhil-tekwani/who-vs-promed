DOH 2 says measles outbreak in Santiago City [Isabela province] now contained
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cagayan Valley Department of Health has allayed fears of the public of
possible spread of the measles disease in the region saying the reported
measles outbreak in Santiago City, has been contained through mass
vaccination conducted by the city health officials.

Floro Orata, Health Education Promotions officer of DOH-CHD [Department of
Health-Center for Health Development] confirmed that at least 7 cases were
reported to be positive of measles disease from January to March this year
[2010]. "One measles case can be considered as an outbreak, if there is no
occurrence of the disease in the past years," he explained.

Orata explained the measles that affected the city is also known as rubeola
[not to be confused with rubella, or German measles. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ], one
of the most highly communicable infectious diseases. "It can spread through
airborne droplets, and direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of
infected persons," the health educator further explained.

The symptoms of measles include a fever for at least 3 days duration, and
the 3 C's -- cough, coryza (runny nose), and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The
fever may reach up to 40 deg Celsius (105 deg F). Those infected are
usually contagious from 4 days before onset of signs or symptoms, and until
4 days after the onset of signs or symptoms.

Orata warned the public, especially parents, to stay vigilant as children
aged 9 months and below are the ones mostly affected by the said virus. He
urged parents to have their children vaccinated with measles virus vaccines
before they reach their 1st birthday. "Measles infection may occur in
infants below 15 months of age so it is advisable to give the vaccine to
infants at an earlier age," Orata added.
