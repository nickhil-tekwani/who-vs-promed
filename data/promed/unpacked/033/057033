UK wheat faces threat of new brown rust race
--------------------------------------------
NIAB [National Institute of Agricultural Botany] is investigating the
possibility of at least one new race of brown rust on UK winter wheat
following this year's [2011] severe disease epidemic.

The UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey received an unprecedented
number of brown rust samples. Although it is still very early to
assess the epidemic's impact, most winter wheat varieties were
affected at some level. "Brown rust appeared in mid-June [2011] and
developed explosively over just a few weeks in some areas," says Dr
Rosemary Bayles, NIAB.

Samples were received from many of the most highly-rated varieties for
brown rust resistance. This suggests the emergence of one or more new
races of the rust, warns Dr Bayles. NIAB are now analysing [fungal]
isolates from various resistant varieties to check for new races. For
variety Stigg, Dr Bayles confirms that an isolate collected in the
field was able to overcome the variety's resistance in seedling
tests.

"This is evidence that we are dealing with a new race on this variety.
Further tests are in progress to fully identify the race and assess
which other varieties may be at risk," says Dr Bayles.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_ (previously _P. triticina_). Related pathogens
affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic
potential of the plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40
percent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on
leaves, stems, and later on heads. Infection of the host can occur in
as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic severity
increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" suddenly
during favourable weather.

Spores are produced as the crop ripens and are spread by wind and
mechanical means. The fungus is not soil-borne. It needs living tissue
to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in
soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a
"green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease
management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of
crop cultivars, and control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring
is important for early discovery of infection so action can be taken
to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

Monitoring programmes have been established in many affected areas to
detect emerging new strains. As mentioned above, both pathogenicity
tests and molecular data are needed to confirm any new strains.
