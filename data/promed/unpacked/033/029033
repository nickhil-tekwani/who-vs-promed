More than 100 cattle producers including major studs face a nervous wait in coming days to learn if they face trading restrictions or the possible eradication of cattle following the detection of Bovine Johne's disease [BJD] in Central Queensland on Monday [26 Nov 2012].

Queensland biosecurity officers are tracing the movement of "substantial numbers" of cattle from Rockley Red Brahman Stud at Bajool near Rockhampton where the disease was detected, to determine how far it may have spread.

Bovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that can cause emaciation and death in cattle, but poses no risk to human health.

The detection announced yesterday [27 Nov 2012] represents the 1st significant case of BJD in Queensland, which is classified as a 'Protected Zone' under the National Bovine Johne's Disease Plan.

While BJD has been reported in the state previously, earlier cases have been limited to small detections in dairy herds on the Atherton Tableland and Darling Downs.

This latest event is significant because it involves a stud and substantial movements of cattle to other properties during the potential infection period, including to other major stud and commercial cattle enterprises in Queensland and interstate.

Biosecurity Queensland said the Rockhampton stud herd appeared to have been infected for "many years", but the original source of the infection was not clear.

"These movements are being traced and risk assessments will be undertaken to determine the potential spread of disease," Biosecurity Queensland said in an official statement notifying of the disease [included in the original article at the source URL above].

Queensland's chief vet Rick Symons told ABC Radio the stud had been placed in quarantine and that Biosecurity Queensland would be contacting about 160 cattle producers who had purchased cattle from the stud.

Rockley is one of central Queensland's best known and respected red Brahman studs and regularly features among the top prices at the annual Rockhampton Brahman Week bull sales.

[One of the owners] told Beef Central the detection has forced the stud to shut down its herd bull operation. "We're just working through a process now to try and get some paddocks free so we can do our IVF [in vitro fertilization] work so down the track we can have a stud again," he said. "We still have our genetics but it will all have to be through embryo and IVF to keep it going, without that herd bull market behind you, it makes it harder."

Cattle Council of Australia animal health, welfare, and biosecurity advisor Justin Toohey urged producers who may be contacted as part of the trace back and trace forward program to "take it slowly" and not to make any rash production decisions.

"The advice to producers who think they are a trace property is to take a few deep breaths, do not go out and cull anything, just settle back and wait for proper technical advice and take it from there," Mr Toohey said.

Biosecurity Queensland offered similar advice: "It is very important that any producer who holds cattle from this property seeks advice from their private veterinarian or Biosecurity Queensland. Producers are strongly advised not to cull these cattle, as that could result in lengthy delays in resolving the risk of infection." Once trace properties are identified, testing will commence to verify if BJD is present in each property's herd.

A culture test which is considered the most effective of the 3 available diagnostic tests for BJD takes between 6 to 8 weeks to produce a result.

Under the National Bovine Johne's Disease Program affected producers are eligible to receive to receive up to AUD 11 000 [about USD 11 500] in cash, including GST [goods and services tax], to assist with the costs of testing to determine their status.

Where BJD is identified, Biosecurity Queensland said it will work with property owners to develop a plan "to manage and eradicate the disease from the property while retaining the leading genetics of the herd."

Mr Toohey said the question of whether properties would face trading restrictions if found to have BJD would rely largely on the level of infection.

He added that in many cases in the past, trace properties were not affected by the disease.

"In the southern states when we have had this sort of incident before we have found very low incidence of the disease in the trace properties, and that is a possibility here," Mr Toohey said.

"That is an optimistic view, however you always need to plan for the worst."

As a Protected Zone Queensland is likely to favour eradication where possible, but Mr Toohey said that decision would ultimately come down to how many properties are identified and what the likely cost will be.

BJD can take 3 to 4 years to manifest itself in animals infected with the disease, adding to the complexity of the current traceback program in Queensland.

Mr Toohey said the National Bovine Johne's Disease Plan was based on the premise that BJD is a disease worth stamping out and/or restricting.

While sheep producers now have access to the Gudair Vaccine to limit the potential of ovine Johne's disease to shed and spread, there is currently no vaccine approved for preventative use against the closely related bovine Johne's disease in the cattle industry.

Research work aimed at developing a cattle vaccine for Australian producers is currently underway at the University of Sydney.

[Bovine Johne's disease is caused by _Mycobacterium avium_ subsp. _paratuberculosis_.

Johne's disease (JD) is a serious disease of cattle, sheep, goats, alpaca, llama, camels, and deer. It produces chronic diarrhoea or ill thrift, leading to emaciation and eventually death.

There are 2 known strains of the organism:
- a cattle strain, which infects mainly cattle, alpaca, goats, deer, and camels to cause bovine Johne's disease (BJD)
- a sheep strain, which infects mainly sheep and goats to cause ovine Johne's disease (OJD)

This is a notifiable disease under legislation.

Young animals are infected by ingestion of _M. paratuberculosis_ either when suckling their dam or grazing contaminated pasture. The bacteria invade the mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes. After a period of time, usually years, infected animals may develop clinical signs.

Clinical signs of JD infection are a gradual loss of bodyweight despite a normal appetite. During a period of several weeks, diarrhoea develops in cattle, but not routinely in sheep. Animals showing signs of disease will inevitably die. There is no treatment.

The bacteria may be found in the colostrum, milk, and faeces of infected animals. Apparently healthy carrier animals with no signs of disease as well as clinical cases can shed the organism.

Bacteria are transmitted from an infected female animal to its off-spring in colostrum or milk or from faecal contamination of the teats and udder. Ingestion of contaminated food or water can also cause infection.

Bacteria survive in faecal material and on pastures where other animals can pick up the infection. In wet conditions, bacteria can survive in the environment for up to a year.

Blood and faecal samples are collected from live animals to test for JD. The blood test is rapid but unreliable as an individual animal test because false positives and negatives can occur. The blood test is suitable only as a herd test. Faecal culture provides a reliable result but the test takes up to 3 months to complete. Tissue samples of the small intestine can be collected at autopsy for histological examination and culture.

There is no treatment for JD and animals showing clinical signs inevitably die. A vaccine is available to aid protection against ovine Johne's disease (OJD) in sheep and goats, and one is being developed for use in cattle.

Since laboratory tests for JD are unreliable or take a long time to complete, eradication of the disease is not easy. Leaving properties or paddocks empty of stock for a period of time can eliminate the bacteria from the environment. The period of time will depend on environmental conditions.

A National Johne's Disease Control Program (NJDCP) has been in place in Australia since 1996. Specific control and management plans are available for OJD and BJD. The Australian Johne's Disease Market Assurance Program, an audited quality assurance program, incorporates animal health risk assessment, testing, and movement controls. It provides a source of low-risk animals for the various industry sectors in the jurisdictions where the disease is known to occur.

Whenever Johne's disease is detected, all opportunities for spread into and within Queensland are investigated. Biosecurity Queensland conducts these tracing activities to protect the livestock industries against the impacts of further spread.

Veterinary practitioners may be called to provide investigative services to their clients.
