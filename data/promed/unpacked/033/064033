Last night [Wed 14 Mar 2012], the Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture reported that 3 cats which had been roaming around H5N1-infected turkey farms in the Moshav Shalva and had died were sent to the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan and found to be infected by the disease. Reportedly, they died from eating dead birds; farmers argued that the cats ate the dead turkeys prior to the diagnosis of the disease and to culling [this timetable was doubted by experts. - Mod.AS].

In light of this information, a visit was paid to the village by the Veterinary Services; additional cats were found roaming around the infected [now empty] premises. Several of these cats had signs of illness. It was decided that cats within and around the infected farm will be trapped, humanely killed and sent to the laboratory for testing.

It is estimated that about 30 straying, un-owned cats have been exposed to the virus in Shalva.

Owners of cats in the village have been advised to see that their pets are kept indoors, prevented from exiting their residences and from roaming around.

The Ministry of Health said that although there is no scientific evidence that the disease can pass from cats to humans, local residents are asked to avoid contact with stray cats or carcasses of cats and to inform the local veterinary services about any cat in Shalva showing disease signs.

[The 1st Israeli cases of feline H5N1 may be attributed to 2 main factors:

1. The very dense population, in Israel, of stray (non-owned) cats. Numbers of such animals have significantly increased in Israel during recent years due to pressures as well as some legislative measures initiated by several animal protection groups, which have rendered stray cats the status of a protected animal. Estimations of the numbers of stray cats in Israel vary between a minimum of 250 000 and as any as one million animals (the human population is about 7 million).

2. Culling and burial procedures may have allowed the stray cats access to cadavers.

The situation of stray cats entering residences, particularly kitchens, has become a common phenomenon in Israel. The public health services will have to tackle this issue, particularly in areas prone to or around avian influenza occurrence.

Previously, H5N1 was found to affect domestic cats and wild felids in several countries, including Thailand, [China] and Indonesia -- see 2004 archives below.

Israel has never suffered a human case of avian influenza. - Mod.AS
