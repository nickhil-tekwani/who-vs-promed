Agriculture damage in Candaba alarming
--------------------------------------
Agricultural crop damages involving thousands of hectares have
reached an alarming stage, with most farmers incurring close to a
million pesos [about USD 23 000] in losses due to fungus and rust on
their crops.

The president of Pansinao Corn Growers Cooperative said the earnings
of growers have decreased by 50 percent. They could no longer finance
another planting season if their problems are not addressed by
government.

Corn smut or _Ustilago maydis_ is the most common fungal disease of
sweet corn and develops during hot, humid weather. Rust on sweet corn,
caused by the fungus _Puccinia sorghi_, is spread by red, wind-borne
spores. Some 20 000 hectares [about 49 000 acres] of land are
involved.

[Boil smut
----------
Boil (or common) smut of maize is caused by _Ustilago maydis_. It
attacks any above-ground part of the plant to form blisters or galls
containing black spores. Mature galls can grow as large as 20 cm
(about 8 in) in diameter. The yield of affected cobs is very low. They
may be toxic to livestock but are eaten in South America as
'huitlacoche' (Mexican corn truffle), which consists of the immature
fungal galls and is considered a delicacy.

Spores can be spread by wind, seed, on clothes or farm machinery, and
can survive in the soil for many years. Disease management includes
plant hygiene measures, crop rotation, seed treatment with fungicides
and use of resistant crop cultivars.

Common rust
-----------
Common rust of maize is caused by the fungus _Puccinia sorghi_. Yield
losses of over 50 percent have been reported. Symptoms include dark
brown pustules on both leaf surfaces; leaves may turn chlorotic and
die prematurely reducing photosynthetic ability, and therefore
infection before grain fill has been completed is more damaging to
yield than infection late in the crop cycle. But rust development is
much more likely in pre-tassel stage plants because a large whorl
provides a humid environment, and young leaf tissue is more
susceptible to infection than emerged leaves.

_P. sorghi_ has a complex life cycle and requires _Oxalis_ species as
alternate hosts to complete its sexual phase. Spores are wind
dispersed over vast distances. Urediniospores can overwinter in warmer
regions where they serve as the primary source of inoculum in
subsequent seasons. Crop varieties with different levels of resistance
are available and more are being developed.

The related species _P. polysora_ causes southern rust (also called
polysora or tropical rust) of maize.
