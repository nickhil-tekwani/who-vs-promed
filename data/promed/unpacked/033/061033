Foot & mouth disease virus type SAT2 - South Africa (in the FMD control area)
------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease in South Africa
reported to the OIE: February 2001).
Information received on 12 August 2003 from Dr Emily Mmamakgaba Mogajane,
chief director, Agricultural Production, National Department of
Agriculture, Pretoria:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 7 August 2003.
Date of laboratory confirmation of diagnosis: 9 August 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: 30 July 2003.
As a result of the ongoing surveillance in the FMD Buffer Zone, cases of
FMD have been detected on the outer edge of the Buffer Zone, in the north
eastern corner of the country, between the Limpopo River and the Kruger
National Park (KNP) fence, at the Tsikuyu- and Bend Mutale areas.
Location of the outbreaks:
22ยบ 22' S - 30ยบ 56' E
22ยบ 25' S - 31ยบ 03' E
Number of cases: at least 6 cases were initially detected.
Source of agent / origin of infection: suspected contact with African
buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) carriers.
Control measures: movement controls have been intensified. All animals in
the surrounding areas will be revaccinated. Meetings with adjacent
communities were held to increase awareness and encourage people to bring
animals for vaccination.
The event can be regarded as an isolated incident. The cases occurred
within the FMD Control Area and thus do not affect the export status of the
FMD Free Zone of South Africa.

[This report provides information on the virus strain, SAT2 and we must
assume the 6 cases reported here are in cattle. However, the first of the
recent outbreaks occuring in KwaZulu-Natal was in a piggery in September of
2000. The next 2 incursions of FMD in November of 2000 and February of 2001
were the result of contact of buffalo from the Kruger National Park getting
past the barrier fence and making contact with cattle in the buffer zone.
This is probably more of the same but we will keep you posted.
The outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal , September 2000 and Mpumalanga Province
November 2001 occurred in the disease free zone. Disease free status
without vaccination was restored by OIE in May of 2002. For details and
interesting maps, see the reference in the previous posting which I repeat
here for your convenience: Foot and mouth disease: the experience of South
Africa. GK Bruckner, et al. Rev Sci Tech Off Int Epiz 2002; 21(3): 751-64
