_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ infection is well known to occur in
cetaceans, and there are even reports of its transmission from cetaceans to
humans. These include a report in the French literature of 4 students who,
bare handed, took samples from a dead, beached whale, _Globicephala melas_.
The following day, all 4 students developed clinical illness compatible
with infection due to _E. rhusiopathiae_, which was isolated from the
whale. No attempt was made at
isolation from the students:

A veterinarian, who performed a necropsy on 2 dying Atlantic bottle nosed
dolphins and whose rubber gloves became torn during the necropsy, developed
swelling and pain of fingers that may have been due to _E. rhusiopathiae_,
which was isolated from 1 of the 2 dolphins, although cultures from the
veterinarian were not reported:
