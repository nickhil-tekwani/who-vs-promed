FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, CATTLE - BRAZIL: CORRECTION

[I am grateful to Dr. Peter Mason of USDA, currently in Brazil for the
following correction on our report dated 7 Apr. My interpretation of OIE
information on this history of FMD outbreaks was in error; the history was
for the region only. -DP

I am a scientist working at the USDA's laboratory that deals with FMD, and
was quite interested to read the attached ProMED-mail posting. However, I was
quite shocked to see it included information that is quite incorrect.
The outbreak in Mato Grosso do Sul is the first outbreak in 4 years in
that region of the country, but it is most certainly not the first
outbreak in Brasil in the last 4 years!
I believe that FMD remains an important problem in many countries in
South America (including many regions in the North of Brasil), and I
think that your posting may minimize appreciation of both the impact of the
disease, and the difficulty of eradication.

[It is a measure of the success of the Brasilian FMD eradication programme
that Mato Grosso, which for many decades was the FMD reservoire for the
country and FMD regularly spilt over into the other states via replacement
stock, had gone four years without a case of FMD. The southern states of
Brasil are now essentially free of FMD. - Mod.MHJ
