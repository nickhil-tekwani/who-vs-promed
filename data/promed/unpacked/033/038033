Abdul Moiz Khan, Sheikh Raza Shahzad, Muhammad Farhan Ashraf and Usman Naseer. Powassan virus encephalitis, severe babesiosis and Lyme carditis in a single patient.
--------------------------------------------------
Abstract
_Ixodes scapularis_ is responsible for transmission of _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _B. miyamotoi_, _Babesia microti_, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and Powassan virus to humans. We present a case of an 87-year-old man who presented with fever and altered mental status. Initial workup revealed haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatitis and acute kidney injury. Patient tested positive for _B. burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_, and was started on doxycycline, atovaquone and azithromycin. He also underwent exchange transfusion twice. After some initial improvement, patient had acute deterioration of mental status and appearance of neurological findings like myoclonus and tremors. Therefore, testing for arboviruses was done, and results were positive for Powassan virus. During a protracted course of hospitalisation, patient required intubation for respiratory failure and temporary pacemaker for unstable arrythmias from Lyme carditis. Patient developed permanent neurological deficits even after recovery from the acute illness.

[Infection with 3 tick-borne pathogens simultaneously is unusual. _Ixodes scapulars_ is a vector for all 3 pathogens involved in this case. One does not know whether one individual tick delivered all 3 pathogens in this case or more than one individual tick was involved. Development of neurological sequelae in individuals with Powassan encephalitis is not unusual. Approximately half of patients surviving clinical encephalitis have neurological deficits following acute infection with Powassan virus.

Although the abstract does not indicate the geographic location of this case, the authors are associated with Internal Medicine in the Albany Medical Center Hospital, Albany, New York, USA, and the presumption is that the patients is from this general area in New York state. Cases of Powassan encephalitis have occurred sporadically in New York state, including a fatal case this year (2019) (see Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (03): (NY) 20190804.6605639). - Mod.TY
