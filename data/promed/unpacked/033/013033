Hong Kong SAR: local case of Japanese encephalitis confirmed
------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) is investigating a case of Japanese
encephalitis in a 38 year old local woman living in Fairview Park, Yuen
Long. Serology tests on her blood samples yielded positive result for
Japanese encephalitis virus infection. A DH spokesman stated today (Wed 5
Nov 2003) that: "Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted by the bite of
infective mosquitoes. Person to person transmission does not occur."
The woman developed fever, headache, and drowsiness on 25 Oct 2003. She
consulted a doctor and was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on 27 Oct 2003.
She is now under intensive care. The level of risk to the population at
this present time is judged to be low. Nonetheless, the DH is conducting
investigation to search for further possible cases. This is the 1st
Japanese encephalitis case reported this year. Investigations by the DH
revealed that the patient had no travel history within 2 weeks of the onset
of illness. Therefore, the case has been classified as a local one.
Prompt control actions have been carried out by the Food and Environmental
Hygiene Department (FEHD) and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD). The FEHD has been conducting anti-mosquito actions
around piggeries on a weekly basis since mid-June. Larvicides have been
applied to control mosquito breeding. The AFCD reminded all pig farmers in
June to take anti-mosquito measures. Inspection of pig farms has also been
stepped up.
The patient's family members were visited by DH's medical staff and were
put under medical surveillance. They did not have any symptoms. Her
residence in Fairview Park was also inspected. The DH is also conducting a
survey in the neighborhood of the patient's residence for active case
finding and serological tests.
From 1992 to 2002, there have been a total of 5 sporadic cases reported in
Hong Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one
imported case in 2001, and 2 imported cases in 2002. Japanese encephalitis
virus is transmitted by culicine mosquitoes living mainly in rural areas.
These mosquitoes breed in waterlogged fields and marshes. The public is
reminded to take measures to prevent mosquito breeding by removing stagnant
water and to take precautionary measures to avoid exposure to mosquitoes
both in Hong Kong and when visiting areas with mosquito-transmitted diseases.
Details of preventive measures against Japanese encephalitis and other
travel health advice are available from DH's website on travel health
