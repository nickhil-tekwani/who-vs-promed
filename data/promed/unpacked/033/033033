Two unnamed patients died from underlying complications and conditions, but they both tested positive for _Clostridium difficile_ (C. diff), NHS officials confirmed. The 2 patients contracted the disease while 14 others are confined in the same hospital for further intervention and treatment.

The health officials said that the 14 infected patients are in isolation and infection prevention to prevent cross-infection to other patients. According to Melanie Johnson, executive nurse director at NHS Lothian said, "We have identified a cluster of _C. difficile_ at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases. As is usual practice, we isolate symptomatic patients, emphasise the importance of infection control precautions and undertake additional cleaning. We always act as if cases are linked and implement action to prevent cross-transmission," she added.

Meanwhile, campaigners have expressed their shock after an investigation into a cluster of the potentially deadly _C. difficile_ bug was launched. This has been the country's worst outbreak of the said disease. Based from a report at the Vale of Leven Hospital in West Dunbartonshire, the outbreak killed 34 people last month. They have issued about 75 recommendations for improvement. In fact, according to Michelle Stewart, from the C. diff Justice Group, "Just a few weeks ago we were given strong assurances that the recommendations from the Vale of Leven inquiry were being put in place. Health boards across the country were implementing these measures. To hear this now so soon after the inquiry has shocked me," she added [1].

Meanwhile, Johnson reiterated that, "We have identified a cluster of C. diff at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases. Our robust surveillance procedures meant that we were able to identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action."

A total of 143 patients were infected and a thorough investigation of the outbreak has been launched.

[There appears to have been a recurrence of _Clostridium difficile_ transmission at the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, Scotland. ProMED-mail previously reported an outbreak of _C. difficile_ -associated diarrhea in 2007-2008 at this hospital (see also's below). At that time _C. difficile_ ribotype 027 was the pathogen involved in the outbreak. The news release above does not disclose if this strain is involved again.

_C. difficile_ is the commonest cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality have been related to the emergence of a hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain ribotype 027 in North America, Japan, and Europe.

_C. difficile_ ribotype 027 hyper-produces toxins A and B. It is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1, as well as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. Infection caused by this ribotype is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and poor response to antimicrobial therapy. Ribotype 027 is characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea (Drudy D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S. gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007; 13; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/3/06-0771_article).

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection control measures, including prompt isolation of patients with _C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents (http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF).

The Vale of Leven Hospital, with 92 inpatient beds, is located in Alexandria, a town in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. West Dunbartonshire, which is one of the 32 local government council areas of Scotland, lies to the west of the city of Glasgow and contains many of Glasgow's suburbs.
