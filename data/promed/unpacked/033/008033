[This is a correction of the most recent report on dengue in Fiji. - Mod.CHC
There were statistical errors in the Disease Outbreak Warning #8, released
on 5 February, 1998. The report should have read "To date there have been
at least 11,063 clinically presenting cases of Dengue Fever at Ministry of
Health Facilities."
The table of areas affected should have appeared as:
Facility Outpatient Admissions
CWM Hospital 6,573 296
Suva Health Centres 1,686
Rewa 412
Tailevu 475
Naitasiri 38
Serua 264
Central Division Total 9,448 296
Lautoka Hospital ~500 ~100
Sigatoka 184 36
Nadi 80 27
Ba 101 24
Tavua 215 31
Rakiraki 271 24
Western Division Total 1,351 172
Labasa 136 16
Macuata 3
Cakaudrove 3
Bua 2
Northern Div. Total 144 16
Lomaiviti 21
Kadavu 37 15
Lakeba 50
Lomaloma 7
Rotuma 5
Eastern Division Total 120 15
Fiji Total 11,063 569

The Ministry of Health regrets any inconvenience that these errors may have
caused. Dr. Asinate Boladuadua for the Permanent Secretary for Health, 28
January 1998.
[Writer's note: Dengue appears to be continuing at a steady level at the
moment, with Suva urban and peri-urban areas clearly bearing the brunt of
the epidemic. Note also that the official count does not include reports
from private doctors. There are also indications from CWM Hospital that
there may be an over-response from the public, and many fever and flu-like
illness cases may have been seen in the hospital's temporary Dengue Clinic
that aren't dengue. At this point in the epidemic, serology is not
routinely done in Suva.
However, in response to a previous query regarding laboratory confirmation,
there have been at least 100 seropositive cases tested at various centres
using rapid diagnostic Pan-Bio kits, or at the Welcome Virus Lab in Suva.
Serology is done primarily to confirm that dengue is circulating in an
area, to identify new areas of dengue spread. It is then discontinued in
favour of diagnosis on clinical and epidemiological grounds, to avoid
confusion from false positive tests, and due to limited resources. A recent
report from Labasa Hospital indicated that of 108 samples drawn from
patients with flu-like illness, 25 were seropositive for dengue. Thus
overall numbers of clinically suspected cases may be higher than actual
dengue seropositives. From the standpoint of controlling the epidemic, it
really makes no difference at this point. There is clearly an epidemic, and
control efforts are underway.
Larval indices show high levels of breeding, particularly for _Aedes
albopictus_ in urban areas. While _Ae. aegypti_ is believed to be the
primary carrier, no Fiji-specific research has been done to confirm that
this is the case. The Ministry of Health, as well as local town councils
have done extensive chemical spraying. However, the Ministry would be
highly interested in individuals with expertise in the area of biological
control methods who might provide information or support via the internet.

[It doesn't look at all to me as though the epidemic is "continuing at a
steady level". The combination of lack of laboratory support, lack of
specific information about the vector, lack of information regarding vector
control, non reporting of cases, and apparent misdiagnosis and
under-estimations of cases indicates a much more serious epidemic than has
been indicated. Although we have been assured that tourists are not at
risk, a report from Australia indicated otherwise. Seems to me that W.H.O.
should become involved in the investigations and control of this epidemic
before it gets out of hand. "Limited of resources" is the key phrase here
and "confusion from false positive tests" may be a telling indicator of the
diagnostic situation. With the numbers now involved, it is possible to
calculate attack rates, even age stratified attack rates. Can anyone
provide such data and information on the serotype responsible for the
epidemic? - Mod.CHC
