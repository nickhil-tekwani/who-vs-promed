[In February 2017, Malaysia reported 36 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in the state of Kelantan (Peninsular Malaysia). The event was resolved on 1 Apr 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23159.

"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and following ongoing evolution is now grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continues to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.

"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.

"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.

"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry."
