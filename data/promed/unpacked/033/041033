[1] Cayman Islands update

The number of people confirmed to have had dengue fever in the Cayman
Islands since October [2007] stands at 8, while a further person is
presumed to have had the tropical disease, the Public Health
Department has reported. But public health officials are confident
the disease has not spread locally, as all 9 patients had recently
travelled to countries with outbreaks of dengue fever.

The 8 confirmed and one presumed cases come from a total of 59 people
tested for the disease since early October [2007]. The rest of those
tested for the disease have either returned a confirmed negative
result or are thought unlikely to have had the disease, the
department said.

Although the wet season is now drawing to a close, meaning the number
of dengue cases should drop across the region, Director of Public
Health Dr. Kiran Kumar said his unit will be keeping a vigilant eye
out for cases of dengue fever. "We know that this is a time when a
lot of people are travelling to other parts of the region that have
dengue fever, so we are asking anyone who returns and experiences
dengue fever-like symptoms to seek medical treatment," he said.

Mosquito Research and Control Unit Director Mr. Bill Petrie said the
MRCU is finding lower numbers of mosquitoes, including the potential
dengue vector, _Aedes aegypti_ on Grand Cayman because of recent dry
weather.

Speaking Thursday morning [13 Dec 2007], he said there could be an
upswing of mosquito numbers in Cayman in the coming week, depending
on how much rain the remnant low passing over Cayman Thursday and
Friday [13 and 14 Dec 2007] brought. "I think we will see a general
increase in mosquito numbers but nothing massive," he said. "We have
larvicide pellets down already that are still active. That will give
us some measure of protection," he said.

"Making predictions about the weather these days is fraught with
danger, but our slow season for mosquitoes in typically from New
Year's onwards,'" he explained.

But Mr. Petrie pointed out that some other countries in the region
have continued to experience wetter conditions than the Cayman
islands have in the past month. This could have implications for
Cayman, he said. It might happen, that come the first few weeks of
the New Year [2008], we may see some more imported cases of dengue
fever from people travelling for Christmas and then returning to
Cayman," he said. "We have a contingency place in plan for that, in
case it does happen," he said.

Imported cases of dengue fever in the Cayman Islands over the past 2
months come at a time when parts of the Caribbean and Latin American
are experiencing some of the worst outbreaks of dengue fever in
decades. Although dengue fever is not endemic to the Cayman Islands,
hurricane Ivan in 2004 spawned a 1300 percent increase in the
population of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, a potential dengue fever
[virus] vector.

[The Cayman Island health authorities are extremely well prepared to
deal with imported dengue fever virus, and recognize the risk of
importation during the holiday season just getting underway. They are
to be commended for their efforts at prevention of dissemination of
dengue virus from the imported cases they have had so far this year
(also see archive 20071112.3670).

Dengue [virus] has infected 536 000 [people] this year [2007], the
government announced.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday [12 Dec 2007] the Ministry of Health announced the national
dengue [case] figures for 2007 up to November. The national case
figures registered for this disease were 536 519 for this period,
with 1275 of them DHF cases. Of these, 136 died. Compared with last
year [2006] there was an increase of 200 000 cases, which was
attributed to the occurrence of epidemics in Mato Grosso do Sul,
Parana, Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco.

The summary noted that the case fatality rate for DHF increased. This
year [2007], it reached 10.7 percent, practically double that of 2002
(the year of Brazil's largest epidemic of this disease), or 5.5
percent; in that same year the number of deaths was greater (150)
when there were 2714 DHF cases. According to the Ministry of Health,
44 percent of [this year's] cases occurred in cities with less than
100 000 inhabitants. Cities with more than 1 million people
constituted 14 percent of the cases.

[According to] the 2nd parameter [incidence] of the National Dengue
Control Program, by regions, states or municipalities those
classified as low incidence were those with less than 100 cases per
100 000 inhabitants. Those with medium incidence had between 100 -
300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. Those areas considered to be at
high risk were those with an incidence greater than 300 [cases] per
100 000 inhabitants. The region with the worst record was the
Central-West, which registered 811 cases per 100 000 inhabitants,
with Mato Grosso do Sul having a concentration of 68 percent of the
notifications.

In the other regions, the Northeast registered 26 percent of the
cases nationally and the North region, with 46 012 cases, had the
lowest absolute number. The Southeast had an increase of 35 percent
in the number of cases compared to last year [2006]. The South, with
a increase of 827 percent this year over 2006, registered the
greatest increase between the 2 years due to the epidemic in Parana.
Rio Grande do Sul registered its 1st autochthonous dengue case
(confirmed by the presence of a [dengue virus] infected mosquito in
the state) with transmission in April, 2007. Santa Clara is the only
state which continues without autochthonous dengue [virus]
transmission.

A total of 13 construction workers have been infected with dengue
[virus]. They have been working at a construction site at the
junction of East Coast Road and Lorong N Telok Kurau.

It is the 2nd construction site which has recorded 10 or more cases
of dengue this year 2007.

Of the affected workers, 4 live near the construction site. Workers
at the site said their colleagues had been sent to Tan Tock Seng
Hospital and they have since recovered. They added that the workers
might return to work in the next 2 days. The workers also said that
officials from the Health Ministry and the National Environment
Agency have searched the site, but apparently could not find any
mosquito breeding ground.
