Hong Kong health officials are monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Guangxi in southern China. The case involved a 50-year-old man living in Hechi in Guangxi. He developed symptoms on [16 Feb 2021] and was admitted for treatment on [17 Feb 2021] due to severe pneumonia. The patient passed away on [2 Mar 2021].

From 2014 to date, 30 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by China mainland health authorities.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. The clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza viruses through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[China's 1st avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 25 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 7 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/).

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. - Mod.UBA
