A 21-year-old Indonesian man from West Jakarta has died of bird flu,
taking the death toll from the virus to 86, a Health Ministry
official said on Monday [1 Oct 2007]. Experts are still investigating
how the man contracted the virus, which is most commonly spread to
humans through contact with sick fowl, Tini Suryanti, spokesman of
the Jakarta health office, told Reuters. "We don't know how he could
have come in contact with sick chickens, since backyard poultry has
long been banned by the city government," Suryanti said.
The victim, who died in hospital on Sunday [30 Sep 2007], fell ill on
18 Sep 2007 but was only hospitalized a week later, the bird flu
centre's Joko Suyono told Reuters. "He was brought too late to the
hospital. He was already suffering from pneumonia, and 3 days later
he died," Suyono said.
Bird flu is endemic in bird populations in nearly all parts of
Indonesia, where millions of backyard chickens live in close
proximity to people. The Jakarta government banned backyard poultry
in February 2007 in a bid to stem a new flare-up of bird flu after 4
people died in the beginning of the year in the capital.
Indonesia has had 107 confirmed cases from bird flu, of which 86 have
been fatal, the highest for any country in the world.
