Hantavirus Infection In China
-----------------------------
[The following review of the hantavirus situation in China has been put
together by Mr. David Cowhig of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Most of it
comes from translations from Chinese articles.
People who come in close proximity to rodents sometimes get hantavirus
infection. The virus is not passed from person-to-person but can be picked
up by inhaling tiny particles of rodent feces. During 1990 - 1997, there
were recorded in China nearly 400 000 cases of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal
Syndrome (HFRS), of which 1.6 percent were fatal. Hantavirus infection is
not an important threat to visitors to China or indeed to anyone who lives
in modern housing.
The following background information about hantaviruses was turned up by a
recent search in Chinese and English on the web. The Chinese language
website chinainfo was as usual very helpful, since
it carries the Chinese Journal of Preventive Medicine. This journal in its
May 1999 issue had a review article on hantaviruses in China. The full
Chinese text is at
<http://www.chinainfo.gov.cn/periodical/zhyfyx/zhyfyx99/zhyf9905/990502.htm>
According to the journal article, China has 90 percent of the world's
hantavirus infections [or more precisely cases of HFRS. Most HFRS cases
can be attributed to either of 2 hantaviruses - Hantaan virus [Hantaan
virus is named after the Hantaan river in Korea or Seoul virus. By 1995
the number of HFRS cases had reached a cumulative total of 1.17 million.
HFRS is one of [some 10 hemorrhagic fevers; it has the greatest
distribution, greatest number of sufferers, and is the most dangerous. In
China, HFRS is second only to viral hepatitis as the most serious acute
contagious disease. Hantaviruses [are usually associated with rodents (95
percent of cases in China) although many animals including house cats can
carry it. Chinese scientists have studied hantaviruses for 40 years.
However, until a South Korean scientist isolated the virus and found it in
rodents in the mid 1980s, the only way to tell it was present was when
people got sick. Inhalation has been shown to be one of the routes of
infection. HFRS (caused by hantaviruses) occurs in all Chinese provinces
and municipalities except for Qinghai and Xinjiang. Controlling rodents is
the best preventive measure. Household rodents are the main vector for
urban transmission of hantaviruses. China manufactures 3 effective vaccines
for hantavirus infection but financing immunization is difficult,
especially since many of the most seriously affected areas are among the
most impoverished in China. Chinese epidemiologists face considerable
scientific challenges in tackling hantavirus infection since there are 2
different hantaviruses responsible for HFRS (Hantaan virus and Seoul
virus), and differences in the seasonal onset of epidemics. Mapping the
extent of these different types is important because different control
strategies are required. The Chinese Journal Of Preventive Medicine
reported that other than rodent control, there are few effective measures
and [the review was not optimistic about bringing hantavirus infection
under control within the next decade.
Hantaviruses have received considerable attention in US scientific journals
over the past decade because a hantavirus was found to be the cause of some
deaths in New Mexico. Hantaviruses first attracted the medical community's
attention during the Korean war, when soldiers crawling around in the field
were one of the main victim classes.
A search of Chinese language websites such as Sohu, Sina.com.cn and
Yahoo/Chinese turned up quite a few medical articles on treatment and the
pathology of hantavirus infection. Improvements in treatment in recent
years, including work at the Fourth Military Medical University's Tangdu
Hospital, have sharply reduced death rates from HFRS in China to world
levels. The October 2000 issue of the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology
turned up 3 articles on hantavirus. One article carried a genetic study of
hantavirus [isolates in Beijing Municipality. There are 5 distinct genetic
subtypes of hantavirus [presumably Hantaan virus - Mod. in Beijing
Municipality. Beijing Municipality includes large rural areas where most of
the hantavirus carrying rodents probably live. The Chinese Journal of
Epidemiology is also carried on Chinainfo at
<http://www.chinainfo.gov.cn/periodical/zhlxbx/index.htm> but the October
2000 issue hasn't been added to the database yet.
Additional information can be found in the following: Epidemiological
progresses of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China, at Chinese
Medical Journal 19905: and Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Vol.3,no.3,
July-Sept 1997; Hantavirus Transmission in the United States; EID Vol. 3
no.2: Hantaviruses; A Global Disease Problem. [Reading the latter article,
there is the following reference to apparent Japanese war crime research:
"In the early 1940s, a viral etiology for HFRS was suggested by Russian and
Japanese investigators who injected persons with filtered urine or serum
from patients with naturally acquired disease. These studies also provided
the first clues to the natural reservoirs of hantaviruses: the Japanese
investigators claimed to produce disease in humans by injecting
bacteria-free filtrates of tissues from _Apodemus agrarius_ or mites
[ticks? that fed on the _Apodemus_ mice."

[The text has been edited to regularize the usage of the term hantavirus.
Hantavirus is the vernacular term applied to all or any member of the genus
_Hantavirus_. There are 2 common hantaviruses in China, which are
regarded as distinct virus species - Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Hantaan
virus has several (up to 5 now according to the article cited) subtypes and
is transmitted by the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_ , whereas Seoul virus
is less variable and is transmuted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. I have
altered rat to rodent in the text where there is ambiguity about the
hantavirus involved. Sin Mombre virus, another virus species in the genus
_Hantavirus_, was responsible for the outbreak of HPS (hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome) in New Mexico. - Mod.CP
