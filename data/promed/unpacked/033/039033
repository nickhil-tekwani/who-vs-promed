The 3rd case of leptospirosis has been registered in Starosambirsk
[district of the Lvov/Lviv/Lwow] region. The last case was registered
in the village Migovo. Igor Kostirko, the head sanitary doctor of the
region informed Zaxid.net that the transmitters of the disease, the
rats, have increased in numbers, as it [has been] a long time [since
anyone] has poisoned them.

To control the [infestation], [an] active rat extinction is
necessary. The secretary of local government, Nikolay Tsependa, said
that funds will be allocated for that purpose, including for
chlorination of wells in the recently [flooded] territories.

[The state sanitary doctor, Sergey Berejnov, reported during [a]
press conference that for every human in Kiev there is a rat.] He
said that during the Soviet Union era [rat infestation was] not
better; however, [during that time and unlike now,] seasonal rat
control measures had been carried out regularly. He also said that
the situation is still controlled and could not get worse.

The janitors say that they [try to exterminate the rats, but use only
popular methods.] "Only cats can solve this problem," a yard janitor
said. She mentioned that every janitor feeds 5-10 homeless cats and
they help to control rats in return.

The rats can transmit leptospirosis, which is the cause of death for
3-5 people every year in Kiev. [On average, 30 cases of leptospirosis
are registered] yearly. There are 2.8 million inhabitants in Kiev and
one million more live there illegally.

[So far this year (2007), 13 people have got an infection transmitted
by rats, and 2 of them have died.] The sanitary station of the city
complains that the government does not want to allocate budget funds
for rat control.

Temporary or one-time measures are [a waste] of money, the
specialists say. They estimate that the number of rats in
multi-storey buildings increased 6-7 times, [and] the incidence of
leptospirosis in the region is higher than the average for country.
Yet, [for the last 3 years], the rat control fees have been
incorporated into utility charges in response to the increase in the
[number of rats]. However, the program is not being carried out and
service suppliers are criticized for it. They, in turn, say that the
population is not paying the utility fees properly.

Rats can transmit salmonellosis, anthrax, rabies, and even typhus.
The rat bite is not a condition for infection; sometimes the contact
of rat's teeth with human food and house items is sufficient.

[These news releases do not state how the diagnosis of leptospirosis
was made in the cases. Because the clinical manifestations of
leptospirosis can be non-specific, laboratory confirmation is
necessary. Serious, potentially life-threatening complications of
leptospirosis include renal failure, liver disease, and pneumonia.

Leptospirosis is often acquired by exposure of abraded skin or mucous
membranes to water or wet soil (such as after flooding) contaminated
with urine from asymptomatic chronically infected rodents. Other
chronically infected animals, such as dogs or cats, can also serve as
a source for human cases in urban settings; the prevalence of
leptospirosis in rats and other urban animals is not stated in the
news releases.

Rats can be a source of leptospirosis in both urban and rural
settings. However, the prevalence of rats that carry many zoonotic
pathogens, including leptospirosis, has been found to be higher in
rural settings, perhaps as a result of higher population densities of
rats in rural settings and their proximity to farm animals that carry
these pathogens
(see <http:// www.ehj-online.com/archive/2000/april2001/april2.html>).

Conditions favoring rat infestation in urban settings include older
housing in poor repair that permits access to food and harborage for
rats, inadequate disposal of trash and debris; lumber and firewood
piles not stacked off the ground; abandoned automobiles and
appliances; dilapidated outbuildings; inadequately maintained sewer
systems; and parks, subways, railroad lines, and highways that can
provide suitable habitat or exposed earth that can be used as burrow
sites. Indeed, in February 2007 hordes of rats were discovered in a
fast food restaurant in Greenwich Village (New York City), which
prompted the local health department to review their restaurant
inspection program.

[Controlling rodents essentially involves getting rid of harborage
and feed. If your buildings are ill maintained there are plenty of
places for rats and mice to hide and breed. Cats help, as does
trapping and poisoning, but that is only temporary until other
changes can be made.

Rats are obvious but domestically, mice can be just as dangerous and
are underappreciated as risks. - Mod.MHJ]
