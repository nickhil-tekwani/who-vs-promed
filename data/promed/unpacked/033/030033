[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 219 246, with 80 928 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 138 044 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 160 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 20 425 cases when compared with the data on 17 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 4207 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1192 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 152 of the newly reported cases. Spain (2943), Germany (2960), France (1404), and the USA (2792) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 63.0% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. A global total of 8968 deaths have been reported, 5723 outside mainland China.

For the 21th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of Mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by Mainland China. Unfortunately South Korea's descending trend reversed and there's been an increase in confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The big news, this is the 1st time since the epidemic was identified that there are no newly confirmed, locally acquired cases in China in the past 24 hours. While one day isn't a definitive interruption of transmission it certainly is very promising. A media (or perhaps social media) report mentioned that many overseas students from China are now returning to their homes feeling safer in China than in the countries where they are studying. The challenge will be to identify all infections before they can escape from detection and start spreading in the community.

According to the report above, a total of 80 928 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 34 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (17 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 8 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. 25 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly climbing. After more than 2.5 months of no newly confirmed cases, Macau has been confirming 1 new case a day for the past 3 days, and 4 new cases in the past 24 hours.

All 34 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China representing 100% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Guangdong (9), Beijing (21), Shanghai (2), Heilongjiang (1) and Zhejiang (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 189.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 152 cases and 7 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (17-18 Mar 2020) when there were 93 newly confirmed cases. This is both worrisome as well as disappointing, as for 2 days it appeared as though the transmission was actually slowing down. Once again Daegu stands out as a focal point for transmission with 97 newly confirmed cases reported and Gyeonggi with 18 newly confirmed cases and Gyeongbuk with 12 newly confirmed cases. We await the release of information form an epidemiologic investigation of this increase in reported cases.

----------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 35 713 total cases. At the moment 28 710 people are positive for the virus. 4025 people have recovered. There are 14 363 hospitalized patients with symptoms, 2257 in intensive care, and 12 090 are in home isolation.

There have been 2978 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 35 713 cases, including 2978 deaths, up from 31 506 cases and 2503 deaths reported on 17 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 17 and 18 Mar 2020 was 4207 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3233 newly confirmed cases between 16 and 17 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (17 713), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (4525), and Venice (3214), all in the northern part of the country, but there are signs the case loads may be increasing outside of these 3 northern provinces. Yesterday [17 Mar 2020], these 3 provinces accounted for 62.7% of newly confirmed cases in the preceding 24 hours, down from 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours. Today (18 Mar 2020) the proportion of newly confirmed cases in these 3 provinces has decreased further to 54.3% of the total newly confirmed cases. It is beginning to look like a trend. The growth in cases in the northern provinces continues, but apparently the growth in other provinces is continuing at a more rapid pace. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 17 151 cases, 1135 deaths
Date: Wed 18 Mar 2020 10:56 UTC

Iran's death toll from the new COVID-19 coronavirus has surpassed 1000 people, as health officials confirmed on state television that the government had recorded hundreds of new cases. "Now everyone knows about this disease, and what is very strange is that some don't take it seriously," Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said in a televised news conference. "If people help, we can control it, and if not, then expect it to last more than 2 months."

The number of people who have died in Iran because of the virus now stands at 1135, after 147 people died in the past 24 hours, Raisi said, Iran also registered 1192 new infections, raising the total to 17 161.
Tehran province had the highest number of new cases with 213. Isfahan in central Iran was second with 162, followed by East Azerbaijan in the northwest with 84. Raisi called on people to be patient, after complaining that bazaars in the capital Tehran are busy and people have been travelling in their cars despite government warnings against it. "Just be patient for these 2 weeks so that, God willing, we can overcome this virus," Raisi said.

Beating the odds
----------------
Coronavirus is especially dangerous for the elderly, and people with preexisting medical conditions, such diabetes, lung, and heart diseases. In the central city of Semnan, a 103-year-old woman has recovered from the virus, state media reported late on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020]. The unnamed woman had been hospitalised for about a week, but was "discharged after making a complete recovery", Semnan University of Medical Sciences head Navid Danayi was quoted as saying by IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency]. The woman was the 2nd elderly patient in Iran to have survived the disease. On Monday [16 Mar 2020], a 91-year-old man from Kerman city, who already suffers from high blood pressure and asthma, recovered from coronavirus after being sick for 3 days. IRNA's report did not say how the pair were treated.

[In the 24 hours from 17 to 18 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 16 169 to 17 151 an increase of 982 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 988 to 1135, an increase of 147 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Early data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults aged 60 years or older and among persons with serious underlying health conditions.

What is added by this report?
This 1st preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was highest in persons aged 85 years or older, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65-84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, less than 1% among persons aged 20-54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged 19 years or younger.

What are the implications for public health practice?
COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults from severe illness.

Globally, approximately 170 000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1). On [11 Mar 2020], the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged 60 years or older; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person 19 years or younger (3). In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020] and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of [16 Mar 2020] , a total of 4226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged 65 years or older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged 85 years or older. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged 19 years or younger. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.

Data from cases reported from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 US territories (5) to CDC during [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020] were analyzed. Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and from Japan (including patients repatriated from cruise ships) were excluded. States and jurisdictions voluntarily reported data on laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 using previously developed data collection forms (6). The cases described in this report include both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or local public health laboratories as well as those with a positive test at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmation at CDC. No data on serious underlying health conditions were available. Data on these cases are preliminary and are missing for some key characteristics of interest, including hospitalization status (1514), ICU admission (2253), death (2001), and age (386). Because of these missing data, the percentages of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths (case-fatality percentages) were estimated as a range. The lower bound of these percentages was estimated by using all cases within each age group as denominators. The corresponding upper bound of these percentages was estimated by using only cases with known information on each outcome as denominators.

As of [16 Mar 2020], a total of 4226 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the United States, with reports increasing to 500 or more cases per day beginning [14 Mar 2020 (Figure 1. Number of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported daily, (N = 4226) -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]). Among 2449 patients with known age, 6% were aged 85 years or older, 25% were aged 65-84 years, 18% each were aged 55-64 years and 45-54 years, and 29% were aged 20-44 years (Figure 2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths, by age group -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]). Only 5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0-19 years.

Among 508 (12%) patients known to have been hospitalized, 9% were aged 85 years or older, 26% were aged 65-84 years, 17% were aged 55-64 years, 18% were 45-54 years, and 20% were aged 20-44 years. Less than 1% of hospitalizations were among persons aged 19 years or younger (Figure 2). The percentage of persons hospitalized increased with age, from 2%-3% among persons aged 9 years or younger, to 31% or higher among adults aged 85 years or older. (Table Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and case-fatality percentages for reported COVID-19 cases, by age group -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]).

Among 121 patients known to have been admitted to an ICU, 7% of cases were reported among adults 85 years or older, 46% among adults aged 65-84 years, 36% among adults aged 45-64 years, and 12% among adults aged 20-44 years (Figure 2). No ICU admissions were reported among persons aged 19 years or younger. Percentages of ICU admissions were lowest among adults aged 20-44 years (2%-4%) and highest among adults aged 75-84 years (11%-31%) (Table).

Among 44 cases with known outcomes, 15 (34%) deaths were reported among adults aged 85 years or older, 20 (46%) among adults aged 65-84 years, and 9 (20%) among adults aged 20-64 years. Case-fatality percentages increased with increasing age, from no deaths reported among persons 19 years or younger to the highest percentages (10%-27%) among adults aged 85 years or older (Table) (Figure 2).

Discussion
Since [12 Feb2020], 4226 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65 years or older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged 85 years or older. These findings are similar to data from China, which indicated greater than 80% of deaths occurred among persons aged 60 years or older (3). These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged 19 years or younger appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group. Given the spread of COVID-19 in many US communities, CDC continues to update current recommendations and develop new resources and guidance, including for adults aged 65 years or older as well as those involved in their care (7,8).

Approximately 49 million US persons are aged 65 years or older (9), and many of these adults, who are at risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness, might depend on services and support to maintain their health and independence. To prepare for potential COVID-19 illness among persons at high risk, family members, and caregivers of older adults should know what medications they are taking and ensure that food and required medical supplies are available. Long-term care facilities should be particularly vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 (10). In addition, clinicians who care for adults should be aware that COVID-19 can result in severe disease among persons of all ages. Persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms and call their provider for guidance if symptoms worsen or seek emergency care for persistent severe symptoms. Additional guidance is available for health care providers on CDC's website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).

This report describes the current epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States, using preliminary data. The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations. First, data were missing for key variables of interest. Data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, were missing for 9%-53% of cases, which likely resulted in an underestimation of these outcomes. Second, further time for follow-up is needed to ascertain outcomes among active cases. Third,, the initial approach to testing was to identify patients among those with travel histories or persons with more severe disease, and these data might overestimate the prevalence of severe disease. Fourth, data on other risk factors, including serious underlying health conditions that could increase risk for complications and severe illness, were unavailable at the time of this analysis. Finally, limited testing to date underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 cases. Additional investigation will increase the understanding about persons who are at risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 and inform clinical guidance and community-based mitigation measures.

The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults.

[This report is adding to the increasing number of reports identifying advanced age as a risk factor for serious disease. The USA experience (early on in the outbreak). The mention of limitations merits heeding. Until there is a better handle on the real infection rate, which will only happen once we have adequate serology to see what the true subclinical infection rate is, we continue to most likely see the tip of the iceberg of the most severe and ultimately fatal cases. - Mod.MPP

Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause severe illness and death, particularly among older adults with chronic health conditions.

What is added by this report?
Introduction of COVID-19 into a long-term residential care facility in Washington resulted in cases among 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members, restricting visitation except in compassionate care situations, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures.

On [28 Feb 2020], a case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in a woman resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington. Epidemiologic investigation of facility A identified 129 cases of COVID-19 associated with facility A, including 81 of the residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures.

On [27 Feb 2020], Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified by a local health care provider of a patient whose symptom history and clinical presentation met the revised testing criteria for COVID-19, which included testing of persons with severe respiratory illness of unknown etiology (1). The patient was a woman aged 73 years with a history of coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who resided in facility A along with approximately 130 residents who were cared for by 170 health care personnel. Beginning in mid-February [2020], the facility had experienced a cluster of febrile respiratory illnesses. Rapid influenza test results were obtained from several residents; all were negative. The patient had cough, fever, and shortness of breath requiring oxygen for 5 days at facility A. She reported no travel or known contact with anyone with COVID-19. On [24 Feb 2020], she was transported to a local hospital because of worsening respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia.

Upon hospital admission, the patient was febrile to 103.3 deg F (39.6 deg C), tachycardic, and was found to have hypoxemic respiratory failure. On [25 Feb 2020], she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography scan showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates; however, multiplex viral respiratory panel and bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative. 4 days after hospital admission, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens were collected to test for SARS-CoV-2; results were reported positive for all specimens on [28 Feb 2020]. The patient died on [2 Mar 2020].

Following notification of the index case of COVID-19, PHSKC, and CDC immediately began investigating the cluster of respiratory illness in facility A to collect information on symptoms, severity, comorbidities, travel history, and close contacts to known COVID-19 cases by interviewing patients or a proxy for cases in which the patient could not be interviewed. Diagnostic testing by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (2-5) was performed for patients and staff members meeting clinical case criteria for COVID-19 (1). As of [9 Mar 2020], a total of 129 COVID-19 cases were confirmed among facility residents (81 of approximately 130), staff members, including health care personnel (34), and visitors (14). Health care personnel with confirmed COVID-19 included the following occupations: physical therapist, occupational therapist assistant, environmental care worker, nurse, certified nursing assistant, health information officer, physician, and case manager. Overall, 111 (86%) cases occurred among residents of King County (81 facility A residents, 17 staff members, and 13 visitors) and 18 (14%) among residents of Snohomish County (directly north of King County) (17 staff members and one visitor).

Reported symptom onset dates for facility residents and staff members ranged from [16 Feb 2020] to [5 Mar 2020]. The median patient age was 81 years (range = 54-100 years) among facility residents, 42.5 years (range = 22-79 years) among staff members, and 62.5 years (range = 52-88 years) among visitors; 84 (65.1%) patients were women (Table Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 epidemiologically linked to facility A among residents of King and Snohomish counties -- Washington, February 27-March 9, 2020). Overall, 56.8% of facility A residents, 35.7% of visitors, and 5.9% of staff members with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Preliminary case fatality rates among residents and visitors as of [9 Mar 2020] were 27.2% and 7.1%, respectively; no deaths occurred among staff members. The most common chronic underlying conditions among facility residents were hypertension (69.1%), cardiac disease (56.8%), renal disease (43.2%), diabetes (37.0%), obesity (33.3%), and pulmonary disease (32.1%). Six residents and one visitor had hypertension as their only chronic underlying condition.

As part of the response effort, approximately 100 long-term care facilities in King County were contacted through an emailed survey using REDCap (6), and information was requested about residents or staff members known to have COVID-19 or clusters of respiratory illness among residents and staff members. In addition, countywide databases of emergency medical service transfers from long-term care facilities to acute care facilities were reviewed daily for evidence of cases or clusters of serious respiratory illness. Routine active surveillance reports to PHSKC for influenza-like illness clusters from long-term care facilities were employed to identify clusters of illness consistent with COVID-19. All long-term care facilities with evidence of a cluster of respiratory illness were contacted by telephone for additional information, including infection control strategies in place and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Based on this information, the long-term care facilities were prioritized by risk for COVID-19 introduction and spread, and highest priority facilities were visited by response personnel for provision of emergency on-site testing and infection control assessment, support, and training. As of [9 Mar 2020], at least 8 other King County skilled nursing and assisted living facilities had reported one or more confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Information received from the survey and on-site visits identified factors that likely contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including 1) staff members who worked while symptomatic; 2) staff members who worked in more than one facility; 3) inadequate familiarity and adherence to standard, droplet, and contact precautions and eye protection recommendations; 4) challenges to implementing infection control practices including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer) §; 5) delayed recognition of cases because of low index of suspicion, limited testing availability, and difficulty identifying persons with COVID-19 based on signs and symptoms alone.

Discussion
These findings demonstrate that outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities can have a critical impact on vulnerable older adults. In Washington, local and state authorities implemented comprehensive prevention measures for long-term care facilities (7-9) that included 1) implementation of symptom screening and restriction policies for visitors and nonessential personnel; 2) active screening of health care personnel, including measurement and documentation of body temperature and ascertainment of respiratory symptoms to identify and exclude symptomatic workers; 3) symptom monitoring of residents; 4) social distancing, including restricting resident movement and group activities; 5) staff training on infection control and PPE use; and 6) establishment of plans to address local PPE shortages, including county and state coordination of supply chains and stockpile releases to meet needs. These strategies require coordination and support from public health authorities, partnering health care systems, regulatory agencies, and their respective governing bodies (8-10).

The findings in this report suggest that once COVID-19 has been introduced into a long-term care facility, it has the potential to result in high attack rates among residents, staff members, and visitors. In the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks in much of the United States, it is critical that long-term care facilities implement active measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19. Measures to consider include identifying and excluding symptomatic staff members, restricting visitation except in compassionate care situations, and strengthening infection prevention and control guidance and adherence (7,9,10). Substantial morbidity and mortality might be averted if all long-term care facilities take steps now to prevent exposure of their residents to COVID-19. The underlying health conditions and advanced age of many long-term care facility residents and the shared location of patients in one facility places these persons at risk for severe morbidity and death. Rapid and sustained public health interventions focusing on surveillance, infection control, and mitigation efforts are resource-intensive but are critical to curtailing COVID-19 transmission and decreasing the impact on vulnerable populations, such as residents of long-term care facilities, and the community at large. As this pandemic expands, continued implementation of public health measures targeting vulnerable populations such as residents of long-term care facilities (8) and health care personnel will be critical. As public health measures are continually implemented, public information needs will only grow. To provide information for patients and families as well as communicate more broadly to all stakeholders, public officials and other community leaders need to work together to encourage everyone to understand and adhere to recommended guidelines to manage this outbreak.

A. Germany to build new 1000 bed hospital
Date: Thu 18 Mar 2020
Source: DW (Deutsche Welle) [edited]
https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-to-build-1000-bed-coronavirus-hospital/a-52811671


The Berlin government said on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] it would create a new hospital to cope with a likely huge increase in coronavirus cases. The facility, which will house up to 1000 patients, will be set up in the Berlin Messe trade fair exhibition grounds in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of the German capital. The hospital will be built with the help of the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. No further details on the exact location or the deadline for completion were given.

The project was approved by the Senate, the executive body for the city and state of Berlin, who said the facility should only be used if other medical facilities are overrun. The new hospital is expected to treat both relatively minor coronavirus cases as well as emergency respiratory patients.

Berlin prepares for bottlenecks
------------------------------
"This measure complements the well-positioned Berlin hospital system to deal with possible bottlenecks," said Berlin Health Senator Dilek Kalayci following the approval. She added that other hospitals in Berlin would expand their services to treat those coronavirus patients requiring ventilation in intensive care. Kalayci added that hospitals in the city would now begin postponing other scheduled surgeries to prepare to treat more patients struck down with COVID-19.

On Tuesday [17 Mar 2020], Berlin already counted 332 coronavirus cases out of more than 7500 infections across Germany. The country has seen a rise of 1500 cases since Monday [16 Mar 2020]. 20 people have died so far.

500 hospitalized so far
-----------------------
The German Hospital Federation (DKG) says around 500 people in the country are currently undergoing hospital treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Officials expect a much higher volume of people to require hospitalization in the next few months.

Germany has announced strict measures to try to contain the pandemic and ensure the country's health sector can cope. Schools have been shut across most of the country, border controls have been tightened, and new restrictions put on public and social spaces. Companies are being urged to offer employees remote work.

Nigeria is restricting entry into the country for travelers from 13 countries including the US and UK, as it announced 5 new cases Wednesday [18 Mar 2020]. The restriction will apply to travelers from countries with more than 1000 cases. They include China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, the United States, Norway, UK, Netherlands, and Switzerland, the country's National Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] said on its Twitter account.

"The Federal Government of Nigeria has also suspended the issuance of visa on arrival to travelers from these countries. All travelers returning from these countries prior to the restriction will be in supervised self-isolation, monitored by the NCDC and Port Health Services," -- the tweet read. The restriction will take effect starting on [20 Mar 2020] and will be in place until further notice.

Health officials also announced an additional 5 cases of the virus in the country, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8. One of them is a recovered patient who came in contact with the index case to Nigeria, an Italian man on a business trip to the country, authorities said.

[8] WHO situation report 58 (as of 18 Mar 2020)
Date: Wed 18 Mar 2020
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200318-sitrep-58-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=20876712_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area (European Region [1]) has reported cases of COVID-19.

- Data presented in the COVID-19 Situation Reports has changed to reflect data reported as of 00:00 CET. As this is the 1st situation report with the new reporting period, there is overlap of data between Situation Report 57 and this report, thus the number of new cases may not equal the difference between total cases in the two reports.

- WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed COVID19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID19 data using different inclusion criteria and different data cutoff times are to be expected.

- WHO, IFRC, and UNICEF jointly released the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 on [16 Mar 2020]. For more information, please see the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and UNICEF jointly released the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 on [16 Mar 2020] (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/risk-communication-and-community-engagement-(rcce)-action-plan-guidance).

The RCCE guidance is a tool to support national health authorities, responders and other partners to develop, implement and monitor action plans for communicating effectively with the public and engaging with communities, local partners and other stakeholders.

The tool includes a 7-step guidance process, which includes: collecting data and making assessments; developing coordination mechanisms; defining and prioritizing key objectives; identifying target audiences and key influencers; developing a RCCE strategy that fits into the country's response strategy; implementing the plan with partners and engaging the community; and developing a monitoring plan for evaluation purposes. The RCCE Action Plan Guidance has a planning template and practical annexes to assist with the exercise.

It allows countries and communities to:
- Adapt the elements according to country needs and the local situation.
- Revise plans according to the evolution of the situation.
- Coordinate and plan together with authorities and partners.
- Proactively communicate and promote a two-way dialogue with communities, the public and other stakeholders.
- Understand risk perceptions, behaviours, and existing barriers, specific needs, knowledge gaps, and provide the identified communities/groups with accurate information tailored to their circumstances.
- Reduce stigma. See WHO's Guide to preventing and addressing social stigma (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid19-stigma-guide.pdf).
- Conduct early and ongoing assessments to identify essential information about at-risk populations and other stakeholders (that is, their perception, knowledge, preferred and accessible communication channels, or existing barriers that prevent people to uptake the promoted behaviors).
- Ensure that all people at-risk of acquiring COVID-19 are identified, reached and involved.

Risk Communication and Community Engagement is an essential component of health emergency preparedness and response. This Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 provides a strategy and tool that helps to prepare and protect individuals, families and the public's health during early response to COVID-19.

[As mentioned in the highlights above, WHO has now shifted from a 0:00 to 23:59 period for the preceding day in presenting data on confirmed cases reported to WHO. As this change just occurred, one sees variances in reported cases in the table that appear as though countries updates weren't entered. This should resolve moving forward. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 160. This includes 13 countries (including 2 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 57 countries (including 4 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 18 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 37 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 27 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

As many of the countries did not have updated data today, I prefer to wait until tomorrow to resume impressions and comments.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [18 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
