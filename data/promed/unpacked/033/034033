Issa Mohamed Musa Yusuf, the minister of health from Central Darfur, told Radio Dabanga that 72 people had died of yellow fever [YF] in the state by Friday [16 Nov 2012]. He also said that 296 people have been infected so far [but see [2[ below].

The minister also told Radio Dabanga that one person died on Thursday [15 Nov 2012] afternoon at a Zalingei hospital as a result of the disease. In addition, he continued, one person from Bindissi locality and another 3 from Um Dukhun locality were recently infected with yellow fever. Cases have also been reported in Jebel Ahmer, Zalingei locality, he said.

Yusuf said yellow fever infections are mostly found in the countryside of Central Darfur, adding that this is the disease's worst epidemic in Darfur.

According to a citizen from Bishara El-Tayeb, Central Darfur, 35 people have died in the village since the yellow fever outbreak one month ago. Besides, a total of 6 people were diagnosed with the disease on Friday [16 Nov 2012], he said, explaining the spread of yellow fever cannot be contained.

Ahmed Ishaq Yaqoup, health minister of West Darfur, announced that 40 people died, and another 113 were infected as a result of the spread of yellow fever in the state. He asserted that rural areas are mostly affected, citing specifically zones around El-Geneina, Mornei and Habila. The minister also confirmed the incidence of the disease in other localities in West Darfur.

Empty syringes arrived at the El-Geneina airport in West Darfur on Friday [16 Nov 2012] according to Minister Yusuf. He told Radio Dabanga he expects the vaccine doses to arrive in the region by the end of the last week of November 2012.

During a news conference on Friday [16 Nov 2012] in Khartoum, the undersecretary of the federal Ministry of Health announced that he expects vaccinations against yellow fever to arrive in Sudan on Saturday or Sunday [17-18 Nov 2012]. He said that once in Sudan, the vaccines will be sent to Darfur. Hopefully, he concluded, the vaccination process will begin by the end of the next week [the end of the week of 25 Nov 2012].

The minister appealed to citizens from Central Darfur to immediately [report] yellow fever cases to the nearest medical center and to follow the ministry's preventive instructions.

WHO says death toll from yellow fever in Sudan's Darfur rises to 110
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization ( WHO) on Thursday [15 Nov 2012] announced that the death toll from yellow fever jumped to 110 in Sudan's Darfur region, APA reports quoting Xinhua. "The total number of cases has reached 374, including 110 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 29.4 percent," said WHO in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by Xinhua. It further said that the outbreak affected 23 localities in Darfur's 5 states, noting that it was working to [deliver] 2.4 million doses of yellow fever vaccine as an emergency vaccination campaign.

The WHO earlier said 7 quarantine centers have been established in Nyala, Kass, Nertity, Zalengei, Garcilla, Morni and Geneina in response to the outbreak. [Quarantine is not normally applicable in a YF epidemic; perhaps isolation wards are meant. - Mod.JW].

The organization noted that there was a need for a minimum of 4. 8 million U.S. dollars to conduct the campaign and provide treatment for the patients, requesting all its partners to support its efforts by pooling manpower and financial resources.

[The YF outbreak continues to smolder in West Darfur, with cases occurring in a variety of villages. A 13 Nov 2012 report indicated that there have been 107 YF deaths in Darfur (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121114.1409831), and a report from the Sudan Ministry of Health on that same date reported 97 deaths (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121113.1407906), but the above report stated that there have been 72 YF deaths.

The arrival of syringes is good news. The arrival of the vaccine will be even better news. One hopes that when it does arrive in Darfur, vaccination teams will be ready to immediately fan out across the region to apply it. Since 11 days are required for the vaccine to be effective after application, one can expect cases to continue into mid-December 2012. The above report does not specifically indicate that cases are occurring in the large refugee camps located in Darfur. Should that occur, a massive number of cases could result in a short period of time. One hopes that the vaccine campaign will prevent that from happening as well as halting additional cases in the villages of Western Darfur.

[According to a report on All Africa dated 15 Nov 2012 at: http://allafrica.com/stories/201211160034.html the 1st cases reportedly came from Jebel Ahmar (Jebel Marra(?) on Google Maps), which is at Nertiti on the road to the Chad border, less than 100km away as the monkey travels through the mountain forest. Checking the historical photos on Google Earth, there has been an extraordinary amount of reforestation of the region since 2004 -- they must have had a lot of rainfall since then.

But there must be a YF cases over the border in Chad. I suppose there are NGOs in the refugee camps close to the Sudan border there -- why haven't they reported anything? - Mod.JW]
