Suspected cases of canine flu appear to be on the rise in the [Washington] DC region. The illness is so prevalent and severe veterinarians are telling dog owners to keep pets away from other dogs at places such as dog parks, doggy day cares and boarding facilities.

"It's not uncommon to get dogs with a cough after boarding or being around other dogs, but definitely following Thanksgiving, there was a big upswing, where we were seeing multiple in a day, which is pretty unusual," said Dr Lauren Giebel, of Quince Orchard Veterinary Hospital in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Giebel said there were 2 or 3 animals with coughs coming into her animal hospital a day, when normally there are only a couple of cases per month. What is also different is how severe the illness appears to get in some animals.

"Some dogs were getting really, really sick. To the point that they were needing hospitalization at the emergency hospitals. A lot of them also had a weird GI component, where they started vomiting uncontrollably," Giebel said. A severe cough is a telltale sign, Giebel said, and it can get so bad it keeps dogs up all night. The cough in some dogs lasts for several weeks; and in one case, the cough didn't go away for 3 months, she said.

Giebel said her pet hospital has had only 1 confirmed case of canine flu, but that is partly due to dogs typically resisting pharyngeal swabs for a PCR test. The test is required to confirm a case of the canine flu. "Much like people didn't like the COVID swabs up their nose, try swabbing the back of the throat of a crazy Labrador retriever, all while they have snot and all these other fluids coming from them," Giebel said. Giebel said this is why a lot of times, dogs with similar illnesses are classified as having canine infectious cough.

Giebel's veterinary hospital isn't alone. WTOP reached out to several hospitals in the region, which report a rise in upper respiratory illnesses coming with a cough.

Wanda Hudgins, hospital administrator at Franklin Farm Veterinary Clinic in Herndon, Virginia, said they receive 6-8 calls a day about dogs with signs similar to canine flu. She added the cases are, "A little worse than we've seen." Hudgins said whatever is going around seems to be a "harder (or tougher) strain" than normal. The Herndon clinic is also urging owners to avoid socializing their pets with other dogs right now, including nose-to-nose greetings during walks.

According to Giebel, other illnesses, including bordetella, commonly known as "kennel cough," are going around, as well; however, it is suspected many of the cases are canine flu. Giebel said dogs with signs are being treated outdoors to prevent the spread of the flu. Veterinarians are even trying to help stop the spread by helping owners start treatment at home when possible.

The signs to look out for is a cough starting mild but gets worse over 48 hours. Signs also to watch out for are lethargy and vomiting. Anyone whose dog has those signs should contact their veterinarian.

When it comes to people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are no reported cases of canine influenza viruses spreading from dogs to people.

Meanwhile, there is a concern with dog-to-dog contact. According to Giebel, owners might not know if their dog is sick and contagious until it's too late, as it takes anywhere from 5-10 days for signs to appear. "If just one of those dogs goes to day care, and then has a yappy hour at the end of the week, he could potentially expose all those other dogs which normally wouldn't have exposure," Giebel said.

There is a canine flu shot, and Giebel said the vaccinated dogs appear to recover quicker than unvaccinated dogs. That doesn't mean you should rush and get your dog vaccinated if it hasn't been inoculated, she said. "Don't rush into it right now; we can't handle the volume and then that just is more exposure," Giebel said. "So, hang tight."

["The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been recognized in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, the H3N8 influenza virus or 'flu' appears to have 'jumped' from horses to dogs. The virus had mutated into a form known as canine influenza virus (CIV) that is highly infective for dogs. At first, veterinarians thought the H3N8 canine flu would be quite lethal. Fortunately, like the human flu virus, it kills very few healthy individuals. Since its detection in 2004, H3N8 canine influenza has been detected in most states. The disease was discovered by Dr Cynda Crawford from the University of Florida, and she estimated the H3N8 strain kills between 1% and 5% of dogs contracting it, with most of the deaths being in dogs having serious concurrent illnesses. That's nothing to sneeze at. The 1918 Spanish flu had a mortality rate of only 2%.

"In March of 2015, a new strain of influenza in the United States was identified (H3N2) in Chicago during an outbreak of respiratory illness. Prior to this, the H3N2 strain of canine influenza had only been identified in Asia after jumping from birds to dogs. After its initial detection, cases of H3N2 influenza were reported in many states and a few provinces in Canada. The strain was even detected in a group of shelter cats that were exposed to infected dogs. A more recent outbreak was reported by the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in May 2017. By mid-June [2017], H3N2 infections had been reported in many other states, including the Carolinas, Texas, and Illinois. The severity of H3N2 may be greater than other respiratory infections, especially in those dogs with higher risk of infection. Similar to H3N8 infection, the risk of mortality with H3N2 infection is low.

"Currently, there are approved CIV vaccines in the United States and Canada. Vaccination against canine flu should be considered for any at-risk breed, dogs with heart or respiratory conditions, dogs that travel or show, and those having extensive contact with other dogs (e.g., those that are boarded [or go to dog parks, shows, etc.]).

"The [signs] of canine influenza are similar to the human flu: cough, runny nose, and fever. The most common clinical sign associated with canine influenza is a cough that does not respond to antibiotic or cough suppressant therapy and lasts 10-21 days. This cough may be productive ('moist') or non-productive ('dry'), and it may be associated with reduced appetite and lethargy. The majority of dogs infected with canine influenza will display mild clinical signs. Dogs infected with the H3N2 strain of canine influenza appear to be at greater risk of developing more severe clinical signs.

"The CI virus is virtually identical to other respiratory infections such as kennel cough. In fact, many cases of CIV may be mistaken as kennel cough or other infections in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex because of these similarities. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing canine influenza from CIRD, any dog with these clinical signs should be seen by a veterinarian.

"Older dogs and dogs with heart and respiratory conditions are at particular risk for CIV. Dogs with short, flat faces (brachycephalic breeds), such as Boston terriers, boxers, Pekingese, pugs, and shih tzus, are also at higher risk.

"Due to its similarities to other respiratory infections, canine influenza cannot be diagnosed on clinical signs alone. If a veterinarian sees a dog within the 1st few days of the onset of clinical signs, a nasal swab for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic lab. If the PCR test is positive, the dog most likely has CIV. After 4 days of illness, PCR results are less likely to be accurate (there may be false-negative results). At this stage, blood testing for CIV antibodies should be performed. This type of testing, called serology, involves comparing antibody levels 2-3 weeks apart. If antibody levels rise significantly over this period, it indicates active CIV infection. Your veterinarian may also wish to run other diagnostics such as blood work and radiographs to assess the severity of infection.

"Any dog suspected of having the CIV should be tested to determine if the disease is spreading in your area. If there are confirmed canine influenza virus cases in your area, consult with your veterinarian and consider vaccinating your dog.

"It is important to note the CIV vaccine cannot completely prevent the disease. It may, however, reduce the severity and duration of clinical signs associated with infection. This is especially important in at-risk dogs and to help reduce the spread of outbreaks.

"Talk to your veterinarian to determine if vaccinating against canine influenza is right for your dog.

"As with nearly all viral infections, treatment is largely supportive. It is important that your pet be kept in a warm, dry area away from other dogs, fed a high-quality diet, and kept well hydrated during illness. Good nutrition and husbandry are crucial in ensuring that dogs mount an adequate immune response and can help promote faster recovery. Dogs affected with a mild form of canine influenza will often develop a secondary bacterial upper respiratory infection. These dogs typically have a thick green mucous discharge from their nose and benefit from broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Dogs that develop pneumonia may require hospitalization, intravenous fluids and medications, and potent broad-spectrum antibiotics. Most dogs fully recover from canine influenza within 2-3 weeks. It is important to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment. Dogs exposed to the virus should be isolated for 4 weeks to prevent further spread.

"Virtually 100% of dogs exposed to CIV will become infected. For this reason, it is important that owners of dogs diagnosed with the virus keep them away from other dogs. This includes trips to the groomer or dog parks and contact with other dogs during walks and in kennels. Clothing, equipment, floors, and hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and water after contact with any dog with signs of respiratory illness."

Owners should heed the warning and get their pets vaccinated. Activities that include other dogs such as play dates or visits to the groomers, dog parks, or boarding facilities make it critical for the owner to get their dog vaccinated. - Mod.TG
