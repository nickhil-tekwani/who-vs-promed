[Burkina Faso] is being hit especially hard by the disease, with a new
strain of the virus, known as strain X, already claiming half of all the
718 meningitis-related deaths since the beginning of the year [2010]. In 5
districts the disease is at epidemic level, and 9 more districts are on
high alert.

The mortality rate is particularly high at 14 per cent. Worryingly,
children and young people are the most affected group, with 80 per cent of
patients aged between 2 and 30. There is no vaccine for strain X.

Plan Burkina Faso has stepped up efforts to deal with the outbreak. Funding
is planned for antibiotics, other treatments, laboratory use, and equipment
and vaccines against the other strains of meningitis, which are still
killing many. So far 5118 people nationally have been treated for the disease.

The country has never seen so many cases of this new type of meningitis,
strain X. As there is no vaccine for it, the focus for the moment must
remain on antibiotic treatment.

[The number of deaths, the number of people nationally who have been
treated for meningitis, and the case fatality rate in Burkina Faso since
the start of 2010 reported in the news release above is about the same as
that reported in a prior ProMED-mail post, Meningitis, meningococcal -
Africa (02): WHO meningitis region 20100426.1343. However, what is new is
the fact that _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup X is responsible for half
of all the 718 meningitis-related deaths since the beginning of the year
(2010).

Mass immunization with the appropriate polysaccharide vaccine is a useful
control measure during an epidemic. However, there is no vaccine for
serogroup X. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended to eliminate nasopharyngeal
carriage of _N. meningitidis_ as soon as possible in close contacts of
persons with invasive meningococcal disease (such as, household members,
day-care center contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's
oral secretions), whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800
times greater than among the general population (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). The rate of
secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of
disease in the index patient.

However, chemoprophylaxis has not generally been recommended during
epidemics (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8625860>), because
multiple sources of exposure, prolonged risk of exposure, logistic
problems, and high cost make this an impractical alternative. When used,
the antimicrobials commonly used for chemoprophylaxis are rifampicin,
ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone, although rifampicin- and
ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease in close contacts has been
reported following had chemoprophylaxis with these antibiotics (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no06/05-0143.htm> and
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm>).
