Anaplasmosis is found in most cattle raising regions of the tropics and
subtropics, including northern Australia and the Philippines. It is caused
by the blood parasite _Anaplasma marginale_, and is usually transmitted in
this country by the tick _Boophilus microplus_. Related organisms,
including _Ehrlichia_ spp. and _Cowdria_ spp., are absent from Australia.
The presence of Anaplasma organisms in the blood of cattle indicates either
previous infection or the animals have been vaccinated with a live
anaplasmosis vaccine. Anaplasma infected animals are likely to develop
strong immunity to anaplasmosis and therefore withstand challenge with
local strains in the Philippines.Uninfected cattle are susceptible to
clinical disease if infected after arrival in the Philippines. _Anaplasma
marginale_ does not pose any risk to human health.
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) takes great care to
ensure that export consignments of feeder cattle meet all Philippine import
health requirements.
In accordance with Philippine import health requirements, AQIS certifies
cattle for export to the Philippines are free from clinical evidence of a
range of diseases including anaplasmosis. The Philippines do not require a
test for Anaplasma parasites, nor is there any scientifically valid reason
to introduce one.
