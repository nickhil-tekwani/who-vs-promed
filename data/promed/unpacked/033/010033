Laboratory results show that a recent wave of bird flu in poultry in
Thailand and Laos was the result of both old and new strains of the
H5N1 virus, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) said today, calling for vigorous implementation of control
measures to prevent further spread of the disease.
The FAO says last month's outbreak in Thailand's Pichit province was
caused by the same strain that has been circulating in the area since
2003, meaning the virus has become endemic to the region.
"The H5N1 virus thus remained alive in central Thailand in a
reservoir of birds and poultry, most probably a mix of backyard
chickens, ducks and fighting cocks," said Laurence Gleeson, regional
manager of FAO's bird flu centre in Bangkok today.
Outbreaks in Thailand's Nakhon Phanom province and Vientiane in Laos,
on the other hand, were caused by strains that did not exist there
previously but that did resemble ones found in southern China, the FAO said.
The bird flu situation in the region has reached a "critical
juncture," said the agency, noting that outbreaks were continuing in
China and also reoccurring in Laos, while cross-border poultry trade
persisted across South-East and East Asia, despite well-known risks.
For all of those reasons, heightened vigilance was essential
throughout the region.
"Timely reporting and sharing information continue to be crucial,"
said He Changchui, FAO's Regional Representative for Asia and the
Pacific, pointing out that while some countries can beat back
occasional bird flu reoccurrence, poorer countries still need funding
to strengthen veterinary services and build up transboundary animal
disease containment programmes.

ASIA ROUND-UP
-------------
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) type H5N1 continues to
spread in Asia. In addition to the 10 countries affected in Southeast
Asia (2003 - 2004), India, Pakistan, Myanmar and Afghanistan were
newly affected by new outbreaks of HPAI in 2006 in poultry and wild birds.
More than 220 million birds have been culled as a consequence of HPAI
outbreaks in Asia with a major impact on food security and people's
livelihoods, backyard poultry farms and the international trade in
live poultry and poultry products. In addition, the unproductive
"downtime" forced on affected poultry farms has had a negative effect
on such farms, public health issues and contact with HPAI H5N1
contaminated environments.
China, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia and Thailand reported new
outbreaks of HPAI during 2006. Although there is an increase in
knowledge and public awareness of HPAI in poultry, it is not yet
clear what is the exact role of wild birds in the epidemiology of
HPAI, the susceptibility of wild bird species, the mechanisms
underlying virus persistence and virus transmission between and among
wild migratory wild birds, resident wild birds, free range birds and
domestic poultry populations.
In Asia, 2 sources of infection of HPAI virus probably coexist: the
introduction, transmission and circulation of the virus in domestic
poultry populations (particularly on backyard farms), live bird
markets and commercial poultry farms with low biosecurity systems,
and migratory wild birds. However, the link between domestic poultry
and wild bird habitats and the true risk posed is still unclear.

[3] Cambodia, ducks, Kampong Cham
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2006

Cambodia has detected 2 new outbreaks of the deadly bird flu virus in
ducks, just days after the disease resurfaced for the 1st time in
more than 4 months.
"We have discovered 2 more outbreaks of bird flu, but it has not
infected the people yet," Kao Phal, the director of animal health at
the agriculture ministry, told AFP on Friday [18 Aug 2006]. Both the
new outbreaks of the H5N1 virus were in Kampong Cham province, just
northeast of the capital Phnom Penh, he said. [See map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/cambodia.pdf>].
One outbreak originated with ducks from the region where bird flu was
detected on 12 Aug 2006, after a farmer smuggled 2000 ducks out of
the area where authorities were slaughtering birds to prevent the
disease from spreading, he said. Those ducks were taken to Tbong
Khmum district, 125 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of the capital,
where most of them had died by Friday [18 Aug 2006], Kao Phal said.
Health authorities slaughtered the remaining ducks, and one official
was fired for failing to prevent the movement of the birds, he added.
A separate outbreak was detected in nearby Batheay district, where
ducks began falling ill on 12 Aug 2006. Kao Phal said 600 birds in
that district have died or been killed.
"We are closely monitoring the situation," he said. "The transport of
poultry has been banned in and out of the new outbreak area."
Bird flu has not struck Cambodia as hard as neighboring countries --
only 6 people have died of the H5N1 strain of the virus since 2003.
But the kingdom is on high alert after new cases were discovered in
Laos and Thailand in July 2006.
The H5N1 virus circulates among wild birds and poultry, which can
then pass it on to humans nearby, but human-to-human transmission is
hard in the virus' present form. The disease has killed nearly 140
people, mostly in Asia, since 2003.

[A statement of Egypt's Supreme National Committee to Combat Bird Flu
has been posted on the official web-site on 17 Aug 2006. (see
<http://birdflu.sis.gov.eg/html/flu0102170.htm>).
It says:
"The ministerial committee established to combat the spread of avian
flu, and chaired by the Minister of Health, has been continuously
monitoring and reviewing developments as follows:
First: No new cases of infections of humans who had been in contact
with dead birds, employed at farms where infections had been detected
or showed symptoms similar to that of avian flu were reported.
Second: Daily status report of infection among fowl: No new cases of
infections were reported to the Central Veterinary Lab. No more
infected sites were appeared in the governorates where infections had
been previously reported".
According to the above official bird-flu web-site, 7 tons of
vaccines, including serotypes H5N1 and H5N2, were imported by air
from Mexico beginning June 2006 and delivered to "a number of
Egyptian governorates" (see 20060604.1555). It seems that Egypt's
decision to use a bivalent vaccine, combining a homologous (H5N1)
vaccine with a heterologous (H5N2) one, is based upon the wish to
utilise the latter also as a marker. Clarification, and -- if
available -- evaluation of the vaccination efficiency, will be
welcomed. - Mod.AS]
