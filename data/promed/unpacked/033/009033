STRIPE RUST, WHEAT - INDIA: NEW STRAIN

Wheat crops in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh are facing a threat from a
new race of yellow rust that can damage the entire produce unless
farmers shift from the current wheat variety, DBW 343, a senior
agricultural scientist said.

"This year [2009], we are feeling the heat of yellow rust, and it is
a warning that if farmers do not shift from DBW 343 to disease
resistant varieties like DBW 17 and DBW 550 soon, it can become a
real threat for the wheat crops," said Mr Jag Shoren, Directorate of
Wheat Research (DWR).

Yellow rust is a fungal disease that can completely destroy wheat and
barley if it appears at an early crop stage. The disease can be
identified if the yellow spores appear and leave a powdery kind of
residue when wiped. The DBW 343 variety, grown in about 6 million
hectares spread across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Bihar, will be completely destroyed
if farmers do not take urgent action, he said.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes
yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to
100 percent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and
a number of grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants
may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next crop
cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken
to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer [self-sown] crops.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from wheat growing areas in Europe, North America and
Australia, and resistance breeding programmes have been set up to
counteract this trend. New strains have also been suspected to
contribute to current difficulties of controlling the disease in China
(ProMED-mail post no. 20090208.0579). In India, several outbreaks of
stripe rust have been reported recently (see 2009 ProMED-mail posts
listed below), and the report above now confirms the emergence of a
new strain associated with them.
