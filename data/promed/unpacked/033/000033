Polio in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- 8 Sep 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) are experiencing
outbreaks of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1).

In Angola, the outbreak which began in April 2007, has this year [2010]
spread to reinfect previously polio-free areas in Angola (the provinces of
Bie, Bengo, Huambo, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, and Uige), as well as to
neighbouring DR Congo, reinfecting Kasai Occidental province which borders
Angola. This outbreak is classified as "re-established" transmission, as it
has persisted for a period greater than 12 months.

In DR Congo, in addition to newly-imported virus from Angola this year
[2010], a case detected in Katanga province with onset of paralysis on 20
Jun 2010, in the east of the country, has been genetically linked to virus
previously imported from Angola, last detected in eastern DR Congo in 2008.
In 2009, a case was detected in Burundi, which was linked to the same
transmission chain. DR Congo was previously regarded by the Advisory
Committee on Poliomyelitis Eradication (ACPE) has having "suspected"
re-established transmission, and this suspicion is now confirmed.

Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (99 per cent reduction in
cases this year [2010] compared with the same period in 2009), western
Africa (no cases since 1 May 2010) and the Horn of Africa (no cases in more
than 12 months), central Africa is now considered to be the greatest risk
to Africa's polio eradication efforts. Angola's outbreak is currently the
only geographically expanding outbreak in Africa. This situation increases
the risk to achieving the next global milestone of the new Global Polio
Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Strategic Plan 2010-2012, the cessation of
all re-established WPV transmission by end-2010.

There is currently a high risk of international spread of WPV from Angola
and DR Congo, given the limited impact to date of control measures and the
historical cross-border spread from both countries. In 2010, outbreak
response in both countries has been inadequate to stop transmission of the
imported viruses. Independent monitoring of supplementary immunization
activities (SIAs) indicate that as many as 25 per cent of children are
regularly missed during SIAs in key areas of Angola (including Luanda,
Lunda Norte, and Lunda Sul). In DR Congo, no response activities have been
conducted in the east of the country since November 2009. The outbreaks
require urgent action to reach a higher proportion of children with oral
polio vaccine (OPV) across Angola and DR Congo and improve surveillance
across Angola and DR Congo.

Due to sub-national surveillance gaps, further undetected circulation of
WPV1 cannot be ruled out. Given the increasingly widespread transmission of
WPV1 in Angola and documented spread to DR Congo, the World Health
Organization (WHO) considers the risk of further international spread to be
high. Given persistent undetected transmission of WPV1 in eastern DR Congo,
and historical evidence of international spread, WHO considers the risk of
further international spread to be high.

Urgent improvements are needed during SIAs and to fill sub-national
surveillance gaps for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), through strengthened
engagement and ownership by provincial- and district-level political and
administrative leadership. In Angola, National Immunization Days (NIDs) are
planned for September 2010, and additional responses are being discussed.
In DR Congo, SIAs are being carried out in response to the new
importations, and an urgent SIA and surveillance strengthening plan is
being developed in response to the detection of the new case in the east of
the country which confirmed persistent undetected transmission in that area.

It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa
strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus
importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also
strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any
virus introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International
Travel and Health guidance, travelers to and from Angola and DR Congo
should be fully protected by vaccination.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[On 3 Aug 2010, ProMED-mail posted a newswire reporting on a "suspected"
outbreak of polio in Angola, which at that time was being denied in the
press. At that time 17 cases of WPV associated polio had been reported in
the country. The above report, issued about one month later, follows the
identification of an additional 3 cases of WPV associated polio in Angola,
noting marked geographic expansion of the areas within the country with
documentation of WPV transmission.

For the purposes of disease eradication, the definition of an outbreak is
"one case".... as the objective is to interrupt transmission of the WPV. As
a reminder, only a small proportion of individuals who are infected with
WPV actually develop paralytic disease -- the range traditionally cited as
a high of one in 50, to a low of 1 in 1000, with the average being cited as
one in 200... hence, for every case of paralytic poliomyelitis identified,
there are an estimated 200 other individuals infected with the WPV and
serve to further continue transmission of the WPV to other susceptibles.

The recognition of countries with re-established transmission of WPV after
having interrupted WPV transmission for 2 or more years prior to the
reintroduction of the virus, is highlighting the challenges to be faced to
achieve the goal of worldwide interruption of transmission of WPV.

According to the most recent polio case counts available on the polio
eradication initiative website, as of the week ending 31 Aug 2010, are
presented below (and are available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>). Of note is that the
overwhelming majority of cases are now occurring in non-endemic countries
(543 out of 638 cases or 85 per cent).

Total cases: Year-to-date 2010 / Year-to-date 2009 / Total in 2009
Globally: 638 / 919 / 1604
- in endemic countries: 95 / 695 / 1256
- in non-endemic countries: 543 / 224 / 348
