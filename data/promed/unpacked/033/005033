An unidentified strain of encephalitis has killed at least 350
children in northern India in the last 9 months, health officials
said Monday [12 Nov 2007].

"Scientists and doctors are working to identify the virus so that
this dreaded disease could be brought under control," said senior
health official Arun Misra.

Outbreaks of mosquito-borne encephalitis are common in Uttar Pradesh,
a state of 180 million people where most public health facilities are
out of reach for the overwhelmingly poor population.

Japanese encephalitis has been a major problem in the state in recent
years, but only 7 children in Uttar Pradesh have died of that disease
this year [2007], Misra said.

Last year [2006], the disease killed 476 children, a dramatic
improvement from 2005 when more than 1400 children died of the
disease.

The progress in fighting Japanese encephalitis is thanks to a massive
vaccination drive, begun in 2005, that has reached more than 16
million children, Misra said.

It's unclear whether the children killed by the unknown strain were
vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis or not, Misra said.

Adults have so far not been affected by the new strain but health
officials provided no other details about it.

[Although this encephalitis outbreak is compatible with Japanese
encephalitis (JE) virus infection, confirmation (or not) will require
laboratory diagnosis. Although 16 million children have been
vaccinated against JE virus since 2005, no denominator figures are
given, so the proportion of the childhood population covered is
unknown. Nor is it known which vaccine was used and the duration of
immunity elicited, especially if the vaccine is inactivated virus.
ProMED-mail requests additional information about the results of the
laboratory tests when they become available.
