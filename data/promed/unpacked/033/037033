SANTO DOMINGO: Volunteers went from house to house in poor neighborhoods
Saturday [16 Dec 2000?, vaccinating children against polio in the wake of
an outbreak here that has left at least 6 children paralyzed and alarmed
health officials.
"Tomorrow, I need to be able to grab a child on the street, any child under
5 years old, and ask his mother if he was vaccinated, and she's going to
tell me yes," said Jose Beltre, the volunteer coordinator in La Cienega, a
squatter neighborhood in the center of the capital.
"We have to get everyone," he told a group of 15 volunteers before they set
out, armed with thermoses of the oral vaccine and chalk to mark the houses
they had visited.
Health care experts thought polio was eliminated from the Western
Hemisphere in 1991, when the last case was reported in Peru. Then in
November [2000, an unusual strain of the virus appeared, first in the
remote mountain town of Constanza. A total of 6 cases have been confirmed
in the Dominican Republic and a 7th has been reported in neighboring
Haiti. The countries have 8 million people each and share the island of
Hispaniola.
In response to the outbreak, health officials in the Dominican Republic
launched the 3-day vaccination campaign Friday. The goal is to vaccinate 2
million children either at stations or by sending volunteers house-to-house
in poorer and remote areas.
Experts from the Pan American Health Organization say the outbreak was
caused not by the wild virus but by an unusual mutation of the vaccine.
The oral vaccine, a relatively safe form of the live virus, is preferred in
part because it is contagious and can give what experts call "herd
immunity." But that only works if most children are vaccinated
directly. If too many children are left unvaccinated, the virus can
circulate in the population long enough to mutate back into a virulent
strain, as apparently happened here.
None of the children who contracted the virus had been vaccinated, PAHO
officials say. The only other similar outbreak occurred in Egypt in the
1980s, when 30 people contracted the disease.
Polio is a crippling and sometimes fatal disease that attacks the central
nervous system and usually strikes children younger than 5. Fewer than
7100 cases were reported worldwide last year, confined to Africa and Asia.
A handful of mothers lined up Saturday morning at the clinic in La
Cienega. A few others followed the teams around, waiting for them to reach
their homes. The volunteers picked their way through garbage-strewn
alleys, knocking on doors and wandering through houses looking for children.
Coordinating the vaccinations was complicated. The vaccine has to be kept
on ice and must be given to at least 80 percent of the children to prevent
the mutation. A safer injected vaccine that cannot mutate is not used here
because it is more expensive, it has to be given by professionals and it
does not offer the herd immunity effect.

[This is a nice summary of the issues related to control measures along
with a good mention of the pre-existing justification for why the IPV is
not being used at present in the Dominican Republic.
The IPV/OPV debate in the USA was heating up while I was working on polio
surveillance at the CDC in 1977/1978 and it took approximately 20 years for
the USA to make the change to a combined IPV/OPV schedule for routine
immunizations in 1997. After an outbreak of polio in a population group
that rejected vaccinations on religious grounds in the USA in 1979 (related
to an outbreak of polio among a different population group that also
rejected vaccinations on religious grounds in the Netherlands and Canada in
1978/1979), the only reported cases of polio in the USA were either
isolated imported cases in inadequately vaccinated individuals or were
vaccine-associated cases (vaccine recipients and contacts of recent vaccine
recipients).
A major advantage of OPV is its ability to 'vaccinate' more individuals
than actually were administered the vaccine through its excretion into the
environment and its transmission to close contacts of recently vaccinated
individuals. These are the very same properties that unfortunately lead to
the vaccine-associated contact cases. This may well have contributed to
the ongoing outbreak in the Dominican Republic through the possible
inadvertent vaccination/infection with vaccine virus of an immune-deficient
individual, permitting a chronic infection which may have led to the
reversion in neurovirulence (see: Khetsuriani N, Prevots DR, Pallansch M,
Kew O. Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) persistence among immunodeficient
persons with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) [Abstract
no. 675. Presented at the 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, 26-29 Sep 1999).
After the certification of polio eradication in the Americas, when it was
clear that the risk of disease from the vaccine clearly outweighed the risk
of disease from the wild virus, along with reviews of studies that
demonstrated that the use of IPV did not result in a decrease in
vaccination coverage, the USA switched to a pure IPV schedule in June 1999
(see: <ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4905.pdf> for a review
of the current recommendations and in-depth background on polio
immunization issues).
Now that wild virus has been eliminated from circulation in the Americas
and the Western Pacific Regions, an outbreak due to a reversion to
neurovirulence of an OPV viral strain makes the debate that was experienced
in the USA relevant to regions that have eradicated wild virus
circulation. One speculates that the issue of when and if the region
should consider if there is a justification for either a combined schedule
of IPV/OPV or IPV alone is probably a hot topic in PAHO at the moment. One
also speculates that the economists are hard at work looking at the cost
efficacy ratio of the various vaccine schedule options in the region. -
