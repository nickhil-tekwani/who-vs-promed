Based on the council's statistics, 845 dengue cases were reported in 2017, in contrast to 387 cases this year [2018], said mayor Datuk Mohd Azizi Mohd Zain during MBPJ's full board meeting. He said the Search and Destroy Aedes Rangers (Sedar) teams have reduced the number of dengue cases.

La Reunion Island. 10 Apr 2018. 167 additional autochthonous dengue cases reported during the past week. Total rises to 755 cases; DEN-2 predominates. http://outbreaknewstoday.com/autochthonous-dengue-fever-reunion-59266/
La Reunion Island. 15 Apr 2018. Nearly 1000 confirmed cases in the north, west and south of the island since 1 Jan 2018.
A dengue epidemic is currently affecting western and southern Reunion. After an unusual circulation of the virus during the austral winter of 2017, the number of dengue cases has gradually increased since the beginning of 2018, with an intensification in February 2018. Public Health France publishes a "point of situation" report and provides reminders about preventive actions to adopt.
On 26 Mar 2018, the Prefect of Reunion declared the level to be a "low intensity epidemic" of the ORSEC arbovirus control device. The intervention unit in the Indian Ocean region provides epidemiological surveillance of dengue fever on Reunion Island and publishes its data every week in an epidemiological point. The current epidemic could continue to intensify in the coming weeks. Indeed, the population is not immune to dengue fever (only 3.1 percent of blood donors tested for dengue in 2008 had antibodies against the virus), and current weather conditions are conducive to vector development.

Epidemiological situation as of 9 Apr 2018:
- 992 indigenous cases reported since 1 Jan 2018
- 237 cases were confirmed during the last week, one case imported from Mauritius
- Prevalence of DENV-2 serotype
- A circulation area of the virus identified in the north
- Continuation of the epidemic in the west and south

- Tonga. 30 Mar 2018. Tonga has recorded 124 cases of dengue since the beginning of the year [2018].

- Samoa. 9 Apr 2018. Serotype 2 Outbreak in Samoa, 2017/2018. The cumulative total as of 18 Mar 2018 is 3255, with a national attack rate of 16.6 per 1000 population. Dengue fever continues to spread geographically, mostly in the Apia Urban and North West Upolu regions. A majority of those affected are 5-9-year-old children, which make up 31 percent of the total cases. There have not been any dengue related deaths reported, hence the total dengue-related mortality remains at 5.

[Dengue fever (DF) and its severe forms -- dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) -- have become major international public health concerns. Over the past few decades, there has been a dramatic global increase in the frequency of dengue fever (DF), DHF, and DSS and their epidemics, with a concomitant increase in disease incidence.

Dengue is found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, predominantly in urban and semi-urban areas. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to family Flaviviradae that is spread by _Aedes_ (_Stegomyia_) mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever.

The most effective means of vector control is environmental management, which includes planning, organization, carrying out and monitoring activities for the modification or manipulation of environmental factors with a view to preventing or reducing vector propagation and human-vector-pathogen contact. In Asia and the Americas, _Ae. aegypti_ breeds primarily in man-made containers, while in Africa, it breeds both in natural containers, such as tree holes and leaf axils, and in artificial containers. Environmental management is also part of the control measures taken against _Ae. albopictus_, a secondary vector for dengue in the Pacific and Asia, and a potential vector following recent infestations in Africa, southern Europe, and the Americas.

The WHO Expert Committee on Vector Biology and Control defined 3 types of environmental management:
- Environmental modification: Long lasting physical transformations of vector habitats.
- Environmental manipulation: Temporary changes to vector habitat as a result of planned activity to produce conditions unfavorable to vector breeding.
- Changes to human habitation or behaviour: Efforts to reduce human-vector pathogen contact.

Environmental management methods to control _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ to reduce human-vector contact include the improvement of water supply and storage, solid waste management, and the modification of man-made larval habitats. Environmental management should focus on the destruction, alteration, disposal or recycling of containers and natural larval habitats that produce the greatest number of adult _Aedes_ mosquitos in each community. These programmes should be conducted concurrently with health education programmes and communications that encourage community participation in the planning, execution and evaluation of container-management programmes (e.g. regular household sanitation or clean-up campaigns). - Mod.UBA]
