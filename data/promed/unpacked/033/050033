[The previous two posts on this outbreak were "Undiagnosed disease -
Bangladesh (Tangail): RFI 20050115.0125" and "Undiagnosed disease -
Bangladesh (Tangail)(02): Nipah conf 20050125.0267". Now that Nipah has
been confirmed, the thread has been changed. - Mod.DK]
Bangladesh: The Nipah virus isolated in Tangail is distinct from the
Malaysian strain
-----------------------------------------------
The Nipah virus behind a mysterious sickness which has claimed several
lives in Bangladesh is not the Malaysian strain, but is closely related to
it, National Public Health Laboratory consultant virologist Prof. Chua Kaw
Bing said. Professor Chua, who was part of a Malaysian team invited by WHO
to help set up a diagnostic virology laboratory in Dhaka last year [2004],
said the victims probably had contracted the virus by consuming
partially-eaten fruits contaminated by flying foxes. He was responding to a
report yesterday [Wed 26 Jan 2005] that disease experts in the United
States had [detected] Nipah virus in blood samples of afflicted persons in
Tangail, 190 km north-east of Dhaka, in Bangladesh.
Prof. Chua said that in May last year [2004], he and 2 others from
University Hospital -- Prof. Tan Chong Tin, a neurologist, and Dr. K.T.
Wong, a pathologist -- were invited by WHO to Dhaka to assist in setting up
the diagnostic virology laboratory, on which work is still in progress. He
said that they learned that Bangladeshis were found to have contracted
Nipah virus infection in various places, in Mahepur in 2001, Nagoan in
2003, and Faripur (twice in 2004).
In Bangladesh, the victims are known to have contracted Nipah virus in the
early part of the year. This may have something to do with the ecology of
the region, such as certain fruits ripening at that time and the birthing
season of the flying foxes. "It is a complicated process" he said.
In the Faripur outbreak, Prof. Chua said Bangladeshi epidemiologists
suspected that the victims could have contracted Nipah virus through
contaminated fruits that were partially eaten by flying foxes. "This
suspicion is based on my work of isolating the Nipah virus (in 1999/2000)
from partially eaten fruits by flying foxes of _pteropid_ species." The
health authorities in Dhaka, he added, should [carry out further
investigations] to have a better understanding of how the virus has spilled
over from flying foxes to humans, as the situation there could be quite
different from the situation in Malaysia.
