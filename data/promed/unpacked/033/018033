CDC warns of rare fungal disease
-----------------------------------------------
Three people in Arizona have contracted a fungal infection this year that is
rare in humans and can cause noncancerous growths, the government said
Thursday.
The fungus -- gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis -- is commonly found in
decaying vegetation and soil and in the gastrointestinal tract of reptiles
and amphibians. It is rarely found in people, the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said.
Only 12 cases have ever been reported - 3 in Brazil, one in Kuwait, one in
Florida and the rest in Arizona, where the 3 most recent cases occurred
between January and March, the CDC said. The other 3 Arizona cases occurred
from 1994 to 1998.
The disease is often misdiagnosed as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease,
the CDC said. Such was the case with those infected in Arizona.
The fungus is passed through ingestion or an open wound.

Gastrointestinal Basidiobolomycosis -- Arizona, 1994-1999
---------------------------------------------------
In March 1999, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) notified
CDC about six cases of gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis (GIB), an
invasive fungal infection. Three cases were reported during January-March
1999, compared with three cases reported during the previous 5 years. This
report describes two persons who had representative clinical presentations
and summarizes the findings of the investigation of these cases, which
indicate that this unusual fungal infection causes severe illness and may
be misdiagnosed initially.
Case Reports [see original]
Epidemiologic Investigation [see original]
MMWR Editorial Note:
B. ranarum rarely causes human disease in the United States.
Basidiobolomycosis is a form of zygomycosis caused by the fungus B. ranarum
(from the order Entomophthorales), which has been isolated throughout the
world from decaying vegetation and soil and from the GI tracts of reptiles,
amphibians, fish, and insectivorous bats (1). Basidiobolomycosis is most
common in the tropical regions of eastern and western Africa, but cases
also have occurred in southeast Asia and South America. The disease most
commonly affects males aged less than 20 years and usually manifests as
painless, subcutaneous nodules on the lower extremities and buttocks (1).
Infection is secondary to traumatic inoculation. GIB is rare, with only six
cases previously reported (three cases from Brazil, one from Kuwait, and
two from the United States, including one case from the Arizona cluster
described in this report) (2-6).
A definitive diagnosis of basidiobolomycosis requires culture of B. ranarum
from clinical or surgical specimens, but a probable diagnosis can be made
based on histopathologic appearance. The microscopic appearance of B.
ranarum in tissues is characterized by scarce, broad, thin-walled,
pleomorphic hyphae surrounded by a collar of eosinophilic material (known
as the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) (7). The host inflammatory reaction is
composed mostly of mononuclear cells with abundant eosinophils and
occasional granulomas (7). Typically, the muscular layer of the GI tract is
thickened greatly and eosinophilic inflammation is present extending
through the serosa into the perigastric or mesenteric fat; the GI mucosa is
typically spared (2,3,5,6). The histopathologic appearance of GIB may be
confused with Conidiobolus coronatus, another Entomophthorales, or
mucormycosis (7). GIB has a nonspecific clinical presentation and may be
diagnosed initially as cancer, PUD, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, or
inflammatory bowel disease (1). A specific serologic immunodiffusion test
is available through CDC, but its sensitivity is unknown, and antibodies
against B. ranarum appear to wane following effective treatment (6,8). The
patients described in this report had peripheral eosinophilia, but this
laboratory finding has not been reported previously as a feature of
basidiobolomycosis.
Successful response to therapy has been reported with ketoconazole,
itraconazole, and potassium iodide; however, response to amphotericin B is
poor (2-6,9). In the six cases described in this report, the three
case-patients in whom GIB was diagnosed before 1999 apparently have been
cured following surgery and treatment with itraconazole. The other three
patients remained clinically well while taking itraconazole
postoperatively. Because all of the Arizona patients underwent surgical
excision of the affected parts of their GI tracts, it is difficult to
evaluate whether itraconazole therapy alone could have resulted in adequate
clinical response.
Ecologic studies in the United States have identified B. ranarum in
reptiles and amphibians (10). GIB presumably is acquired through ingestion.
However, except for the patient with a history of pica, it is unclear how
the other patients acquired the infection. Possible exposures include
unintentional ingestion of contaminated soil, especially near rivers or
lakes, or eating fruits or vegetables contaminated with soil or feces from
reptiles or amphibians. The findings in this report indicate that decreased
acidity and other host factors (e.g., underlying disease and use of
medication) may increase the risk for acquiring GIB.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First,
despite active case finding, a small number of cases were available for
analysis. Second, because of the extended time between exposure and initial
interviews of patients, the findings are subject to recall bias. To
minimize this problem, the questionnaire focused on daily activities and
usual food preparation methods.
Increased awareness by clinicians and public health surveillance may help
identify additional cases, determine the burden of disease, and lead to a
better understanding of risk factors for GIB and possible prevention
measures. Physicians caring for patients with suspected basidiobolomycosis
should contact their state health departments or CDC's Mycotic Diseases
Branch, Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for
Infectious Diseases, telephone (404) 639-2499.
