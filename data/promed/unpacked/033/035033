[1] New York Times report
Date: Fri 18 Dec 2009

Health officials reported on Friday [18 Dec 2009] that 2 transplant
patients are critically ill with a rare brain infection that was
transmitted to them by kidneys taken from a donor at the University
of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.

The same infection probably killed the organ donor, but it was not
diagnosed; his doctors thought he had an autoimmune disease. 2 other
patients also received heart and liver transplants from the donor,
but neither has become ill. The transplants took place in November
[2009], in 3 states. A spokeswoman for the university declined to say
where the recipients were, citing patient confidentiality.

3 weeks after their transplant surgeries, the kidney recipients
became ill abruptly, within hours of each other, with seizures, a
change in mental status and fever, said Dr Eileen Farnon, an
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which is investigating the cases. A doctor noted that both were
transplant recipients, and immediately suspected that they might have
contracted an illness from the donor.

Subsequent tests of tissue left from the deceased donor found the
infection, which was also diagnosed in the patients. The patients are
being treated with a mixture of antimicrobial drugs.

The infection is caused by an amoeba, _Balamuthia mandrillaris_,
which lives in soil and water. Only about 70 cases have ever been
identified in the United States. Nearly all have been fatal. The
current cases are the first to have been found in transplant
recipients. Although infections from transplants are uncommon, there
have been cases in which recipients contracted West Nile virus,
rabies, and other infections.

The moderator wonders if _Balamuthia_ could be present as an
asymptomatic infection, but the cited report notes that the donor
died after suffering "neurologic problems" so it is likely this was
undiagnosed but not asymptomatic.

It may be worth noting that not all free-living amoebae would pose
the same risk for organ transplantation. _Naegleria_ is directly
neuroinvasive through the cribriform plate into the olfactory tract
and has not been demonstrated outside the CNS (although myocarditis
has been reported in conjunction with PAM, _Naegleria_ have not been
identified in the myocardium).

None of 8 recipients of organs from 2 infected donors developed
subsequent evidence of infection (Bennet WM et al, Am J
Transplantation 2008; 8: 1334-5 and Kramer MH, Lerner CJ, Visvesvara
GS. J Clin Micro, 1997; 35: 1032-3.)

_Acanthamoeba_ and _Balamuthia_, on the other hand, are probably
acquired via the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts and
disseminated infection is well known.

I would like to reply to the posting "Amebic meningoencephalitis,
organ transplant - USA (MS)" published today [20 Dec 2009]. Since my
final project is on rabies, I don't understand how it was possible
that the organs from a patient, who had died after showing neurologic
signs, were taken.

Because of the risk of rabies no organ transplant should be allowed
if the donor had neurological signs before his death. This rule was
[adopted] after the death of 16 people from rabies as a consequence
of organ transplantation.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Preston Church and Maya Kimchi for their
comments. It was indeed mentioned that the donor had neurological
problems. The fact that _Acanthamoeba_ and _Balamuthia_ can infect
humans through the gastrointestinal tract may explain that the
infection was seen outside the brain. The notion in the New York
Times article above, that the doctors thought that the patient had an
autoimmune disease is interesting. Autoimmune diseases are often
systemic affecting more than a single organ.

Information on _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ can be found at
