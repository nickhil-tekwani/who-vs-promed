In reference to the above report [20090826.3005]: The report said that 52
cows had died of the disease etc. Does this mean they were depopulated as
part of a emergency response program from the authorities or that they died
of the disease itself? In that FMD causes very minimal mortality except in
juvenile animals, is there lab confirmation that FMD is the cause of the
outbreak? If the "disease outbreak" is actually killing the cattle, then it
is likely not to be FMD, and another disease with high mortality should be
suspected, though endemic FMD may be present in these herds.

[Dr Goldsmith's observations are appreciated. The cited newswire reported
the deaths of 52 cows of 23 families during 20 days. Indeed, this may sound
like an unusually high number; however, since the denominator is not given,
the case fatality rate could not be determined.

It indeed may be wondered whether the animals have died of the disease or,
rather, have been culled. A previous report from Viet Nam addressing the
recently introduced FMDV serotype A mentioned the deaths of 20 calves in
the Nghe An province (see posting 20081218.3973). The said posting stated
that the Nghe An authorities culled all 96 sick cows and buffaloes in the
affected locations.

Case fatality rates may reach very high values, even exceeding 50 per cent
in some cases, if/when young, unvaccinated animals and a highly pathogenic
FMD strain are involved. Since the cited newswire included the term "cow",
the age of the animals involved was not clear. The term "cow" has,
linguistically, 2 different meanings: 1) the mature female of
cattle/bovine; and 2) a domestic bovine animal regardless of its sex or age.

Unfortunately, no official information from Viet Nam on the introduction
and spread of FMDV serotype A, allegedly since the end of 2008, is as yet
available on the OIE website. The most recent official notification of Viet
Nam concerning FMD dates back to July 2007, when an outbreak of FMDV
serotype Asia1 was reported and later (February 2008) declared resolved,
becoming endemic. No mortalities were reported from the Asia1 affected
farms. In the annual report for 2008, Viet Nam provided information on
several outbreaks of the endemic serotype O.

A response to ProMED-mail's previous RFI, and an official OIE report to
confirm (or otherwise) the information on FMDV serotype A allegedly
recorded in several provinces of Viet Nam from north to south since
December 2008, are anticipated. The reports are expected to include the
recorded morbidity and mortality data and, if available, information on the
strain's genotyping and on the adequacy of applied vaccines. - Mod.AS]
