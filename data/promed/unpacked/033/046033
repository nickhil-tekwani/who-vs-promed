S. Korea Confirms Foot-and-Mouth
---------------------------------
SEOUL: South Korea confirmed Sat 04 May 2002 that foot-and-mouth
disease killed 280 pigs at a farm this week and said the livestock
disease may be spreading. The announcement comes 2 years after a
foot-and-mouth outbreak that devastated the country's pork exports.
Agriculture officials slaughtered 10 000 pigs at nearby farms this
week and said Saturday they were restricting movements of livestock
nationwide. They instructed the nation's pig and cattle farmers to
fumigate their facilities.
"We have a strict ban on any movement of livestock in areas
surrounding the stricken farms," said Kim Chang-sup, an official at
Seoul's Agriculture Ministry. He said farmers needing to transport
animals in other areas would have to take precautions such as
fumigating animals in the presence of officials.
The ministry said tests confirmed that foot-and-mouth disease killed
280 pigs that died earlier this week with blisters in their hooves
and mouths at a farm near Ansung, 60 miles south of the capital,
Seoul.
Also Saturday, the ministry determined that 50 pigs on a farm at
Jinchun, a town 12 miles south of Ansung, were also infected with
foot-and-mouth. The disease spreads rapidly among cloven-hoofed
animals such as cows and pigs but is not dangerous to humans.
Kim said the government would slaughter all 1000 pigs at the farm at
Jinchun and was trying to determine how many more pigs it should kill
in the surrounding area. Korean television showed soldiers and health
officials fumigating farms and spraying decontaminants on vehicles
entering villages. News of the outbreak came just as neighboring
Japan had begun lifting restrictions on South Korean pork that was
imposed after the disease struck some farms 2 years ago.
The Japanese government responded Sat 04 May 2002 by imposing a
provisional ban on imports of pork, beef, mutton, and other meat
products from South Korea, said Hiroyuki Otomo, an official at
Tokyo's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry.
Almost 95 percent of South Korea's 339-million-dollar annual pork
exports went to Japan until 2000. South Korea exported only 75
million dollars in pork in 2000 and 46 million last year, mostly to
Russia, the Philippines and a few other Southeast Asian countries.
The 2000 outbreak forced authorities to slaughter 2200 animals,
mostly cattle, and vaccinate 1.5 million. It cost the government and
farmers an estimated 231 million dollars, according to government
data.

[In Mar 2000, FMD was introduced into South Korea for the first time
in 66 years. The Koreans chose vaccination as their control strategy
since exports could be forgone, though the pork market to Japan was
important and growing. Although the outbreak only encompassed 15
herds, it was rather widely dispersed geographically and that made a
stamping-out -- by slaughter policy -- unattractive. South Korea
became officially free of FMD in September 2001.
So while vaccination did take longer, it proved to be a viable
strategy... or so we thought. Now the new outbreak, 8 months later,
poses questions: Will it be the same Pan-Asia O strain that has
caused so much trouble around the world (UK and many other
countries)? How did it enter into South Korea? This question is an
extremely important one, but may remain unanswered. It would be
invaluable to know whether the virus was introduced exogenously or if
there were cracks in the population's immunity associated with the
vaccination program. Last time both Japan and Korea cast suspicion
on imported Chinese hay.
Last but not least, how far will it spread? The piggery involved is a
big one, and pigs are amplifiers of the virus, so the potential for
spread definitely exists. Authoritative reports from South Korea will
be helpful. - Mod PC
