All babies born in London should be vaccinated against tuberculosis
(TB) to protect them against the growing threat from the disease,
public health specialists say. Almost 45 percent of all childhood TB
cases in the UK occur in the capital [London] and the rising
incidence has now passed the threshold where routine immunisation
should be introduced, according to experts from the Health Protection
Agency (HPA).

Tuberculosis is often thought to be a disease of the past. It was a
major killer until the early 20th century, but the introduction of
powerful drugs in the mid-20th century was thought to have beaten it,
and by the late 1980s cases had fallen to an all-time low of 5000 a
year. But since then there has been a resurgence and the incidence
has steadily increased. There were 9153 cases among adults and
children recorded in the UK in 2009, the largest annual increase (5.5
percent) since 2005.

Nine out of 10 cases occur in ethnic minorities, and routine BCG
[Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin] vaccination of school age children
against TB was abandoned in 2005 in favour of a more focused campaign
on children of immigrants. Current policy is to offer vaccination to
children born abroad or with parents born abroad. Immunisation is
also recommended for all children living in areas where the incidence
of TB exceeds 40 cases per 100 000.

Writing in the Journal of Public Health, Josephine Ruwende of the HPA
and colleagues say this level is now seen consistently across London.
They criticise the existing policy of targeting immigrant families
because high levels of migration within the city make them difficult
to trace. "With an overall TB incidence in London exceeding 40 per
100 000, universal BCG immunisation of all neonates should be
considered across all London boroughs," they say.

Most children with tuberculosis are infected in this country (unlike
adults, who are mostly infected abroad). Although children rarely
pass on the disease to others there have been outbreaks in schools.
The study found 1370 cases of TB reported in children under 15 [?
years] in London between 1999 and 2006.

In 2004, the UK's Chief Medical Officer launched a TB Action Plan
that called for a "progressive decline" in incidence rates of TB by
at least 2 percent per year for everyone born in England. "Clearly,
this is not being achieved among London's children," the authors write.

Tuberculosis is a global killer, claiming more than 2 million lives a
year, mostly in the developing world. It is curable with drugs, but
requires 6 months of treatment and the course must be completed to
prevent the disease returning. The development of drug-resistant
strains of TB in recent years has caused alarm. These cases are
extremely difficult to treat and cost tens of thousands of pounds.

Dr Ibrahim Abubakar, a TB expert at the HPA's Centre for Infections,
said: "This increase shows we must remain vigilant in our fight
against TB. This is an entirely preventable infection, but it can be
fatal if prompt diagnosis and treatment are not given. People need to
be aware of the main symptoms of TB, which include a fever and night
sweats; a persistent cough; weight loss; and blood in your sputum
(phlegm or spit). If you experience 2 or 3 of these symptoms for more
than 3 weeks, you should go to your GP."

[BCG, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin, is an attenuated strain of the
bovine tuberculosis bacillus, _Mycobacterium bovis_, developed for
use as a live bacterial vaccine to prevent tuberculosis (TB) and
disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. In addition, it is used
as an immunostimulant in the treatment of superficial carcinoma of
the bladder. The vaccine was 1st administered to humans in 1921 and
remains the only vaccine against tuberculosis in general use.

Many persons born in countries with a high prevalence of TB have been
BCG-vaccinated in infancy to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis
and miliary disease. However, vaccination with BCG is not recommended
as a means to control TB in the USA, relying instead on the detection
and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI).

BCG is not recommended because of the success of other measures in
reducing incidence of TB, the low risk of infection with
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in the U.S. (e.g., in 2003, children
aged <14 years accounted for 6.2 percent of reported TB cases -
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5412a1.htm>), the
variable effectiveness of the vaccine against adult pulmonary TB
(Colditz GA, Brewer TF, Berkey CS, et al. Efficacy of BCG vaccine in
the prevention of tuberculosis. Meta-analysis of the published
literature. JAMA 1994;271:698--702), and the vaccine's potential
interference with tuberculin skin test (TST) reactivity. TST is used
to diagnose LTBI.

Also, BCG vaccination is not used in HIV-infected persons (WHO.
Revised BCG vaccination guidelines for infants at risk for HIV
infection. Wkly Epidemiol Rec 2007; 82 (21): 193-196); disseminated
disease due to BCG has been reported in HIV-infected children
vaccinated at birth with BCG, and immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (IRIS) associated with BCG also has been reported among
children initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for
HIV infection
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5811a1.htm>).

Children most commonly are infected with _M. tuberculosis_ from
exposure in their immediate environment, usually the household.
Contact investigation of adults with infectious TB is the most
important activity for early detection of TB among children. Children
exposed to active TB must be evaluated for LTBI; children with LTBI
are at high risk for progressing to primary TB and its sequellae.

In the U.S., infants and children are treated for LTBI if they have a
positive TST or are exposed to a person who has contagious TB (after
exclusion of active TB disease in the infant or child and regardless
of the child's TST results). Exposed children with an initially
negative TST are retested in 3 months after exposure to infectious TB
has ended. If the 2nd test result is positive, treatment is continued
for a full course of treatment for LTBI. If the 2nd test result is
negative, treatment may be stopped
(<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm>).

In 1996, the U.S. CDC only recommended vaccination with BCG for
infants and children with exposure to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in
settings in which other protective measures are either inaccessible
or proven to be ineffective. Specifically, "BCG vaccination should
only be considered for children who have a negative tuberculin skin
test and who are continually exposed, and cannot be separated from,
adults who [either] are untreated or ineffectively treated for TB
disease (if the child cannot be given long-term treatment for
infection); or have TB caused by strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin"
(<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/prevention/BCG.htm>).

Timely reporting and contact investigation of suspected cases of
infectious TB is crucial in prevention of TB among children. The high
rate of TB in the UK in children born, or with parents, born in
countries with high TB prevalence suggests that detection and
treatment of active TB in adults in the households of these children,
targeted tuberculin skin testing of children from these households,
treatment of exposed children for confirmed or suspected LTBI, or
targeted tuberculin skin testing of recent immigrants from high TB
prevalence countries has been inadequate.
