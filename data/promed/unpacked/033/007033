Three cases of salmonellosis have been officially confirmed in Taravao in addition to the suspected case of a 4th person who died after having shown the symptoms of salmonella infection.

In a statement, released Thursday morning, 30 Nov 2017, the Ministry of Health said: "3 cases of salmonellosis confirmed and a suspected case, occurred in Taravao." These infections were reported to the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire between 20 and 28 Nov 2017. Above all, "one person has died," says this information, while indicating that "the main cause of death remains uncertain."

This person died in the night of 18 to 19 Nov 2017, a few hours after eating an egg dish (Kai Fan). His wife suffered a salmonella infection following this meal. One of 2 other confirmed cases of salmonellosis also consumed a Kai Fan. These takeaway meals were all purchased in the same Taravao business.

"We were not able to take samples from the deceased person," says Dr. Marine Giard. "It is thought that this person also had salmonellosis, but the doctor who observed the death did not remember that the person's episode of gastroenteritis was the direct cause of death. [He] died at home and did not call a doctor during the episode of illness. (...) He had the same symptoms as his wife, who was confirmed with salmonellosis," said the head of the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire, noting that "it is unusual for a healthy person, as it seemed to be his case, to die of salmonellosis, which is why this case is still very surprising. There was no autopsy."

The statement released on Thu 30 Nov 2017 said that an "inspection was conducted in this store by the Center for Hygiene and Public Health." Two types of analyses are in progress, the Ministry of Health said, stating that they are interested in the "remains of the food consumed" and "water withdrawals made due to recent rainy episodes." The sanitary survey is currently underway: "We will try to explore all leads; the dishes sold in this shop are being analyzed, water samples were taken; we are going back to the egg production chain and examining people who were preparing the dishes," says Dr. Giard.

Regarding the salmonellosis found in Taravao: "More than 10 days later, we have had no new cases declared; we have good reasons to assume that the infectious source has dried up," the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire stated.

[Certainly, undercooked eggs are a well-recognized vehicle for the transmission of salmonellosis. It is unclear whether salmonellosis was the proximate cause of death in the man mentioned, as most fatalities in salmonellosis are in the very young and very older and those with underlying diseases. It is not clear whether the decedent had any substantial risk factors for more severe disease.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, especially with _S._ Enteritidis_, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient if pasteurized. - Mod.LL]

[Tahiti, with a population of 183 645 residents in 2012, is the most populous island of French Polynesia, accounting for 68.5 percent of its total population; the small town of Taravao is situated on a short isthmus that connects the larger northwestern portion of Tahiti, where Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia is located, with the much smaller southeastern portion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti). - Mod.ML
