Methylene chloride, a common paint-stripping chemical, appears to have killed at least 13 workers who used it to refinish bathtubs, a group of occupational health researchers said in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6107a2.htm?s_cid=mm6107a2_w].

The deaths occurred from April 2000 to last September [2011]. Most victims were relatively young -- only 3 were older than 50 -- but [8] had a documented history of cardiovascular disease.

Methylene chloride vapors are denser than air and may have pooled in the tubs where the victims were working, the researchers speculated. They noted that the chemical can also be absorbed through the skin. Moreover, bathrooms are usually small and may not have been well-ventilated.

"Both OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] and NIOSH [National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health] are issuing communications regarding the risk for death from bathtub refinishing using methylene chloride strippers and the availability of safer products," the MMWR report indicated.

"In a small, enclosed bathroom, it is unlikely that a methylene chloride stripping agent can be used safely."

[Sometimes retrospective studies provide insight that is not visible at the time the situation is occurring. Patterns are seen when a larger picture becomes available. Sadly, this is often after one or more persons may have lost their life.

Following is the editorial note from the MMWR report. Interested readers may find the full report at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6107a2.htm?s_cid=mm6107a2_w.

Methylene chloride is a highly volatile, colorless, toxic chemical widely used as a degreaser, process catalyst, and paint remover (6). Because methylene chloride vapors are heavier than air, in the case described in this report they likely remained in the bathtub after application. To use products containing methylene chloride safely, work areas must be well ventilated, and when levels of methylene chloride exceed exposure limits even after implementation of engineering and work practice controls, workers must use respiratory protective equipment, such as tight-fitting, full-face, supplied-air respirators (4). OSHA's standard for methylene chloride, which was promulgated in 1997, covers all occupational exposures to the chemical (such as, general industry, shipyard employment, and construction). The standard mandates that air monitoring, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and personal protective equipment be in place where methylene chloride is used.

Methylene chloride is absorbed primarily via inhalation, although it is also absorbed effectively by intact skin. To protect against skin absorption, butyl rubber or polyvinyl alcohol gloves must be worn; latex gloves like those used in the case described in this report will not protect against skin absorption. Methylene chloride is metabolized to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide (6,7) and is categorized as a carcinogen (8).

Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels in the blood as great as 10-12 percent can result from methylene chloride exposure (2,6). COHb levels in this range can cause headache, nausea, or dizziness. Arrhythmias have been reported at COHb levels as low as 4-6 percent, angina at levels as low as 3.9 percent, and electrocardiographic changes at levels as low as 2.0 percent (6,9). In the 13 deaths analyzed in this report, the data indicate that carbon monoxide was not likely the cause of death. Because methylene chloride, like many solvents, acts as a central nervous system depressant causing narcosis at high concentrations, the decedents likely lost consciousness and died from respiratory depression. Consistent with this conclusion were the high methylene chloride blood levels at the time of autopsy found in the 6 persons whose methylene chloride blood levels were quantified. However, because 8 of the 13 decedents had cardiac disease (6 with coronary artery disease and 5 with a cardiomyopathy or valvular disease), the arrhythmogenic effect of the methylene chloride itself or of its metabolite, carbon monoxide, might have been a contributing factor in their deaths.

Methylene chloride-based stripping products usually are applied with a paint brush or aerosol can. The products cause the bathtub coating to pucker, allowing it to be easily scraped away so that a new finish can be applied. In a small, enclosed bathroom, it is unlikely that a methylene chloride stripping agent can be used safely. Alternative methods of bathtub stripping, such as sanding, should be used. Alternative chemicals that could be used include petroleum distillates, acetate, mineral spirits, caustic paste, and acid-based formulas. However, these other methods and chemicals have their own hazards, and all employers and employees should be well aware of their risks (10). Potential worker exposures should be evaluated to determine whether the work process is safe and to ensure that workers are protected.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, the number of deaths identified by OSHA likely is an underestimate because the IMIS [Integrated Management Information System] database does not include all occupational deaths and injuries (such as those of self-employed workers). Second, the data examined in this report are limited to workers and do not address potential risks to consumers who have access to some of these products. Finally, additional deaths among bathtub refinishers might have been ascribed to heart disease when they were actually caused by methylene chloride.

Both OSHA and NIOSH are issuing communications regarding the risk for death from bathtub refinishing using methylene chloride strippers and the availability of safer products. The Michigan program distributed an investigation report and a hazard alert (10) after identifying bathtub refinishers in Michigan through Internet directories.

Methylene chloride also presents a risk to persons among the general public who seek to do their own bathtub refinishing. A review of the OSHA IMIS system, the Internet, and hardware stores, found 42 stripping products, 26 (62 percent) of which are readily available on the Internet or at local hardware stores. Many of these stripping products contain 60-90 percent methylene chloride. Many Internet sites promote do-it-yourself bathtub stripping, and no state or federal restrictions exist on the use of methylene chloride stripping agents. The widespread availability of these products and their effectiveness puts both professional bathtub refinishers and do-it-yourselfers at risk. Public health agencies, worker safety agencies, manufacturers, and trade organizations should clearly communicate the extreme hazard posed by using methylene chloride-based stripping products in bathtub refinishing.
