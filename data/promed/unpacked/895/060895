Rabid bats are invading a Pueblo apartment complex and at least 2 people, including a child, have to be treated for rabies. Animal control has responded to the Fenix Apartments near the State Fairgrounds 14 times this week. They said 11 bats have been collected, 2 of which tested positive for rabies. A bat was found near a sleeping child, so the child had to be treated immediately. An adult is also being treated.

News 5 caught up with neighbor Joseph Martinez, who has already found 3 of the bats in his apartment since he moved in. "It's pretty bad. The bats, they fly around and they somehow or another get in the building, and then they latch themselves to the wall. Then when they see something or hear something, they move," Martinez said.

Bats' teeth are so small they can bite without leaving a mark, so anyone who may have come into contact with them has to be evaluated. Pueblo County Health Department officials said anyone who sees a bat or comes in contact with one should call a doctor right away.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, and infections are almost always fatal, unless treated. - Mod.PMB
