Ten people died and dozens of others fell sick after eating a vegetable curry during a temple ceremony in India. Worshippers were served the religious offering, described as a "vegetable pulav," before falling ill at Maramma temple in Chamarajnagar, southern India. The health crisis even spread beyond humans, as 60 crows were found dead nearby after eating the leftover food.

The tragedy in the state of Karnataka has killed at least 10 people, including a 15-year-old girl, the Times of India reported. [Another source states as many as 11 have died and 82 have been hospitalized. - Mod.TG]

Police are said to be investigating foul play, with 2 people arrested amid fears poison was deliberately added to the food.

One of the worshippers told News18: "We came to temple, and they gave us tomato rice, which was smelling. Some people at the front of the queue consumed the food and fell sick; many others threw the food away and were saved. The ill were vomiting and frothing at the mouth."

The ceremony was reportedly taking place to mark the laying of a foundation stone for a new tower at the temple.

Former Indian Prime Mister H.D. Deve Gowda was among those to express his "shock" at the tragedy. He said on Twitter: "Families who have lost their lives in the disaster should have the strength and courage to endure pain."

[Several sites have noted that the food smelled of kerosene. Apparently, people began vomiting, passing out, and having difficulty breathing. Medical personnel are working to stabilize the patients, many of whom came in not breathing. In addition to kerosene, there is a strong suspicion of pesticide being put in the food.

I read multiple sites trying to find more definitive information with regard to clinical signs that could lead to a clue as what this substance or substances was. However, the articles provided little information with regard to clinical signs other than what I noted in the previous paragraph.

The situation seems to have escalated rapidly. I am unsure why someone would continue to eat food smelling of kerosene. I wonder if the perpetrators were trying to use something to disguise the smell or taste of the actual toxin(s) they laced the food with. I hope the food in question was sent to a reputable lab for analysis. Stomach contents of both ill and deceased victims may also be used for analysis.

Other pre-existing health issues may also be complicating a more precise description of the clinical signs. We would welcome additional information on the causative agent(s).

Our condolences to those who lost friends and family, and wishes for a speedy recovery to the ill. - Mod.TG
