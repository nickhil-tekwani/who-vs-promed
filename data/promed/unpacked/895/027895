2000/047 Tomato dwarf leaf curl virus a new begomovirus of tomato and sweet
pepper in Jamaica - Addition to the EPPO Alert List
Since 1992, leaf curling and severe dwarfing with or without marginal
chlorosis were observed on tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) and sweet
pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) plants in south and central Jamaica. Molecular
studies revealed the presence of a new begomovirus which was called tomato
dwarf leaf curl virus. It was found in mixed infection with tomato yellow
leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) in both sweet pepper and
tomato. Tomato dwarf leaf curl virus is most probably transmitted by
whiteflies, although this has not been demonstrated. The authors felt that
tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus is probably more important than tomato
dwarf leaf curl begomovirus, but more studies are needed on the possible
interactions of these two viruses.
Why: Tomato dwarf leaf curl virus came to our attention because it was
reported as a new virus of tomato and pepper in Jamaica.
Where: Jamaica
On which plants: Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) and pepper (_Capsicum
annuum_)
Damage: Leaf curling and severe dwarfing with or without marginal
chlorosis. Tomato dwarf leaf curl virus was always found in association
with tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus.
Transmission: Transmission by whiteflies is most probable but has not been
demonstrated nor studied.
Pathway: Tomato and pepper plants from Jamaica, vegetables?
Possible risks: Tomatoes and sweet pepper are important crops in the EPPO
region. Whiteflies are also present, but more data are needed on insect
vectors. In addition, knowledge is lacking on the real impact of the virus
on plants, as it was always found in association with tomato yellow leaf
curl begomovirus.
