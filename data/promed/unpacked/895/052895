Since the beginning of July 2007 in Volgograd oblast [region], the number
of people with West Nile fever (WNF) has increased to 54, as reported by IA
Regnum. 44 cases were registered in Volgograd city, 8 in Volgsky region,
one in Leninsk, and one in Sredneakhtubinsky region. 75 per cent of
patients are older than 50 years. Two patients with WNF died.
WNF is the virus infection; migrant birds are the reservoir of the virus.
The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Mostly, the illness is
taking its normal course without severe complications.
The increasing number of mosquitoes carrying the virus is the result of an
abnormally hot summer. Most of the patients were infected in the
countryside or in summer residences.
In order to prevent new cases of WNF, sanitization of ponds and insecticide
treatment of basements are being carried out in the region.

[Although it is autumn, the number of people with WNF is increasing. By 11
Sep 2007, the number of cases was 33; the total now is 54. As with other
infections (Crimean hemorrhagic fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome, rabies, etc), it is considered that abnormally hot weather is the
reason for this situation. Since the incubation period of WNF lasts up to 3
weeks, it is possible that some patients acquired the virus in August 2007.

Although the number of human WN virus cases has increased, notably in the
past 2 weeks, presumably, killing frosts will hit this area soon, bringing
an end to mosquito transmission of WN virus for this year.
