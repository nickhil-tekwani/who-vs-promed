GUATEMALA: Health authorities fear that the death of a child in the
southern region of the country is due to an outbreak of poliomyelitis,
according to the local press.
The 8-year-old child died on Saturday in Coatepeque some 210 kilometers
southwest of the capital and, although the Minister of Health said that the
child was treated for Guillain-Barre Syndrome [GBS(which has symptoms
similar to polio), the Ministry ordered the investigation of a possible
outbreak, according to the newspaper Siglo Veintiuno (21st Century).
Although several physicians refused to treat the case, in Coatepeque the 2
sisters of the child who died were vaccinated against polio and a sanitary
block was placed to avoid spread of polio.
Specimens were obtained from the case and were sent to the United States in
order to determine if this was a case of poliomyelitis, informed the
Ministry of Health.

[The last case of indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus in the
Americas region was detected on 5 Sep 1991 in Peru. Since then the
poliovirus isolates in the region have been vaccine viruses, with the most
recent circulation of a neurovirulent vaccine virus type 2 in Hispanola.
According to the most recent poliovirus surveillance report of PAHO Vol. 16
No. 12, 24 Mar 2001, (<http://www.paho.org/English/HVP/HVI/Spe1612.pdf>)
in the past 12 months, Guatemala has submitted 77 stool specimens from
reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, of which 70 had no viruses
isolated, 4 had non-polio enteroviruses isolated, and 1 had a vaccine
virus isolated. The reported AFP rate for the past 12 months was 1.68 per
100 000 population, suggesting a good surveillance system. The symptoms of
GBS and polio are very similar, and in the pre-eradication era in the
Americas there were frequent misdiagnoses of GBS that were ultimately shown
to be due to poliovirus infection. In the post-eradication era GBS has
been a major final diagnosis of reported AFP cases.
It is very disturbing to see the press referring to a single case report of
AFP as a presumed outbreak of polio, unless they know something more than
is presented in this newswire report. ProMED-mail would appreciate more
information on this report if and when available. - Mod.MPP
