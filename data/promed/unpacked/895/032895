Trypanosomiasis is sweeping parts of southern Sudan. Some 60,000 people live
in the epicenter of the current epidemic. A 1997 survey showed that about 20
percent of the population -- approximately 12,000 people -- had sleeping
sickness. Without treatment all will die. It used to be kept below epidemic
levels in southern Sudan by a trypanosomiasis treatment and control program
supported by the Belgian government. But its staff pulled out in 1989
because of the civil war between the Khartoum government in the north and
rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army in the south, and the number of
cases has escalated catastrophically.
"Sleeping sickness is defined as an epidemic when the prevalence of the
disease in the population is two percent or greater," explained Dr.
Micheline Richer of the U.S. charity International Medical Corps (IMC).
"This is an epidemic of really catastrophic proportions. Some villages we've
tested have had as high as 40 percent prevalence."
Untreated, the disease is always fatal. Sleeping sickness is curable but
with costly medicines.
The IMC and another charity, Care International, plans to test every person
in every village, treating those affected and bringing the epidemic under
control. The goal in Tambura county is a prevalence level of less than two
percent within two years. So far they have screened 5,000 and treated over
500 patients.
Initial screening is with the CATT blood test. CATT positive patients are
examined for parasites in their blood and lymph fluid. If they have them,
lumbar punctures are used to see if the disease has spread into the central
nervous system. Treatment is effective but the two drugs required are very
expensive.
Melarsoprol is highly toxic and used only for patients whose central nervous
system are affected. The dosage, based on a patient's weight, has to be
measured daily, requiring intensive training of staff who are being taught
from scratch. The area has lost what few medical facilities it had before
the war. It costs about $8 a vial and a full course for a patient is $80.
Pentamidine, used to treat patients at an earlier phase of sleeping
sickness, costs $20 for a full course if supplies come from the World Health
Organization. The price shoots up when it is bought on the commercial market
because the drug is used to treat complications of AIDS and demand.
With an estimated population of 4.25 million in southern Sudan, the IMC
estimates the cost of getting the disease under control in the region at $10
million over two to four years.
Rebels in control of the area have their own way of joining the battle
against the disease. "We made an order that anybody who did not come for the
screening would be put in prison for six months," said Peter Ngarasy,
representative of the rebels'relief arm in Tambura county. "This is what we
decided as a kind of
encouragement."
