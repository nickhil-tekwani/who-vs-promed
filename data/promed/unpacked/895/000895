Hendra virus outbreak confirmed in Chinchilla
---------------------------------------------
Authorities in Queensland have confirmed another case of Hendra virus
on the western downs. Test results have confirmed a horse that died in
Chinchilla on Friday [22 Jul 2011] had the virus. It is the 1st case
west of the Great Diving Range.

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says it is
unclear how many people had contact with the horse at this stage. "All
people who've had contact will have blood tests taken now, and again
in 21 days, and 42 days to just check that they haven't developed the
disease," she said. Dr Young says it is believed the vet who treated
the animal was wearing protective equipment.

"We've got staff out at the property now. They've only just arrived
but my initial understanding is that the vet who was involved with
this horse out at Chinchilla was wearing [protective clothing] but
we'll talk to the vet and just confirm that," she said.

It is believed there are 4 other horses on the property.

There have now been 8 outbreaks of Hendra virus in Queensland this
year [2011]. 9 horses in Queensland and 4 in New South Wales are
confirmed to have died from the disease over the past month.

The disease can be fatal in humans and authorities are currently
monitoring 51 people for signs of the illness.

Four of the 7 people to have ever contracted Hendra virus have died
from the disease.

[In ProMED-mail post 20110723.2220, the moderator queried as to why a
horse diagnosed a month ago was just now in the news. Yes, it just now
died, but it seemed odd to the moderator that it was only now
reported. The following is a synopsis of issues regarding how and why
that horse was just now reported. - Mod.TG]

- Loganlea, Logan City animal (7th event in Queensland in 2011): the
reason this animal has only just been reported now is because of its
unusual circumstances.

The animal had antibodies which, as is reported, is unusual. Testing
generally looks for live virus as animals do not survive long enough
to develop antibodies. It is not clear when the animal was infected as
the owner cannot recall a seroconversion illness in the horse. As the
links make clear "it could have been 2 weeks ago, it could have been a
year."

There is a human precedent for this --- at the chronologically 1st
event (identified in retrospect) a farmer, Mark Preston, assisted his
wife, a vet, with a necropsy on a horse. Subsequently he is reported
to have developed a flu-like seroconversion illness. Some 13 months
later he died and Hendra virus was found in his brain after
post-mortem.

The circumstances of Mr Preston's death are mentioned in a number of
the following articles that discuss the events at Loganlea:
http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/hendra-lays-dormant-and-can-reemerge-20110722-1hrlr.html,
http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/hendra-death-toll-hits-13-for-month/story-e6frg6nf-1226100095361,
and
http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/hendra-strikes-in-queenslands-west/story-fn6ck45n-1226100812202.

- New event at Chinchilla, Queensland (8th event in QLD in 2011):
[the last article above] mentions the new infection that was reported
today (Sun 24 July) in Chinchilla QLD [also in [1] above].
This is the furthest west an infection has been reported. All the
other events have covered the range of several species of fruit bat.
This event is unusual in that only the little red flying fox
(_Pteropus scapulatus_;
http://www.stickeebatz.com/HTML/little%20red%20flying%20fox.htm)
[which also has a great photo. - Mod.TG] is thought to be found in
this area. The health department is reported to be door-knocking in
the area to ascertain if anyone had contact with the horse in the days
before it's death.

Vaccine
-------
On the vaccine, there continue to be media reports about the efforts
to "fast-track" the vaccine's approval for use on horses
(http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/red-tape-hits-hendra-vaccine-hopes/story-e6freoof-1226100458056).

In the news story the approval body states they have not yet received
an application for a vaccine to approve so there isn't clarity about
where the delay is, or even if there is a delay, at this time.

Summary of events, locations
----------------------------
The following Queensland summary comes from today's [24 Jul 2011]
release about the event at Chinchilla
(http://www.facebook.com/notes/biosecurity-queensland/hendra-virus-case-confirmed-in-chinchilla-area/195479693838578).

Hendra in Queensland snapshot as at 24 Jul 2011:
- Locations with confirmed cases: Beaudesert, Mt Alford, Park Ridge,
Kuranda, Hervey Bay, Boondall, Logan, Chinchilla
- Horse deaths: 10
- Horses being monitored: 83 plus 4 horses at this stage at
Chinchilla.
- People being tested: 57 not including Chinchilla cases yet to be

- Locations with confirmed cases: Wollingbar, Macksville, Lismore
- Horse deaths: 4
- Horses being monitored: 4 (3 at Macksville, 1 at Lismore)

The information above has been summarized from
http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/horses/health/general/hendra-virus.

In total there have been 11 reported events since 20 Jun 2011. This
brings the number of total events ever reported to 25.

[The precedence for the antibody and delay of clinical disease with
this particular disease is very interesting. It clearly indicates the
situation has occurred with this disease prior to now.

On a more somber note, it is sad to learn there is yet another
outbreak occurring. Given the spread of this disease and the number of
animals in quarantine, it seems some clarification from vaccine
regulators would be in order. It seems there is confusion surrounding
the fast-tracking of this vaccine. We would appreciate clarification
from one of the vaccine formulators and regulatory authorities. -
