Swaziland Quarantines Abattoir as FMD Scare Spreads
---------------------------------------------------
MBABANE: Swaziland's only abattoir certified for international meat exports
was placed under quarantine after inspectors detected the highly contagious
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in a large number of slaughtered cattle.
The infected cattle were detected at the Swaziland Meat Industries (SMI)
abattoir after being imported from the specialist Kanhym cattle and pig
feedlot estate in the neighboring South African province of Mpumalanga.
Swaziland veterinary services director Dr. Robert Thwala confirmed that 10
blood and 11 tissue samples sent to Pretoria for forensic verification
tested positive.
Thwala warned all further cattle or meat imports from South Africa would be
restricted until the outbreak was brought under control. South African
veterinary authorities also swung into action, quarantining Kanhym and 3
adjoining farms 20 km east of Middelburg in Mpumalanga.
Agri-Mpumalanga president Lourie Bosman stressed strict control measures
were already in place to inoculate or, if necessary, destroy Kanhym's 10
000 cattle and 54 000 pigs.
The outbreak comes just weeks after South African authorities were forced
to slaughter thousands of animals and quarantine a 20 000 square km zone in
KwaZulu-Natal in an increasingly desperate attempt to contain the country's
first outbreak of FMD in 44 years.
No one was able to confirm whether the infected cattle were destined for
export as part of a European Union quota scheme, which grants Swazi
exporters preferential tariff protection. Swaziland Chamber of Trade and
Industry president Derick von Wissell warned that international economic
repercussions are bound to be severe even if the infection were contained
at the abattoir. "We're all very concerned. This could have a potentially
disastrous effect on our economy. The beef and associated livestock
industry is very important, with almost as many cattle in Swaziland as
people," said Dr. Von Wissell.
Swaziland currently has an EU quota of 3600 metric tons, but only managed
to export 664 metric tons in 1999 due to a shortage of suitable
high-quality beef to meet the EU's strict standards.
Bosman meanwhile confirmed that the Mpumalanga outbreak involved a
different strain of the disease from that plaguing KwaZulu-Natal, and said
initial investigations indicated the Mpumalanga infection may have been
caused by cattle imported from beyond South Africa's "red line." The red
line designates South Africa's disease-free regions and includes all stock
and other agricultural areas, with the exception of the Kruger National Park.
Bosman said the strain detected at Kanhym was not the endemic strain found
in the Kruger Park. Kanhym buys calves and other young cattle from farmers
across the region for its Middelburg feedlot, where it fattens the animals
for slaughter in Swaziland.
Inspectors at Swaziland's SMI abattoir spotted telltale sores on
slaughtered cattle's mouths and tongues and reported the first infected cattle.
Bosman said FMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by bodily contact.
"Feedlot animals are kept in very close proximity to each other in pens,
and so this kind of disease can sweep through an entire feedlot very
quickly," he said.
Mpumalanga currently accounts for 13 percent of South Africa's entire beef
and other cattle meat product industry, earning R390 million per year. The
provincial pig farming industry generates roughly R14 million per year and
contributes 3 percent to the national pork industry.
An emergency response team of State veterinarians was deployed to Kanhym,
and army commandos, regular troops and police are preparing to enforce a
"total" quarantine in the area.
Bosman stressed that Kanhym's 54 000 pigs, which are usually more
susceptible to the disease than cattle, have all tested disease-free so
far. Pointing out that Mpumalanga's cattle industry consisted of large
commercial farmers who were easier to police than the hundreds of small
communal farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, Bosman confirmed no cattle had been
destroyed yet.
"We're initially inoculating all 10 000 cattle on Kanhym and those on the
adjourning Azul and SIS farms. We'll decide whether to destroy them later,
once the vets have a clearer idea of the extent of the problem," he added.
Veterinarian team leader Dr. Paul Kloeck was not immediately available for
comment, but Kanhym spokesman Dina Groenewald confirmed that a large
contingent of vets and other specialists had been on the farm. Police
spokesman Senior Superintendent Theo du Bruyn said police were already
helping vets reach all farmers in the area and were putting emergency
contingency plans in place for roadblocks and quarantine cordons.
The South African National Defence Force's (SANDF) Group 12 operational
unit also confirmed it was preparing for rapid deployment to the area.
South Africa's agriculture minister, Thoko Didza, is expected to make a
detailed public statement about the outbreak after meeting with
veterinarians, police and army.
