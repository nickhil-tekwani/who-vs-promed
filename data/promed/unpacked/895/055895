Senegal confirmed its 1st case of EVD on [Fri 29 Aug 2014], according to a statement from Health Minister Awa Marie Coll Seck. The patient, a Guinean national who traveled to Senegal, is in quarantine. The news brings the number of countries impacted by the outbreak up to 5: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Senegal's neighbor, Guinea, have seen the bulk of the 3069 reported EVD infections in the region, according to the WHO. More than half of those infected have died. The virus also spread to Nigeria through a traveling Liberian-American man. A separate outbreak of a different strain of ebolavirus has been reported in the DR Congo.

As the outbreak worsened in West Africa, Senegal took aggressive measures to prevent the virus from spreading across its borders. Last week [week of 18 Aug 2014], the country closed its borders with neighboring Guinea out of fear that the virus might come to Senegal. That closure prevented any flights headed to Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Liberia from touching down on Senegal's soil. The World Health Organization counts 607 confirmed and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea alone and 406 deaths from the virus there.

Senegal is a major travel hub for the region, particularly its capital city of Dakar, the Associated Press noted. The news gives added weight to fears that the current outbreak is far from its peak. On [Thu 28 Aug 2014], WHO warned that the outbreak could infect more than 20 000 people before it ends.

In Liberia, where international health organizations have said the outbreak could be spiraling out of control, [visiting] US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Director Tom Frieden said "It's even worse than I'd feared. Every day this outbreak goes on, it increases the risk for another export to another country."

[This person either did not arrive by air or sea, or else escaped screening -- or possibly was not febrile on arrival, how long ago? It is not stated if he is in the capital, Dakar [population more than 1 million]. There must be a lot of contacts to follow up. This is a major disaster for the country. - Mod.JW
