The number of people sickened by a bacterium found in some shellfish has more than doubled in the past week [roughly 9-16 Aug 2013]. A state Department of Agriculture official said 32 cases of the illness are either confirmed or under investigation. Of those, 14 were linked to clams and oysters harvested from beds off Westport and Norwalk, which were shut down earlier in August 2013 due to concerns about the bacterium. "It is an outbreak, at this point," said David Carey, director of the department's Bureau of Aquaculture.

The state shut down the beds last week and issued a voluntary recall of shellfish harvested there over the last month [July to August 2013], due to high levels of the naturally occurring bacterium _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. The bacterium, which rapidly multiplies in higher temperatures -- such as the heat waves that hit the region in July 2013 -- can cause acute gastrointestinal illness.

There is a lag time between when the illness strikes and when it is confirmed, so more cases are expected to be identified in the coming weeks. Last week, just 5 cases in the state were linked to the bacterium. Of the 32 cases being looked into by the bureau -- which includes both Connecticut residents and reports from out of state -- 13 are still unconfirmed and 5 originated in harvest areas in other states.

_V. parahaemolyticus_ is generally found in uncooked fish, including crabs, shrimp and lobsters. It occurs in other kinds of fish as well, and some people have been known to become ill from it after eating sushi, said Dr Rock Ferrigno, chairman of Bridgeport Hospital's emergency department.

There have been no illnesses from this outbreak treated at Bridgeport Hospital, he said. Greenwich Hospital and Danbury Hospital also said they hadn't seen anyone with the infection. Stamford Hospital, on the other hand, has seen at least 4 cases, and at least one person was hospitalized, said Dr Michael Parry, director of infectious diseases at the hospital. Typically, Parry said, vibrio-related illness causes diarrhea and other lower intestinal problems, but doesn't usually cause vomiting. "It's not usually life-threatening, but it can make you pretty sick," he said.

[Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _E. coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aide to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). - Mod.LL
