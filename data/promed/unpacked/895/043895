Below are several published papers on epidemic dropsy in Delhi.
Aggarwal KC, Prasad MS, Salhan RN, Yadav D, Pandit N, Goyal PC, Garg
M. A two-centre collaborative study on clinico-epidemiological
profile of a recent outbreak of epidemic dropsy in New Delhi (India)
with special emphasis on its cardiac manifestations in pediatric
patients. J Trop Pediatr. 2001 Oct;47(5):291-4.
106 clinically diagnosed cases of epidemic dropsy, admitted in June
to August 1998 to the P-III unit of RML Hospital and the Department
of Pediatrics, Safdarjang Hospital, were studied. All of them
consumed mustard oil contaminated with _Argemona mexicana_, confirmed
by ferric chloride and nitric acid tests.
No specific sex predilection was seen. No child was affected below
the age of 3 years. Pedal edema and reddish hyperpigmentation were
the most consistent findings (100 percent).
Frank cardiac failure was seen in only 24 (22.64 percent), yet
persistent tachycardia was alarmingly high (104/106, i.e. 98.4
percent). Notably ECG showed prolonged Q-T interval in 24 children
(22.64 percent), unrelated to serum Ca2+ level in patients with
congestive cardiac failure (CCF).
Color Doppler echocardiography showed biventricular dilatation in all
the 24 patients with CCF. Wide pulse pressure was recorded in 2
patients only.
Mortality occurred in only 2 patients (1.89 percent). Eye involvement
was a late finding. All those who survived (i.e. 104/106) recovered
completely, except 2 patients who were left with sarcoid-like changes
of skin telangiectasia.

Epidemic dropsy--a clinical study of the Delhi outbreak. J Assoc
Physicians India. 2000 Sep;48(9):877-80.
BACKGROUND: A major outbreak of epidemic dropsy occurred in Delhi,
India, in August-September 1998, due to the consumption of
contaminated mustard oil.
METHODS: The clinical data of 212 adult patients of epidemic dropsy
who presented to our hospital is analyzed.
RESULTS: Pitting pedal edema (100 percent), skin erythema (75
percent), limb tenderness (63 percent), diarrhea (51 percent), and
hepatomegaly (34 percent) were the prominent clinical manifestations
observed in the patients.
Superficial retinal haemorrhages and retinal venous dilatation was
observed on fundus examination and 9 percent of patients developed an
open angle glaucoma over a 3-month follow-up period. Cardiac failure
was present in 14 percent of patients.
Most patients had mild disease which responded to cessation of
mustard oil consumption, bed rest, diuretics, and antioxidants. There
were 6 deaths, all of whom had intractable cardiac failure.
A unique feature of this outbreak was the documentation of acute
renal failure in 3 patients, a phenomenon never described previously.
CONCLUSIONS: Strict law enforcement to prevent the contamination of
edible oils is essential to avoid the occurrence of future similar
outbreaks.

poisoning: autopsy findings of 2 cases. Forensic Sci Int. 2001 Jan
1;115(1-2):135-41.
Epidemic dropsy, a disease due to _Argemone mexicana_ poisoning, is
characterized by pathological accumulation of diluted lymph in body
tissues and cavities. Recently, the largest epidemic of the disease
in India affected Delhi and its neighboring states during the months
of August-September 1998.
Over 3000 persons fell ill, and more than 65 died in the state of
Delhi alone. 2 cases belonging to the same family died, out of the
large number of cases admitted in this tertiary care teaching
hospital situated in eastern part of Delhi. Autopsy findings of these
2 cases are presented and discussed here along with the review of
toxicity due to this poisoning.

[Sanguinarine is an benzophenanthridine alkaloid obtained from
sanguinaria (_Sanguinaria canadensis_) and other species of the same
family, including _Argemone mexicana_ (the common name is Mexican
Poppy). The seeds of the plant when pressed and processed as oils may
concentrate the alkaloids. The seeds are most likely the most toxic
portion of this plant.
Members of _Sanguinaria_ spp have been known to be used medicinally
to treat gingivitis, halitosis, and cough. However, prolonged use or
overdose has been demonstrated to cause stomach pain, diarrhea,
visual changes, paralysis, fainting, and collapse.
The plant is unsafe for use in children and should not be used by
pregnant or lactating women. - Mod.TG]
