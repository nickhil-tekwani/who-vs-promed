A 20-year-old youth, resident of the Barrio Santa Lucia neighborhood
in Las Toscas city, contracted the virus [infection] in the
neighboring Tacuarendi locale by handling rodents. This news agency
contacted the Director of the local hospital, Dr. Roberto Saucedo, in
order to obtain more information about this case.

In the interview, that professional said that the case of the young
Las Toscas man was positive and added that he is in in critical
condition because the virus [infection] caused among other effects,
pulmonary and renal problems. Currently, the patient is interned in
Reconquista [medical facility] and is undergoing dialysis. Following
the initial tests, the physicians are going to carry out a 2nd test in
order to confirm the infection, [although] Dr. Saucedo said that the
symptoms are interpreted with total assurance as a hantavirus
[infection] case.

According to what was said in the interview, preventive work will be
undertaken in local schools by Health and Social Development Area of
the municipality. Also, he stated that this coming Monday [14 Nov
2011] a meeting will be held in the facilities of the hospital
[including] health officials of the Reconquista Node, employees of
Rural Hospital No. 4 and of Health and Social Development Area of the
Toscas municipality.

This news agency will continue providing related information so that
the community will continue on alert and acquire the necessary
resources to prevent hantavirus infections.

[Cases of hantavirus infections have been reported from various parts
of Argentina this year (2011). The specific hantaviruses involved in
these cases, including the current one, above, are not specified. As
noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several
hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina:
Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat
host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses
Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in
central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran
(in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo
(western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Without laboratory
confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which
hantavirus was involved, although Andes virus seems unlikely.
