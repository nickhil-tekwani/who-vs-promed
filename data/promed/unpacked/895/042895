Foot & mouth disease - S. Korea
--------------------------------
Given that pig herds are most likely to become infected with FMD virus by
ingestion of contaminated meat (e.g. garbage containing meat that is
contaminated with the virus), investigators would do well to concentrate
their efforts on legally or illegally imported meat when trying to track
down the route of introduction of this virus [see Pharo HJ, Foot-and-mouth
disease: an assessment of the risks facing New Zealand. NZ Vet J 50(2)
46-55, 2002].
In the past there have been various unofficial reports of vast smuggling
operations involving meat and live animals from PRC to neighboring
countries (e.g. to Taiwan by Croddy in ProMED-mail 20010501.0847), but
instead of discussing the likelihood of such high-risk routes we often hear
only speculation of spread by wind, straw, hay, sugar cane tops, human
feet, and even horses hooves. Meanwhile it is rare for the actual source of
the virus to be identified.
From a risk analyst's perspective, there is an urgent need for experiments
to be carried out to evaluate the FMD risk posed by the fomites listed above.

[We are very grateful to Dr Pharo for his challenging comment, addressing a
major problem. The Middle East-Southern Asian (ME-SA) topotype of FMDV-O
has been identified by the OIE/FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD
Disease (WRLFMD), during 2000-2001 alone, in the following central and
eastern Asian countries: Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal,
South-Korea, Taiwan-POC, Thailand, and Russia (Primorskiy territory,
bordering north-east ROC). These are the countries which notified
officially their outbreaks to FAO, OIE or the World Reference Laboratory
for FMD, and provided samples for identification and genotyping. According
to Knowles et al. ("Outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O in
the UK caused by a pandemic strain", the Veterinary Record, 3 Mar 2001, p
258), the PanAsia strain spread westwards as far as the UK and Ireland,
eastwards as far as Japan, and caused an outbreak in South Africa as well.
First isolated from an outbreak in northern India in 1990, it was recovered
in 1993-4 from samples submitted from Nepal; in 1998 from Bhutan; and in
1999 it was identified in the People's Republic of China (PRC)(Hainan
Province and Tibet). This was followed by an outbreak in Kinmen island,
Taiwan POC from where it spread, before FMD had been suspected, with
transported cattle to the main island of Taiwan. The virus has also been
isolated from samples received from other countries bordering PRC and their
neighbors, including Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and
Laos. In March 2000, the PanAsia strain spread into S. Korea and Japan.
Both countries have previously been free of FMD, S. Korea since 1934 and
Japan since 1908. These incursions had a major economical impact. The
current recurrence in S. Korea is a repeated blow to the economy of this
country.
The issue is to be discussed during the due International symposium on foot
and mouth disease, convening in Lyon, France, 2-5 June 2002, co-sponsored
by the OIE:
<http://www.fond-merieux.org/>
Its agenda covers, among other topics, the epidemiology of FMD in various
regions -- including papers on South East Asia, Taipei-China, Thailand,
Japan, North East Asia, India and the Indian subcontinent, and Russian
Transcaucasia. The situation in the PRC deserves special attention; it was
described in an insightful report in ProMED-mail posting 20010501.0847(see
ref). Hopefully, the conference will succeed in enhancing the necessary
surveillance and promote intensifying control measures there. According to
the 1997 census, PRC's farms include 335.3 million pigs, 102.1 million
sheep, 114.7 million goats, 70.2 million cattle, and 20.9 million
buffaloes! PRC reported officially to the OIE, during recent years, the
following number of FMD outbreaks: 1996 -- 0; 1997 -- 3; 1998 -- 2; 1999 --
8; 2000 -- 0; 2001 (Jan-Jul) -- 0. - Mod.AS]
