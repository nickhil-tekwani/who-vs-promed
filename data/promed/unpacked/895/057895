They had no history of travel outside of their native places. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 125 000/cumm and 110 000/cumm) was seen in both patients. The patient from Bhimdhunga-11, Kathmandu told that she saw at least 20 people having symptoms similar to her, and were seeking treatment at local health care centers.

The major outbreak of dengue virus was 1st observed in 2010 [1], while chikungunya was 1st reported in Nepal in 2013 [2].
