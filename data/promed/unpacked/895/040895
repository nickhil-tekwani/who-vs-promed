Human cases of avian influenza may be both more common and less
lethal than has been reported, Swedish and Vietnamese researchers
reported on Monday [9 Jan 2006]. A survey of Vietnamese residents
shows that people who handled or cared for sick chickens were more
likely to report some sort of flu-like illness in 2004. While the
study cannot prove these people were infected with avian influenza,
it suggests that infections may be going undetected, said Dr. Anna
Thorson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who led the study.
"The verified human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in
Viet Nam may represent only a selection of the most severely ill
patients," Thorson's team wrote in their report, published in the
Archives of Internal Medicine.
H5N1 avian influenza was first reported in people in Hong Kong in
1997, when it infected 18 people and killed 6. It re-emerged in 2003
and has infected at least 156 people and killed about half of them --
including 93 infections and 42 deaths in Viet Nam, according to the
World Health Organization. But that is only the number of cases that
have been diagnosed and confirmed. Half of all respiratory deaths are
never diagnosed in developed countries, and the numbers are even
lower in developing nations. Thorson's team decided to gather
evidence that avian flu may have been circulating undetected in Viet Nam.
They sent trained interviewers to a rural Vietnamese region with
confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza among poultry. "We
included 45 478 randomly selected inhabitants," they wrote. They
found that 8149 people, or close to 18 percent, reported having some
sort of flu-like illness and that about 25 percent of all those
surveyed lived in households reporting sick or dead poultry. "The
flu-like illness attributed to direct contact with sick or dead
poultry was estimated to be 650 to 750 cases," the researchers said.
"Our epidemiological data are consistent with transmission of mild,
highly pathogenic avian influenza to humans and suggest that
transmission could be more common than anticipated, though close
contact seems required," they concluded. "Having poultry in the
household was in itself not a risk factor for flu-like illness, but
contact with sick or dead poultry was," they added.
They said someone should follow up with blood tests to see if people
who reported flu-like illness had antibodies to H5N1, which would
indicate they had been infected with the virus at some point. If the
virus is circulating more widely among people than believed, this
could be dangerous, because it would give the virus more
opportunities to evolve into a form that more easily infects humans,
the researchers said. Even with a fatality rate of just 1 or 2
percent, this could translate into many deaths globally in case of a pandemic.

Transmission of the avian influenza H5N1 [virus] to humans may be
more common -- but often less deadly -- than previously thought,
researchers here reported. There have been 146 laboratory-confirmed
human cases of H5N1 flu reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO) as of 6 Jan 2006 with 76 deaths.
A population-based study in one of the hotbeds of the avian flu
outbreak among poultry appears to show that mild flu-like symptoms
are relatively common among people in contact with sick or dead
birds, according to Anna Thorson, M.D., Ph.D., from the Karolinska
Institute. The results of the study "are consistent with a higher
incidence of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) [infection]
among humans than has been recognized previously," Dr. Thorson and
colleagues here and in Vietnam reported in the 9 Jan 2006 issue of
the Archives of Internal Medicine. "The results suggest that the
symptoms most often are relatively mild and that close contact is
needed for transmission to humans," the researchers concluded.
This finding comes as Europe -- already on edge over the avian flu
scare -- is reeling from reports that 15 people in Turkey have been
infected with H5N1 influenza, apparently transmitted from poultry,
and that 3 children have died. The latest figures were reported by
Turkish authorities; the World Health Organization has so far
confirmed only 4 cases in Turkey, of whom 2 have died. According to
press reports, hundreds of people across Turkey have checked into
hospitals, afraid they have contracted the virus.
Viet Nam is hardest-hit by the H5N1 outbreak among poultry, Dr.
Thorson and colleagues noted: Poultry breeding is widespread and
about 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas, where
poultry is both an important source of income and a major part of
subsistence farming. Also, WHO statistics show there have been 93
confirmed human cases of avian flu in humans and 42 deaths in the
country. Dr. Thorson and colleagues analyzed data from household
interviews conducted in FilaBavi, a Vietnamese demographic
surveillance site in the Bavi district of northwest Viet Nam. The
region has seen several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza, the researchers noted.
As part of regular disease surveillance, between 1 Apr and 30 Jun
2004, trained interviewers asked 45 478 randomly selected people in
the district to answer screening questions about exposure to poultry
and flu-like illnesses (defined as a combination of cough and fever).
Most of those interviewed -- 84.4 percent (38 373) -- lived in
households keeping poultry, and 25.9 percent (11 755) lived in
households reporting sick or dead poultry. Other exposures to
poultry -- such as using bird feces as manure -- were common. A
multivariate analysis of the responses found that: Just having
poultry in the household was not associated with a significantly
increased risk of flu-like illness. The odds ratio was 1.04, with a
95 percent confidence interval from 0.96 to 1.12. Having sick or dead
poultry in the household, but without direct contact, was a
significant risk factor. The odds ratio was 1.14, with a 95 percent
confidence interval from 1.06 to 1.23. Having been in direct contact
with sick or dead poultry produced the highest risk for flu-like
illness. The odds ratio was 1.74, with a 95 percent confidence
interval from 1.58 to 1.89.
There was also a significant difference in clustering of cases in
families reporting flu-like illness: The mean number of cases per
household was 1.69 for those with sick or dead birds compared with
1.57 in households without. The result was statistically significant
at p= 0.001. The clustering could be evidence of human-to-human
transmission, the researchers said, although it could also be caused
by a common exposure to sick or dying birds.
The data are consistent with avian flu as a "relatively mild,
febrile, respiratory infection that easily can go undetected," the
researchers concluded, especially if it occurs outside the major
cities where good-quality health care is available. On the other
hand, they noted, the data "need to be confirmed with
population-based seroprevalence studies and with virology studies in
patients with acute mild infection. In the absence of serological
data, we cannot state the cause of disease," they wrote. "The
observed results could have resulted from other diseases affecting
poultry and humans."

of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. Arch Intern Med. 2006;166: 119-123.
In the absence of supporting serological data, it is premature to
conclude that all or any of the symptomatic flu-like illnesses
recorded are associated with H5N1 avian influenza virus. There are a
diverse range of human respiratory viruses that could account for
these findings.
