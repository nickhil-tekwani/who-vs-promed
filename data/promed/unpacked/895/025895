EPIZOOTIC HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE, CERVIDS - USA (INDIANA)

The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study has recently
confirmed that samples submitted from 2 dead Indiana white-tailed
deer tested positive for epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). The EHD
virus was detected by PCR testing. Starting in late August 2006, a
steady stream of reports came in from the public indicating that they
were finding dead deer, most of which were either near or in water.
Other clinical signs also pointed to EHD.
Concerned landowners and hunters reported a total of 300-400 dead
deer to several DNR offices. Biologists believe the actual loss was
several times that many because, undoubtedly, many dead deer went
undetected. A total of 15 west-central and southern Indiana counties
reported deer losses. The highest loss was in an area about 30-50
miles west of Indianapolis in Clay, Parke, Putnam and Vermillion
Counties. A few cases are suspected east of Indianapolis in Henry
County, but are unconfirmed. Posey County in the far southwest part
of the state as well as Ohio County in the southeast corner reported
losses. There have been no known incidents of livestock being affected.
Indiana has had outbreaks of EHD in 1985, 1987, 1996 and 2004, all in
west-central and south-central Indiana. This vector-borne viral
disease typically develops in dry falls, but wet weather was the norm
this year [2006] through the summer and fall in central Indiana. The
vectors for the virus are biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_. As
the weather cooled, reports tailed off, and reports of deer deaths
now have ended, since we've had several hard frosts.
