Local media reports that a couple in Tunel in Mongolia's Khovsgol
Province were determined to have contracted anthrax on 20 Sep 2007,
and the county was closed off. The infected couple underwent
treatment at the province's infectious disease hospital. The
husband's condition improved, but the wife's illness worsened and she
died on the 26 Sep 2007.
No further cases have been found.

[Anthrax is widespread and enzootic in Mongolia. In 2004, outbreaks
were officially reported in the following 12 provinces: Khenti,
Hovsgol, Bulgan, Selenge, Uws, Gobi-Altai, Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan-Uul,
Ovorkhangai, Arkhangai, Drakhan-Uul, and Zavkhan. Allowing for
spelling variation during transliteration, anthrax is of some
standing in Khovsgol/Hovsgol. Clarification of the situation has been
requested of senior veterinary officers in Ulaan Baatar.
