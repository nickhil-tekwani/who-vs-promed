There is growing fear of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
in a herd of gazelles in the north of the country, following the
discovery of 10 dead gazelles in the area between Yisachar plateau
and the Tavor creek. The disease has been recorded in several cattle
herds in the north during recent months, and it now seems that
gazelles have been infected as well.
Some [carcasses] have been sent to the laboratory, but even before
results have been obtained, the diagnosis seems very likely. The
director of Israel's Nature and National Parks Protection Authority
in northern Israel, Dror Pevzner, said, "the affected animals cannot
move nor eat; dead gazelles are found mainly close to water sources.
The gazelle population on the Golan and Yissachar plateau were hit by
FMD 22 years ago, but at that time their populations were much larger
than now: on the Golan there were about 5000 individuals compared to
only 229 now, and in the Yissachar plateau there were about 3500
individuals compared to 1113 these days".

Authorities fear a possible outbreak of FMD in the [Lower] Galilee,
after 10 gazelle carcasses were found near the Tavor River. Dror
Pevzner, head of the Israel Nature and National Parks Protection
Authority northern district, said the gazelles' symptoms matched
those of the disease. The last outbreak among wild gazelles occurred in 1985.

[The following description of the 1985 outbreak in gazelles (a
protected species) in the same vicinity is extracted and abridged
from reference 1:
"The disease was first observed on 10 Apr 1985. The outbreak in the
densely populated herd of mountain gazelles reached extensive
proportions with many lame or immobile animals, as well as
fatalities, being reported. Sick and dead animals were concentrated
in and around water sources and under vegetation. When sick animals
were approached they showed little resistance to examination.
Their temperatures were found to be as high as 41 deg C (105.8 deg
F). Some animals showed locomotory disturbances, probably resulting
from muscular lesions; no diarrhoea was seen.
The disease affected all age groups irrespective of sex. Disease
distribution was similar to the age and sex structure of the
population. Surprisingly, no fawns were observed, although many had
been seen during previous visits. It was assumed that suckling fawns,
normally visited at least twice daily by their dams in their hiding
places under the vegetation, had died of either disease or starvation
after the commencement of the epizootic.
Typical, severe oral lesions were observed in all animals examined
and consisted of necrotic lesions on the dorsum of the tongue in some
cases, and the lips and gums in others. The ventral side of the
tongue was not affected. Foot lesions characterised by interdigital
elongated erupted vesicles, were seen in many cases. Vesicular
coronal lesions were found on the lateral and posterior parts of the
hooves of some gazelles. Separation of the hooves was frequent and
some animals lost their horns, leaving bleeding cores.
Macroscopic muscular lesions were clearly seen in the heart of most
animals examined, as well as in the diaphragmal, lingual and other
skeletal muscles. In some cases, slight but distinct lesions were
seen on omasal folds. Other changes included pneumonia and
splenomegaly. Most animals examined were in excellent nutritional
condition indicating that the course of the disease was peracute.
Some animals, although adjacent to water, manifested severe
dehydration. This was probably because of an inability to drink
caused by lingual muscular changes. FMDV type 0 was also isolated
from buccal and podal lesions, as well as from a sample of affected
heart muscle. The isolated FMDV was later designated by the World
Reference Laboratory at Pirbright, UK as FMDV -O ISR 1/85.
The outbreak subsided towards the beginning of May 1985. It is
estimated that at least 1500 animals of all age groups died,
representing a mortality rate of at least 50 percent. The case
mortality rate was probably even higher.
It was concluded that this unusually malignant form of FMD was a
result of the virulence of the particular virus strain combined with
an extremely susceptible host, present in a very high population
density. The gazelle population on the Ramot Yissakhar nature reserve
had increased considerably in size since the 50s, having previously
been on the verge of extinction. This population growth was achieved
by intensive inbreeding since this species is rather sedentary and no
external genetic material had been introduced. Consequently, the
population involved might have had a genetically linked
hypersusceptibility to the disease".
