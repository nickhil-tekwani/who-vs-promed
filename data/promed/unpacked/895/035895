Investigators struggling to find anthrax clues
----------------------------------------------------
(CNN) -- One month after the first anthrax case materialized in Florida,
health and law officials are struggling to discover who mailed the lethal
bacteria and determine how 2 seemingly unlikely individuals contracted the
disease. The anthrax-related death Wednesday of a New York woman with no
apparent connection to known bacterial contamination is under particular
scrutiny. A second woman, who lives in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, has
cutaneous anthrax, and health officials are uncertain of the origin of the
bacteria that infected her.
Preliminary tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found
no difference between the anthrax that killed a 61-year-old New York woman
and samples from others with the disease. "We haven't identified anything
about this strain that's different from strains in the other areas," said
Dr. Julie Gerberding with the CDC, adding that more analysis is needed.
Latest developments:
- Preliminary tests on 4 mailrooms used by the Food and Drug Administration
have come back positive for anthrax, an agency spokeswoman said Thursday,
adding that more tests are under way to confirm the contamination. Those
sites in Rockville, Maryland, did not get mail directly from the tainted
Brentwood processing center in Washington, the spokeswoman said, but
received mail primarily from a Postal Service "hub" in Shady Grove, Maryland.
- So far 6 bar code sorting machines and a freestanding dust extractor have
tested positive for anthrax at Manhattan's largest postal facility, the
Postal Service said Thursday. The facility will remain open while machines
are being decontaminated, officials said.
- Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon said Wednesday postal equipment sent to a
company in his state to be repaired tested positive for a small amount of
anthrax spores. He said he was concerned the U.S. Postal Service did not
quickly notify Indiana officials about the equipment's exposure to anthrax.
It was not immediately clear where the contaminated machinery originated.
- In Kansas City, Missouri, officials hoped to have conclusive results
Thursday from preliminary tests that showed the presence of anthrax at a
U.S. Postal Service's Stamp Fulfillment Services Facility. The traces of
the bacteria were found on garbage bags that had been put around trays of
mail received from Washington's Brentwood postal facility -- where 2 postal
employees contracted inhalation anthrax and later died.

Update: Investigation of Bioterrorism-Related Anthrax and Interim
Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Persons with Possible Anthrax Since 3
Oct 2001, CDC and state and local public health authorities have been
investigating cases of bioterrorism-related anthrax. This report updates
findings as of 31 Oct, and includes interim guidelines for the clinical
evaluation of persons with possible anthrax. A total of 21 cases (16
confirmed and 5 suspected) of bioterrorism-related anthrax have been
reported among persons who worked in the District of Columbia, Florida, New
Jersey, and New York City.
Until the source of these intentional exposures is eliminated, clinicians
and laboratorians should be alert for clinical evidence of _Bacillus
anthracis_ infection. Epidemiologic investigation of these cases and
surveillance to detect new cases of bioterrorism-associated anthrax continues.

Hopefully the lack of new findings indicates a near end to new infections.
