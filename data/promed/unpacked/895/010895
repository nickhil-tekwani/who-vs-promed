H1N1 detected in live pigs imported into Singapore
--------------------------------------------------
The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has detected the pandemic
A (H1N1) virus in some pigs imported into Singapore from Indonesia's
Pulau Bulan.

But the AVA stressed that the pork available [in Singapore] is safe
for consumption, as the H1N1 virus is not transmitted through the
handling and consumption of pork and pork products including ham,
bacon, sausages, and canned pork.

AVA added it will step up its monitoring and inspection to ensure food
safety, like increasing the number of daily pork samples taken for
tests from 30 to 100.

It will also take part in a comprehensive disease surveillance
programme on the Pulau Bulan farm, led by the Indonesian authorities.
The aim is to identify and isolate affected pig houses.

Dr Chew Siang Thai, AVA's director-general for services, said: "AVA is
now working closely with the Indonesian authorities and the farm
management to ensure that clinically healthy pigs are exported to
Singapore. "And these pigs, when they are in the abattoir, are also
subjected to a series of inspections that ensure that safe pork get
released into the market."

Restricted animal movement will also be imposed to ensure only healthy
pigs are exported to Singapore. The AVA said this is in line with the
World Organization for Animal Health's recommendation.

Meanwhile, steps have also been taken to make sure that everyone is
safe. Dr Chew said: "The workers have already been putting on
protective gear, masks, and have been practising good hygiene
procedures to avoid getting any potential infection."

Suppliers have been informed of the steps being taken so that they too
can play their part by enhancing measures and ensuring everybody
complies with the requirements.

AVA said that Singapore has adequate sources of pork supplies from 25
countries. Singapore's import of 1000 pigs daily from Pulau Bulan
constitutes some 20 per cent of the total pork consumed there.

[According to Singapore's data on its animal population, as available
on OIE's website, no pigs are raised in Singapore. It is thus clear
that all imported live animals are intended for slaughter, probably
immediately after arrival. Consequently, abattoir personnel may be
exposed to potential infection of the slaughtered pigs. Justifiably,
the workers have been instructed to apply hygienic, protective measures.

Singapore is the 4th country detecting and reporting pandemic
influenza H1N1 virus in porcines, preceded by Canada, Argentina, and
Australia. The virus infected another animal species, turkeys, in
Chile. Similar but unidentified or unreported events involving the
same or additional species, may have occurred in other countries and
should be surveyed and recorded. In fact, according to a report of 3
Sep 2009, ongoing surveillance for respiratory diseases in Manitoba
swine herds, Canada, has detected the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza
virus in several herds, including sow barns, nursery barns, and feeder
barns in various locations in the province (see
<http://www.pigprogress.net/news/h1n1-found-in-several-manitoba-herds-3364.html>).
