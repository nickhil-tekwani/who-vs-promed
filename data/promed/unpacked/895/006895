Paktika is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southeastern part of the country. It has a population of about 413 800 mostly ethnic Pashtuns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paktika_Province)

As per the report above, the onset of flu-like symptoms with increased coughing, nose bleeds, fever, and diarrhea have been described.

The short duration of symptoms and rapid progression suggest possible differential diagnoses of acute viral infection or exposure to a poisonous or toxic agent. Any pertinent details of the epidemiological investigation, including total number of cases, exposure history, demographics, etc., and results of laboratory tests would be appreciated. - Mod.UBA]
