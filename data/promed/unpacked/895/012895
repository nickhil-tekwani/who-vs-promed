Alberta Heath Services is reminding Albertans to keep clean, as an
outbreak of viral meningitis has spread across the province. Symptoms
start out much like a summer cold with dry coughs or fevers, but
since April 2010, 90 of those colds turned into reported cases of
viral meningitis in Alberta, with half of those cases originating in
Edmonton, says Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer with Alberta
Health Services. "Over the past few months we've been seeing quite a
bit of viral meningitis," Predy told reporters on Tuesday [17 Aug
2010]. "It is more than what we usually see. With kids going back to
school, we thought we should issue this advisory."

The cases reported concern people between the ages of 10 and 30, and
for people who do recreational activities in large groups. "A lot of
the cases have been related to sports tournaments, recreational
activities," he said. "If you are sick or your children are sick,
don't send them to sports camp; don't send them to school; keep them
at home until they are better." Albertans are encouraged to avoid
sharing water bottles or soft drinks, to wash hands thoroughly, and
to clean surfaces of gym equipment and common household surfaces.

The majority of viral meningitis cases don't cause death. The cases
have been known to spring up in the region every couple of years
during the summer. Predy reminds Albertans this incident is not as
serious as the string of bacterial meningitis cases in 2000, where
some cases led to death. Of the 90 recent viral meningitis cases in
Alberta, no one has died from the disease. But those who do get
meningitis should get checked to "rule out other, more serious forms
of meningitis," Predy said.

Viral meningitis can cause fever, dry cough, headaches, body aches,
weakness, tiredness and rash and can usually last 7 to 10 days.

[Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes ("meninges") that
cover the brain and spinal cord. Viral infections are the most common
cause of meningitis. Viral ("aseptic") meningitis is serious but
rarely fatal in people with normal immune systems. Usually, the
symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.

Different viral infections can lead to viral meningitis. But most
cases, particularly during the summer and autumn months, are caused
by enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses, and
echoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either
have no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with
low-grade fever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus
infections develop meningitis.

Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most
often spread through direct contact with an infected person's faeces.
The virus is spread through this route mainly among small children
who are not yet toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to
adults changing the diapers of an infected infant.

Enteroviruses and other viruses (such as mumps and varicella-zoster
virus) can also be spread through direct or indirect contact with
respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an
infected person. The viruses can also stay on surfaces for days and
can be transferred from objects. Viruses also can spread directly
when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets containing the
virus into the air we breathe. The time from when a person is
infected until they develop symptoms (incubation period) is usually
between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An infected person is usually
contagious from the time they develop symptoms until the symptoms go
away. Young children and people with low immune systems may spread
the infection even after symptoms have resolved. Detailed information
on viral and bacterial meningitis can be obtained from the CDC
web-site at: <http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/faq.html>.
