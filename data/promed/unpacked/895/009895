A total of 3 Argentinean provinces -- Buenos Aires, Cordoba and La
Pampa -- have reported 20 outbreaks of bovine anthrax. During this
year [2008], 6 human cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported at the
national level: 4 cases in the Province of Buenos Aires and 2 in the
Province of Entre Rios.

In the Assessment Area of the Province of Buenos Aires, the average
annual percent distribution of positive samples submitted for the
period 1977-2008 was 12 percent 411/3336.; during 1977-1981 it was 18
percent positive sample and by 2002-2006 it had reached 11 percent.
In the year 2008, this percentage fell to only 4 percent, or 7/153,
similar to that obtained in 2007. There has been no major change in
vaccination cover or policy. Outbreaks were diagnosed in Olavarria,
Bolivar, Navarro, Gonzalez, Chavez, Mar Chiquita, General Villegas,
and with a distant case in the north-east corner of the province,
Villa Maria, close to Cordoba.

The Seasonal Percent Distribution also showed a declining tendency,
with 7 percent in summer and 2 percent in autumn, and with similar
values for the winter and spring. Usually twice as many summer
samples are positive compared to the other seasons. This probably
reflects a recent change of climate: there was a drought with only
667mm [26.25 inches] of rain during the year, the lowest in the last
47 years, and high mean temperatures of 2C [35.6 DEGF]; the usual
annual regional rainfall is 973mm [38.3 inches]. This will continue
to be studied under the framework of the Program: Projections of
Future Scenarios of Climatic Change.

In the Alert and Response Zone in the county of Azul there were no
cases of bovine or human anthrax reported in 2008. This area carries
some 549 927 head of cattle; in the period 1988-2007 there were 67
outbreaks of anthrax. In 2008, 536 herds or 132 610 head were
vaccinated with Sterne. The Province of Buenos Aires, over the
1977-2008 period has reported 258 outbreaks of bovine anthrax in 51
counties. The other 4 Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories in the
Province of Buenos Aires and in La Pampa processed 154 samples, in 22
of which (14 percent) B. anthracis was isolated: in the province of
Buenos Aires these cases were in Chasico -- Villarino, Rauch, and
Tres Arroyos; in La Pampa cases were in Guatrache, Loventue, General
Roca, Conhelo, Utracan, Rancul, and Capital.

The annual production of the anti-anthrax vaccine throughout the
country was: 18 630 250 doses from 7 production plants. Sensitivity
and resistance to the most frequently used antibiotics were evaluated
in the 7 strains isolated from B. anthracis in the Assessment Area:
100 percent of the strains were sensitive to Penicillin,
Tetracycline, Florphenicol, Gentamicin, and Ciprofloxacine. Only
Trimetoprim-Sulfatometoxazol showed a resistance of 86 percent. It is
necessary to continue promoting adequate sanitary measures for
effective control of this zoonosis: vaccination of susceptible
animals, efficient carcass disposal, and protection of the personnel
involved for the welfare of the national Public Health.
