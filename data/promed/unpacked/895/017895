As part of epidemiological surveillance establishment [activities] in
Reunion, new cases of chikungunya been highlighted in Saint Paul, in
the Plateau-Caillou area, Saint-Gilles-les-Bains and La Plaine in
St. Paul, according to the Regional Health Agency. The
epidemiological assessment stands at 19 confirmed cases and 4 probable cases

Chikungunya and dengue [viruses] are transmitted by the same
mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_. To prevent the spread of chikungunya
and dengue, health authorities have taken the following measures:
increase vector control actions in the affected areas and
mobilization of private doctors and hospitals for early reporting of
suspected cases. The prevention measures: eliminate stagnant water in
the environment (empty saucers, check the flow of the gutters, comply
with the days of trash[collection], empty small containers ...) and
protect themselves against mosquito bites (repellents, [wear]
covering clothing ...).
