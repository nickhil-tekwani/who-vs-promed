The Pennsylvania Department of Health is investigating 5 cases of _E.
coli_ O157 reported in 4 counties that are believed to be linked to
eating rare or medium-rare steak at different Hoss's Steak and Sea
House restaurants. Four of the 5 cases were hospitalized; none
developed kidney failure.
"The Department of Health is working very closely with the
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and the United States
Department of Agriculture to provide any information that can help in
identifying the source of the _E. coli_ cases," state Health
Secretary Dr. Calvin B. Johnson said. "We will continue to work with
our partners to identify cases in Pennsylvania and, we hope, prevent
any additional illnesses."
The ill persons ate at 4 different Hoss's restaurants between 24-29
Mar 2007, in Centre, Dauphin, Venango and York counties. The
restaurant exposures are the only common link among the individuals
and suggest that the source of the infections is an item consumed at
the restaurants. All confirmed cases ate different cuts of steak;
several reported the item was requested and consumed rare or
medium-rare.
Because the number of cases is small and the exposure period was
several weeks ago, the health department believes the risk to Hoss's
customers is low. However, customers who may have taken home leftover
steak should discard it. The USDA has issued a recall of steak
products from H-F-X Inc., which is Hoss's processing and distribution
center in South Claysburg, Pennsylvania. The company is fully
cooperating with federal and state authorities in the recall and
illness investigation.

[It is remarkable that the suspected vehicle in this outbreak/recall
is steak and not ground beef or another vehicle.
As noted in a past posting (E. coli O157, frozen steaks - USA
(Midwest): recall 20030701.1617), the bacteria associated with the
steak are usually external, meaning that the pathogen would be killed
by heat, which might not inactivate internal bacteria. In that
posting, the meat had been injected with tenderizers so that the _E.
coli_ could be inoculated internally. This technique to fool Mother
Nature once again may produce more collective harm than individual
good. If it remains that steak was the vehicle, how the meat remained
contaminated after even cooked rare needs to be established.
