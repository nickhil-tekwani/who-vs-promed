[2] Guinea: Ebola contacts
Date: Thu 28 May 2015
Source: Guineenews [in French, trans.JW, edited]
http://guineenews.org/ebola-233-contacts-dans-la-ville-miniere-kamsar-selon-le-coordonateur-local-de-lutte-contre-ebola


For nearly a month, the industrial [mining] city of Kamsar has become the new home of the Ebola hemorrhagic disease, and this has caused a divergence of views on the existence of the disease and the cause of the deaths recorded during the crisis period. To shine light on this situation, your information site guineenews.org extended its microphone to Dr. Facinet Yattara, prefectural coordinator of the fight against Ebola in Boke.

Guineenews: What is the state of play in Kamsar with this new outbreak of Ebola virus?

Dr Yattara: Yes, Kamsar is the new home [of Ebola], and, unfortunately, that opened there less than a month ago. It all started with a death of a person on 30 Apr 2015, and this person was buried in the neighborhood of Filima, but it turns out that the person had died of Ebola, but people did not know that. One week later, we started seeing sickness in the wake of the burial, and today [28 May 2015], there are 7 people who have been infected by this patient, and among these, 3 have died...

Guineenews: What are the means available to eradicate Ebola in Kamsar?

Dr Yattara: the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a number of provisions including an air-conditioned tent, an air-conditioned container equipped with offices of the prefectural coordinator and the WHO team coordinator; also, it has provided a generator of 22 KVA to feed the Kassapo health center (district Kamsar) and facilities. Finally, there is also a mobile laboratory that the state has negotiated for Kamsar with Canada and has been operational since yesterday [27 May 2015]. These resources allow us whenever we suspect a patient to perform collection, analysis, and, when it is positive, send the patient directly to a care center.

Guineenews: What are the statistics to date?

Dr Yattara: We have 8 cases including 7 confirmed positive, of which 2 were cured; the 8th is probable because the person has not yet been tested, and we have 233 contacts without counting the contacts of the new cases detected today [28 May 2015].

Guineenews: Do you deal with cases of concealment?

Dr Yattara: Yes, unfortunately there are cases of concealment. Whatever may be said with all the awareness campaigns, people do not understand the gravity of the situation when a person is sick with Ebola; the best thing to do for him and for the community is to take him out of the community and send him to a suitable Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC), and for Boke, they are Coyah and Conakry.

Guineenews: Has the sub-prefecture of Kamsar had at its side international aid?

Dr Yattara: From the start of the epidemic in Kamsar, there has been a very strong mobilization of the national community, supported by the international community; it allowed us to mobilize a large set of human and logistical resources. In terms of human resources, we have a community of consultants and epidemiological staff from the World Health Organization (WHO) who came to strengthen management of the Ebola virus in Kamsar.

Guineenews: Tell us about the presence of Ebola virus in Kamsar.

Dr Yattara: This is what happened: There was a taxi driver who transported a patient on the night of 17-18 Apr 2015, a patient who hid from control so was not monitored in Conakry, and this often happens. He fell ill without going to the formal structures and spent 2-3 days in a private clinic, but as he did not improve, he negotiated with the said taxi driver to take him to a traditional healer at Tifinda in Tougnifily (Boffa), but he died the next day. A secure funeral was held, and the results of sampling were positive on 20 Apr 2015. So, the virus was carried by the driver, who got sick on 23 Apr 2015 and who presented to the hospital on 28 Apr 2015, almost towards the end of his illness. The sooner the patient is received in a processing structure, the better the chance of cure.

Following the death of that person from Ebola that we did not know about, he was buried in the village, and all the people who tested positive were contaminated by this gentleman either during his illness or during his funeral or while he was in the hospital of the National Agency for the Development of Mining Infrastructures (ANAIM), because there was an Ebola patient there for the same period ... for 2 days...

Doctor Yattara: Two sick people sent to Ebola treatment centers were healed. The [measures] taken seem to me to be appropriate, with control and hand washing at the gate and at the back of the institutions of the sub-prefecture. If we can limit the movement of suspicious persons, if we manage to stop the transfer of corpses from one place to another, if we manage to secure all burials with the efforts of the Red Cross, we will have hope that the virus will not spread. We have a population that is willing to support us, because today the existence of the virus is in the mind of everyone.

[3] Suspected, research, vaccines, funding

28 May 2015 Guinea and Guinea-Bissau: Red Cross, WHO send medical teams to Guinea-Bissau, Guinea after possible cross-border Ebola contamination
http://www.ibtimes.com/red-cross-who-send-medical-teams-guinea-bissau-guinea-after-possible-cross-border-1941889
[A recent Ebola virus case in Guinea has health workers rushing to the border of neighboring Guinea-Bissau, hoping to suppress a possible outbreak there. According to the World Health Organization, investigations are ongoing to trace a contact who attended the funeral of a deceased person in Boke, and who is thought to have returned to a fishing community in Guinea-Bissau. Because of the proximity of the recent cluster of cases to Guinea-Bissau, a response team from Guinea-Bissau has been sent to the border to assess points of entry. In addition, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and the WHO have both sent medical experts to Guinea-Bissau to prepare for a possible outbreak in the small West African country, which could occur after a possibly-infected person crossed over from neighboring Guinea.

The borders are very porous, making it extremely difficult to maintain control of spread of Ebola until all 3 West African countries are Ebola-free. - Mod.LK]

30 May 2015 Guinea: Ebola Health-Care Workers Attacked in Guinea as Death Toll Rises
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-30/ebola-health-care-workers-attacked-in-guinea-as-death-toll-rises
[A mob attacked health-care workers looking for someone suspected of having Ebola in the city of Kamsar, as the death toll from the disease in the West African country increased. Violence against HCWs is very disturbing, especially now that the communities have had enough experience to be well aware of the help the workers are offering the villagers. - Mod.LK]

31 May 2015 USA (Kansas): Patient has malaria, not Ebola, University of Kansas Hospital officials say
http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article22717137.html
[A man in his 30s, recently returned to the Kansas City area from Sierra Leone on 28 May 2015, was admitted to the University of Kansas Hospital, through the Emergency Department on 29 May 2015 after developing mild fever and headache. The patient was deemed to be at "very low health risk" for Ebola virus infection. A strict protocol of isolation and care was carried out, and CDC guidelines were followed while awaiting the results of testing. Test results were negative for Ebola, but positive for malaria.]

29 May 2015 USA (New Jersey): Lassa fever death reveals holes in Ebola monitoring system
http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/29/410315875/new-jersey-lassa-fever-death-reveals-holes-in-ebola-monitoring-system
[New Jersey officials are now monitoring anyone who had close contact with the Lassa victim, including health care workers, for possible signs of Lassa fever. Lassa fever has never been spread from person-to-person in the United States, and there have only been 6 documented cases in the last 40 years. - Mod.LK]

[Since October [2014], more than 17 000 people across the U.S. have been monitored for Ebola after returning from West Africa. None of them came down with it. That's an average of 80 people a day arriving from the 3 West African countries! - Mod.JW]

27 May 2014 USA (New York): Yonkers: Ebola threat cleared at St. Joseph's hospital
http://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2015/05/27/ebola-suspected-yonkers-hospital-patient/28029935/
[According to Dean Civitello, spokesperson for the hospital, "There's no suspected case of Ebola, and the Department of Health is not monitoring a case for Ebola." The patient, who was admitted to the hospital with fever-like symptoms and was quickly isolated, traveled from a country on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's watch list. Testing was done for the Ebola virus.]

29 May 2015 USA ex Sierra Leone: University of Kansas Hospital treating patient who is considered "very low risk" for Ebola
http://www.kshb.com/news/health/university-of-kansas-hospital-talks-about-patient-with-very-low-risk-for-ebola

A strict protocol of isolation and care is being carried out, and CDC guidelines are being followed. The patient has no history of contact with anyone infected with the Ebola virus and no contact with health-care workers. Testing has been done, and results are expected in 1-2 days.]

http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/05/20/university-of-hawaii-and-hawaii-biotech-forwarding.html
[The project, in collaboration with mainland laboratories, has completed efficacy trials in mice, guinea pigs, and monkeys. Once funding is secure, human clinical trials could begin within 12-18 months. The vaccine (researched and developed in Hawaii) could ultimately protect against 3 viruses and is non-replicating. According to Axel Lehrer, assistant professor at the UH Department of Tropical Medicine: "We consider this a 2nd-generation vaccine, and we want to cover all the required viruses, which would include Ebola, Sudan and Marburg viruses."

Under the terms of the feasibility agreement, Soligenix will evaluate its proprietary vaccine thermo-stabilization technology, ThermoVax, licensed from the University of Colorado, to stabilize components of the vaccine.]
