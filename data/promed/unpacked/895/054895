The following information includes data on African swine fever (ASF) in South Korea, selectively extracted from the above, most recent weekly FAO update.

Situation update -- South Korea:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak on [17 Sep 2019], ASF was detected in domestic pigs in 14 farms [Gyeonggi-do (9), Incheon City (5)] and in 30 wild pigs from Gyeonggi-do (17) and Gangwon-do (13) [but see comment below]. As of [15 Nov 2019], nearly 450 000 pigs have died/been culled.

ASF virus gene (genotype II) was also detected at Incheon Airport in products brought in by passengers from China (Shenyang and Harbin cities, pork sausages) and Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi cities, pork sausages and pork jerky).

[Since the dissemination of the above FAO weekly report, 2 additional cases of ASF in wild boar on South Korea's northern border have been reported by South Korea to the OIE, bringing the total to 32 wild boar. OIE's WAHIS summary, as of 29 Nov 2019, with links to all 24 reports submitted so far and an interactive map presenting all ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs and wild boar (click on the cluster to center, zoom in to the desired resolution), is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778.

Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks = 46 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 27 001 / 44 / 16 / 26 983 / 0
Wild boar / Not available / 32 / 31 / 1 / 0

The continuing ASF spread in wild boar along the inter-Korean border underlines the suggestion that North Korea was/is the likely source of ASF in South Korea. North Korea has not submitted a follow-up report since its immediate notification of ASF on 30 May 2019 (20190530.6494781).

A new outbreak of ASF affecting wild boars has been reported recently from Russia's far eastern province Yevreyskaya oblast, bordering China's north eastern province Heilongjiang (follow-up report no. 14, dated 28 Nov 2019). Russia has reported, during 2019, numerous cases of ASF in wild boar in 3 clusters along its borders with Heilongjiang. To view these clusters, as well as the inter-Korean outbreaks in wild boar and the (strikingly few) reported cases in China's wild boar since the start of its huge epizootic (September 2018), please refer to OIE's global ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/yxwdzovv (click on the chosen region/cluster, zoom in).

Information from China on the ASF situation in wild boar is rather scarce. The species is widely distributed throughout the country, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and the region bordering Mongolia. A relatively high density, estimated at a mean of 2.24 head/sq. km (5.8 head/sq. mi) is reported from some forests in northeastern China, and even higher in the south eastern coastal areas. - Mod.AS
