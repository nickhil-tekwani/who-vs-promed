Homeless people and drug users are apparently experiencing the brunt of Kentucky's uptick in hepatitis A virus cases. The Kentucky Department of Public Health (KDPH) has charted the increase since 1 Jan 2017, with 103 confirmed cases, which have included 78 hospitalizations. The 7 most recent illnesses came in during the count for the week of [11-17 Feb 2018], according to an update posted [Tue 20 Feb 2018].

The uptick in cases involving homeless people and drug users occurred since 1 Aug 2017, according to KDPH. Viral sequencing has linked Kentucky's cluster with hepatitis A outbreaks in California, Utah, Michigan and other states. KDPH says it is "working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate," KDPH added. "Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease."

Kentucky declared the acute outbreak of hepatitis A in November 2017. Most of the cases are in Louisville with nearly 90 cases in a city that usually sees only one to 4 cases in a typical year.

The health department has vaccinated more than 4300 people in Louisville. Hotel Louisville offered free vaccinations to its residents on [Tue 20 Feb 2018]. Health officials urge Louisville residents to get vaccinated and practice good hygiene as the best defenses against the spread of hepatitis A.

[The Utah and California outbreaks are linked genetically but the Michigan is different. Does the post suggest that some of the cases are linked to Michigan and others to California? - Mod.LL]

Since 1 Jan 2017, Utah public health has identified 198 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

[It is interesting that so far in Utah there have been no fatalities whereas the large outbreaks in southern California and southeastern Michigan reported case fatality rates of 3-4 percent. The hospitalization rate in Utah while high is also substantially below the 70-80 percent rate in those other outbreaks.

Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.6 percent of the total males are MSM, 2.9 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.4 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total cases continue to increase and have altogether in numbers and in fatalities surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.
