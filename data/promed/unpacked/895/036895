Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 307 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Equidae / 28 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: movement of the causal agent from another nearby outbreak.

Epidemiological comments: Since [22 Jul 2022], measures including release of sterile insects in the field have been implemented in 2 points, 9.5 liters of insects (approximately), weekly; this measure will be maintained for a period equal to 3 biological cycles of the agent from the last case detected [16 Aug 2022]. Aerial release of sterile insects, by means of 2 weekly flights, at a dose of 3000 flies per linear nautical mile [1.85 km]. Specific epidemiological surveillance was carried out in all farms within a 5 km radius around Pigand√≠ Grande case, without any other finding. Routine surveillance, health education campaigns (for local people, producers, technicians, among others) and release measures will be maintained for a period of three 3 biological cycles (9 weeks).

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures: surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; treatment; movement control; disinfestation

["Current Situation of Screwworm in Panama:

"Currently, the screwworm (NWS) remains limited to the presentation of cases in a fluctuating way in the so-called Biological Protection Barrier within the province of Darien, with some very sporadic detections in the province of Panama. In the last 5 years there were 242 cases of NWS, the highest number was in 2019 with 81 and the lowest of 8 cases in 2018. Only in 2021 positive samples were identified in the province of Panama within the perimeter of 8 kilometers of the limits with the province of Darien.

"The effective control and eradication measure are the release of the sterile insect, complemented by the other actions of surveillance on the farm, control of the mobilization of animals and the installation of ground dispersal cages. Field activities have been reinforced with personnel and equipment to deal with suspicious reports in a timely manner, leading to more effective controls with a minimum of impact on the producers involved. However, for the success of the program it is essential to maintain the awareness of the producers in doing their part: to check, inspect and heal the wounds, good livestock practices with responsibility, transport only healthy animals and continue with the immediate report of suspicious cases." (Source: Panama-US Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm (COPEG) https://www.copeg.org/en/producer-resources/)

"Humans can be affected similarly to animals. The disease can quickly become debilitating if it affects the eyes, mouth, nasal, or frontal sinuses, or the ears." (Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2015.
