Since 14 Jul 2014, clinical cases suspected as bovine ephemeral fever (BEF, "3 days sickness"), showing the typical signs (mainly elevated temperatures, acute drop of milk yield, salivation, recumbency) have been reported from dairy cattle farms in various parts of Israel, particularly from the Carmel coast and Hasharon regions. Several positive PCR tests for BEF have been obtained.

In 2 large dairy operations which had been vaccinated against BEF, the disease seems to have affected only a few animals, and the disease seems to be mild. Further observations meant to assess the efficacy of the vaccine are ongoing.

[Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), a seasonal, vectorborne disease circulating throughout Africa, Asia and Australia, is not an OIE-notifiable disease and not zoonotic. This disease seems to be underreported.

BEF is caused by the bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family _Rhabdoviridae_. It deserves attention due to its high morbidity rate and significant economic losses, mainly due to dramatic decreases in milk production, abortion in late pregnant cows, loss of condition, temporary infertility in bulls, and some deaths.

Vaccination against BEF is practised by several countries where the disease is known to be a significant cattle-health problem, such as Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Egypt, and Israel. For a list (incomplete) of BEF vaccine producers, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/disease_list.php?disease=bovine-ephemeral-fever&lang=en.

Vaccination against BEF in Israel is voluntary, applied exclusively by the practitioners upon request of the owners. Previous results
were promising. During the unfolding epizootic, field observations are being undertken by Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Service to definitely establish the vaccine's efficacy.
