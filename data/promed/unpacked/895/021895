Following the confirmation of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in cattle in a village in Elbistan, where 10 animals died, 14 villages and one town have been qurarantined.

State/Province/Region Food, Agriculture and Livestock Manager in Elbistan Ihsan Emiralioglu provided details of the implemented precautionary quarantine measures. He described the 1st outbreak, which was initially seen in one village a month ago and was diagnosed by the Adana Directorate of Veterinary Control and Research Institute, and added: "The sale of sacrificial animals for the Kurban Bairami [Feast of Sacrifice, Eid-Al-Adha] will be allowed, if circumstances allow, just a week before its start. No exit of animals from the region will be allowed. We are engaged in the building of a controlled market for sacrificial animals and will open 2 more animal sales locations."

The implementation of the disease control and quarantine measures and animal movement restrictions is headed by the Provincial Animal Health Security Committee, chaired by Albistan's Governor, Tuncay Akkoyun. The commission will consider removing the measures 28 days after the last case.

[According to Turkey's report to the OIE, the outbreak started on a farm in Kahramanmaras on 6 Aug 2013 and was confirmed on 13 Sep 2013. Media named the index village as Catova. In the meantime, the virus, which is insect-borne, could have widely spread. Its potential has been recently clearly demonstrated in another Middle Eastern country, Israel (dynamic map at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/Map_of_events_20072013.ppt). Israel eventually applied general mass vaccination, which seems to have slowed down, if not yet stopped, the further spread of infection. Without vaccination, the virus managed to overwinter.

According to Turkish media, the following villages in Albistan are among the ones quarantined: Dogan, Akveren, Kucukyapalak, Eldelek, Citlik, Sogutlu, Aglica, Alembey, Hasankendi, and the town of Karaelbistan.

The Feast of the Sacrifice (in Turkish, Kurban bairami) is due this year on 15 Oct 2013 and is celebrated for 3 days, involving the slaughter of very large (7 digit figure) numbers of large and small ruminants, many of them, particularly in rural areas, outside the controlled slaughter facilities in private households. This is the most unfortunate time for the penetration of an exotic animal disease. Being vectorborne, the ability to prevent LSD from becoming endemic is not secured, even if/when vaccination is applied.

Fortunately, LSD is not zoonotic.

According to the OIE notification, Turkey is to apply "vaccination in response to the outbreak." Details on the vaccine to be applied and information on the advance of vaccination activities will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
