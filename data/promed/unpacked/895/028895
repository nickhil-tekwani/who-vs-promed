An outbreak of gastroenteritis due to _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Enteritidis associated with an outdoor public holiday event
occurred in a small village in southern Latvia on 21 Jul 2006. The
outbreak lasted from 22-25 Jul 2006. Descriptive and analytical
epidemiological investigations were conducted to determine the extent
of the outbreak, and to identify outbreak-related risk factors. Of
approximately 260 people who attended the event, 107 participants
were interviewed and 49 people fulfilled the criteria of an outbreak
case (attack rate 46 percent). Stool specimens from 26 people
including 17 kitchen workers were microbiologically tested, and 8
specimens were found to be positive for _S._ Enteritidis. The
retrospective cohort study revealed that a fried pork dish made with
raw egg was the likely cause of the outbreak (RR: 7.8, 95 percent CI
5.2-11.78; P less than 0.001).
Outbreak background:
A cluster of 3 cases of gastroenteritis with onset on 22 Jul 2006 in
patients from the same area was reported to the local branch of the
State Public Health Agency in Jelgava (PHA) on 24 Jul 2006. The
investigation revealed a relationship between the cases and attending
an event in small village X on 21 Jul 2006. On 24 Jul 2006 it was
decided by public health authorities that a full investigation should
be carried out to determine the extent of the outbreak and to
identify the outbreak cause by using a retrospective cohort study.
Outbreak case definitions:
Probable case: A probable case was defined as a person who attended
the event in village X on 21 Jul 2006, ate dishes served there, and
then became ill with symptoms of diarrhea.
Confirmed case: A confirmed case was defined as a person who attended
the event in village X on 21 Jul 2006, ate dishes served there, and
then became ill with symptoms of diarrhea and had a microbiologically
confirmed _S._ Enteritidis infection.
An exposure was defined as consumption of a food item prepared and
served by the staff of restaurant Y, which prepared all the food
available at the event. The food items available included 2 different
soups, smoked sausages, a rissole dish made from salad with cut
potatoes and other boiled vegetables, pickled cucumbers, boiled eggs
and meat products mixed with mayonnaise, braised cabbage, bread, pate
with bacon, fried pork (fried with raw egg), cake, vegetables
(tomatoes and cucumbers), beer, coffee and soft drinks (made up on
site from syrup and water).
Patients who developed diarrhea (with or without vomiting), abdominal
pain or fever in the 4 days after attending the event were considered
to have been ill with acute gastroenteritis.
The municipality provided a list of all the people who participated
in the public holiday event in village X (n=260). Information about
the outbreak was released to the media in order to invite
participants to come forward for interview. A total of 107 people
were considered for the cohort analysis: 8 were contacted in hospital
and 99 were contacted at home. A questionnaire was developed at the
local branch of PHA using Epi Info 3.2.2.
Interviews were carried out face to face or by telephone, and
included questions on basic demographic data, symptoms and clinical
signs, date and time of clinical onset, duration of illness,
admission to hospital and food history, which included using the list
of food items available at the public holiday event.
We compared the food-specific attack rates (AR) for each food item on
the list among the exposed and the non-exposed cohort members in the
univariate analysis (all statistical tests, including chi-square, 95
percent confidence interval and P value). The measure of association
was the relative risk (RR).
Results:
Of approximately 260 people who attended the village event, 107
participants were interviewed and 49 people fulfilled the criteria of
an outbreak case (attack rate = 46 percent). Stool specimens from 28
people, including all 17 kitchen workers from restaurant Y, were
microbiologically tested, and 8 specimens were found to be positive
for _S._ Enteritidis.
On 27 Jul 2006, a clinical microbiology laboratory reported a cluster
of stool samples positive for _S._ Enteritidis. The local food
safety authority was regularly updated about the situation, so that
it could perform control measures in the implicated restaurant Y,
which had prepared and served food for the participants of the event.
Analysis:
The questionnaires were completed for all cohort members. Women made
up 65 (61 percent) of the 107 cohort members. The median age was 42
years (range 2-70). The outbreak lasted from 22-25 Jul 2006, peaked
on 22 Jul 2006 and indicated a common point source outbreak.
Of the cohort, 49 patients met the case definition of an outbreak
case (attack rate (AR) = 46 percent). Among these 49 cases were 29
women (59 percent) and 20 (41 percent) men, and the median age was 39
years (range 2-70). The case distribution by age group and sex is
illustrated in Table 1 [for table, see original URL - Mod.LL].
Stool specimens from 26 people, including 8 symptomatic participants,
2 symptomatic kitchen workers of restaurant Y, 15 asymptomatic
kitchen workers and one asymptomatic participant, were tested for
salmonella, and 8 specimens, including 2 from kitchen workers, were
found to be positive for _S._ Enteritidis and fulfilled the
definition criteria of a confirmed outbreak case.
In addition to diarrhea, 20 patients (41 percent) reported nausea, 16
patients (33 percent) reported vomiting and 34 patients (69 percent)
reported fever. The mean duration of illness was 5 days. Nine
patients were admitted to hospital. All 49 patients recovered.
Epidemiologists from the local branch of PHA collected 6 table eggs
from restaurant Y's kitchen, where all meals for the public holiday
event had been prepared. The eggs were from the same supplier as
those used for the event, but were from a later batch. No other food
item served at the event was available for microbiological
examination at this time. Salmonella test results for the eggs were negative.
During the epidemiological investigation, it was established that the
food prepared in restaurant Y was stored unrefrigerated, from around
3 hours after preparation until consumption. The univariate analyses
of food exposures revealed that only the consumption of pork was
positively associated with illness. An association with disease risk
at a 5 percent significance level was found for fried pork (RR: 7.8;
95 percent CI 5.2-11.78; P=0.001).
Conclusions:
The epidemiological investigation revealed that a fried pork dish
made with raw egg was the likely cause of the outbreak, and that
inadequate preparation and storage of the food contributed to the
outbreak's development.
