As CO2 [carbon dioxide] levels increase in the atmosphere, near-shore waters are becoming more acidic, which can hurt the shell strength of marine organisms. The early stages of shell growth are sensitive to increasingly corrosive seawater, reports a new study, and it's causing commercial oyster operations in the Pacific Northwest to fail.

Young oysters begin shell building very quickly, so that within 48 hours they can begin feeding. The researchers found that oysters can start building calcium carbonate shells within 12 hours after fertilization, when they're just 1/100th the diameter of a human hair. But in acidic water, the oysters need to exert more energy for shell building and have less for swimming and getting food, the researchers say.

"The hatcheries call it 'lazy larvae syndrome' because these tiny oysters just sink in the water and stop swimming," said George Waldbusser of Oregon State, the lead author of the paper. A very small change in ocean chemistry leads to oysters that can't grow shells properly, the researchers said. "These organisms have really sensitive windows to ocean acidification -- even more sensitive than we thought," Waldbusser said.

The findings were reported this week in the journal Nature Climate Change.

The abstract reads:
"Ocean acidification results in co-varying inorganic carbon system variables. Of these, an explicit focus on pH and organismal acid-base regulation has failed to distinguish the mechanism of failure in highly sensitive bivalve larvae. With unique chemical manipulations of seawater we show definitively that larval shell development and growth are dependent on seawater saturation state, and not on carbon dioxide partial pressure or pH. Although other physiological processes are affected by pH, mineral saturation state thresholds will be crossed decades to centuries ahead of pH thresholds owing to nonlinear changes in the carbonate system variables as carbon dioxide is added. Our findings were repeatable for two species of bivalve larvae could resolve discrepancies in experimental results, are consistent with a previous model of ocean acidification impacts due to rapid calcification in bivalve larvae, and suggest a fundamental ocean acidification bottleneck at early life-history for some marine keystone species."

Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have caused atmospheric CO2 to increase at an unprecedented rate and have resulted in a corresponding increase in dissolved CO2 in the ocean. This addition of CO2 has disrupted the chemistry of seawater, including carbon dynamics: increasing hydrogen and bicarbonate ions concentrations, and reducing the concentration of carbonate ions. The main consequences of these changes to seawater chemistry (ocean acidification) are a reduction in the average environmental pH experienced by all marine organisms and a decrease in the availability of calcium carbonate, needed for calcifying marine species. This effect documented in oysters should be investigated in other organisms requiring calcium carbonate. - Mod.PMB
