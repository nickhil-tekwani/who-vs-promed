[Responding to ProMED/MBDS Dengue - Cambodia (04)20120516.1119 posted on 16 May]

As a non-medic travelling in Cambodia's countryside, I think the reports of infections are completely underestimating the pandemic currently going on.

In one village alone in the province of Preah Vihear I have counted at least 700 cases of infections since January 2012.

Extrapolate this to the whole province and you easily have 40 000 or more cases of infections that will very soon occur also in the rest of the country thanks to the newly built roads and increased movement of people.

Many strong men are unable to work due to month-long severe arthritis.

People have died directly or indirectly.

[ProMED thanks Fabio Napoletano for providing his 1st-hand observations. There is a clear need for health authorities to follow up on the outbreak that is going on, with epidemiological surveillance and good laboratory support.

Although persistent athralgia is typical of chikungunya virus infections, because the acute clinical signs of dengue and chikungunya are otherwise similar, laboratory diagnosis will be essential, especially if fatalities are occurring. Reports of fatalities from chikungunya virus infections are very rare, so one hopes that the cause of deaths in this outbreak in Cambodia are determined. - Mod.TY]
