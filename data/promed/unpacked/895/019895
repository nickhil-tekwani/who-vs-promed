[The dairy operation of Kibbutz Alumim is several hundred meters from
the boundary of Israel with the territory controlled by the
Palestinian authority in the Gaza strip. See sector 13 in the
interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>,
where Alumim will be found at the coordinates X=442.95, y=246.
Since there is definitely no animal movement across the tightly
fenced and heavily guarded boundary between the Israeli and
Palestinian territories, airborne transmission by arthropod vectors
is the only plausible route of introduction. The same route was
suspected in 2 previous introductions of Lumpy skin disease (LSD)
into southwestern Israel adjacent to the Gaza strip, namely in
Peduyim in August/September 1989 and in Ein Zurim in June 2006.
The source of infection in the Gaza strip is not known; in view of
Gaza's proximity and possible contacts with Egypt, where LSD is known
to be present, an Egyptian source of infection is possible.
Following last year's (2006) LSD outbreak in Ein Zurim, cattle in a
protection area around the Gaza strip were vaccinated. Information on
the vaccination status of the 10 affected bovines and data on the
vaccine type applied will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
