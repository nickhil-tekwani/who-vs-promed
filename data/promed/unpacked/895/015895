Oyster-killing disease spreads
Entire industry in Maritimes could be at risk
-----------------------------------
A disease that can wipe out oyster populations has spread from one part of
Cape Breton to another part of the island, as well as to 2 sites in Prince
Edward Island (PEI), federal fisheries scientists said Monday.
The MSX disease, a microscopic parasite (_Haplosporidium nelsoni_),
attacking the flesh of oysters at all stages of its growth, was found for
the first time in the St. Peter's Bay and Hillsborough River areas of P.E.I.
The disease doesn't harm humans, but federal Fisheries Minister Robert
Thibault has said the whole industry in the Maritimes could be put at risk
if MSX got into the Gulf of St. Lawrence or Prince Edward Island.
During a news conference, Fisheries Department scientists said the disease
was also confirmed in 4 of 9 sites sampled in Cape Breton. Previous tests
had shown the feared disease existed in the Bras d'Or Lake area of Cape
Breton, where it has severely damaged the local industry. Monday's results
showed it is now present outside of the Bras d'Or Lake area, in Aspy Bay,
on the island's northern tip.
But scientists emphasized the oysters were in the early stages of the
illness, and there was no evidence of the widespread mortality that has
wiped out populations elsewhere in North America.
Sharon McGladdery, science adviser at the Fisheries Department, said
officials will collect more samples from the lightly infected areas and
train more experts to attempt to diagnose the disease. "This will give us a
much bigger picture over the next few months of where MSX is in our
waters," she said. "The best way to stop it is to detect it early. That's
why we're putting in a massive surveillance effort."
Mary Stephenson, head of the shellfish division, said she was encouraged
the new discoveries in P.E.I. and Cape Breton showed the disease was only
present in a portion of the tissue of one of 30 samples.
She said that in P.E.I. the "oysters were actually Nova Scotia oysters
being held in P.E.I. waters," rather than local oysters that had acquired
the illness. She also said the fact the oysters had been in P.E.I. for 2
years and had not caused widespread mortality was a good sign.
She reported that 6 samples from the Gulf of St. Lawrence shore of New
Brunswick, one from the Gulf shore of Nova Scotia, and one from southwest
Nova Scotia have shown no evidence of MSX.
McGladdery said the oysters are being removed from the infected areas. No
other containment measures are being planned until further test results are
complete, she added.
The disease, first introduced from the Pacific Ocean about 15 years ago,
has devastated local species of oyster in some parts of the eastern United
States. It was discovered in 4 or 5 cultivated aquaculture beds in Cape
Breton's Bras d'Or Lakes in mid-August 2002, but the oysters were not
diagnosed with the disease until last month when the fishery was shut down.
Oyster aquaculture is a $1-million [Canadian dollars] industry in the Bras
d'Or Lakes. It's already suffered huge financial losses since harvesting
and stock transfers have been stopped. One local harvester said he lost 85
per cent of his harvestable crop this season. Oysters take about 5 years to
mature, and scientists were hoping the parasite would be impeded by colder
water temperatures.
MSX has the potential to wipe out 85 to 90 percent of oysters in an area,
like it did in the 1950s when it was brought in from Asia and affected
oyster production in Delaware and Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.
Earlier this month, a moratorium was placed on transferring bivalve shell
stock from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into Prince Edward Island. The
scientists said during the news conference that the moratorium will continue.

MSX DISEASE (HAPLOSPORIDIUM NELSONI) IN CANADA
----------------------
(Disease never reported before in Canada).
Emergency report
Information received on 21 October 2002 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa:
Report date: 21 October 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of confirmation of infection: 18 October 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: under investigation.
Outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
St. Patrick's Channel, Cape Breton, province of Nova Scotia (Atlantic coast) 1
Description of affected population: American (eastern) oysters Crassostrea
virginica.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
cru ... * ** ... ...
* Samples examined by histology have shown prevalence rates of over 48%, to
date.
** Mortality rates of over 80% have been reported.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made:
- The presumptive diagnosis was made by the Shellfish Health Unit, Gulf
Fisheries Centre (Fisheries and Oceans Canada), Moncton, province of New
Brunswick.
- Diagnosis was confirmed on 18 October 2002 by the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science, United States of America (OIE Reference Laboratory for MSX
disease), using PCR(1).
B. Diagnostic tests used: histology and PCR(1).
C. Causal agent: Haplosporidium nelsoni. Both plasmodial and sporocyst
stages were observed in samples.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the source of the infection is
unknown. Cases of abnormal mortality and oysters destined for live transfer
between Atlantic provinces are routinely examined histologically by
shellfish health pathologists at the Gulf Fisheries Centre. No evidence of
MSX has been detected in any of these investigations over the last 15 years.
B. Other epidemiological details: oysters on the Pacific coast are
considered to be free of the disease as they are predominantly Crassostrea
gigas and there is no direct transfer of live oysters between Pacific and
Atlantic coasts.
Control measures:
- Contingency plans to control spread of the disease have been implemented
by the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, in conjunction with
provincial authorities.
- Movements of live oysters have been halted and a surveillance programme
is under way to determine the geographical extent of infected oyster stocks.
- Efforts are underway to contain the disease and prevent spread to other
stocks within Nova Scotia and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.
- The feasibility of attempting eradication of the disease is under
investigation.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction.
