Bluetongue in Morocco (Date of previous outbreak of bluetongue in
Morocco reported to the OIE: 2004).
Translation of information received on 30 Oct 2006 from Dr Hamid
Benazzou, Director of Animal Production Department, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, Rabat:
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report
declaring the outbreak(s) ended.
Date of start of the event: 10 Sep 2006.
Clinical disease: yes.
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion, clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Location of the outbreaks: Guenfouda and Sidi Moussa communes (Jerada
province).
Number of animals in the outbreaks: 52 cases out of a total number of
2148 susceptible animals.
Affected species: ovine.
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were performed: Biopharma, Rabat
(Morocco) and OIE reference laboratory for bluetongue, Pirbright
(United Kingdom).
Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation. Serotyping is ongoing.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken: control of arthropods; quarantine;
movement control inside the country; external antiparasite treatment
of affected flocks; national reinforced epidemiological surveillance
of the disease; awareness campaign for local authorities and farmers.

[The current identification of BT virus (still to be typed) in
clinically affected sheep in Morocco (Jerada province) relates,
reportedly, to an outbreak which started 7 weeks earlier, namely on
10 Sep 2006. The province of Jerada, north-east Morocco, borders
Algiers where BTV-1 (a new strain to North Africa!) has been recently
identified as the cause of an extensive epizootic in sheep, and --
probably -- also in cattle (see 20060911.2574).
Interestingly, on 14 Sep 2006 Morocco notified the OIE about an
outbreak of Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD) in cattle, which
reportedly had started on 28 Jul 2006. Jerada was one of the affected
provinces, with 20 foci (See 20061010.2906). Clearly, (at least) 2
orbiviruses are currently circulating in North Africa, affecting (at
least) 2 ruminant species. In some cases -- the Jerada province, for
one -- they could be affecting ovines and bovines simultaneously,
while EHD is characterised by clinical symptoms which are
indistinguishable from bluetongue. This situation is indicative of
the clear need to send samples for laboratory confirmation, followed
by typing and subtyping, from all ruminant species showing bluetongue
or bluetongue-like symptoms.

[I hope that you will view getting 2 moderator comments on a single
posting as a Halloween treat rather than a trick (today is the
holiday in the U.S). Notwithstanding concerns about adding to the
length of the posting, some additional emphasis on the situation so
aptly described by Mod.AS bears emphasis.
Every so often in the natural history of an emerging disease, unique
spaces in time and place occur. From a distance it appears to me as
if one may be happening now in Jerada, north-east Morocco. In my
opinion, it is important that we view the 2 orbiviruses in 2 ruminant
species stretching across the border of 2 countries in a holistic
manner to have a good chance of obtaining a deeper understanding of
the epidemiology of how and why this orbivirus has extended its range
both geographically and perhaps also in terms of species affected.
Not only is it critical to get thorough laboratory subtyping of a
truly representative sample of affected animals, but also good
outbreak investigation and modern applications of animal health
geographic information systems might be very helpful in developing
knowledge about the origins of disease that might have broad
applicability and theoretical implications. This certainly seems
like a situation where mining the epidemiology might yield treats
rather than tricks. - Mod. PC]
