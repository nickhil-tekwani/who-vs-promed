A total of 4 Koreans have died since last month [June 2015] after contracting a deadly virus often transmitted by ticks, according to health authorities. All of the deceased patients were aged 70 or older.

The disease, called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], was first reported in China in 2009. It has an incubation period of 6-14 days and symptoms include fever, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, and leukopenia.

The 1st patient who died of the disease this year [2015] contracted the virus while working at a farm on Jejudo Island, the Health Ministry said. The 74 year old died on 14 Jun [2015]. Since then, 3 more patients have died in Gyeonggi and South Gyeongsang provinces.

To prevent the disease, health authorities advised people to wear long sleeves when working on farms and to not lie down on lawns without a mat from April to November. In China, the disease has a fatality rate of 12 per cent.

ProMED-mail reported the 1st case this year (2015) in South Korea, a 73 year old woman living in a rural city in South Chungcheong province. She was admitted to a hospital in Daejeon on 12 May 2015, 3 days after showing symptoms of SFTS, or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, caused by a virus carried by ticks, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Now, there are a total of 4 fatal cases, who were residents of other provinces, suggesting that the virus is endemic in several localities in South Korea.

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the _Bunyaviridae_ family. An article published by Yun and colleagues indicated that __Haemaphysalis longicornis_ ticks have been considered the principal tick vector of SFTSV but the virus has been shown to be present in _Amblyomma testudinarium_ and _Ixodes nipponensis_ ticks, which might serve as potential vectors of this virus in South Korea. However, the presence of viral RNA in a tick does not confirm that the tick can transmit the virus (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140705.2589725).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease discovered in China in 2009. In July 2013, the 1st human infection with SFTS virus (SFTSV) was detected in Shaanxi Province, Western China.
Methods
-------
A seroprevalence study among humans was carried out in an SFTS endemic village; specifically, serum samples were collected from 363 farmers in an SFTS endemic village in Shaanxi Province. The presence of SFTSV antibodies in serum was determined using an ELISA.
Results
-------
SFTSV antibodies were found in a total of 20 people (5.51 per cent), with no significant difference between males and females (6.93 per cent and 4.42 per cent, respectively; Chi-square = 1.29, p = 0.25). Moreover, the SFTSV antibody positive rate was not significantly different across different age groups (Chi-square = 2.23, p = 0.69).
Conclusions
-----------
SFTSV readily infects humans with outdoor exposure. The results of the serological study indicate that the virus circulates widely in Shaanxi Province. SFTSV represents a public health threat in China.
Discussion
----------
We found an SFTSV seroprevalence level of 5.51 per cent in an SFTS endemic village, which is similar to that reported in Hubei Province (6.37 per cent) and Zhejiang Province (5.51 per cent), but much higher than that reported in Shandong Province (0.84 per cent) and Jiangsu Province (0.94 per cent). This discrepancy may be attributed to the season of sample collection, age and sex of the subjects, previous exposure or low level of infection, or differences in detection methods employed in different studies. Furthermore, the seropositive volunteers in our study had not had contact with the 1st reported patient before onset, which suggests that other infections in the village may have resulted from natural exposure to a reservoir.
