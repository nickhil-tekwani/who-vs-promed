[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.4.13, Lumpy skin disease, from which the following commentary is quoted http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf:

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) was 1st seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957, it entered Kenya, associated with an outbreak of sheep pox. In 1970, LSD spread north into the Sudan; by 1974, it had spread west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and the Cameroon, with reported mortality rates in affected cattle of 20 percent. The occurrence of LSD north of the Sahara Desert and outside the African continent was confirmed for the 1st time in Egypt and Israel between 1988 and 1989, and after a period of 17 years was reported again in 2006. In the past decade, LSD occurrences have been reported in the Middle Eastern, European and west Asian regions. Lumpy skin disease outbreaks tend to be sporadic, depending upon animal movements, immune status, and wind and rainfall patterns affecting vector populations. LSD is considered to have become established outside Africa. The principal method of transmission is thought to be mechanical by arthropod vector.

The severity of clinical signs of LSD depends on the strain of capripoxvirus and the age, immunological status and breed of host. _Bos taurus_ is more susceptible to clinical disease than _Bos indicus_; the Asian buffalo has also been reported to be susceptible. Within _Bos taurus_, the fine-skinned Channel Island breeds develop more severe disease, with lactating cows appearing to be the most at risk. However, even among groups of cattle of the same breed kept together under the same conditions, there is a large variation in the clinical signs presented, ranging from subclinical infection to death. There may be failure of the virus to infect the whole group, probably depending on the virulence of the virus isolate, immunological status of the host and vector prevalence."

In 2015, Namibia reported 6 outbreaks of LSD. Of 447 susceptible animals, 11 cases were reported. The outbreaks were located in the north part of the country in the regions Omusati (1), Otjozondjupa (1), Ohangwena (3) and Oshikoto (1). For additional details on these outbreaks, see the OIE's annual report 2015 at http://tinyurl.com/hvs6n82, and go to section 3 of the report.
