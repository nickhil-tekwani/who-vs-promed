The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating
with public health officials in many states to investigate a
multi-state outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Typhimurium infections associated with contact with water frogs, such
as African dwarf frogs. Water frogs commonly live in habitats such as
aquariums or fish tanks. As of 5 Apr 2011, a total of 217 individuals
infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been
reported from 41 states since 1 Apr 2009. The number of ill person
identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (5), Alabama (2),
Arizona (10), California (17), Colorado (12), Connecticut (3), Florida
(1), Georgia (4), Idaho (4), Illinois (8), Indiana (1), Kansas (2),
Kentucky (4), Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (6), Maryland (5), Michigan
(6), Minnesota (1), Missouri (5), Mississippi (1), Montana (2), North
Carolina (1), Nebraska (2), New Hampshire (3), New Jersey (3), New
Mexico (2), Nevada (3), New York (7), Ohio (7), Oklahoma (1), Oregon
(5), Pennsylvania (14), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (4), Texas (4),
Utah (18), Virginia (11), Vermont (1), Washington (23), Wisconsin (3),
and West Virginia (1).

Among the persons for whom information is available, illnesses began
9 Apr 2009. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year
old to 73 years old; 71 percent of patients are younger than 10 years
old, and the median age is 5 years old. 51 percent of patients are
female. Among ill persons, 34 percent were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Surveillance for additional illness continues through analysis of
data in PulseNet, the national network of public health and food
regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
The CDC, in collaboration with many state and local health
departments, is continuing to investigate an outbreak of Salmonella
infections associated with contact with water frogs, specifically,
African dwarf frogs. In interviews, ill persons answered questions
about contact with animals and foods consumed during the days before
becoming ill. 64 percent of ill persons reported contact with frogs in
the week before their illness began. Of ill persons who could recall
the type of frog they had contact with, 84 percent identified African
dwarf frogs. The median time from acquiring a frog and illness onset
was 15 days, with a range of 7 to 240 days. Findings of traceback
investigations identified a single water frog breeder in California as
the source of African dwarf frogs associated with human infections.
This frog breeding facility was 1st identified as the source of
African dwarf frogs associated with human infections in 2010.
Information about this investigation in 2009-2010 can be found on the
CDC Salmonella page http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks.html.

Environmental testing also links the infection to a single African
dwarf frog breeding facility in California. Because of the evidence of
an ongoing problem, local health department officials visited the frog
breeder in late March 2011 and collected environmental samples. These
samples were tested in CDC laboratories and were found to be positive
for salmonellae; additional testing is ongoing to determine if this
strain is the outbreak strain.

General Advice About How to Care for Water Frogs
------------------------------------------------
Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after handling
anything, including water, that comes in contact with water frogs or
from inside their habitat (e.g., aquarium or fish tank). Since the
water from inside their habitat can carry the same germs as the water
frogs themselves, following proper handwashing practices is very
important. Adults should assist young children with hand washing.

Kitchen sinks should not be used to empty or wash the frog's habitat
(e.g., aquarium or fish tank). If possible, empty and wash the habitat
outside of the home, using disposable gloves. If bathtubs are used for
cleaning the frog's habitat, they should be cleaned thoroughly and
disinfected with bleach. Young children should not be allowed to clean
the frog's habitat (e.g., aquarium or fish tank).

Be aware that salmonellosis can be caused not only by water frogs,
but by other amphibians and reptiles, such as turtles. More

[Although the link between human salmonellosis and pet turtles is
commonly known, this posting is a reminder that amphibians such as
frogs as well as other reptiles, such as snakes, can also be carriers
of the disease.

The most likely source of transmission in this outbreak was contact
with water from the frogs' aquariums. Because African dwarf frogs are
small and tend to rest at the bottom of aquariums where children have
difficulty reaching them, direct handling as the source of
transmission is less likely. Amphibians are known carriers of
Salmonella (1). African dwarf frogs are purely aquatic animals,
typically less than 2 inches long from nose to tail stub, and sold as
ornamental aquarium pets. In one study, 21 percent of aquarium frogs
tested from 16 retailers were positive for Salmonella (1).
Furthermore, Salmonella bacteria shed from frogs are readily
recoverable from aquarium water where frogs are housed (1). Salmonella
can survive for an extended period in the environment, and indirect
transmission through environmental contamination might occur (2).
