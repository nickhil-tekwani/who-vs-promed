Shillai area in Sirmaur district is famous for producing good
varieties of ginger. Ginger farmers have alleged apathy of the State
Government towards them despite their crop fetching valuable foreign
exchange from overseas markets.

"There is a huge demand for our ginger in the markets in Pakistan.
Our crops are attacked by saran rog (soft rot or rhizome rot disease)
and the government is not concerned about it. They must provide us
with all necessary pesticides and minimum support price for our
crops," said Kapil, a farmer.

"Our lives depend on the ginger crop. But we are neither provided
with subsidies and seeds, nor with the minimum support rate for our
crops," said Ashok Kumar, another farmer.

[Soft rot is the most serious disease of ginger (_Zingiber
officinalis_) in India and in some other countries. It is caused by
fungi in the genus _Pythium_ (_P. aphanidermatum_ and other species).
The disease has been reported to destroy up to 90 percent of the
annual crop. Symptoms include rotting of shoot bases, yellowing and
drying up of leaves, collapse of shoots, and rotting of rhizomes. The
disease is favoured by high moisture in the soil. The pathogens are
spread with infected materials including soil and plant debris, by
mechanical means and water. Disease management includes the use of
well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, and preventative
fungicide treatments of rhizomes for planting. All of the commercial
ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible, but the
related ornamental _Z. zerumbet_ was identified as a potential source
of genetic resistance.

Soft and rhizome rots of ginger due to other pathogens including
fungi in the genus _Fusarium_ and bacteria in the genera _Ralstonia_
and _Erwinia_ have also been reported from various locations but
appear to be of relatively minor importance in India.
