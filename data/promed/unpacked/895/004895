Man dies after catching anthrax from cow
------------------------------------------
A herdsman has died after contracting anthrax from eating beef, in a rare
occurrence of the acutely infectious disease in humans in China, local
health officials said yesterday [9 Jul 2004]. The man, a Tibetan named
Sangdan, died on 11 Jun 2004, 7 days after coming into contact with the
infected animal in Maqu county, in north-west Gansu province. "The man ate
the meat of the diseased cow and later sold the skin and got infected,"
said Maqu county health bureau official Ma Shuyan. "I can confirm that he
died on 11 Jun 2004 from anthrax."
35 people, who came into contact with him, have been quarantined. The
infected area has been isolated, and cattle markets have been closed, the
China News Service reported.
"We checked all cows that had contact with the diseased cow, and none was
infected," said the official. "We didn't slaughter them; we just vaccinated
them. We have burned the skin and the other leftovers of the cow."
While China's Ministry of Agriculture refused to comment, statistics on its
web-site show a handful of anthrax cases in livestock around the country
every year.
There is no record of the disease being passed on to humans before.

Gansu province. Ma Shuyan, from the Maqu county health bureau, says he can

[Official claims to the contrary, human anthrax is not unknown in China,
especially in the west and north; there are a number of cases each year.
Human anthrax is now seldom seen in eastern China, as the disease in
livestock there is adequately controlled. Burning what they could find of
the sick cow was the correct action. - Mod.MHJ]
