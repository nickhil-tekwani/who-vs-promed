Suspected Legionnaires' disease on cruise ship
-----------------------------------------------------------
On Fri 27 Jul 2007 the Department of Communicable Disease Control and
Prevention, Stockholm County Council was informed by one of the
infectious diseases hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, that 3 females
from a cruise ship had been hospitalised due to severe pneumonia. The
chest X-rays from each of them showed bilateral infiltrates. Based on
this information the Stockholm Environmental Health Office was asked
to make contact with the ship.
This contact was established and the ship was offered help with
sampling for _Legionella_ bacteria from the environment on the ship.
A total of 13 water samples and 5 swabs samples were collected during
the same day. It was later revealed that 2 more persons were
hospitalised in another infectious diseases hospital in Stockholm.
One had X-ray verified pneumonia and the other had an exacerbation of
COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], but no pulmonary
infiltrates on chest X-ray. Both were discharged on 30 Jul 2007.
The cruise ship left Stockholm on Saturday morning 28 Jul 2007 and
returned directly to Dover, UK. More actions have been taken in the
UK. Urinary antigen tests from one of the 4 pneumonia patients showed
a borderline positive result. PCR on sputum samples from 2 of the 4
were positive for _Legionella_, one whom also had the borderline
positive urinary antigen test.
The water samples showed very low amounts of _L. pneumophila_ (10
cfu/L) and no _Legionella_ bacteria were detected in the swab
samples. However the final laboratory results will be available next
week [6-10 Aug 2007].
To conclude there were 4 persons with clinical and radiological
symptoms compatible with legionellosis. Of those 4, 2 had PCR
positive sputum for _Legionella_, one of whom also had a positive
urinary antigen test. All 4 responded rapidly to treatment directed
against Legionella. Taken together with the fact that _L,
pneumophila_ were detected in low amounts in water samples from the
cruise ship it indicates that transmission of _Legionella_ may have
occurred in the ship. Further microbiological analyses are needed to
confirm this suspicion.

[We thank Dr. de Jong for her detailed report. _Legionella_ are
frequently difficult to culture from environmental water sources.
Concentrations of this fastidious organism may vary because of
factors such as water temperature and dispersion of the biofilm in
which the organism is embedded. It would be helpful if an
epidemiologic investigation could suggest a link between the cases
and a particular environmental water source. Molecular fingerprinting
of the clinical and environmental isolates can then confirm the
link.The positive urinary antigen assay from one of the patients
suggests that _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is involved.
Although the exact dates for exposure are not given, with an
incubation period usually of up to 10 days (and longer in some
outbreaks) more cases of legionnaires' disease are still possible. A
discussion of detection and control of _Legionella_ in environmental
sources is found at:
