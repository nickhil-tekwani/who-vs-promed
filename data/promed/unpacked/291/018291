[1] CDC report
Date: Sun 10 Nov 2013
Source: CDC [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2013/O157H7-11-13/


CDC is collaborating with public health officials in California, Washington, and Arizona; the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS); and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infections. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _E. coli_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that could be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories, which performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

The type of bacteria responsible for this outbreak is among those referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, or STEC or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) Some types of STEC frequently cause severe disease, including bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a type of kidney failure. EHEC bacteria are divided into serogroups (e.g., O157 or O121). _E. coli_ O157 is the EHEC serogroup found most commonly in American patients. The EHEC O157:H7 PFGE pattern in this outbreak is new to the PulseNet database. It has never been seen before.

A total of 26 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O157:H7 have been reported from 3 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), California (22), and Washington (3).

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 29 Sep 2013 to 26 Oct 2013. Ill persons range in age from 4 years to 78 years, with a median age of 28 years. 61 percent of ill persons are female. Among 21 persons with available information, 6 (28 percent) reported being hospitalized. Two ill persons have developed HUS, and no deaths have been reported.

Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that 2 ready-to-eat salads, Field Fresh Chopped Salad with Grilled Chicken and Mexicali Salad with Chili Lime Chicken, produced by Glass Onion Catering and sold at Trader Joe's grocery store locations, are one likely source of this outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 infections.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FSIS and FDA are continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and work is continuing to determine the source of contamination and identify any other potentially contaminated products still on the market. CDC will update the public when additional information is available.

Recall
------
On Sun 10 Nov 2013, Glass Onion Catering, a Richmond, CA firm, voluntarily recalled approximately 181 620 pounds of ready-to-eat salads and sandwich wrap products with fully cooked chicken and ham that may be contaminated with EHEC O157:H7. The products were produced between 23 Sep 2013 and 6 Nov 2013 and shipped to distribution centers intended for retail sale in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Tom Atherstone, company president, at (510) 236-8905.

The products subject to recall are regulated by both FSIS and FDA. Products regulated by FSIS bear the establishment number "P-34221" inside the USDA mark of inspection.

CDC, FSIS, and FDA recommend that consumers do not eat these products and dispose of them immediately.

Advice to Consumers
--------------------
CDC recommends the following to consumers and retailers:
- Consumers should check their homes and refrigerators for recalled ready-to-eat salad products and wraps.
- Read the list of recalled products regulated by USDA-FSIS.
- Read the list of recalled products regulated by FDA.
- Consumers should not eat the recalled ready-to-eat salad products and wraps and should dispose of any remaining product in their homes. This is especially important for children 5 years of age and younger, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, who are at greater risk for complications (e.g., hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure) associated with EHEC infections.
- Retailers and food service operators should not sell or serve the recalled ready-to-eat salad products and wraps.
- People who have eaten a recalled ready-to-eat salad product or wrap should look for signs of EHEC infection including diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps.
- People who think they might have become ill from eating a recalled salad or wrap should talk to their health care providers.

[2] USDA-FSIS recall
Date: Sun 10 Nov 2013
Source: USDA-FSIS [edited]
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2013/recall-065-2013-release


Glass Onion Catering, a Richmond, CA establishment, is recalling approximately 181 620 pounds of ready-to-eat salads and sandwich wrap products with fully-cooked chicken and ham that may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 10 Nov 2013.

The company announced that the products are being recalled in conjunction with other foods regulated by the FDA. A full list of products being recalled will be available on FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Recalls/default.htm [See below - Mod.LL].

Products regulated by FSIS bear the establishment number "P-34221" inside the USDA mark of inspection. FSIS products subject to recall include:
- 12 oz. packages of "delish pan pacific chop salad"
- 13.4 oz. packages of "delish California style grilled chicken salad"
- 9.9 oz. packages of "delish uncured applewood smoked ham & cheese wrap"
- 10.5 oz. packages of "delish grilled chicken caesar wrap"
- 10.9 oz. packages of "delish southwestern chicken wrap"
- 11.5 oz. packages of "delish greek brand low-calorie grilled chicken wrap"
- 9.9 oz. packages of "delish white chicken club wrap"
- 11.2 oz. packages of "delish asian style chicken wrap"
- 13.4 oz. packages of "atherstone Fine Foods Southwestern Style White Chicken Wrap with Chimichurri Sauce"
- 10.5 oz. packages of "atherstone Fine Foods Asian Style White Chicken Wrap with Mango Vinaigrette"
- 9.9 oz. packages of "atherstone Fine Foods Grilled White Chicken Caesar Wrap with Caesar Dressing"
- 10.7 oz. packages of "super fresh Foods California Grilled Chicken Salad, Low Fat Mendocino Mustard Dressing"
- 10.7 oz. packages of "Lunch Spot Southwestern Style Chicken Wrap, Chile & Lime Dressing"
- 9.2 oz. packages of "super fresh Foods Pan Pacific Chopped Chicken Salad, Ginger Soy Dressing"
- 10.7 oz. plastic containers of "TRADER JOE'S Field Fresh Chopped Salad with Grilled Chicken."
- 11 oz. plastic containers of "TRADER JOSE'S MEXICALI SALAD with Chili Lime Chicken."

The products were produced between 23 Sep 2013 and 6 Nov 2013 and shipped to distributions centers intended for retail sale in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS began monitoring a cluster of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses on 29 Oct 2013 then was notified by FDA on 6 Nov 2013 that California authorities had reported case-patients consuming pre-packaged salads with grilled chicken. Working in conjunction with the CDC, FDA, the California Department of Public Health, the Washington State Department of Health, and the Arizona Department of Health Services, FSIS has determined that there is a link between the grilled chicken salads and the illness cluster. 26 case-patients have been identified in 3 states with indistinguishable _E. coli_ O157:H7 PFGE (genetic fingerprint) patterns with illness onset dates ranging from 29 Sep 2013 to 26 Oct 2013. Based on epidemiological information, 15 case-patients reported consumption of ready-to-eat pre-packaged salads prior to illness onset. A traceback investigation determined Glass Onion Catering was the supplier of the products implicated in the outbreak.

While uncommon to find _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a poultry product, FSIS will continue its investigation in conjunction with the FDA to identify the source of the contamination. FSIS continues to work with the CDC, FDA and state public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some products may be in a consumer's refrigerators. Because this is a ready-to-eat product, FSIS advises all consumers to destroy the product.

[3] FDA recall
Date: Sat 9 Nov 2013
Source: FDA [edited]
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm374400.htm


Athertone Foods, Inc. of Richmond, CA is voluntary recalling "Best Buy" dates 9-23-13 through 11-14-13 of ready to eat salads and wraps because they may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 bacteria (_E. coli_ O157:H7). _E. coli_ O157:H7 causes a diarrheal illness often with bloody stools. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly. The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death. To date, no illnesses have been associated with these products.

Specific FDA regulated product information is below:

Product Description/UPC/Areas Distributed/Retailers

Delish Greek Style Orzo Salad 6 oz Clam Shell/49022 74630/Northern CA/Walgreens
Delish Asian Style Noodle Salad 6 oz Clam Shell/49022 74628/Northern CA/Walgreens
Delish Vegetarian Wrap 11.3 oz Cellophane/49022 55349/Northern CA/Walgreens

[The 2 separate recalls, one from USDA FSIA and one from FDA, are necessary since the agencies regulate different parts of the food continuum.

While it is correct that poultry, especially chicken, is not a common recognized vehicle for human EHEC infection and that the non-protein ingredients of the salads were more likely as vehicles, the following publication suggests the risk is not zero:

Kalin R, Ongor H, Cetinkaya B: Isolation and molecular characterization of _Escherichia coli_ O157 from broiler and human samples. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2012;9: 313-318.

Abstract
---------
There is a lack of information about the role of poultry, specifically chicken, in transmission of _E. coli_ O157 and subsequent human illnesses. This study was, therefore, aimed at investigating the presence of _E. coli_ O157 and its virulence genes in various samples collected from broiler chickens and humans in eastern Turkey by culture, immunomagnetic separation (IMS), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The genetic relationship between broiler and human isolates was also examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

In the PCR analysis of sorbitol-negative isolates, _E. coli_ O157 was identified in 0.1 percent (1/1000) and 0.4 percent (4/1000) of the liver and cecum samples of broiler chickens, respectively. On the other hand, none of the carcass samples were determined to be positive for _E. coli_ O157. Overall, the results indicated that 12 percent (3/25) of the flocks were positive for _E. coli_ O157. The differences between the flocks in terms of the positivity were determined to be statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Ten (2.7 percent) of 367 human stool samples were also positive for _E. coli_ O157 in the PCR examination. None of the broiler and human _E. coli_ O157 isolates possessed H7, shigatoxins 1-2, or enterohemolysin genes, whereas all the broiler isolates and one of the human isolates were positive for intimin gene. In the PFGE analysis, a total of 8 different profiles (4 from broiler and 4 from human isolates) were observed. However, there were no genetic relationships between broiler and human _E. coli_ O157 isolates. It can be concluded that more detailed studies are needed in poultry to better understand the role of these species in the epidemiology of _E. coli_ O157 infections in humans.
