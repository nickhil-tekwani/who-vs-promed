Animal Control officers are warning you to stay way from wild animals. It comes after a man was exposed to rabies in Sumner County when he tried to help an injured fox.

Rabies is a deadly disease that is transmitted to humans from infected animals. The disease infects the nervous system causing disease in the brain and then death. Officers say the man found the injured fox in Sumner County in early June 2015. When he tried to help the wounded fox, the man told officers the fox bit him. That fox later tested positive for rabies, a disease that can be fatal to both animals and humans. Luckily Kansas health officials say that the man will be fine.

"The State believes he is not going to be infected," said Sumner County Health Director Laura Rettig. "It is still up to him whether he chooses to have treatment or not."

Rettig says it is vital to start treatment within 10 days of being exposed to rabies, or else it could be fatal. Here are the symptoms she says you should look for in animals. "A lot of erratic behavior everyone thinks of rabies as foaming at the mouth, that may or may not be a symptom," Rettig said. That's why animal control officers are warning people to say away from wild animals.

"If you see an injured animal, leave it alone." said Wichita Police Lieutenant Steve Kenney. "It is not worth your life or injuries to help that animal out. Call somebody, a local area rescue, to see if they can deal with it properly."

There have been 51 confirmed cases of rabies in Kansas so far in 2015. 41 skunks, 6 bovines, 3 cats, and 1 fox. There have been 4 confirmed cases in Sedgwick county.

The Wichita Animal Control is launching a campaign called, "The Fox says, Look but don't touch."

[Sumner County, Kansas, is roughly in the middle of the southern border of the state, adjoining Oklahoma; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/kansas_90.jpg. Sedgwick County is to the immediate north of Sumner County.

As this confirmed rabid fox bit this man, presumably on his hand, it is unclear why the Kansas State Health officials put him at minimal risk, according to this report. But as they see plenty of rabies exposures -- they quote 51 cases of confirmed animal rabies just for this year -- they have experience. - Mod.MHJ
