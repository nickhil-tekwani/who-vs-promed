No fewer than 1158 children in Borno State are undergoing treatment from measles in Maiduguri, Borno State capital.

According to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) also known as Doctors Without Borders, most of the patients were admitted at Gwange Paediatric hospital, which is managed by MSF.

Statistics indicate 58% of the children admitted at the hospital are from Zabarmari, a volatile small settlement of about 45 000 people located 20km [approx. 12.4mi] away from Maiduguri.

The duration of the outbreak, according to MSF Head of Mission David Therond shows: "The 1st child affected by measles was admitted in Gwange Paediatric hospital on 3 Dec 2020 and the number of patients has been increasing since then in Maiduguri hospitals," adding: "A vaccination campaign is required to see the number of cases decrease."

Therond informed that MSF launched an aggressive response to the outbreak by strengthening the hospitalisation capacity in Gwange and Fori health facilities through increasing the number of beds from 65 to 105 in Gwange.

Due to the challenge of access to Zabarmari community, MSF developed a partnership with the health authorities in the town of Zabarmari with a local team comprising of 10 community health workers and a nurse.

This team in Zabarmari is supervised by a mobile team coming from Maiduguri to support the local primary health care and refer severe cases to the Gwange paediatric hospital in Maiduguri.

Kubura Mohammed, a mother of 7 children, is from Zabarmari. She is in the pediatric hospital with her 4- year- old daughter who has been diagnosed of measles. Narrating her experience at the hospital, she said: "My daughter had been ill for 6 days before I brought her to the hospital. The medical team was all around my daughter throughout our 1st night because her condition was really critical.

''Her treatment commenced from the moment she was admitted and this includes blood transfusion and the administration of intravenous fluids.

"The care we are receiving here is completely free. We appreciate what MSF is doing in our community and I must add that about 2 weeks ago, one of my daughters was also treated of measles in this hospital. All of my 7 children have had measles at different times.''

The Nation reports Borno state has had incidents of measles outbreaks every 2 years over the past decade.

During the measles outbreak in 2019, 8 local government areas of Borno state were affected and MSF provided care to 4000 children in Gwange and Bama hospitals.

[2] Vaccinations needed

Hundreds of children are falling ill with measles in Zabarmari, a small town in Nigeria 's conflict-affected Borno state, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned today. A vaccination campaign is needed to curb the epidemic in Zabarmari and the state capital Maiduguri.

"We are engaged in discussions with the authorities and preparing to support them in a catch-up vaccination campaign in Maiduguri and Zabarmari as soon as vaccines are available, because measles is extremely contagious and especially dangerous for young children," said David Therond, MSF head of mission.

The vaccination plan is still under discussion at state and federal levels with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.

In addition to increasing the number of beds from 65 to 105 in the Gwange hospital, "MSF also reinforced inpatient capacity at another health facility run by MSF in Maiduguri's Fori district. MSF also launched activities in partnership with health authorities in the town of Zabarmari, which has an estimated population of over 45 000 people, including families displaced by conflict in the region.

Because conflict in the region makes accessing Zabarmari challenging, MSF has set up a local team comprising 10 community health workers and a nurse. This team in Zabarmari is supervised by a mobile team based in Maiduguri to support local primary health care and refer children with severe cases of measles to the Gwange pediatric hospital.

Borno state has had repeated measles epidemics over the past decade. During the measles outbreak in 2019, 8 local government areas of Borno state were affected and MSF provided care to 4000 children in Gwange and Bama hospitals. Several factors contribute to the epidemic: routine vaccinations are not carried out in many locations because, according to health authorities, more than 60% of health centers in the region are closed or unable to function properly because of the conflict. The fighting has also forced the departure of some aid organizations that were providing health care in remote areas.

[ Measles is a vaccine -preventable disease. Children should never be dying from diseases when vaccines are available.

"The World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 fact sheet on immunisation coverage says vaccination currently prevents 2 -- 3 million deaths annually [of all vaccine preventable diseases]. But despite the numerous benefits, some children in Nigeria are losing out on important routine vaccines due to poor functional vaccination system, high cost and parents' ignorance.

"In Nigeria for instance, it is widely believed that about 18 northern states are performing poorly in terms of immunisation coverage with those in the south doing better with a great margin. But a brief on the National Immunisation Coverage Indicators (NICI) 2016/2017 states that only 1 in 4 children received all recommended vaccines.

"It says more children are fully immunised in the South-South, South-West and South-East zones, but noted that lack of awareness was the main reason children are not fully vaccinated."
