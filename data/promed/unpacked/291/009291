The Secretary of Agriculture of Rio Grande do Sul, Jose Hermeto Hoffmann,
confirmed on Saturday night [5 May 2001 the clinical diagnosis of foot &
mouth disease (FMD) in Santana do Livramento, a city 488 km from Porto
Alegre, on the frontier with Uruguay.
The Secretary said no animals would be culled, but the affected property
would be closed off and that he had already sent teams to the municipality
to carry out protective actions [presumably vaccination - Mod.JW.
The property owner told Agencia Estado he had found the disease in 10
animals: "They had blisters in the mouth, especially on the gums and
tongue." They were diagnosed by 2 veterinarians who visited the farm on
Friday [4 May 2001.
[Laboratory confirmation has not yet been reported. - Mod.JW
[If this report is confirmed, it is a serious blow to Brazils "FMD-free
without vaccination" beef export zone. Uruguay has been battling the
disease recently, so it is not totally unexpected to find the disease just
across the border into Brazil. Diseases, especially this one, do not
respect boundaries. ­ Mod.TG

SAO PAULO, Brazil: A cow in the southern Brazilian ranching state of Rio
Grande do Sul shows signs of having foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) although a
blood test for confirmation is still pending, according to Brazil's
Agriculture Ministry.
If the case is confirmed it would be the first sign of the
financially-devastating livestock disease in the world's biggest commercial
herd since August 2000, when Brazil slaughtered 11 000 head in the state to
contain an outbreak. "There's only one case for now," said Miguel Bueno,
the spokesman for Brazilian Agriculture Minister Vinicius Pratini de
Moraes. "Clinically it points to a possible case of FMD, but the serology
has yet to be confirmed."
The cow was found in the town of Santana do Livramento, near Uruguay, which
has been struggling with its own outbreak of the highly contagious disease,
which causes blisters and fever in cattle, pigs, sheep, and other
cloven-hoofed animals.
Bueno said the area had been isolated and a vaccination program was due to
be implemented on Monday, although he was unsure about the number of cattle
to be immunized. The state of Rio Grande do Sul had stopped vaccinating its
13 million cattle in April 2000 and has been awaiting the coveted
"foot-and-mouth free without vaccination" status from the Paris-based
International Epizootic Office (OIE).
Minister Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said Brazil's beef exports would not be
greatly affected as the meat from the area was mostly used to produce
cooked products whose sale was unaffected by the disease. A small but
growing export of off-the-bone beef from the area would be "affected over a
certain period," he said, but it was the government's implementation of FMD
vaccinations in the area that could cause the most damage. However, Rio
Grande do Sul's governor and Pratini de Moraes decided to resume limited
inoculation against the disease in the municipalities bordering Uruguay and
Argentina as a precaution against the disease spreading into Brazil. The
agriculture minister has said the limited vaccination scheme should not
delay an OIE vaccine-free stamp for the region. The rest of Brazil's 167
million head of cattle are going through a vaccination program which aims
to make the country foot-and-mouth immunization free in 2005.
Aside from vaccination, Brazil has turned the normally picturesque valley
of the Uruguay River, which separates Brazil from Argentina, Paraguay, and
Uruguay, into a military zone to prevent the spread of the disease from its
infected neighbors. Air Force helicopters and surveillance planes, armored
personnel carriers, marine patrol boats, and heavily armed soldiers in
camouflage have been deployed along the river to intercept any contraband
livestock or would-be rustlers.
Brazil currently has a ban on live animals, beef products, animal
reproductive material, and vegetable products from Uruguay and Argentina
without proper certification after both reported cases of the disease.
Uruguay, whose main export revenue earner is beef, manages an
11-million-head cattle herd and a 15-million-strong flock of sheep, while
Argentina has almost 55 million head of cattle.
