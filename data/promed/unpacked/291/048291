Rainbow Lorikeet Deaths in Melbourne
------------------------------------
Since early March 2012, wild rainbow lorikeets (_Trichoglossus haematodus_) have been reported as dead or sick at a number of sites in the eastern and north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. At one site, more than 32 deaths were recorded. Sick birds have shown signs such as diarrhoea, vomiting, regurgitation, and lethargy. In some cases, hand feeding of lorikeets has occurred at the sites.

Investigations have been undertaken by veterinary staff at the University of Melbourne Faculty of Veterinary Science and Victorian Department of Primary Industries.

At this stage, a bacterial infection of the bowel, known as necrotic enteritis, is believed to be the most likely cause. Birds have tested negative for other possible diseases, such as avian influenza, Newcastle disease, avian paramyxovirus, salmonellosis and psittacosis. Investigations are however ongoing.

This disease is believed to result from overgrowth of a bacterium (_Clostridium perfringens_) in the bowel, resulting from hand and supplementary feeding. Lorikeets have a simple digestive system that is well suited to their natural diet. As this disease is spread in droppings from sick birds, it can easily be passed onto healthy birds congregated at feeding sites. Because of this, feeding of birds is not recommended and can in fact be a danger to their health. There are many flowering plants, as well other sources of food such as insects, available for lorikeets without the need to provide additional food.

Any sick or dead birds can potentially be a health risk to people so it is important to dispose of carcasses appropriately. Dead birds can be collected by using a plastic bag as a glove, and wrapping the bag around the bird without touching it (the same way as picking up dog faeces). Dead birds should be double bagged and then placed in the domestic rubbish. Dead birds should not be buried as dogs or cats may dig them up. After handling dead or sick birds, always wash hands with soapy water, and if you wish, use an alcohol wipe as well.

Further information or reporting cases. Please contact Wildlife Health Surveillance Victoria by e-mail <pamw@unimelb.edu.au> or telephone for further information or to report dead/sick rainbow lorikeets. Your reports will assist with further investigations into this disease.

[Necrotic enteritis is an acute or chronic enterotoxemia commonly seen worldwide in varied bird species, such as chickens, turkeys and ducks. It is caused by _Clostridium perfringens_ and characterised by a fibrino-necrotic enteritis, usually of the mid- small intestine. In poultry, mortality may be 5-50 percent, usually around 10 percent. Infection occurs by faecal-oral transmission. Spores of the causative organism are highly resistant. Predisposing factors include coccidian infection, diet (high protein, high viscosity), in ducks possibly heavy strains, contaminated feed and/or water, other debilitating diseases.

Feeding wildlife is not a good idea. As in cases like this, it may cause the animals great harm. Examples in the U.S. are mycoplasmosis and salmonellosis transmitted by bird feeders in songbirds.
