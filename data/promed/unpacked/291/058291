Ottawa Public Health [OPH] says that children who have not been vaccinated for the measles could be required to stay away from school for up to 3 weeks if they've come in contact with any of the 3 recently diagnosed measles patients.

The 1st case was confirmed [Wed 31 Aug 2016], and OPH and the Leeds, Grenville, and Lanark District Health Unit have since contacted 500 individuals who might have been exposed to the measles patients. All 3 cases involved children who were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated, and all 3 cases were related. As of Monday morning [5 Sep 2016], no further cases had been reported.

In Ontario, it's recommended that youngsters get 2 doses of the measles vaccine, the 1st soon after 1st first birthday, and a 2nd at between 4 and 6 years of age. Students in primary or secondary schools in the province are required by the Immunization of School Pupils Act to show proof of immunization from the measles and certain other diseases before they can attend school. Exemptions are permitted, though, for medical reasons or matters of conscience or religious belief.

The measles virus is typically spread through coughing and sneezing. It can cause ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, blindness, brain inflammation, and death. Early symptoms, which usually occur 10 or 12 days after infection, include fever, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Within 2 or 3 days of symptoms appearing, white spots may appear inside the mouth, followed by a red rash spreading from the face to the rest of the body.

The local vaccination rate among schoolchildren is 98.4 per cent. The last case of the measles reported in the area was in 2014.

According to Dr Carolyn Pim, associate medical officer of health at OPH, the virus can live in the air for up to 2 hours, which makes the process of tracking down people who might have been exposed difficult. She says there are 2 purposes for contacting these people. "One is to identify the people who may benefit from things that we can do to prevent them from personally getting infections. If it's very soon after they've been exposed, a measles vaccine can be effective in preventing them from getting an infection." Those at high risk, she notes, such as infants and people with weakened immune systems, may also benefit from an immune globulin IV to help boost their immune system. "The 2nd is to advise people to watch out for signs and symptoms of measles, so we can catch it very early if they do develop measles."

If parents are unsure of whether their children have been properly vaccinated, Pim recommends they contact their physician or call Ottawa Public Health.

The City of Ottawa provided a list of places, dates and times that individuals may have been exposed [see source URL above].

People who have not previously had the measles or have not been fully vaccinated and who might have been exposed in the listed areas are asked to watch for any signs and symptoms of the measles and avoid contact with individuals who are at high risk for complications of the measles (infants less than 12 months of age, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems) for 21 days after exposure date.

Anyone who thinks they or a family member has the measles is asked to call a health-care provider immediately. More information about the measles and immunizations can be found at http://ottawa.ca/en/residents/public-health or by calling the Ottawa Public Health information line at 613-580-6744 (TTY: 613-580-9656).

[This public health response is necessary with a communicable disease such as measles. It is helpful in control that before entering primary or secondary schools, the Immunization of School Pupils Act requires proof of immunization from the measles and certain other diseases before the child can attend school.

[2] Japan (Osaka): Kansai International Airport alert
Date: Sun 4 Sep 2016
Source: Tokyo Reporter [edited]

The Osaka Prefectural Government is working to contain an outbreak of measles at a management company at Kansai International Airport that began about 1 month ago, reports the Asahi Shimbun [3 Sep 2016).

A total of 31 employees of Kansai Airports have been confirmed to have the virus, which developed last month [August 2016] during the busy Obon [Festival of Souls, a Buddhist celebration] holiday period -- a time when the airport received roughly 60 000 passengers per day.

"Special attention at Kansai International Airport is needed since it is a major gateway for Japan," a government official is quoted.

In a statement issued on [31 Aug 2016], Kansai Airports said that it was working with the Izumi Sano Health Office in Osaka in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

"Kansai Airports notified its employees yesterday [3 Sep 2016] that if they are exhibiting symptoms they should not come to work," the company said in the statement. A special hotline set up by the company received more than 260 inquiries over a 2-day period.

On [19 Aug 2016], a hospital in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture confirmed a man, 19, who attended a performance by Justin Bieber at Makuhari Messe on [14 Aug 2016] had contracted measles. 4 members of the man's family have also been confirmed to have the virus.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the man used Kansai International Airport to travel overseas on [31 Jul 2016]. The man is believed to [have] exposed a female employee of Kansai Airports to the virus. She then spread it to 30 other persons within the company.

Another 2 persons using the airport that day are believed to have contracted measles via the man. As well, 2 persons at the Justin Bieber concert likely received the virus from the man.

By the morning of [31 Aug 2016], Kansai Airports had confirmed 16 employees had measles.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory system. It is spread by direct contact or airborne means, such as when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Common symptoms include a fever, cough and a skin rash.

Since the incubation period can reach 2 weeks, Kansai Airports warned recent users of the airport. "Customers who visited Kansai International Airport on or after [17 Aug 2016], and who may exhibit the symptoms outlined below are encouraged to seek medical attention," Kansai Airports said in the same statement. "We are providing information on the Kansai Airports website to help keep the spread of this infection to a minimum."

[This is a classic example of how rapidly measles can spread and highlights the importance of vaccination to protect the population.
