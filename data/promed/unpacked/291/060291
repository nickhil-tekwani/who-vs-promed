Bhutan is facing a major health concern with the rising cases of hepatitis B infection. Tucked in the eastern Himalayas, Bhutan, with a population of just over 650 000, is bordered to the west, south and east by India and in the north by China. Bhutan launched a hepatitis B vaccine [campaign] in 1997 after high prevalence of the disease came to light.

Last year [2011] alone, 744 hepatitis B cases were reported, Jigme Dorji Wangchuk, a doctor at the National Referral Hospital here, said. The higher rate of detection was due to the increasing number of testing centres. But Bhutan also has hepatitis A and C, the Bhutanese daily quoted Wangchuk as saying. Hepatitis B infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. The virus is spread through blood transfusion, unsafe sex or sharing of needles contaminated by the virus.

There is currently no government awareness campaign, but patients are provided free medical treatment, the health ministry's chief programme officer Tandin said last week. There is, however, less emphasis on hepatitis C, which is more serious. About 95 percent of patients lead a normal life with treatment, but the virus remains in the body.

Diseases like malaria, dengue and cholera are also widespread in the country.

[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences.

Hepatitis B is endemic in China and other parts of Asia, although, until recently, hepatitis B prevalence was considered to be low in Bhutan as a result of a study of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal (B.K. Shah et a., Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ). 2005 Jul-Sep;3(3):239-42). Until recently, the main route of hepatitis B virus transmission in the Bhutanese population was considered to be vertical, from mother to child, an important factor for the implementation of a correct anti-HBV vaccination strategy in Bhutan. (G. Da villa et al., Res Virol. 1997 Mar-Apr;148(2):115-7).

The IANS report above indicates that, currently, patients in Bhutan are provided free medical treatment for hepatitis B virus infection, but at present, there is no governmental awareness campaign. It is unclear what role vaccination plays in the current strategy.

The Kingdom of Bhutan is a landlocked state located at the eastern end of the Himalayas and bordered to the south, east and west by the Republic of India and to the north by the People's Republic of China. Bhutan is separated from Nepal to the west by the Indian state of Sikkim and from Bangladesh to the south by the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal.
