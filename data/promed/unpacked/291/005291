Mystery Disease Death Toll Now 24
---------------------------------
The death toll from a disease which hit Chesamisi High School in Bungoma
District a month ago has reached 24. Meanwhile, Kenya Medical Research
Institute (Kemri) said the disease was not malaria or typhoid as initially
thought, but leptospirosis.
The chief physician at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Dr
Sijenyi Nyabundi, said the disease was caused by a bacterium, and spread by
dogs, rats, donkeys, cattle, goats and sheep. He explained that people get
leptospirosis from water which has come in contact with urine from the animals.
Of the 4 students admitted to the hospital, 1 was referred to Kenyatta
National Hospital. 2 were still there, while the other had been
discharged. The students had been in isolation since they were admitted.
The Nation established that the nearby Mahonge Health Center had seen 902
cases by Tue, 15 Jun 2004.
During a fact-finding tour, Western Provincial Commissioner Hassan Noor
Hassan was told that at nearby Chesamisi Girls School, 32 students and 4
teachers were down with the disease, while at the Chesamisi Primary 435
pupils were absent, reportedly also sick. The primary school head teacher
said 2 of his pupils were among those who had died.
The school attendance was low. The Nation found less than 400 pupils, and
the normal school population is 1610.

[The symptom complex associated with the outbreak is not stated nor is the
method of disease diagnosis, which is usually serological. The infection
can be spread from direct contact with an infected animal but is usually
associated with a contaminated water exposure. The number of cases here
seems quite large and, if they indeed have occurred over a month and truly
are leptospirosis, is suggestive of an ongoing source of exposure.
The symptoms associated with the illness can range from none to
overwhelming infection with renal and hepatic failure (Weil's disease). It
is not generally transmissible from person to person, so isolation is not
needed.
Not much information is available regarding leptospirosis in East Africa,
and ProMED would appreciate any comments in this regard. - Mod.LL]
