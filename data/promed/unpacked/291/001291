TUBERCULOSIS, DEER - USA (MICHIGAN)

Two Michigan state commissions have proposed measures to prevent the spread
of bovine tuberculosis from white-tailed deer. Beginning 1 May, there would
be bans on feeding deer and on baiting deer outside the deer-hunting season
in all of 5 counties and parts of 6 others in the state's lower peninsula.

Almost 5 percent of deer killed during 1997 with a 600 square mile area of
four counties tested positive for tuberculosis. The testing was initiated
after one infected deer was found in 1994. The state's cattle industry, now
certified as TB-free, is anxiously awaiting the results of tests being done
on 4 herds.
Hunters think the bans are too severe; farmers think not enough is being
done. "There's plenty of bitter medicine to go around," said Bob Bender,
state TB coordinator.
