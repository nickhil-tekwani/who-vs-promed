[The information in the first two comments was received from
correspondents in response to the Moderators' comment that: "West Nile
virus in animals in Guadeloupe and Jamaica are the first reports of the
presence of the virus in these Caribbean islands. It is unclear whether
these are based on virus isolation or serological testing."]

Guadeloupe
----------
The reports of West Nile virus in animals in Guadeloupe are based on
serological testing of horses (seroconversion, and seroneutralisation test
to confirm West Nile virus specificity).

Jamaica
-------
Results of serological testing of native bird populations (endemic,
non-migratory) in Jamaica were the basis of evidence for local West Nile
virus transmission. (This work has been published in Emerg. Inf. Dis.
9(7): 860-863).

[Former moderator C.H. Calisher provided the information that the
aforementioned paper is entitled "Serologic Evidence of West Nile Virus
Transmission, Jamaica, West Indies (By Alan P. Dupuis II, Peter P. Marra,
and Laura D. Kramer). The summary reads as follows: "In spring 2002, an
intensive avian serosurvey was initiated in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and
Mexico. We collected >1600 specimens from resident and non-resident
neotropical migratory birds before their northerly migrations. Plaque
reduction neutralization test results indicated specific neutralizing
antibodies to West Nile virus in 11 resident species from Jamaica." The

The assistance of all three correspondents is greatly appreciated. - Mod.CP]

West Nile Virus Transmission in Resident Birds, Dominican Republic Komar O,
Robbins MB, Klenk K, Blitvich BJ, Marlenee NL, Burkhalter KL, et al.
Abstract
-------
We report West Nile virus (WNV) activity in the Dominican Republic for the
first time. Specific anti-WNV antibodies were detected in 5 (15 percent) of
33 resident birds sampled at one location in November 2002. One
seropositive bird was less than 4 months old, indicating a recent
infection. [The 5 birds were of 4 different species. The date of sample
collection suggests that local transmission was occurring from southbound
migrants. - Mod.JW]
