The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 30 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 598, of which 550 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 363 deaths (315 confirmed and 48 probable) and 204 people healed.
- 47 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Komanda and 1 in Mabalako.
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases (all community deaths): 1 in Mabalako and 1 in Komanda.

[No changes in news of the response / vaccination totals from 30 Dec; see below. - Mod.LK]

[Note that the deaths are community deaths, which is always problematic since others likely became infected during treatment outside of secure medical treatment centers. But now with suspension / slowdown of control efforts, it is even more problematic, as contacts are not being traced and vaccinated. This allows for further spread of the virus.

The number of new cases reported is likely an underestimate because of the suspension of control activities in the communities where the focus of activity lies. - Mod.LK]

Report from European Commission's directorate-general for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations

Democratic Republic of Congo - Ebola outbreak (DG ECHO) (ECHO Daily Flash of 30 Dec 2018)
--------------
As of 29 Dec there are 593 reported cases ([598 cases as of 31 Dec 2018. - Mod.LK]; 545 confirmed and 48 probable). Vaccination activities were stopped in Goma, Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Komanda following demonstrations. The response to the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak has been severely affected by the prevailing situation in Beni and Butembo. Contact tracing and vaccination activities have been particularly disturbed, but so have alerts notification and investigations and, in general, all community activities, including community deaths investigations and safe and dignified burials. In Beni, the transit centre is still not functional.

[3] Response
- Sat 29 Dec 2018. Press Release
[International Rescue Committee, abridged, edited]
https://www.rescue.org/press-release/election-related-violence-democratic-republic-congo-forces-irc-temporarily-suspend

- The International Rescue Committee (IRC) was forced to temporarily suspend its Ebola response and other programming in Beni and Butembo, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), after a delay in elections led to violent protests and attacks on aid workers working to combat the outbreak. IRC-supported facilities were damaged, destroyed, looted, and burned, and health staff working in these facilities are afraid to continue following proper response protocols. The situation has become too dangerous for IRC staff to continue its life-saving work.

Bob Kitchen, vice president of the emergency unit at the International Rescue Committee, said,
"IRC staff have been advised to stop working and hibernate in their homes. With almost 600 cases and more than 350 deaths, this outbreak is already the 2nd deadliest in history. A suspension of programming will allow the disease to spread unabated, likely reaching major cities and spreading across international borders, leading to a major international health catastrophe. Having been targeted themselves, staff in IRC-supported facilities are too scared to follow proper Ebola screening protocols. We are monitoring the situation daily and will be back to work as soon as it is safe to resume operations."

- Sat 29 Dec 2018. Congo-Kinshasa: Uganda On High Alert Over Ebola Spread in DR Congo Election Aftermath
[All Africa, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201812310350.html

Uganda has heightened Ebola surveillance and prevention preparedness amid fears that the general election in the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo could lead to a refugee influx. Government officials said such a refugee influx in the post-election period could trigger cross-border Ebola outbreaks in the neighbouring countries, especially Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

"Cognizant of the fact that there may be post-election unrest, we are increasing our capacity to screen more people," said the minister of health, Jane Ruth Aceng.

Dr Aceng said that the polls increase the likelihood of people moving together in groups, which in turn raises the probability of spreading the haemorrhagic fever.

Dr Aceng said that Uganda is investing in more thermometers and walk-through screens to hasten the screening process. Uganda currently has 24 screening points, including one at Entebbe Airport. The rest are located in 5 districts in the southwest.

Information from the World Health Organisation shows that 2.3 million people from the DRC entering Uganda had been screened by December 2018. The majority went through the land borders in western Uganda, while at Entebbe, only 74 200 people were screened.

Dr Yonas Tegegn, WHO representative in Uganda, said that even as the screening, surveillance, and preparation of isolation and treatment centres for Ebola are being done for all of the 9 neighbours of DRC, the highest emphasis is on the 3 in the east: Uganda, South Sudan, and Rwanda.

Uganda has so far vaccinated 2260 health workers in the 20 high-risk districts and 600 more Ebola vaccine doses are yet to be used. The high-risk districts include those at the border and refugee-hosting ones like Kamwenge, Kampala, and Wakiso.

With the government expecting 3000 more vaccine doses, the number of frontline health workers inoculated against Ebola will be close to 6000.

These efforts have cost Uganda, UGX 69.8 billion (about USD 19 million) since the outbreak was announced in August [2018].

In the event of even a single Ebola case crossing into Uganda, Dr Aceng says that the country will carry out a ring vaccination of people who might have had contact with the patient.

Dr Miriam Nanyunja, disease prevention and control advisor at the WHO, said that the case fatality rate for the ongoing DRC outbreak stands at 59%. This is quite high compared with other outbreaks like that in West Africa, which had a 40% case fatality rate, despite the fact that the vaccine was available midway.

According to data from WHO, in 2007, Uganda registered the lowest Ebola case fatality rate of 24%.

Dr Tegegn said that the outbreak has been hard to control because it is affecting areas occupied by the Allied Democratic Forces and Mai Mai militia, which block access to patients in their territories.

[The year-end [2018] finds the DRC Ebola outbreak with no real sign of ending. This is in spite of what appears to be an effective vaccine and 4 antiviral compounds in use. More than 50 000 individuals have been vaccinated. The main reason behind this disappointing situation is the violent unrest perpetuated by the local militia groups. It is not for lack of effort by the healthcare workers and all the volunteers battling this outbreak.

This outbreak also has a higher case fatality rate than previous outbreaks (59% compared with a 40% case fatality rate in the West African outbreak, for example), even with improved treatment facilities including Biosecure Emergency Care Units for Outbreaks (CUBE), which are certified P4 isolation units designed for the treatment of patients. The higher case fatality rate may be a consequence of the people's distrust of the government and healthcare workers, leading patients to seek treatment in community centers that are not properly equipped, rather than safe Ebola treatment centers. This also may also account for the high infection rate among healthcare workers who treat patients in the community centers. At least 54 healthcare workers have been infected, including 18 deaths.

The pullout of non-Congolese workers who fear for their lives is completely understandable. The omnipresent violence presents a greater threat than the virus. Taken together, it is an untenable situation.

With the New Year, we hope the situation will change. We are grateful for the tremendous dedication of all who have contributed to the control effort and hope their efforts will pay off. Surely they have made a difference even at this time. - Mod.LK
