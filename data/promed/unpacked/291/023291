Here's some more info. I asked him about asbestos exposure and this is his
reply. I've also posed the occupation question and will forward when
received.
Since his house is circa 1940-1950 era I suspect lead may have been in the
plaster, wall board and/or paint. Lead may well be a consideration. I've
asked him to check with his MD about lead testing.

Jim,
Yes, I was exposed to large amounts of asbestos (about 50 lbs) six months
prior to my symptoms when I removed it from my heating pipes in the
basement of my house. I wore an asbestos rated respirator and attempted to
clean up the dust on the floor as best as possible after removal. I do
remember getting some in my eyes occasionally. I took a shower immediately
afterward and wore long sleeves and long pants which were also washed
immediately afterward. The wallboard removed during the renovation was
fairly old (1940's or 50's) and had taped seems. I used an ordinary fiber
dust mask for the removal of the guano and wallboard.
For the last ten years I've been working in the finance industry with
emphasis on asset trading, software modeling and database management. I
spend about 10 hours a day at work on my computer.
No, I have not been tested for lead or asbestos poisoning. I've added those
to my list.

Histoplasmosis needs to be ruled out. It is not true to say that the CNS is
not invaded by _Histoplasma capsulatum_. Though CNS infection appears
uncommon in histoplasmosis, probably being found in less than 5% of severe
cases, it is by no means unknown. References to the condition can be found
in the monograph: J. Schwarz. 1981. Histoplasmosis. New York: Praeger.
In my view, it would be very much more likely for an immunocompetent person
to acquire histoplasmosis from bat guano than to acquire cryptococcosis.
Indeed, we see histoplasmosis cases with such exposure fairly regularly. As
far as I know, _Cryptococcus neoformans_ is not associated with bat guano.

I'd think of having leptospirosis checked out too - known to happen where
bat droppings and broken human skin or conjunctivas get together, I think.
Some of the symptoms seem to fit.
