Both Gifu and Aichi prefecture governments launched a council by stakeholders on 8 Mar 2019 to prevent the spread of classic swine fever [CSF]. Both prefectures established a general assembly meeting on the same day and announced plans for the oral vaccination spraying to wild boar. Gifu prefecture will be set up in 900 locations from [25 Mar 2019]; Aichi prefecture will be set up in 60 locations starting in late March [2019].

Gifu prefecture established the "Prefectural Oral Vaccine Countermeasure Council" made up of relevant city municipalities, hunting clubs, the prefectural pig farming association, and others. The oral vaccine will be sprayed 6 times in total until March next year [2020], and the effect will be verified. The scattering range covers about 120 sq km [46 sq mi] in 18 cities and towns, centered on the mountains in the southern part of the prefecture where infected wild boar is found. It is divided into 3 periods -- March to May [2019], July to September [2019], next January to March [2020] -- and sprayed twice each.

Sensor cameras will be used to check whether the bait has been eaten and, after random capture, if antibody is produced. The Prefectural Department of Agriculture, which is also a member of the council, said, "Since it is the 1st such operation in the country, there are uncertain points; we want the related organizations to implement the project cooperatively while firmly evaluating the effect." From 18 Mar [2019], the spreading will start; the baits include ingredients that will attract the boars to be immunized.

Aichi prefecture's "Swine Fever Infection Countermeasure Council" consists of the municipality to be sprayed, hunting clubs, Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), the prefectural pig farming association, JA Aichi central association, etc. About 80 sq km [about 31 sq mi] of the forests in Inuyama, Komaki, and Kasugai will be treated. The number of oral vaccine baits, 2400-3200, will be dispersed in 60 places and applied twice during each of the 3 stages, totalling 6 times until next February [2020].

Hiroyuki Okachi, manager of the Livestock Division of the Prefectural Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Department who took up the chairmanship of the council, said, "I do not have prefectural boundaries in wild boars, and I would like to work with Gifu prefecture tightly and work hard."

[The most widely applied concept of oral bait vaccination of wild boar against classical swine fever (CSF), including bait design and an immunisation scheme, was developed, evaluated, and optimised by Kaden and colleagues (ref 1). The respective vaccines are conventional MLVs (modified live virus). Immunisation occurs by uptake of the oral vaccine through the lymphoid tissues of the oral mucosa and tonsils, where expression of virus stimulates the immune system.

For the above and additional data on the manufacture, testing, and use of the oral CSF vaccine, see article 3.1, "Oral vaccine", in chapter 3.8.3, "Classical swine fever (hog cholera) (infection with classical swine fever virus)," of OIE's Terrestrial Manual (p. 19-20 of the chapter [p. 1569-70 of manual] at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.08.03_CSF.pdf).

Since the start of the CSF event in Japan, 3 Sep 2018, 208 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The epidemiological statistics, summarised as of Fri 8 Mar 2019, are as follows:

Total outbreaks = 208 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 48 744 / 218 / 34 / 48 710 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 212 / 63 / 149 / 0
