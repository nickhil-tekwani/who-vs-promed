Regarding the information in the article that the child was bitten or scratched 3 weeks prior to showing signs of illness and the moderator's comment: "However, in the present case, in view of the lapse of time between exposure and appearance of symptoms, it is unlikely that post-exposure prophylaxis could have been successful," this article is contradicted by advice from Queensland Health which states that the child was bitten "2 months ago ... prior to becoming ill 3 weeks ago" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-681ai3lhD4, as published by Queensland Health on 14 Feb 2013). This suggests a period of at least 5 weeks between contact and symptom development, which is longer than the time required to receive a course of post exposure treatment (between 21 and 28 days).

The CDC states that: "Rabies in humans is 100 percent preventable through prompt appropriate medical care." (http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/people.html). This is the basis for my understanding that people are very unlikely to become sick if they receive the post exposure immunoglobulin and vaccination within 48 hours of the contact. This advice suggests that, even if there had been only a 3 [week] incubation period, the child should have remained healthy had he been vaccinated following his exposure.

This death is a tragedy for the family and child. It is utterly miserable that his parents were never able to seek the appropriate care for their son.

[There appears to be uncertainty in this case about the lapse of time between exposure of the victim and the appearance of symptoms. Nonetheless, the general opinion is that in the case of exposure to classical rabies virus, where the interval between exposure and appearance of symptoms may be prolonged, treatment should still be considered even if the exposure occurred many months or years previously (e.g. see the HPA Green Book).

The 1st recognised human infection with Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) was in November 1996. The patient died from a rabies-like illness 20 days after 1st becoming unwell. In December 1998, the 2nd case, a 37-year-old Queensland woman, died from a rabies-like illness 27 months after being bitten by a flying fox (fruit bat). Neither of these patients received post-exposure prophylaxis, so at present, there is no precedent for the success of immediate post-exposure prophylaxis in the case of ABLV. Nonetheless, Storm Standford's comment is appropriate. - Mod.CP
