The number of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases in Florida has
risen to 68 for 2003, further substantiating an earlier suspicion
that 2003 will be a tough year for fighting the disease. Florida's
case count for all of 2002 was 25 horses.
EEE is caused by a virus found in wild birds, and it's transmitted to
horses and humans via the bite of an infected mosquito. Horses do not
develop high enough levels of the virus in their blood to be
contagious to other humans or animals.
Vaccination histories are unknown for at least 28 of the 68 cases,
and at least 29 had not been vaccinated for EEE within the past 6
months. 15 of the 68 horses were recovering when the cases were
logged; the other 53 horses died or were euthanized.
According to Bill Jeter, DVM, diagnostic veterinary manager for
Florida's Division of Animal Industry, "The 15 cases that were
reported were alive at the time the horses were seen by the
veterinarians, and if we do a follow up on these cases, I am sure
that some of them would not have survived, as the horses would have
died or have been euthanized 1 or 2 days later."
A 90 percent mortality rate is associated with EEE in Florida. The
counties hit hardest are in the north-central part of the state,
including: Alachua (5 cases), Bradford (4), Gilchrist (8), Levy (7),
Marion (8), Osceola (6), and Union (4).
Most of the cases have had April 2003 onset dates (28), closely
followed by March (24). 16 of the horses began showing clinical signs
of EEE in May.
"There are no new WNV cases, but we continue to receive EEE
positives. It (the EEE) doesn't seem to be slowing down at this
point," said Jeter.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus is endemic in North America
along the Eastern seaboard and Gulf coast. EEE virus is classified in
the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_, whereas West Nile
virus is classified in the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family
_Flaviviridae_. The former is transmitted to horses predominantly
from infected asymptomatic wild birds via _Aedes spp._ mosquitoes,
although other mosquitoes have been implicated in some outbreaks.
Although horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for
EEE virus, some horses develop viremia levels high enough to transmit
virus to any mosquitoes that may feed on them. The mechanism of
over-wintering of EEE virus is unknown. The case-fatality for EEE
virus is 50-90 percent in horses, hence the urgent admonition for
preventative vaccination.
There are vaccinations available for horses. Owners should be
encouraged to vaccinate their horses. The vaccine should be
administered in a series of 2 injections separated by 3 weeks. Other
protection such as mosquito repellant for horses should be used.
Although repellents are not a guarantee of protection, it will help
make the horse more comfortable. Vaccination and repellents would be
the best combination for protection from the virus.
People are also susceptible to EEE. As such, mosquito repellent and
long-sleeved shirts and long pants are also advisable. - Mod.TG]
