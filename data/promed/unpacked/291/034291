Bali's rabies epidemic continues to plague the island. According to Radar
Bali, a total of 93 people have died from suspected rabies spread from dog
bites, despite massive expenditures and efforts to inoculate pet dogs and
eliminate stray animals.

Ketut Teneng, the spokesman for the Bali provincial government, said that
93 people have died after suffering dog bites. Of that total, he said, 41
of those deaths were clinically linked to rabies through laboratory tests
on the victims. The remaining victims were buried without aid of laboratory
test but after exhibiting symptoms consistent with a rabies infection.

The number of new dog bites reported in Bali remains very high. On an
average day, 165 people are bitten by dogs in Bali, adding to widespread
fear among visitors and locals of the danger of contamination with a
potentially fatal disease. Teneng said the elimination of stray dogs must
continue, adding "this does not have to done by government officials who
kill the dogs, but also by the public who undertake the elimination of
stray animals." Saying the threat of infection is before "our very eyes,"
Teneng pointed to the high number of stray dogs living in Bali, resulting
in a greater risk of dog bites and possible infection with rabies. "We have
a clear choice; do you want to get rabies or not? If we allow the dog
population to grow, it means the chance of getting rabies is also high,"
said Teneng.

Teneng said that for the year 2010 through 2 Sep 2010, a total of 37 901
dog bites have been inflicted on Bali residents. From that total, 34 485
victims have been treated with rabies anti-serum. These figures show a
dramatic increase over 2009, when only 21 806 dog bites were reported, of
which 18 825 victims received anti-rabies serum.

According to the chief health officer for Bali, Dr Nyoman Sutedja, the
costs of fighting rabies in Bali is substantial. In 2009 the provincial
government of Bali spent Rp. 6.5 billion [USD 723 000], Bali regencies Rp.
3.5 billion [USD 389 000] and the central government contributed Rp. 15
billion [USD 1.7 million] to Bali's anti-rabies campaign resulting in total
expenditures of Rp. 25 billion [USD 2.7 million]. In 2010, the total spent
in combating rabies is expected to rise.

[The numbers of dog bites and human rabies deaths continue to be alarming.
Human fatalities during this 2-year rabies outbreak have risen from 76 on 6
Aug 2010 to the current 93 just a month later. It would be of interest to
know what proportion of the total population has been vaccinated. It would
also be of interest to know if the Rp 25 billion (USD 2.7 million) has gone
to dealing with the dog population, or if this includes post-exposure
treatment of people bitten by dogs as well.
