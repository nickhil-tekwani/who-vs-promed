[1] Japan: 2nd wave
Date: Fri 31 Jul 2020 7:00 PM EDT (updated 2 Aug 2020)

After initial success, Japan is facing a reality check on the coronavirus [COVID-19]. The country garnered global attention after containing the 1st wave of COVID-19 with what it referred to as the "Japan Model" -- limited testing and no lockdown, nor any legal means to force businesses to close. The country's finance minister even suggested a higher "cultural standard" helped contain the disease.

But now the island nation is facing a formidable resurgence, with Covid-19 cases hitting records nationwide day after day. Infections 1st concentrated in the capital have spread to other urban areas, while regions without cases for months have become new hotspots. And the patient demographic -- originally younger people less likely to fall seriously ill -- is expanding to the elderly, a concern given that Japan is home to the world's oldest population.

Experts say that Japan's focus on the economy may have been its undoing. As other countries in Asia, which experienced the coronavirus earlier than those in the West, wrestle with new flare ups of Covid-19, Japan now risks becoming a warning for what happens when a country moves too fast to normalize -- and doesn't adjust its strategy when the outbreak changes.

While Japan declared a state of emergency to contain the 1st wave of the virus, it didn't compel people to stay home or businesses to shut. That was ended in late May [2020] and officials quickly pivoted to a full reopening in an attempt to get the country's recessionary economy back on track. By June [2020], restaurants and bars were fully open while events like baseball and sumo-wrestling were back on -- a stark contrast to other places in the region like Singapore which were re-opening only in cautious phases.

Japan's haste may have been premature, say experts.

"This is the result of the government prioritizing economic activity by getting people to move around again over infection control," said Yoshihito Niki, a professor of infectious diseases at Showa University's School of Medicine.

Proper strategy
---------------
Countries throughout the Asia-Pacific are experiencing 2nd waves, many -- like Hong Kong, Australia and Vietnam -- after being standard bearers for virus containment the 1st time around. They're providing a window into the future for places just emerging from their 1st outbreaks, or continuing to battle through them, like the U.S.

A number of factors contributed to Japan's resurgence, according to public health experts. The state of emergency may have been lifted too early, before infections had sufficiently slowed. That also resulted in an ill-defined reopening plan -- leaving officials slow to take steps when new infection hotspots 1st emerged in nightclubs late in June [2020]. As cases increased, officials continued to talk down the dangers and insist they were mainly confined to nightlife spots

"The government should have had a proper strategy to contain the transmission as promptly as possible," said Kenji Shibuya, a professor at King's College London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization. "Both Hong Kong and Australia acted very quickly and are trying to contain it as fast as possible, with expanded testing and aggressive social distancing including local lockdowns. Japan is making things worse by just waiting and seeing."

Cases in Japan nationwide topped 1000 for 5 consecutive days as of Monday [3 Aug 2020], with the number of infections above 1500 on 2 of those days. During the previous peak in April [2020], daily cases maxed out at just over 700.

Second surge
------------
Although Japan understood earlier than many Western countries that the virus was more likely to spread through droplets in the air, and warned residents to avoid crowded, unventilated conditions, it wasn't enough to change individual behavior as the restrictions were lifted. While people have continued to wear masks throughout the pandemic, the current infections have largely occurred in situations where face coverings aren't typically worn, like group dining and drinking events. Japan's Covid-19 cases have topped 1000 for 5 days in a row.

Unlike New Zealand, Japan never spoke of eliminating the pathogen. Experts tried to encourage a "new way of living" and spoke of an era in which people lived with the virus. But the messaging from central and regional governments was mixed, with local officials in Tokyo warning against travel even as the national government encouraged it, and both sides bickering over who was to blame.

The national government continues to argue that the situation this time is different. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reiterated on Friday [31 Jul 2020] that another state of emergency isn't required. The death rate in Japan remains low by almost any standards, and the medical system isn't over-burdened -- a key factor public health officials use to judge success of virus containment. The country has fewer than 100 people in critical care due to Covid-19.

But treatment won't bring the current spread to a halt.

"Hospitals can treat the infected," said Koji Wada, a public health professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. "But only the government, through public health measures, can reduce the number of infected people."

When Shigeru Omi, the head of the current panel of experts advising the government, told officials to delay the domestic tourism push, he was ignored. The "Go To Travel" campaign then turned into a public relations nightmare, as Japan's rural residents grew angry over the potential of infections being brought to the countryside by city-dwellers. Eventually, Tokyo was excluded from the campaign in a last-minute about-face.

What impact the tourism campaign had on spreading the virus won't be known for weeks. Experts are now more concerned over the upcoming traditional Obon holiday period in mid-August, when many young Japanese return home to pay respect to the dead and spend time with often-elderly relatives.

In a sign that the situation can no longer be ignored, local officials are starting to backtrack on economic re-opening. Osaka has asked people to refrain from dining in groups of 5 or more. In Tokyo, restaurants, bars and karaoke shops have been asked to shorten operating hours. Governor Yuriko Koike has threatened to declare another state of emergency for the capital. Okinawa has already done so.

- 14:20 GMT -- Oman
Oman will on Saturday [8 Aug 2020] lift a domestic ban on travel between provinces, imposed on [25 Jul 2020] to prevent the spread of the coronavirus during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, the state news agency ONA has said. From Saturday [8 Aug 2020] it will also reduce its curfew for a week to between 9 pm and 5 am (1700-0100 GMT), instead of 7 pm to 6 am (1500 to 0200 GMT). A full lockdown of the Dhofar province in the south will be maintained until further notice. Oman, a country of 4.7 million people, has recorded almost 80 000 coronavirus infections and 421 deaths.

- 12:45 GMT -- Scotland
Scotland imposed new restrictions on the northeastern city of Aberdeen to tackle an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, ordering pubs to close and visitors to stay away. "We are at a stage of this pandemic where extreme caution is necessary, and also in my view, sensible," First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said at a news conference.

- 11:45 GMT -- Viet Nam
Viet Nam's health ministry on [Wed 5 Aug 2020] reported an additional 41 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country's total to 713 infections, including 8 deaths. Of the new cases, 40 are linked to Danang, the new coronavirus epicentre where Viet Nam on [25 Jul 2020] detected its 1st locally transmitted infections in more than 3 months. There were 2 other cases reported earlier in the day. There have been 264 cases since the virus resurfaced in Danang, which include all 8 of the country's COVID-19 deaths. Infections have since been found in at least 10 locations in Vietnam.

- 11:15 GMT-- Afghanistan
Nearly 1/3 of Afghanistan's population -- or 10 million people -- have been infected with the coronavirus, according to health ministry estimates published on [Wed 5 Aug 2020]. The figure comes from a survey based on antibody tests on nearly 9500 people across the country, with technical support from the World Health Organization, Health Minister Ahmad Jawad Osmani said at a press briefing. The virus entered Afghanistan in February [2020] as thousands of migrants returned from neighbouring Iran, which at the time was the region's worst-hit nation. The survey estimated that 31.5% of the population had contracted the virus, with the highest infection rate in Kabul where more than half of the city's 5 million population were thought to have been infected. But the country of about 32 million people has a limited testing capacity and has officially declared just 36 000 cases and more than 1200 deaths. "A 2nd wave of the infection is happening everywhere in the world and we cannot be an exception. We will use the findings of this survey to better prepare ourselves for a possible 2nd wave," Osmani said.

-10:30 GMT -- Hong Kong
Hong Kong reported 85 new coronavirus cases on [Wed 5 Aug 2020], including 3 locally transmitted ones, as authorities battle to control a 3rd wave of the outbreak which has seen a resurgence in infections over the past month. Since late January [2020], about 3700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 42 of whom have died. Wednesday's [5 Aug 2020] figure was up marginally from Tuesday's [4 Aug 2020] 80 cases [Kin Cheung/AP]

- 10:00 GMT -- Indonesia
Indonesia recorded 1815 new coronavirus infections on [Wed 5 Aug 2020], bringing the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 116 871, data by the country's health ministry showed. There were 64 additional deaths, taking the overall number of fatalities to 5452, the data showed. Indonesia's economy contracted in the 2nd quarter for the 1st time in more than 20 years as it was slammed by coronavirus restrictions, with warnings that the recovery could be among the weakest in Southeast Asia. Output in the region's biggest economy slumped 5.3% on-year in April-June [2020], the statistics agency said.

- 09:45 GMT -- Russia
Russia reported 5204 new cases of the novel coronavirus on [Wed 5 Aug 2020], bringing its nationwide tally to 866 627, the 4th-largest caseload in the world. Russia's coronavirus task force said 139 people had died over the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 14 490.

- 09:15 GMT -- Philippines
The Philippine health ministry reported 3462 new coronavirus infections and 9 additional deaths. In a bulletin, the ministry said total infections had risen to 115 980, putting the tally just behind Indonesia's 116 871 cases, which is the highest in East Asia. Coronavirus deaths in the Philippines have reached 2123.

- 08:45 GMT -- South Africa
Some 24 000 health workers in South Africa have contracted the coronavirus, 181 of whom have died, since the pandemic hit the country in March [2020], the health minister announced on [Wed 5 Aug 2020]. South Africa is the hardest-hit country in Africa, with at least 521 318 infections diagnosed so far, accounting for more than half of the continent's cases. Health Minister Zweli Mkwize told a news conference that the numbers of health workers who tested positive for coronavirus stood at 24 104 (about 5% of South Africa's total caseload), including 181 deaths.

- 08:05 GMT -- Japan
Japanese drugstores were stripped bare of gargling solution by [Wed 5 Aug 2020], a day after the governor of the western prefecture of Osaka suggested it could help fight coronavirus, triggering panic buying reminiscent of the early days of mask shortage. Hundreds of thousands of people posted pictures of emptied shelves on Twitter, accompanied by handwritten "Out of Stock" notices, as they canvassed suggestions on how to acquire the coveted antiseptic. On [Tue 4 Aug 2020], Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said a study showed a smaller viral load in the saliva of 41 patients with mild symptoms after regular gargling with a medicine infused with a povidone-iodine solution than in those who had not.

- 06:35 GMT -- Ukraine
Ukraine reported a record daily high of 1271 new coronavirus cases on [Tue 4 Aug 2020], the country's council of security and defence said on [Wed 5 Aug 2020]. The number of new infections has increased sharply in the past 2 months following the gradual lifting of restrictions that began in late May [2020]. The total number of cases rose to 75 490, including 1788 deaths and 41 527 recovered as of [5 Aug 2020].

- 05:50 GMT -- Czech Republic
The Czech Republic reported on [Wed 5 Aug 2020] its biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases since the end of June [2020] as a recent uptick in infections stays elevated. The central European country of 10.7 million recorded 290 new cases on [Tue 4 Aug 2020], Health Ministry data showed, bringing the total number of cases detected to 17 286. Of those, 11 812 have recovered and 383 have died of the COVID-19 illness.

- 04:50 -- Global coronavirus deaths
The global death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 700 000 on [Wed 5 Aug 2020], according to the Johns Hopkins University and Reuters tallies, with the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico leading the rise in fatalities. Nearly 59 00 people are dying every 24 hours from COVID-19 on average, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the past 2 weeks. That equates to 247 people per hour, or one person every 15 seconds. The United States and Latin America have been the epicentres of the pandemic and both are struggling to curb the spread of the virus.

- 03:45 GMT -- Latin America
Latin America has surpassed Europe to become the region with the highest coronavirus death toll worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The region has now recorded more than 206 000 deaths, approximately 30% of the global total. Brazil, the Latin American country most affected by the novel coronavirus, has now recorded a total of 95 819 deaths as of [Tue 4 Aug 2020]. Mexico, the 2nd-most affected country in the region, has recorded 48 869 deaths. The spread of the pandemic has also accelerated in Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia.

- 03:09 GMT -- Australia
Australia's 2nd-most populous state of Victoria has reported its deadliest day of the coronavirus outbreak with 15 deaths in the last 24 hours and a record daily rise in infections. The state reported 725 new cases compared with 439 a day earlier. It recorded its previous one-day high of 723 cases and 13 deaths last week.

- 01:39 GMT -- Queensland shuts state border
Australia's Queensland state will close its border with New South Wales (NSW) state to hold back a 2nd wave of COVID-19 infections. A surge in coronavirus cases in Melbourne, the country's 2nd-largest city, has forced the state of Victoria to impose a night curfew, tighten restrictions on people's movements and order most businesses to stop trading from [Wed 5 Aug 2020] night. Other states are imposing new restrictions of their own to prevent any spillover from Victoria and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who has already shut her northeastern state's border to Victorians, said travellers from NSW and the capital Canberra also would be barred from [Sat 8 Aug 2020]. "We have seen that Victoria is not getting better, and we're not going to wait for New South Wales to get worse. We need to act," Palaszczuk said at a news conference in Brisbane.

- 02:08 GMT -- USA
A bipartisan group of state attorneys general has urged the US government to allow other companies to make Gilead Sciences' COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug. The coalition of more than 30 state attorneys general called on the government to act or allow states to do so, saying in a letter to US health agencies that Gilead "has not established a reasonable price" for remdesivir. "Gilead should not profit from the pandemic and it should be pushed to do more to help more people," the letter said. The drugmaker is charging most US patients USD 3120 per course, or USD 520 per vial of remdesivir. Gilead said in a statement that the AGs were misrepresenting facts about access to remdesivir and that the regulatory actions proposed are unauthorised under these circumstances and would do nothing to speed up access. The medicine is one of only 2 that have demonstrated an ability to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials.

Vaccine updates
---------------
- 12:05 GMT -- German-Chinese coronavirus vaccine trial begins in China
Clinical trials on humans have begun in China for a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by German pharmaceutical group BioNTech with Chinese company Fosun Pharma, the companies said. A total of 72 participants have already received their 1st dose following approval for the phase one trial from Chinese regulatory authorities, BioNTech and Fosun Pharma said in a statement. The vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b1, is one of 4 based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology. Another, BNT162b2, is being evaluated in a global phase 3 trial conducted by BioNTech and US giant Pfizer which started on [27 Jul 2020]. The phase one trial in China involves 144 participants who will receive 2 doses 21 days apart. Those aged 18-55 will be the 1st to take part, followed by older people.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 5 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO Regional Director for the Americas, Dr. Carissa Etienne, has warned of disruptions to regular health services due to COVID-19. Health workers have been redirected to care for COVID-19 patients, people are hesitating to seek routine care due to fears of infection, and global supply chains of medicines and equipment are strained.
- This week, the world celebrates Breastfeeding Awareness Week to highlight the importance of breastfeeding. WHO recommendations on the initiation and continued breastfeeding of infants and young children also apply to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.As WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros mentioned in yesterday's [Tue 4 Aug 2020] press briefing, 'the many, many benefits of breastfeeding for newborn babies and children substantially outweigh the potential risks for COVID-19 infection.'
- The WHO Regional Office for Europe has released an article on Marko Obradovic, a paediatric nurse in Serbia, who describes the challenges and importance of encouraging breastfeeding.
- WHO has been supporting Suriname to address the COVID-19 pandemic and has assisted in strengthening Suriname's health system and through the Universal Health Coverage Partnership, with the goal of helping the country achieve universal health coverage.
- Today [Wed 5 Aug 2020] we include 2 reports in the 'Subject in Focus' below. The 1st discusses a recently released WHO brief on estimating mortality from COVID-19, an extremely useful indicator of the burden of disease that helps guide policy decisions. The 2nd provides a summary of the age and sex distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases from the WHO COVID-19 global surveillance database from January to July 2020.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 48.4% of the global newly reported cases and 50.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.7 million cases. The USA reported 49.1% of cases (49 151), followed by Brazil 16.6% (16 641), Colombia 10.2% (10 199), Argentina 4.8% (4824), Mexico 4.7% (4767), Peru 4.2% (4250), and Chile 1.5% (1469).

- The European region reported 10.5% of the global newly reported cases and 9.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 24.1% (5204) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Israel 8.3% (1804), Ukraine 5.8% (1271), Romania 5.6% (1232), Spain 5.4% (1178), Turkey 5.0% (1083), Kazakhstan 4.9% (1062), France 4.5% (965), Germany 3.4% (741), and the UK 3.1% (670).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.3% of the global newly reported cases and 7.7% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 26.0 % (2836) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 25.2% (2751), Saudi Arabia 12.3% (1342), Morocco 9.4% (1021), Pakistan 6.2% (675), Palestinian Authority 5.5% (604), Kuwait 4.4% (475), Bahrain 2.7% (297), and Oman 0% (0). Oman did not report any cases in the past 96 hours. Cases are increasing in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 4.3% of the global newly reported cases and 11.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 50.2% (4456) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 8.9% (798), Kenya 6.8% (605), Ethiopia 6.6% (586), Algeria 5.9% (532), Nigeria 3.4% (304), Madagascar 2.6 % (235), and Cameroon 0% (0). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past few days.
- The Western Pacific region reported 4.1% of the global newly reported cases and 0.68% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 74.5% (6263) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 15.1% (1271), Australia 4.8% (411), Singapore 3.5% (295), China 1.3% (109), Viet Nam 0.24% (20), and South Korea 0.39% (33). Japan and Australia continue an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 27.5% of the global newly reported cases and 19.4% of global deaths. India reported 92.5% (52 509) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Indonesia 3.4% (1922), and Bangladesh 3.4% (1918). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (4 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 5.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with the highest global daily case count today [5 Aug 2020] above 56 000.

In the past 24 hours, India reported 56 626 cases followed by the USA (55 148) and Brazil (54 685). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.5%). There were 6838 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, and Spain all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2953 to 56 626. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Iran, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Israel, Indonesia, Bolivia, Chile, France, and Romania, and their range of reported new cases is 1309 to 2834.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 0.34%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 7.0%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases, albeit I wonder if this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [2][E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has increased from 9% to 10%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.) The most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
