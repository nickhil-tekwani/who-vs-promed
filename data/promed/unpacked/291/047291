We appreciate Jan Clement's interest in our paper and his history of hantavirus biology and ecology. Indeed, we agree with many of his points. Nonetheless, it appears that he has misread our text. We did not write that Seoul virus has "probably been introduced recently in NYC", and consequently may "represent a potential risk to human health in the city. We wrote, "If this virus has only recently been introduced into the NYC rat population, it may represent a potential risk to human health in the city." We also wrote, "Seoul virus may have been present in NYC prior to the recent introduction identified here and undergone local extinction and reintroduction. Alternatively, SEOV may exist in multiple small, focal rat populations throughout NYC, of which we have sampled only one. Because the prevalence of rat or human antibody to SEOV has not been assessed in NYC and human infection may be asymptomatic or cause very mild disease, we are currently unable to distinguish between these hypotheses."

We also note (and reference) that Seoul virus has been serologically detected in both rats and people in other US cities, including Baltimore [Maryland] and Los Angeles [California]. Although only a few cases of HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] have been identified in the US, we agree that human infection has also been associated with more mild forms of disease, including hypertensive renal disease. However, work by others has also demonstrated that Seoul virus is not ubiquitous in urban Norway rats throughout North America, which suggests that its distribution is patchy and may be a result of multiple introductions, or local extinction/colonization events. We found Seoul-Baxter in only 8/133 rats from 1/5 sites. All 8 viruses were more than 99.9 per cent identical to each other and more similar to each other than any of the "British" clade of viruses were to other members of the clade. This does not suggest a long history of circulation in NYC. More widespread sampling of rats and human serosurveys will be needed to understand the epidemiology of Seoul in NYC. Similarly, additional sequence data from other North American Seoul viruses will help to put NYC into the continental context.

We thank Professor Clements for his interest in our paper and look forward to any suggestions he might have concerning how to continue the work.

[ProMED regrets the delay in posting this report and any inconvenience it may have caused. ProMED also thanks Cadhia Firth and W. Ian Lipkin for their comments clarifying their findings concerning Seoul virus presence in New York City. One hopes that the additional sampling that they mentioned will occur. If so, ProMED awaits the results with interest.
