Two [young] sisters have died of an undiagnosed disease at a hospital in Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district, officials said [on Sat 15 Dec 2018]. The news of the girls' deaths put the district administration on alert, prompting the authorities to constitute a special medical team to ascertain the cause of the deaths.

The deceased were identified as [an 8 year old and her 5 year old sister]. They [died on Fri 14 Dec 2018] at Reasi District Hospital within 2 hours of being brought there by their father from far-flung Danour village in Arnas area, officials said. The bodies of the girls were handed over to [their father] for last rites after a team of doctors conducted the post-mortem on [Sat 15 Dec 2018].

Superintendent of the hospital Pritam Singh said it was premature to say anything about the disease, which led to the deaths. "The post-mortem report is awaited and only after getting it can we say anything about the cause of their death," he said.

[The father] said his daughters fell sick a few days ago, at the time the family believed it was a case of throat infection. "When their condition deteriorated, I took them to a local dispensary. There we were referred to Reasi District Hospital. However, my girls could not be saved," he said.

Reasi district development commissioner Sagar Dattatray Doifode said he had ordered setting up of a special medical team to look into the deaths of the 2 minors. "The medical team visited Danour village on [Sat 15 Dec 2018] and conducted an inspection among the people for symptoms of diphtheria, but nothing of the sort was found," he told PTI. As the autopsy report was yet to be prepared, the officer said the medical team was carrying out a preventive vaccination drive for various life-threatening diseases among the children in the village and adjoining areas.

[We are given little information in the news report above about the clinical manifestations of the rapidly fatal illness in 2 sisters, 8 and 5 years of age, in Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district, India, except that they were believed to have a "throat infection" 2 days before their deaths. We are told that the local medical team suspects diphtheria, which seems a likely possibility.

Diphtheria is caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram positive bacillus. _C. diphtheriae_ causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils, where an adherent pseudomembrane forms, which may result in respiratory obstruction. The toxin is responsible for the major complications -- myocarditis (such as, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as, paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). The overall case fatality rate for diphtheria is 5%-10%, but is higher (up to 20%) among persons younger than 5 and older than 40 years of age.

Close contacts, especially household contacts, should receive a diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, and antibiotics, such as benzathine penicillin G or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin.

More information from knowledgeable sources about these cases would be appreciated.

Jammu and Kashmir is a state in northern India, located mostly in the Himalayan mountains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir). Reasi district is one of 22 districts in Jammu and Kashmir (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasi_district).
