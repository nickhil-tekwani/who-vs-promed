The number of dengue fever cases reported in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean has exceeded the one million case mark, according to new data released by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) today [2 Sep 2014].

The total number of cases stands at 1 060 441 suspected and confirmed cases. Brazil again leads all countries with nearly 700 000 cases, or 65 per cent of all cases in the Western hemisphere. This should come as no surprise as the largest country in South America reported more than 1.4 million cases alone in 2013 (there were 2.3 million cases total in all the Americas).

The country recording the 2nd most cases was Colombia, which tallied some 95 000 dengue fever cases to date.

There were 431 fatalities associated with dengue this year [2014] to date, with Brazil accounting for 261 of them.

The United States has laboratory confirmed and reported 172 cases so far with 99 per cent of the cases classified as imported.

There are 4 serotypes called DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. All serotypes have been isolated in the Americas. In several countries they circulate simultaneously, creating a serious risk for an epidemic.

[2] Japan case details
Date: Thu 4 Sep 2014
From: Masayuki Ota <myuki.ota@gmail.com> [edited]


A total of 9 patients with domestic dengue fever presented to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, between 26 Aug and 2 Sep 2014.

Common complaints included fever, headache, myalgia, and fatigue. The median onset date of the fever was 25 Aug (range: 18 Aug-1 Sep [2014]). The median age was 34 years (range: 16-52 years), and 5 (56 per cent) patients were male. None of the patients had an immunocompromised state.

In all patients, there was no history of travel to foreign countries outside Japan within the past 3 years, except for one patient who traveled to Hawaii around 5 months ago. However, all patients had recently visited Yoyogi Park, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, or its vicinity. 8 (89 per cent) patients had visited the park regularly (3-7 days per week), and 1 patient had visited the park only on 16 Aug 2014.

Upon initial presentation, blood examinations revealed thrombocytopenia (60 000-144 103 cells per microlitre) in 8 (89 per cent) of patients, and leukopenia (1190-3100 cells per microlitre) in 6 (67 per cent) of patients [divide these figures by 1000 for cells per nanolitre. - Mod.SH]. So far, DENV type 1 has been detected in the serum of 6 patients using real-time RT-PCR, which was performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan.

4 patients defervesced by 2 Sep [2014]. The range of fever clearance time was 7-10 days; none of the patients developed severe dengue. 5 patients still have fever, with their fever duration ranging 2-9 days.
