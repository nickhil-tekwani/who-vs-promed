Santa Catarina has another confirmed case [the 2nd] of yellow fever [YF] in humans. The information was confirmed by the secretary of state for health (SES) this Mon 3 Feb 2020. The patient is admitted to the Nereu Ramos Hospital, in Florianopolis, a reference infectious disease unit in Santa Catarina.

The diagnosis of the disease [as yellow fever] was confirmed by the Central Laboratory of Public Health (LACEN/SC)on Sunday [2 Feb 2020]. The 40 year old man, resident of Jaragua do Sul, in Planalto Norte of Santa Catarina, was not registered for the [YF] vaccination in the Information System of the National Program of Immunizations (SIPNI).

This is the 2nd case of human infection in the state and the 4th since 2019, when there was the 1st diagnosis in the state. Last year [2019], SC registered 2 deaths on account of the disease.

The 1st case of 2020:
The patient whose diagnosis was confirmed on 24 Jan [2020] remains hospitalized at Nereu Ramos Hospital, in Florianopolis. He is 47 years old and is a resident of the municipality of Sao Bento do Sul, also in Planalto Norte, and with no vaccine registration in the system.

Transmission:
Yellow fever is a serious disease, transmitted by mosquitoes in wildland areas and close to forests. Vaccination is the best way to protect oneself from the disease. The dose is free. To date, the state's vaccination coverage is 84%, below what the Ministry of Health recommends, which is to vaccinate at least 95% of the target population.

Symptoms:
Yellow fever is a rapidly progressive disease. The infection results in the following symptoms:
- fever of up to 6 days duration;
- intense headache;
- abdominal pain;
- hemorrhagic manifestations;
- jaundice.

Monkey deaths:
On Mon 3 Feb 2020, SES also confirmed 2 more monkeys dead of yellow fever. The howlers were located in Corupa on 26 Dec 2019 and in Blumenau on 7 Jan of this year [2020].

In total, 9 monkeys dead of yellow fever were counted in 2019 (in Garuva, Joinville, Indaial, Jaragua do Sul, Sao Bento do Sul, and Corupa) and the 2 animals diagnosed with the disease in 2020 (Blumenau e Pomerode).

[The 2 human cases this year (2020) are due to YF virus spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. The dead monkeys indicate that the virus has been circulating in the state for over a year. It is important that the human population YF vaccination coverage reach the 95% goal set by the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is the only way to avoid these sylvan cases, since elimination of the forest YF virus transmission cycle is not feasible. - Mod.TY
