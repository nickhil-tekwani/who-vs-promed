First Report of the Potato Cyst Nematode (_Globodera pallida_) in the Czech
Republic.
----------------------------------
M. Zouhar, and P. Rysanek, Department of Plant Protection, Czech University
of Agriculture, 165 21 Prague, Czech Republic; and V. Gaar, State
Phytosanitary Administration, Department of Diagnostics, 160 00 Prague,
Czech Republic. Plant Dis. 87:98, 2003; published on-line as
D-2002-1107-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 15 Oct 2002.
Potato cyst nematode, _Globodera pallida_, [Gp] was detected in several
soil samples collected from various areas of the Czech Republic. _G.
rostochiensis_ [Gr] pathotype Ro1 is known to be widespread in the Czech
Republic. Gp was reported from the neighboring countries of Austria,
Germany, and Poland, and also was suspected to be present in the Czech
Republic, but it has never been unambiguously proved (1).
Recently, nematode isolates have been recovered from soil that multiply
readily on Ro1- resistant potato cultivars. These isolates were identified
on the basis of 3 tests: (i) microscopic observations of cyst vulval area
morphology and stylets of second-stage larvae; (ii) ELISA using a
commercial kit; and (iii) a PCR method (2). A complete series of Gp and Gr
pathotypes from Scotland and Germany served as controls.
Results were identical for all 3 methods used. 1 sample contained Gp only,
5 samples contained mixtures of Gr and Gp, and 1 sample contained Gr only.
The origin of Gp contamination is unknown. Strict quarantine measures have
been taken to prevent Gp from spreading into neighboring areas.
To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the occurrence of Gp in the
Czech Republic.

[Potato cyst nematodes were first recorded in Germany in 1913 and are now
widely distributed throughout Europe. Recent crop loss data for England and
Wales indicate losses of about 9 percent with an estimated GBP 43 million
(nearly USD 69 million). Disease management involves use of long crop
rotations (at least 6 years) between potato crops, applications of
nematicides containing 1,3-dichloropropene) and planting of resistant and
tolerant potato cultivars. A major consequence of planting resistant and
tolerant cultivars is the increase of Gp.
