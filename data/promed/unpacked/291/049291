Health Department confirms 1st case of human rabies after 44 years in DF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Department of the Federal District (SES-DF) confirmed, this Tuesday (5 Jul 2022), the 2nd case of human rabies in the history of the DF. Until then, according to the ministry, the only notification in the capital had been in 1978.

Because of the case, the SES-DF decided to bring forward the start of the rabies vaccination campaign, starting next Wednesday (6 Jul 2022). The folder should disclose more information about vaccination sites on Tuesday afternoon (5 Jul 2022).

Rabies is a zoonotic disease -- which passes from animals to humans and vice versa -- transmitted by a deadly virus involving the central nervous system, leading to death after a short evolution. The transmission of the disease occurs when the rabies virus existing in the saliva of the infected animal penetrates the body through the skin or mucous membranes, through a bite, scratch or lick.

Disease symptoms
----------------
In humans, the symptoms are characteristic transformation, restlessness, sleep disturbance, dark dreams; changes in (light) sensitivity, burning, tingling and pain appear at the bite site; these changes last 2 to 4 days. Subsequently, a picture of hallucinations emerges, accompanied by fever; the period of disease state begins, for 2 to 3 days, with fear of air and water currents, of varying intensity. Periodic seizures appear.

In animals, there is difficulty in swallowing, profuse salivation, change in behavior, change in eating habits, paralysis of the hind legs. In dogs, the barking becomes different from normal, resembling a "hoarse howl", and bats, with the change of habit, can be found during the day, at unusual times and places. According to SES-DF, the last diagnosed case of rabies in dogs was in 2000 and, in cats, in 2001.

How to prevent
--------------
- take domestic animals to be vaccinated against rabies annually;
- always seek the Health Service in case of aggression by animals;
- keep your animal under observation if it attacks someone;
- do not let the animal loose on the street and use a collar/lead on the dog when going out.

How to collaborate with Health Services on rabies control measures:
- notify the existence of stray animals in the vicinity of your home;
- report the abnormal behavior of animals, whether they are aggressors or not;
- report the existence of bats of any species;
- arrange for the delivery of animals for collection of material for laboratory examinations, in cases of death of animals with suspected rabies or from an unknown cause.

[2] Utah (Washington, Salt Lake and Weber Counties): bats, dogs, human exposure

Three bats infected with rabies, humans and dogs exposed to the disease in Utah
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah health officials on Thursday [30 Jun 2022] confirmed 3 cases of rabies in bats that exposed humans and dogs to the disease.

"The humans received preventive vaccines, and the dogs received boosters and a 45-day home quarantine because they were up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations," the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

The bats were found in Washington County, Salt Lake County, and Weber County, according to Hannah Rettler, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.

"The location really doesn't matter," spokeswoman Charla Haley said. "There is a risk when being around any wild animals regardless of location."

Health officials noted a bite or scratch from an infected mammal can transmit rabies. Exposure through bats is the leading cause of human death due to rabies in Utah. The state averages about 15 rabid animals reported every year, according to the statement.

In 2021, 5 people in the U.S. died from rabies, the department said.

If an unvaccinated pet is exposed to rabies, officials said they either need to be kept in professional isolation for 4 months or euthanized.

"Keeping your pet current on its rabies vaccines is the most important and affordable way to protect you and your pet from rabies," the department said.

Bat's teeth and claws are so small a bite or scratch "may not be seen or even felt by the injured person," according to the statement. Symptoms of rabies may not appear for weeks to months after exposure. All exposures should be reported, officials said.

Rabies symptoms begin similar to the flu, then include anxiety, confusion, abnormal behavior and delirium. Officials noted once those symptoms begin, the disease is typically fatal in humans.

"If you find yourself near a bat, dead or alive, do not touch, hit, or destroy it and do not try to remove it yourself," said Rettler.

Those who find a bat should contact their local animal control office or the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to collect the animal for rabies testing.

Signs of rabies in pets include changes in normal behavior, aggression, attacking without reason, foaming at the mouth, lack of interest in food or water, staggering or paralysis. [Other signs may include a sudden and uncharacteristic shyness, or being withdrawn from normal behavior or routine. - Mod.TG]

"Infected wild animals may also act uncharacteristically tame or unafraid of humans. Infected bats may be seen flying around during the daytime, resting on the ground, or may show no noticeable signs at all," officials said.

More information about how to protect yourself and your pets from rabies can be found at epi.health.utah.gov/rabies.

Collin County health department warns of possible rabies exposure at community pool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Collin County, Texas, are warning residents about a possible exposure to rabies at a community pool on Friday [1 Jul 2022].

Collin County Health Services said the possible exposure happened at the Heritage Celina Homeowner's Association community pool on Stanford Lane.

According to the health department, a bat was seen in and around the pool on Friday afternoon [1 Jul 2022].

The department said the bat may have rabies due to its reported behavior. The bat has not yet been located.

The county health department is now asking anyone who may have had physical contact with the bat to call the department's epidemiology program as soon as possible.

The department's number during regular business hours is 972-548-4707. However, if they need to be reached this weekend -- Friday through Monday [1 to 4 Jul 2022] -- residents should call the Collin County sheriff's dispatch at 972-547-5350 and ask for the epidemiologist on call.

Parents should ask their children if they had contact with the bat, the department said.

Collin County Health Services said rabies can be transmitted to humans through an infected animal's saliva. Rabies is preventable if treated before symptoms arise, the department said.

Rabid fox bites man in NC -- the 3rd attack in this county in weeks, officials say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A man was bitten by a fox which later tested positive for rabies, making him the 3rd victim of a rabid fox attack in the same North Carolina county in less than a month, officials said. The fox bit the man just before 6 a.m. on [3 Jul 2022] in Ash, according to a bite report from the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office. The animal was euthanized and tested positive for rabies on [6 Jul 2022]. Ash is about 140 miles [225 km] south of Raleigh. The man, [SG], was visiting his parents when he encountered the animal, he told WECT. "At the time, I didn't know what it was," he told the outlet. "I thought it was a cat, you know, at first, but it latched on to me and was not going to let go until I ripped it from my body." A rabid fox attacked 2 people in separate incidents in Brunswick County in late June [2022]. The animal was captured and euthanized, and both the bite victims received rabies vaccinations.

A rabid fox bit another person in May [2022], according to the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office. "All mammals are susceptible to rabies," but in North Carolina, the disease is most often found in skunks, raccoons, bats and foxes, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services.

[5] Massachusetts: coyote, human exposure

Coyote bites woman in parking lot of restaurant in Swampscott, Massachusetts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Texas woman who is visiting family in Massachusetts is undergoing rabies treatment after she was bitten by a coyote in the parking lot of a restaurant in Swampscott.

[KE] said she was leaving Bertucci's at the Swampscott Mall on Paradise Road with her sister, Susan, Saturday night [2 Jul 2022] when the incident happened.

[KE] said she had just put her leftovers in the car and sat down in the driver's seat when she felt a strong bump on her thigh.

"I was thinking it was a puppy or a dog, and here's this coyote standing there looking at me," she said.

"She just let out this blood-curdling scream, and I had no idea why because I hadn't seen the coyote at all," her sister said.

"He frightened me, certainly," [KE] said. "I was holding a can of seltzer water and I threw it at him to get him away from the door so I could get in the car. I never expected one would walk up to the car and just put his head right in."

Once she was able to close the door, [KE] thought nothing of the encounter and drove to her childhood home in Salem.

"As I was driving home, I kept saying to my sister: 'This really hurts.' But it hadn't torn my pants or anything, so I just thought he bumped me really hard," she said.

She checked to see if there was bruising on her leg once she got to Salem and discovered blood on the inside of her pants.

This marks the 2nd instance within the past few weeks in which a coyote bit a person in Swampscott. The 1st attack happened [13 Jun 2022] in the parking lot of Santander Bank on Paradise Road, which is less than a block away from the parking lot where [KE] was bitten.

[KE] said police told her people are leaving food out for coyotes, which is creating this problem in the town.

"This was a well-fed coyote," [KE] said. "To be able to wound someone like this, especially coming right into the car, if it's a child or a toddler or another animal, i's really serious."

Swampscott Animal Control officers are reminding people not to feed wild animals, as it attracts them to humans and causes incidents like this.

Shortly before 10 p.m., NewsCenter 5 captured footage of the coyote in the Swampscott Mall parking lot Tuesday [5 Jul 2022] -- which is around the same time KE was bitten 3 nights earlier. That coyote appeared to be eating something in the parking lot.

Rabid fox bit 3rd Carroll County resident in 2 months, health officials say
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials are treating a 3rd person that has been bitten by a rabid fox in Carroll County in the last 6 weeks.

The bite took place last Thursday [30 Jun 2022] near Lepard and Glenloch roads in Roopville, according to the health officials. The fox was captured and tested by state health officials. Results released on Wednesday [6 Jul 2022] confirmed the fox had the [rabies] virus.

The victim was told to begin taking the Post Exposure Prophylaxis to prevent human rabies.

Two other rabid foxes were caught in late May [2022], both within 2/10's of a mile [0.3 km] of each other near the area of Highway 78 in Villa Rica and Old Villa Rica Road in Temple.

That area is less than 9 miles [14.5 km] west of the Winston area of Douglas County where a fox was found dead after attacking a family dog. It also tested positive for the [rabies] virus.

"If you notice a wild or nocturnal animal moving about in the daytime and the animal appears to show no fear of people or the animal seems to behave in a sick or abnormal way, the animal may be infected with rabies," said Melinda Knight, District 4 Public Health's environmental health director. "People should avoid animals acting out of character and report it to animal control or their local environmental health office."

Rabies, which causes encephalopathy, is easily preventable. Its symptoms include fever, headache, insomnia, confusion, hallucinations, a slight or partial paralysis, hypersalivation, and/or difficulty swallowing. Ultimately, the virus can be fatal.

"It is important to remember although rabies occurs more often in wildlife, domestic animals like the family dog or cat can become infected as well," she said.

The good news is it is treatable and preventable. For more information visit the Georgia Division of Public Health at <www.dph.georgia.gov/rabies> or the CDC at <cdc.gov/rabies>.

Residents can also call the Carroll County Animal Control Office for more information or the Carroll County Environmental Health Office.

Fox in Ticonderoga tests positive for rabies
--------------------------------------------
The Essex County Health Department (ECHD) was notified Monday [4 Jul 2022] about a gray fox interaction involving multiple people and pets in Ticonderoga.

Residents initiated a call for help through Essex County Dispatch 911 Call Center. A Department of Conservation (DEC) officer was requested to go to the location in Ticonderoga to handle the fox. The Health Department was called to provide additional guidance for people and pets.

"The animal was reported as overly aggressive, drooling and biting. It initiated contact with multiple pets and people," stated Jessica Darney Buehler, Director of Health Planning and Promotion for ECHD and the on-call staff who spoke with residents and the DEC officer.

"Because the behavior was consistent with rabies and there was potential exposure, I advised 3 people to pursue rabies post-exposure treatment immediately," added Buehler. "I also advised owners of pets and livestock to seek rabies boosters for their animals through veterinarians. Care for people, pets, and livestock is all underway."

The fox was submitted for testing and results returned confirmed it was positive for rabies. This is the 2nd confirmed case of rabies in gray fox this summer [2022]. Both were in the southeastern portion of Essex County.

To best protect people, pets, and livestock, ECHD recommends the following prevention actions:
• Keep pets and livestock up to date with rabies vaccinations
• Attend pets when outside and feed pets inside
• Tightly cap garbage cans, birdseed and other food sources to avoid attracting wild animals to your yard

Those who have been exposed to saliva or brain tissue of a suspected rabid animal should:
• Wash all wounds thoroughly with soap and water
• Seek medical attention immediately
• Report animal bites or possible rabies exposures to ECHD.

If your pet or livestock have contact with saliva or brain tissue of a uspected rabid animal, contact your veterinarian for medical care and contact ECHD to determine what additional follow-up may be needed.

ECHD may submit wild animals and bats for rabies testing if they have had contact with humans or pets, or if they have displayed unusual behavior.

[8] North Carolina (Brunswick County): fox, human exposure

Man attacked by rabid fox in Brunswick County over the holiday weekend
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[SG] and his family were excited for a fun holiday weekend visiting his parents in Ash, North Carolina. [SG] even woke up early Sunday morning [3 Jul 2022] to try and take in a beach trip.

"I woke up about 5 and walked out of my parent's front door to go to the beach and watch the sunrise," he said.

That's when the unexpected happened. Out of nowhere, a wild fox attacked [SG] and latched onto his leg.

"I immediately recognized I was going to have to battle this animal," he said. "At the time, I didn't know what it was. I thought it was a cat, you know, at first, but it latched on to me and was not going to let go until I ripped it from my body."

His family was immediately awakened by the commotion outside, even attempting to kill the fox themselves. They ended up calling deputies with the Brunswick County Animal Services who put down the animal.

"It even tried to attack them guys," said [SG]'s father. "But they kind of fought it back and everything."

Even worse, tests came back on Wednesday afternoon [6 Jul 2022] showing the fox had rabies. Now, [SG] has to go through intense treatments while his foot and ankle continue to heal.

"The treatments, I'll spare you some of the worst of it," [SG] said. "But it's not something you want to go through. I spent quite a bit of time in the hospital and getting the injections directly into each of the wounds, and then additional vaccine in both arms."

[SG] and his family say they were left scarred after what happened. Considering this is the 3rd fox attack in the county in less than a month, he hopes people learn from this and are better prepared if they find themselves in a similar situation.

"Always be prepared," he said. 'You never know. This was a shocker. It could happen to anybody. I know. It's rare. But be prepared."

Experts with health services say if you are bitten by a wild animal, you should immediately call animal control. They say you should also clean the wound for 15 minutes with soap and water, and be able to provide an accurate description of the animal which attacked you.

[There are a number of human exposures in this rabies update. If you have a known bite, please use soap and water to wash the wound, thoroughly. Then seek medical care.

"See your doctor for attention for any trauma due to an animal attack before considering the need for rabies vaccination. After any wounds have been addressed, your doctor -- possibly in consultation with your state or local health department -- will help you decide if you need treatment known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Decisions to start PEP will be based on your type of exposure, the animal you were exposed to, whether the animal is available for testing, and laboratory and surveillance information for the geographic area where the exposure occurred.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of 1 dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach." (Extracted from https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html)

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine. (People who may receive preexposure vaccination would include lab workers working with rabies samples, veterinarians, wildlife rehabilitators, game wardens and other individuals working with animals in some capacity. - Mod.TG)

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." (Extracted from https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html)

Please keep your pets up-to-date on rabies vaccination or boosters. This is a protection for your pet as well as yourself. It does not matter if you always keep your pet indoors, it is still very important to keep your pet up to date on vaccinations. Bats can get into various spaces, and enter a house. They may just as easily bite your sleeping pet as you. Saving the life of your pet is important and a vaccine to prevent rabies is well worth the time and effort it takes to protect your pet. - Mod.TG
