Viet Nam: Symptom-free Avian Influenza [Virus Infections] Pose No Risk
---------------------------------------------------
2 elderly Vietnamese who tested positive for [avian influenza] virus yet
remained healthy pose no significant risk to other people, a World Health
Organization expert said on Thu 10 Mar 2005. "In most infections, or many
infections, it is not unusual to get people who have either mild or
asymptomatic infections," Hanoi-based WHO medical epidemiologist Peter
Horby told Reuters. "There is no evidence that asymptomatic infection like
this poses any significant risk of onward transmission, so it is not
alarming in that sense," he said.
The 2 elderly Vietnamese, both from the northern province of Thai Binh,
where a cluster of cases is causing great concern about the possibility of
human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, had relatives who had
contracted the virus. "We certainly need to look into circumstances of how
they might have got their infection, whether from poultry, a contaminated
environment or from another infected person," Horby said.
What worries the experts most is the possibility of the virus mutating into
a form which could pass easily between humans and set off a pandemic in a
world without immunity to it and kill millions. So far, there has been no
evidence that mutation has occurred, and the only previous probable case of
human-to-human transmission occurred in Thailand, where a mother died after
cradling her sick daughter in her arms for hours.
The 47 [46 confirmed by WHO on 11 Mar 2005 - Mod.CP] people it has killed
since sweeping through large parts of Asia in late 2003 are believed, like
those who recovered, to have caught the virus directly from infected
poultry. But Vietnamese experts are investigating the Thai Binh cases to
see if the 2 old people caught the virus from prolonged contact with other
victims. The old man, the grandfather of a brother and sister who had
contracted the disease, drank raw duck blood during the Tet Lunar New Year
festivities last month, health officials in his village said.
But the only contact established so far with the virus for the other case,
a 61-year-old woman, was her husband, who died of bird flu in February
2005. "It could be that, and it could be from the contaminated
environment," Horby said. "That's certainly a possibility that needs to be
investigated." Health officials from the woman's village said she ate only
pork, and all 4 chickens raised in her house had tested negative for [avian
influenza virus infection].
There were cases of people contracting the H5N1 virus during its 1st
appearance, in Hong Kong in 1997, without showing symptoms but the elderly
man and woman were the 1st known [asymptomatic] cases in Viet Nam, Horby
said. Vietnamese health officials said the 2 must have had the virus, which
usually causes symptoms in 3 to 10 days, for about a month, but Horby cast
doubt on that. "You would not expect somebody to carry influenza infection
for that length of time, and it is impossible to tell how long they've had
it," Horby said.
The H5N1 virus has killed 34 [33 confirmed by WHO on 11 Mar 2005 - Mod.CP]
Vietnamese, 12 Thais and a Cambodian since it swept across large parts of
Asia at the end of 2003. It has recurred several times despite the
slaughter of millions of poultry and has spread across about half of Viet
Nam since the latest outbreak began in the Mekong Delta of Southern
Vietnam. It sprang up again around the same time in Thailand, where the
government said it had spread to 19 of the country's 76 provinces but had
not infected any more people.

Viet Nam: 2nd Nurse is Suspected Case of Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health officials said today they suspect a nurse who cared for
an avian influenza patient has contracted the disease that has killed 46
people across Southeast Asia. Dao Trong Bich, Deputy Director of The
Medical Centre in Thai Thuy District in northern Thai Binh province, said
the woman had cared for a 21-year-old man who tested positive for the H5N1
virus and remains in critical condition. The 41-year-old nurse, also from
Thai Binh province, was hospitalised on Thu 10 Mar 2005 in Hanoi with a
high fever, coughing and a lung infection -- typical avian influenza
symptoms. Specimens have been taken from her for testing, and results are
expected this week, the doctor said. She is in stable condition.
If the tests are positive, she would be the 2nd Vietnamese health care
worker to be sickened by avian influenza virus. Avian influenza has killed
33 people in Viet Nam -- 13 in the latest outbreak which began in December
2004. A Cambodian woman died earlier in 2005, while Thailand has reported
12 deaths. Experts have warned that if the virus mutates into a form that
can be easily transmitted between humans, it could spark a global pandemic
that kills millions. There has been no evidence so far that the virus has
changed its form [pathogenicity]. Bich said health authorities are closely
monitoring the health of 2 doctors and 2 other nurses at the Centre who had
contact with the 21-year-old man. None has shown any symptoms, he added.
The 21-year-old man is at the centre of a cluster of bird flu cases that
include his 14-year-old sister and 80-year-old grandfather, who has the
virus without showing any symptoms.

Viet Nam: 2nd Nurse is suspected Case of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health officials said on Sat 12 Mar 2005 that they suspect a 2nd
nurse who cared for an avian influenza patient has contracted the disease
that's killed 46 people across the region. Dao Trong Bich, deputy director
of the Medical Centre in Thai Thuy District in northern Thai Binh province,
said the 41-year-old woman had cared for a 21-year-old man who tested
positive for the H5N1 virus and remains in critical condition. The nurse
was admitted to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital on Thu 10 Mar 2005 with a high
fever, coughing and a lung infection -- typical bird flu symptoms, a doctor
there said on condition of anonymity. Test results to confirm if she has
bird flu are expected next week, the doctor said. The doctor refused to
speculate on how the nurse may have contracted the suspected case of bird flu.
Earlier this week, Viet Nam reported that a 26-year-old male nurse who
cared for the same patient had contracted the virus and is in stable
condition. Officials have said they don't believe the male nurse had
contracted the disease from the patient but said they couldn't rule out
that possibility. Experts have warned that if the H5N1 virus mutates into a
form that allows for easy transmission between humans, it could spark a
global pandemic that kills millions. So far there has been no evidence it
has acquired that ability, with most bird flu infections apparently
stemming from contact with sick poultry. A case of limited human-to-human
transmission, between a mother and daughter, was recorded in Thailand, but
the virus had not changed its form [pathogenicity].
Bich said health authorities are closely monitoring the health of 2 doctors
and 2 other nurses at the Centre who had contact with the 21-year-old man.
None of them have shown any symptoms, he added. The 21-year-old man is at
the centre of a cluster of bird flu cases that include his 14-year-old
sister and 80-year-old grandfather, who has the virus without showing any
symptoms.

[Despite the possible infection of a 2nd nurse from patients in her care,
evidence for direct transmission of the H5N1virus from person-to-person is
still equivocal. In none of the situations where person-to-person
transmission might have taken place is there evidence of onward
transmission of a H5N1 variant with enhanced virulence for humans.
Assessment of the extent of asymptomatic infection in the human population
is still lacking, and remains a barrier to proper evaluation of the risk of
generation of a pandemic virus. - Mod.CP]
