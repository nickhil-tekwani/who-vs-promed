Health authorities in Christchurch are trying to trace a measles
vaccine to find out whether it was faulty, after 6 people who had
been immunised caught the disease. The Canterbury District Health
Board has so far identified 15 confirmed and 6 probable cases of
measles. Most occurred in youths aged between 11 to 16 years old who
had not been vaccinated, although 6 of the cases had been.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Cheryl Brunton says the situation is a
concern, and the DHB [District Health board] is working to identify
what vaccine the sufferers were given. She says it is possible there
was a problem with a particular batch, or that some vaccine was not
handled properly. Dr Brunton is urging Canterbury parents with young
babies to get themselves immunised against measles, as the illness is
highly contagious. Young babies are a particular concern because they
cannot have their 1st vaccination until they are 15 months old, and
if they are exposed to measles, they are at risk of complications. Dr
Brunton says the best protection is for people around them to be immunised.

The 3-in-one measles, mumps and rubella vaccination is 95 percent
effective in giving lifelong immunity.

[It is not clear from this brief report whether the 6 vaccinated
individuals are probable or confirmed cases of measles virus
infection, and whether they are geographically or socially connected.
Up till now as far as this moderator is aware, there has been no
evidence of appearance of measles virus variants able to escape the
protective efficacy of the MMR triple vaccine. So it must be presumed
that these 6 cases are consequences of administrative errors or
deficiencies in vaccination procedure. Further information is requested.
