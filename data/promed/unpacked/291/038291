Health investigators are looking into 8 streptococcal infections at a
hospital in Bernalillo County. The state Department of Health [New
Mexico] would not release the name of the hospital. It says the
hospital is cooperating, and no new cases have been identified since
23 Jan [2008].

The Health Department is looking into the group A streptococcal
infections with the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC]. State epidemiologist Mack Sewell said the
investigation is aimed at preventing additional cases, identifying
sources of the infection and recommending prevention methods to the hospital.

[This brief news release apparently describes a nosocomial outbreak
of infection due to Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called
_Streptococcus pyogenes_. GAS is an uncommon but important cause of
nosocomial infections. Unfortunately, not much information is
provided to be sure that the infections were acquired in the hospital
or in the community. GAS can be highly contagious and outbreaks of
invasive GAS disease have occurred among susceptible patients and
healthcare workers in hospitals and nursing homes. The news release,
however, does not state whether the cases had any underlying
diseases, such as open wounds, recent surgery, recent childbirth, or
concurrent influenza or varicella, diabetes, or immune deficiency,
which would make patients particularly vulnerable to GAS infection.
Broken cutaneous or mucosal barriers facilitate invasive GAS
infection after exposure. It would be helpful to know if the cases
were clustered in time, circumstance, and geographic area to suggest
an epidemiological link. Molecular analysis (such as, pulsed-field
typing) of the isolates will aid differentiating a common source
outbreak or a breakdown in good medical/nursing practices. The source
of a nosocomial outbreak may be an asymptomatic healthcare worker who
carries GAS either in the anus, vagina, skin, or pharynx, and can
shed the organism into the immediate environment despite proper
gowning and gloving (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056612.htm>).

A prior ProMED-mail post -- 20050308.0692 -- cites references
relating to the spread of invasive streptococcal disease in health
care settings.

Bernalillo County is located in the US state of New Mexico. The
county seat is Albuquerque. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map
of the USA at <http://healthmap.org/promed?v=40,-97.6,4> can be used
to locate Albuquerque, New Mexico. - Mod.ML]
