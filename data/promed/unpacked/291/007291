Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, official destruction of animal products, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, zoning, no treatment of affected animals
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species, total vaccinated
Vladimirskaya Oblast / Cattle: 17 666; Sheep & goats: 1332

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[According to previous media reports, citing official sources, 104 000 cattle heads were already vaccinated as of 24 Oct 2016, out of the total of 131 000 heads in the Vladimir region which were due to be vaccinated (see item 2 in 20161026.4587331). The discrepancy between the data from the 2 sources deserves to be clarified. - Mod.AS].

Suspension of the "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised" status

Russia:
Following an immediate notification received from the OIE Delegate of Russia on an outbreak of FMD in Vladimirskaya Oblast, the status of "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised", as recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution No. 16 in May 2016, is suspended with effect from 20 Oct 2016.

As noted by Interfax, the Head of the Rosselkhoznadzor Territorial Administration for the Vladimir Oblast, Vladimir Nagorny, has stated that, in order to prevent the spread of the FMD virus, experts are going to test in the near future the security measures applied by the milk producers from Vyshmanovo and the steps undertaken in the milk processing plants which have received the supplied milk.

"We have already asked the prosecutor for permission to carry out all necessary checks according to law."

V. Nagorny also said that at present his Service, together with the regional veterinary administration and law enforcement agencies, are engaged in determining the cause of the animal virus infection.

According to him, there are several versions. Above all, penetration of the virus from countries where FMD is prevalent, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey. He did not exclude the possible drift or spread of the virus from a Moscow plant, cultivating the virus strain for vaccine production. "But our task is not necessarily to limit our investigations to a particular solitary version," he said.

V. Nagorny also said that introduction of the FMD virus by contaminated animal feed has been excluded. He explained that the animal feed sector in Vyshmanovo utilized locally grown ingredients for the production of the feed, but recently used also imported produce. "The same feed was supplied and used in other farms without problems. The feed has also been tested negative for the virus. Thus, feed, as source of infection, can be excluded," he said.

According to the spokesman of Rosselkhoznadzor, Alex Alekseenko, it is now very important to determine the molecular structure of the virus. "Identifying its closest strains will enable to define its origin and route of penetration," he said.

FMD was discovered last week in a farm in the village Vyshmanovo, Vladimir region. To date, all the livestock in it, about 800 head of cattle, have been destroyed. For security purposes, all the wooden buildings on the farm will be burned, and the concrete structures processed [which probably means cleansing by disinfectants or heat-treated by burners/torches]. All cattle in the area have been vaccinated.

Meanwhile, the detection of FMD in the territory of the Russian Federation which had been recognized earlier this year [2016] by the OIE as a free zone without vaccination, can adversely affect the export plans of meat producers. Kazakhstan and Belarus have imposed a ban on meat imports from a number of regions of the Russian Federation (see item 1 above).

[The above report presents 2 issues which have been put to discussion in ProMED-mail's earlier postings addressing the FMDV Asia 1 event in Vladimir; their current presentation by Russian officials renders them significant.

1. The need to exclude a possibility that the outbreak could have been caused by a vaccine strain originating from a local vaccine producing plant; and
2. The "importance to determine the molecular structure of the virus"; in other words, its genotyping.

In fact, the said 2 issues are related to each other. Genotyping will allow the confirmation or exclusion of the raised possibility ("version") that a vaccine strain is behind the event. During a comparable 2007 event in the UK, 2 days elapsed between the initial report on a suspected case of "a vesicular disease" affecting cattle "at a premises in Surrey" (20070803.2509), and the official reporting of its final identification as the vaccine strain "FMDV serotype 01 strain BFS67-1" (20070803.2523, 20070804.2538), found later to have leaked from the Pirbright laboratory, situated 6 km [about 4 miles] from the affected farm.

According to available information (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/disease_list.php?disease=foot-and-mouth-disease&lang=en), killed FMD vaccines against serotype Asia 1 are produced in the following plants in Russia:

Plant name / location / website
-------------------------------
1. Shchelkovsky Biocombinat / Moscow region / http://www.biocombinat.ru
2. Agrovet / Moscow / http://www.agrovet.ru/index.eng.htm
3. FGBI - "ARRIAH" (Federal Centre for Animal Health) / Vladimir, Tur'evets / http://www.arriah.ru/en/main/products

The 3rd plant is situated less than 14 km [9 miles] from the affected farm (map at http://tinyurl.com/h7n8wme).

The genotyping is expected to be performed by the highly qualified FMD laboratory of FGBI - "ARRIAH". OIE gave 2 international statuses to this laboratory: OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (1995) and OIE Collaborating Centre for Diagnosis and Control of Animal Diseases for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia (1997). FAO gave a status of FAO Reference Centre for Foot-and-Mouth Disease for Central Asia and Western Eurasia to the FGBI "ARRIAH" (2013).

It is expected that the vaccine strains from each of the 3 named producers be included in the battery of virus strains compared with the strain sampled from clinical FMD cases on the premises of the affected dairy operation in Vyshmanovo.

It may be assumed that the molecular studies of the causative pathogen have been initiated during the earliest stages of the event. ProMED awaits their results once available. - Mod.AS
