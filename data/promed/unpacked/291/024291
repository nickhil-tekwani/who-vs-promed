At least 85 people have died of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam in the last 2 months, a bulletin by the Health Department said. There were 10 deaths reported over the last 9 days, including one on Saturday [27 Aug 2022].

Since July this year [2022], as many as 390 cases of the infection have been detected, the bulletin said.

JE is a viral brain infection that spreads through mosquito bites. The virus, found in pigs and birds, is passed to mosquitoes when they bite infected animals.

Given the surge in JE cases over the past few months, a district rapid response team was formed in July [2022] to deal with the situation.

All standard operating procedures and guidelines communicated by National Health Mission, Assam, are being followed in the districts for case detection, management, and referral, official sources said.

There are 9 medical colleges and 10 district hospitals in the state, equipped with requisite facilities, and have been designated as JE treatment centres, they added.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 85.

The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on 19 Jul 2022 to 390 cases on 28 Aug 2022. Interestingly, these 390 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome.

Although there is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state, a previous report indicates that fogging with insecticide is being done. The current JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
