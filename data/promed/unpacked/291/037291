Minnesota EHV-1: Additional Cases from Index Farm Suspected
-----------------------------------------------------------
So far, 5 of 7 horses residing on the Wright County, Minnesota, horse farm that recently confirmed 3 cases of neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infection have developed clinical signs consistent with the disease, according to a statement on the University of Minnesota (UM) Equine Center Facebook page.

"Three of these are being managed in isolation at the Large Animal Hospital, and their conditions are gradually improving," the statement, which was posted late Monday night (19 Nov 2012), reads. "To date no cases have been identified beyond the original farm but it will take an additional 2 weeks until this can be ruled out with confidence."

The current Minnesota outbreak began 10 Nov 2012 when the index horse began showing signs of disease suddenly, treating clinician Anna Firshman, BVSc, PhD, CERP, Dipl. ACVIM, ACVSMR, assistant clinical professor of Large Animal Medicine at the UM Veterinary Medical Center, previously told TheHorse.com. That animal's condition deteriorated rapidly, she said, and the decision was made to euthanize him.

Shortly thereafter, a 2nd horse began to show clinical signs associated with EHV-1 and was admitted to the UM Large Animal Hospital on 11 Nov 2012, Firshman said. Diagnostic tests soon confirmed EHV-1. The 3rd horse began showing clinical signs not long after and was admitted to the hospital on 14 Nov 2012, she relayed. That animal also tested positive for the disease. Both of these horses were in stable condition as of 16 Nov 2012, Firshman said. The horses' clinical signs have included severe weakness, ataxia (incoordination), and an inability to urinate and defecate, she added.

In the 19 Nov 2012 Facebook post, UM advised area horse owners to be on the lookout for clinical signs including weakness, ataxia, and urine dribbling or difficulty passing urine and to contact a veterinarian immediately if signs develop.

Hawthorne Race Course Continues to Deal with EHV-1
--------------------------------------------------
Meetings with grooms and hotwalkers were conducted 18 Nov 2012 to explain proper cleanliness and hygiene because cleanliness among those in contact with horses daily is of the utmost importance.

Horsemen talked with officials from Hawthorne Race Course and the Illinois Department of Agriculture 19 Nov 2013 on a conference call about the continued efforts to contain an equine herpes outbreak at the Stickney, Illinois, track. On 16 Nov 2012 track officials confirmed that a horse who died 14 Nov 2012 and one other ailing horse had tested positive for EHV-1. The deceased horse is the 3rd confirmed death from EHV-1 during the outbreak that started last month. The ailing horse is one of 6 that has been moved into an isolation area in barn K2 for further monitoring.

Track officials said the purpose of isolating horses is to be able to monitor them while allowing the more than 1800 remaining healthy horses residing on the premises to continue racing.

In a statement, Hawthorne assistant general manager Jim Miller said meetings with grooms and hotwalkers were conducted 18 Nov 2012 to explain proper cleanliness and hygiene because cleanliness among those in contact with horses daily is of the utmost importance. A notice in both English and Spanish also was handed out.

Miller said a group of horses from Barn A, who 21 days ago tested negative for EHV-1, received a 2nd test 19 Nov 2012. If they again test negative, those horses will be moved back into the general population and will be allowed to race. Along with some other horses who could soon test negative for a 2nd time at 21 days, officials said more than 60 horses could return to the general population this week.

Miller said since the initial outbreak, Hawthorne has incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs on testing, staff, disinfectant, and lost racing dates.

"There are many reasons as to why we continue to race," Miller said in a statement. "We understand the amount of jobs that are on the line and we know that there are many healthy horses on the backstretch. We understand there are cases that may arise and they are handled on a case by case basis. These cases have diminished since our initial outbreak in Barn A but they exist."

Miller added that ceasing racing could create new illness risks if horses were isolated to their stalls with no opportunity to train or race.

[Both of these outbreaks represent an expansion of the disease. And sadly, they also represent the seriousness of this disease as the outcome is more frequently than not, death.

Readers are encouraged to learn more about the disease by reading the moderator's comments on ProMED-mail posting 20121019.1354013.
