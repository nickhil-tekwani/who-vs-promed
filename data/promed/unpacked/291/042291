Pigeon Fever Found in Florida Horses
------------------------------------
Traditionally considered a West Coast disease, pigeon fever was
recently diagnosed in several Florida horses.

Pigeon fever is caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis_, which tends to live in the soil in hot, dry
environments. It is primarily spread by flies and causes abscesses on
the pectoral region that give a horse a "pigeon breast appearance"
(hence the name).

Pigeon fever is not unusual in West Coast states like California,
which reportedly had severe pigeon fever conditions during the 2009
fly season. While an estimated 2 percent of the 1922 mustangs at the
Calico Complex in Nevada had signs of pigeon fever from the end of
December 2009 until the beginning of February 2010, even this was not
widely considered an official "outbreak."

In contrast, it is not typical to see any cases of pigeon fever on
the East Coast. Nonetheless, Michelle M. LeBlanc, DVM, Dipl. ACT, a
reproduction specialist at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in
Lexington, Kentucky, diagnosed pigeon fever in several horses in
Florida this past spring.

"Three Thoroughbred yearlings sharing a paddock on one farm," said
LeBlanc. "One Thoroughbred mare with a foal at the side and 2 riding
horse all developed chest abscesses consistent with pigeon fever."

She added, "_C. pseudotuberculosis_ was cultured from each of these
horses to confirm the diagnosis, and all the abscesses were lanced
and allowed to drain. Only the 2 riding horses were treated with a
broad-spectrum antibiotic (SMZ), and all horses are now doing well."

According to LeBlanc, one confirmed case of pigeon fever was also
seen at the University of Florida's Veterinary Medical Center.

In reference to the spread of pigeon fever, LeBlanc said, "I don't
think we can assume that the disease is spreading. We had an
abnormally dry, cold winter with blowing sand. It is more likely that
the bacterium was already in the soil and the environmental
conditions allowed the organisms to multiply. We experienced a
problem with pigeon fever in Florida about 20 years ago, and it is
likely that Florida will not see it again for many years."

Pigeon fever is not usually life-threatening, and many cases resolve
both with and without veterinary intervention.

[Pigeon fever, pigeon breast, breastbone fever, dryland distemper,
dryland strangles, false strangles, false distemper are the names
that this disease -- caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis_ -- are most frequently known by. Geographically,
it was at one time considered to be a disease of California, where it
is regarded as endemic. However, it is much more widespread now,
especially in the western states of the US, but it has a worldwide
distribution. It is a seasonal disease, usually appearing in late
fall but can appear sporadically at any time of year.

The signs of pigeon fever can also initially resemble those of other
diseases such as strangles. Sometimes the only initial signs are
lameness and a reluctance to move. It can strike a horse of any age,
sex or breed, but usually attacks young adult animals. There is a low
incidence in foals.

It has also been diagnosed in cattle, and a similar disease affects
sheep and goats. The disease is not transmissible to humans, although
humans can carry the infectious agent on shoes, clothing, hands or
barn tools and transfer it to another animal.

Clinical signs include lameness, fever, lethargy and weight loss and
usually is accompanied by very deep abscesses and multiple sores
along the chest, midline and groin area and, sometimes, the back.
Abscesses also can develop internally.

The disease is called pigeon fever because infected animals often
develop abscesses in their pectoral muscles, which swell and resemble
a pigeon's chest. Although the disease is considered seasonal, with
most cases occurring in early fall, a number of cases have been
confirmed during winter months and other times of the year as well.

The causative bacteria live in the soil and can enter the animal's
body through wounds, broken skin or through mucous membranes.
Additionally, some researchers believe pigeon fever may be
transmitted by flies.

Of the types of disease (external abscesses, internal abscesses or
limb infection [ulcerative lymphangitis]), the ulcerative
lymphangitis is the most common form worldwide and rarely involves
more than one leg at a time. Usually, multiple small, draining sores
develop above the fetlock.

The most common form of the disease in the United States is external
abscessation, which often forms deep in the muscles and can be very
large. Usually, it appears in the pectoral region, the ventral
abdomen and the groin area. After spontaneous rupture, or lancing,
the wound will exude liquid, light tan-colored, malodorous pus.

Internal abscesses can occur and are very difficult to treat. The
most common forms are external abscess and lymphangitis, with the
prognosis of a full recovery being generally good. Internal abscesses
are much more difficult to treat.

The contagious nature of the disease means an accurate diagnosis is
imperative, and treatment should be initiated as well as control of
insects and the rigid practice of biosecurity.

Horse owners should be aware of the clinical signs and understand
veterinary care must be timely. Infected horses should be isolated,
the abscesses properly treated and the drainage properly disposed of.
The area where the infected horse is kept must be properly cleaned
and completely disinfected, because this is a very hardy bacterium.
Bacteria in the pus draining from abscesses on infected horses can
survive from one to 55 days in the environment. They have also been
shown to survive from one to 8 days on surface contaminants and from
7 to 55 days within feces, hay, straw or wood shavings. Lower
temperatures prolong the survival time.

Pest control is extremely important. The bacteria may be transported
between animals by flies. Flies are also being investigated in the
role of instigator of this disease.

Horses may become infected but not develop abscesses for weeks. The
disease usually manifests in younger horses but can occur in any age,
sex, and breed.

A different biotype of the organism is responsible for a chronic
contagious disease of sheep and goats, _Caseous lymphadenitis_, or
CL. Either biotype can occur in cattle.

Treatment in horses often consists of hot packs or poultices applied
to abscesses to encourage opening. Open abscesses should be drained
and regularly flushed with saline. Surgical or deep lancing may be
required, depending on the depth of the abscess or the thickness of
the capsule, and should be done by your veterinarian. Ultrasound can
aid in locating deep abscesses so that drainage can be accomplished.
External abscesses can be cleaned with a 0.1 percent povidone-iodine
solution. Antiseptic-soaked gauze may be packed into the open wound.
A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as phenylbutazone, can be
used to control swelling and pain.

Antibiotics are controversial. Their use in these cases has sometimes
been associated with chronic abscessation and, if inadequately used,
may contribute to abscesses, according to one study. The most
commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of this condition is
procaine penicillin G, administered intramuscularly, or
trimethoprim-sulfa. In the case of internal abscesses, prolonged
penicillin therapy is necessary.

Buckets or other containers should be used to collect pus from
draining abscesses, and this infectious material should be disposed
of properly. Consistent and careful disposal of infected bedding,
hay, straw or other material used in the stall is vitally important.
Thoroughly clean and disinfect stalls, paddocks, all utensils and
tack. Pest control for insects is also very important.

With treatment, animals usually recover between 2 weeks to 77 days.
Although some animals may have recurrences, generally recovery is
complete, and the prognosis is good. - Mod.TG]
