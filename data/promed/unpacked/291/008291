Paraguayan health authorities are investigating the cause of death of
around 90 farmyard birds in San Juan Batista, 300 km south of the
capital, Asuncion. The possibility that the deaths are connected with
avian flu has been discarded.
The dead birds are chickens and ducks. A source in the National
Animal Health Service (Senacsa) said that the deaths were initially
thought to be due to insecticide distributed on the farm to control
flies. But the source said this was not the final diagnosis. The
authorities are carrying out tests to determine the exact cause of
death.

[Without clinical signs, it is difficult to speculate as to the cause
of the birds' deaths. However, most countries are actively on the
alert for avian influenza. This was likely the 1st viral disease to
be ruled out. There are other possibilities for the deaths, such as
Newcastle disease or laryngotracheitis. We look forward to a
definitive diagnosis. - Mod.TG]
