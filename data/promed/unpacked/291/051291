According to a media report, government health authorities confirmed
Saturday (13 Sep 1997) that 11 of the 19 persons recently infected with
Hantavirus have died and that 4 other deaths may be linked to the disease.
The government has formed a panel to halt the spread of the outbreak, which
has been centered in the Aysen region 600 miles (1000 km) south of
Santiago. However, one of the recent fatalities occurred in Arica about
1000 miles (1650km) north of the capital.
Chilean officials say that field mice migrated into the country from
Argentina in 1995. Now the Peruvian government has increased its border
surveillance to prevent the spread of the virus from Chile.

[Governments seem to me to have a remarkable way of making a biological
occurrence into an international incident. This and previous postings
allude to mice (actually rats, likely _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, the
Long-tailed rice rat, known locally as "colilargo", not "field mice"),
fumigation of vehicles (for what purpose?), and "invasions" of rodents
(sic: mice). From what I understand, certain plants in Chile that usually
do not flower for decades have been flowering for a year or more and are
providing food usually not available to rodents. This may be contributing
to increases in rodent population densities.
The Chilean Government is actively investigating this epidemic and efforts
will be increasing within the near term. There is no evidence for
human-to-human transmission in this epidemic; familial clustering of cases
may be a result of common source infections. -- Mod CHC
