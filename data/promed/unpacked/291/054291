The Lyme disease tick creeps into the suburbs
------------------------------------------------------------------
In just 3 years, from 1998 to 2001, the number of confirmed cases of Lyme
disease doubled or tripled in Berkshire, Bristol, Franklin, Hampden,
Norfolk, Plymouth, and Worcester counties of Massachusetts.
Even Suffolk and Middlesex counties, more urban than the more wooded
counties to the west and still among the safest places in the state to be
when it comes to tick bites, have seen Lyme disease cases grow 5-fold since
1990.
"The whole state now is at risk," said Alfred DeMaria, director of
communicable disease control for the state Department of Public Health,
"It's not just the Cape [Cod], the islands, and Cape Ann anymore. It's
everywhere."
At the same time, the medical community has been stymied in its efforts to
reliably prevent, diagnose, and treat the disease. This winter, the
manufacturer of the only approved vaccine to prevent Lyme disease pulled
its product off the market citing poor sales. That has left public health
officials redoubling efforts to avoid what many are predicting: that cases
of Lyme disease will set new records again this season.
Since CDC began tracking reports of Lyme disease in 1982, more than 145 000
cases have been reported. Massachusetts is in a group of 8 northeastern
states accounting for nearly 90 percent of USA case reports. The actual
number of cases is likely higher since not every case is reported.
According to David L. Weld, executive director of the American Lyme Disease
Foundation, record numbers of Lyme disease could be seen this year. During
the 1990s and continuing into the year 2000, the number of reported cases
of Lyme disease nationwide was higher in each of the even-numbered years.
Lyme disease in humans is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_,
which can be traced to the blood of certain small rodents, particularly
white-footed mice. Tiny ticks, in their earliest stages of development,
feed on the blood of these mice, contracting the bacteria. As the ticks
mature, they feed on larger animals, such as white-tailed deer. Because the
ticks have a 2-year life cycle, Weld said it is believed that the adult
ticks, which come into contact most often with humans in the grasses and
woods inhabited by deer, cause the spike in Lyme disease numbers every 2
years. Rising deer populations and increased residential development near
wooded areas are often blamed for the deepening public health concern in
communities previously unaffected by the infection.
The small town of Norwood in metropolitan Boston reported 5 cases last
year, none in 1998. In Ludlow, a town in the Quabbin River valley, the
number of dogs destroyed last year related to canine Lyme disease was 4
times what was seen in prior years.
"The numbers here have increased astronomically in the last 3 years," said
Doreen Rae, a director of nursing in the town, "And in Wilbraham and Munson
and Hamden." Officials in Ludlow have been working with the Harvard School
of Public Health and Connecticut Children's Hospital to track Lyme disease.
Tick sweeps were performed and the ticks tested for the bacteria
responsible for causing Lyme disease infections. In 1990, Rae said, less
than 2 percent of the ticks tested carried the bacteria. In the latest
tests, more than half the ticks have tested positive.
The only vaccine approved by the FDA for protection against Lyme disease,
LYMErix, was voluntarily removed from the market in February. Last year,the
FDA conducted an inquiry into 905 postmarketing ''adverse event reports''
regarding the vaccine since approved in late 1998, concluding that most
were consistent with adverse effects noted during clinical trials. The FDA
stated, however, that further study was needed of vaccine users who
developed arthritis or facial paralysis. [It is not at all clear if these
more serious events temporally related to vaccination were a direct
consequence of it. - Mod.LL]
Ramona DuBose, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of
LYMErix, said the sales of the vaccine have dropped sharply. In 1999, sales
were $40 million, representing about 1.5 million doses of the vaccine. In
2002, only about 10 000 patients were expected to request the vaccine. [The
primary series of this immunogen has been 2 doses given 1 month apart with
a booster 12 months later. Additional yearly booster may have been needed
as well - see below - Mod.LL]
"The demand has not been there for this particular vaccine," DuBose said.
While the medical world continues its work on the disease, others are
looking for an environmental solution.
David Simser, an entomologist with the Barnstable County Cooperative
Extension Service, is participating in a 4-state field test of 2 systems
for targeted distribution of a pesticide that public health officials hope
may kill enough ticks to make a difference in the fight against Lyme disease.
The first is a system of bait-box devices that can be placed around a
property to attract mice and other small rodents. Once inside the box, an
insecticide called fibronil coats their fur, killing early-stage ticks and
protecting the rodent from developing more ticks for at least a month.
Field tests will be conducted this spring and summer in NY, NJ, and CT as
well as MA. A second device is a 4-poster setup designed to attract adult
deer and coat them with a pesticide that kills the adult ticks.

[The Lyme borreliosis vaccine that has been withdrawn from market is a
unique biologic. Produced using DNA technology, the immunogen is ospA, one
of the outer surface proteins of the organism. The anti-ospA antibody
produced from vaccination was effective in preventing human infection
despite the fact that the organisms usually do not produce ospA when
replicating in humans. The mechanism of action appears to be ingestion of
antibody-containing blood by the tick and inactivation of the borrelia in
situ in the tick. Because adequate levels of antibody, therefore, are
required at the time of vector feeding, there is no time for an anamnestic
response. Some clinicians, therefore, were concerned that waning antibody
levels might require a booster yearly just before the beginning of 'tick
season'. Targeting the ticks with pesticides has been attempted
before. It tends to be effective in small settings but is unlikely to have
any substantial effect in natural settings because of the quantities of the
ticks that would need to be killed. - Mod.LL]
