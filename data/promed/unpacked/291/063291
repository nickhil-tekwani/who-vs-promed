After an in-depth investigation by the New York State Health
Department as well as school officials, Le Roy School District
Superintendent Kim Cox says they still have no answers regarding an
unusual outbreak of Tourette-like symptoms in a group of 6 students at
the Junior-Senior High School.

Last month [October 2011] health officials began looking into medical
records, environmental conditions, and other factors after the
students began exhibiting neurological tics, similar to Tourette's
syndrome. Health Department spokesman Peter Constantakes told WGRZ-TV
this morning [28 Nov 2011] that they did conclude that other students
and staff are not at risk and there have been no other cases
reported.

While a cause has not been found, they are confident that the
conditions and symptoms the students are exhibiting are real and not a
figment of imagination or power of suggestion. Constantakes says this
type of outbreak is extremely unusual, and they were not able to find
another like it. In cases that showed similarities, stress factors
seemed to play a role in the patient's symptoms.

The Le Roy School District issued a statement to parents and residents
over the holiday week [Thanksgiving, 24 Nov 2011] explaining the
situation and reaffirming that the health, safety, and well being of
students and school staff is their top priority. Cox said that the
district would provide no further comment on the issue.

[Pediatric childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tics, that
includes Tourette disorder, have been hypothesized as arising in a
subset of patients as a result of an autoimmune process that follows
group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections such as "strep
throat" and scarlet fever (Kurlan R, Johnson D, Kaplan EL; Tourette
Syndrome Study Group: Streptococcal infection and exacerbations of
childhood tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective
blinded cohort study. Pediatrics. 2008; 121(6): 1188-97;
http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/6/1188.long. Swedo
SE, Leonard HL, Garvey M, et al: Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
disorders associated with streptococcal infections: clinical
description of the first 50 cases [published correction appears in Am
J Psychiatry. 1998; 155: 578]. Am J Psychiatry. 1998; 155(2): 264-71;
http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=172706).

The autoimmune process is thought to be analogous to that of Sydenham
chorea (a major neurologic manifestation of acute rheumatic fever).
The term PANDAS is the acronym for "Pediatric Autoimmune
Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infections"
that has been applied to the disorder
(http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08916930500484757).

The news release, however, does not indicate the time line in which
the Tourette cases occurred and if any of the 6 cases had evidence of
GABHS infection.

LeRoy is a small town with a population of 7790 at the 2000 census in
Genesee County, Western New York State, United States
