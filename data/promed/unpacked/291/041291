Bovine TB traced to Saginaw County dairy cow
--------------------------------------------
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) 22 Mar 2013 announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the lymph nodes of a Saginaw County dairy cow identified during slaughter surveillance. The strain of bovine TB is unique to Michigan deer and cattle.

"Slaughter surveillance is an important part of the food safety net. USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service is charged with removing anything that looks suspicious from the food system," said Kevin Besey, MDARD food and dairy division director. "Although pasteurization kills the bacteria and is an important component of public health, MDARD will not permit milk from reactor animals to be sold for human or animal consumption."

"In accordance with our bovine TB response plan, the farm has been quarantined and a whole-herd test conducted," said Dr. Steven Halstead, MDARD state veterinarian. "Some animals responding to the on-farm test have been necropsied at Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health. Samples collected at necropsy are undergoing further diagnostic tests to confirm TB and these tests may take days to weeks.

Since Saginaw County is in a bovine TB-free area, we are moving quickly to stamp out and contain the disease at this one location." MDARD does not expect this one animal to affect Michigan's TB-free status in this area. Epidemiologists will conduct a farm visit to look at everything from farm bio-security measures, potential wildlife incursions, including feral swine, animal husbandry practices and purchase and sale records.

"Working with MDARD, DCPAH is here to help protect public and animal health in Michigan. Helping to address these types of disease incidents is core to our mission," said Carole Bolin, Michigan State University (MSU) Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (DCPAH) director. "Our ability to perform testing quickly and reliably plays a key role in getting information back to all the stakeholders without delay. We know this is a difficult situation for producers to be in, and we are dedicated to getting answers to them as quickly as possible."

Bovine TB affects all mammals, with cattle being especially sensitive. In 1994 a bovine TB positive white-tailed deer was killed by a hunter in Alpena County. In 1998, USDA, MSU, the Michigan Department of Community Health, MDARD and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources created an interagency project to address eradicating bovine TB by surveillance testing 1.3 million domestic animals, testing hunter harvested deer, establishing cattle and bison testing zones, assisting with disease risk mitigation practices, depopulating some beef and dairy cattle farms and removing test positive animals from herds on other farms.

In 2000, the entire state of Michigan lost TB-free status and Michigan has methodically taken steps to block transmission of the disease which is now only endemic in a small 4-county area of northeastern Lower Michigan. The Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ), where the disease still occurs, is Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. The Saginaw County border is about 115 miles and has 3 counties between it and the MAZ.

This is a significant extension of the outbreak from its recognized county area. It will be interesting to watch Michigan perform their traces -- those moving into a herd or premises vs. those moving out of a herd or premises. These are often called trace-ins or trace-outs. Michigan has large job ahead of it to not lose ground on their systematic approach to whittle down the bovine tuberculosis in the state.
