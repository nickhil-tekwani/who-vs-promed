[Several species of hantavirus may be present in Panama. Previously, 2
hantaviruses have been isolated in Southwestern Panama: Choclo virus
(reservoir host _Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) and Calabazo virus (reservoir
host _Zygodontomys brevicauda_). Only the former has been associated with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. More detailed information can be found in
the following paper: Vincent et al., Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in
Panama: Identification of novel hantaviruses and their likely
reservoirs. Virology 277: 14-19, 2000). - Mod.CP]
