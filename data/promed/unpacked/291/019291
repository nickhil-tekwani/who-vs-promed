Bird Flu: Virus Near Grosseto, Hundreds Of Wild Ducks Culled
-----------------------------------------------
After the discovery of avian influenza yesterday [31 Oct 2006] in the
Grosseto area, hundreds of animals will be put down. Late yesterday
[31 Oct 2006] evening, the Health Ministry asked the National Avian
Influenza Centre for its advice concerning whether the ministerial
decree DM 22/9/2000 should be urgently applied with regard to the
wild duck breeding grounds on which bird flu of the H5 strain and N
type has been found, but having ruled out that it is N1, the most contagious.
The ministerial decree referred to provides for the culling of all
the animals on the farm. The Health Ministry made the decision along
with the Tuscany regional government and the health-care body of
Grosseto on the way to go about the matter in this specific case and
supplied instructions for the culling itself.
In addition to the putting down of the wild ducks, the ministerial
orders provide for other measures to limit the likelihood of the
spread of the virus, which consist mostly of establishing a
surveillance zone with a [how many?] km radius around the farm in
question and surveillance, which will begin immediately after the
ordinance by the mayor of Grosseto and which will last for 3 weeks
after the culling. In the zone, the entire bird population will once
again be checked, even birds intended for use by single families, as
was done previously, since the entire area is inside or very close to
a humid zone used by migratory birds. For the period in question, all
the animals checked are to be considered under quarantine and will
have to be kept on the farms, prohibited from coming in or going out,
including both the birds themselves and their products, meaning eggs
and chicks. All farms in rural zones will be kept under constant
surveillance by the veterinary service of the local health-care authority.
The culling of the farm-bred wild ducks will be carried out within a
few days by a specialized firm, and the bodies will be destroyed and
buried on the land where they are found, after having their bodies
disinfected. The owners of the animals culled will be reimbursed for
the market value of the animals, established by an ad hoc committee
provided for by law in the case of forced culling.

[On 21 Sep 2006, Italy sent the following "final report" to the OIE:
"The last case of avian influenza detected in wild birds dates back
to 25 Feb 2006, in Puglia (Taranto province). Therefore, since the
surveillance activity on the entire national territory has revealed
no positive results for H5N1 virus, the event should be considered over.
Furthermore, the active surveillance among domestic poultry on the
national territory involved in the outbreak was intensified between
10 Feb and 5 Apr 2006. It was carried out on samples from 13 112
farms, and all gave negative results.
Italy is a country that meets OIE standards, in particular Articles
2.7.12.3. and 2.7.12.4., including Appendix 3.8.9., of the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, since notifiable avian influenza
virus -- strain H5N1 -- was found only in wild birds.
Italy has, therefore, not lost its free status with regard to
notifiable avian influenza in poultry."

The above news-wire on a suspected (yesterday, 31 Oct 2006) avian
influenza case in Tuscany is the single relevant piece of information
that could be found. Confirmation or otherwise, and -- in case
confirmed -- details pertaining to the serotype involved and its
pathogenicity, will be appreciated.
A firsthand report on a low-pathogenic H5N1, isolated in Padova,
Italy from wild ducks in the fall of 2005, was included in archived
post 20051112.3318.
