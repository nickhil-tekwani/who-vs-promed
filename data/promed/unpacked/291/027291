[The following article was published in October 1990. - CopyEd.MSP]

_Cryptococcus neoformans_ is a biotrophic smut-like fungus, and the
epidemiology of cryptococcosis can mainly be explained by exposure to
an infective aerosolised inoculum. For _C neoformans_ var gattii, it
is postulated that the principal infectious propagule is the
basidiospore and that exposure to _Eucalyptus camaldulensis_, the
host tree, is required to initiate infection in humans and animals.

_C neoformans_ var gattii may have been exported from Australia by
infected seeds of _E camaldulensis_ containing dormant dikaryotic
mycelium of the fungus. For _C neoformans_ var neoformans, both the
basidiospore and desiccated encapsulated yeast cells are postulated
to act as infectious propagules, the basidiospores showing a seasonal
distribution in association with an as yet unidentified host plant
and the encapsulated yeast cells dispersed from accumulations of
dried bird (mainly pigeon) droppings, which act as a year-round vector.

[The following comment was published 8 Dec 1990 in response to the
article above; see: Bart Curtis et al, Lancet. 1990 Dec
8;336(8728):1442. - CopyEd.MSP]

The authors commented that cryptococcal meningitis was common in the
Port Moresby area of Papua New Guinea [PNG], with 129 confirmed cases
in the period 1978 to 1987. The indigenous eucalypts in PNG are not
_E. camaldulensis_ but _E. papua_, _E. alba_, and _E. conferiflora_.
This disease is also common in the aborigines in the Northern
Territory of Australia, where these 3 species of eucalypt are common
but _camaldulensis_ is absent.

Isolation of _Cryptococcus neoformans_ var. gattii from _Eucalyptus
camaldulensis_ in India
-------------------------------------------

Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

_Cryptococcus neoformans_ var. gattii has an ecological association
with 5 Eucalyptus species: _E. blakelyi_, _E. camaldulensis_, _E.
gomphocephala_, _E. rudis_, and _E. tereticornis_. After human
infections due to _C. neoformans_ var. gattii were diagnosed in the
states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka, India, a study was
undertaken to investigate the association of _C. neoformans_ var.
gattii with Indian eucalypts, especially in the state of Punjab. A
total of 696 specimens collected from _E. camaldulensis_, _E.
citriodora_ and _E. tereticornis_ (hybrid) trees were examined for
the presence of _C. neoformans_ var. gattii. Flowers from 2 trees of
_E. camaldulensis_ in the Chak Sarkar forest and one from the village
of Periana near the Ferozepur area yielded 5 isolates of _C.
neoformans_ var. gattii. The origin of the trees could be traced to
Australia, thus providing evidence that the distribution of _E.
camaldulensis_ correlated with the distribution of human
cryptococcosis cases caused by _C. neoformans_ var. gattii in northern India.

[All in all, it would seem that while _E. camuldensis_ might present
the greatest international risk, one should be cautious with any
imported eucalypt seeds or seedlings. However, it was noted earlier
that this organism had not been recovered from eucalypts in BC; see
20070103.0022. There is much yet to be discovered about the ecology
of this organism. As my colleague Tam Gales stated: "Since the US ...
imports eucalypts and since the fungus has been isolated from areas
in California, one has to wonder whether this is a natural extension
of the fungus or whether we are simply becoming more adept at
diagnosing it;" see 20061010.2902. - Mod.MHJ]
