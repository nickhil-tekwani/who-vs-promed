Health authorities in Cordoba [Argentina] have confirmed several West
Nile [virus] encephalitis cases, a severe disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, which, until now, has not been recorded in humans in the country.

This reports one case in the city of Marcos Juarez in Cordoba
province and 3 additional cases in Chaco province, according to the
press in this city. The case occurred in March [2006] in a man of 58
years but [the West Nile virus etiology] was only recently confirmed
by laboratory tests. The man had not traveled outside the country in
recent years, inferring that the disease
was contracted locally.

The West Nile virus confirmatory tests were done by the Instituto
Julio Maiztegui in Pergamino, Buenos Aires, and referred to the CDC
international reference center in Puerto Rico.

[Several months ago [West Nile virus] cases were detected in horses
[in Argentina], so that the occurrence of human cases was just a
matter of time. That is exactly what has happened. Cordoba is in
Argentina, and has marked [climatic] seasons, so that in the summer
season _Culex_ [mosquito vectors] proliferate. So for Cordoba, and
the rest of South America, [the occurrence of human West Nile virus
cases] is just a question of time. Surveillance must be carried out,
in addition to in birds, also in horses and in _Culex_. - Mod. JLS
(translated by Mod TY)]

[It is now clear that West Nile virus has spread to various parts of
South America, and likely has become endemic there. A
hemisphere-wide surveillance and reporting system, perhaps operated
through the Pan American Health Organization, would be useful to
national and local health authorities, and provide a useful basis for
vaccination of equines and for focused vector control efforts. As
Mod. JLS suggests above, it is just a matter of time until additional
human cases occur in additional areas of South America.

Cordoba is near Buenos Aires, Chaco is in the northeast of the
country, close to Paraguay. - Mod. TY]
