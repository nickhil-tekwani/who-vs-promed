AEROSOL TRANSMISSION (5)

In re: Mike Turrell's comments regarding the potential for Ebola virus
aerosol infections -- The prevalence of antibody to a given arbovirus
may increase with increasing age but the prevalence of arboviral diseases
do not necessarily follow such a line. Each virus must be studied
individually and generalization avoided. They may all look the same but
we know how useless size and shape are.
Also, it surely appears that the Gabon Ebola outbreak is not hitting on
a specific age group. The last report I saw had ages of patients ranging
from 7 months to 65 years.

Dear Moderator:
I have been out for a while and missed or inadvertently deleted
the original posting/question, but from what I have seen in these
messages I thought I would put in my two cents regarding a lentivirus
that primarily utililizes arthropod transmission: the equine
infectious anemia virus (EIAV). EIAV is transmitted mechanically by
biting horseflies (Tabanid sp.), and is facilitated by the very high
titers achieved in the symptomatic horse (ie in the range of 10 to the
8 or 9 power horse infectious doses per ml) and the relatively large
volumes of blood ingested/transmitted by these flies. Subclinically
infected horses have lower titered viremias, but are still infectious
although presumably with much less efficiency. Virus viability in the
flies appears to be shortlived (ie hours), and interrupted feeding and
available susceptible horses in the immediate vicinity are important for
transmission under natural conditions. Since HIV can be transmitted
mechanically by needles, it seems that if the appropriate conditions were
met (density of infected/viremic and susceptibles, appropriate vector
biology, and so forth) that it is possible HIV could be transmitted by
arthropods; of course epidemiology suggests that these are not normally
met.
Regarding aerosol transmission, both symptomatic and subclinical horses
contain virus in pulmonary alveolar cells, with extensive replication in
the symptomatic horse. Although I am not aware of any studies that
specifically looked at infectivity of nasal secretions, epidemiology
suggests that horizontal transmission in the absence of vectors is very
rare if it occurs at all despite the presence of virus in the respiratory
system. As suggested elsewhere, other factors are important in determining
if a virus is transmitted by aerosol under natural conditions.

[- A number of years ago, it was shown that the human HIV viraemia was
not sufficiently high to allow mosquito transfer through bloody mouthparts.
Though many have been carried out, not one study has yet shown a valid
mosquito risk for HIV infections. Participation by tabanids biting humans
under the necessary circumstances is so rare as to be irrelevant. MH-J Act-Mod]
