The number of mumps cases has risen to 1100 in 8 Midwestern states
and prompted the federal government to distribute vaccines from its
stockpile to stop the outbreak's spread, health officials said on Wednesday.
The outbreak is the largest mumps epidemic in the United States in
more than 20 years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said. Most are in Iowa, where 815 cases have been
recorded, the CDC said.
An additional 350 mumps cases have been reported in Minnesota,
Kansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Missouri and Oklahoma,
officials said. Investigators are reviewing possible cases in 7 other
states that were not named.
Mumps usually is not serious and rarely kills. None of the cases in
the recent outbreak have been fatal.
Once a common childhood illness, mumps was virtually eradicated with
widespread use of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. But
the vaccine is effective in only about 90 percent of people, which
could partly explain the recent outbreak, CDC Director Julie Gerberding said.
"Although this is a very good vaccine, it's not perfect," Gerberding
said at a news conference.
Many college-age students may have received just one of the 2
recommended doses when they were young, and therefore may not have
the same level of immunity as others, she said.
Federal officials urged students, people who work in school or
university settings and health-care workers who did not get both
doses to get a 2nd dose.
The CDC is sending 25 000 doses of MMR vaccine to Iowa for that
purpose, Gerberding said. Drug maker Merck & Co. Inc. has donated an
additional 25 000 doses for health officials to use as they see fit.
Investigators do not yet know how many of the people infected with
mumps were vaccinated. So far, "we have absolutely no information to
suggest there's a problem with the vaccine," Gerberding said.
Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. It causes
unpleasant illness including fever, headache and swelling of the
glands around the jaw.
Up to 10 percent of patients may develop encephalitis. Other serious
complications that sometimes occur include meningitis, inflammation
of the testicles, ovaries or pancreas, or permanent deafness. There
is no approved treatment.
The mumps virus is transmitted by coughing and sneezing. Experts say
it is about as infectious as influenza. People can transmit mumps to
others for 3 days before they have any symptoms.
In the United States, an average of 265 mumps cases have been
reported each year since 2001. Mumps vaccinations started in 1967.

Nebraska, which is part of a 9-state mumps epidemic, is now reporting
110 cases of the disease in 22 counties, health officials said
Monday, 32 of which are confirmed.
"Currently, most of our mumps cases are in southeastern Nebraska,"
said Dr. Anne O'Keefe, epidemiologist for the state Health and Human
Services System.
She said most of the cases are among people ages 10 to 18 and 35 to
45. "However, we're seeing cases in children as young as 2 and adults
up to age 64," she said.
The mumps epidemic is the nation's first in 20 years.
Some 600 suspected cases have been reported in Iowa, according to the
national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are also
cases reported in Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include
fever, headache, muscle aches and swelling of the glands close to the
jaw. It can cause serious complications, including meningitis, damage
to the testicles and deafness. Mumps is spread by coughing and sneezing.
No deaths have been reported from the current epidemic.
A 2-dose mumps vaccine is recommended for all children and is
considered highly -- but not completely -- effective against the illness.
According to HHS, Nebraskans ages 30 to 65 years old are the most at
risk to catch the disease because they probably never were vaccinated
or had the disease.
Nebraska law for years has required 2 doses of the mumps vaccine
before a child can enter school or college. Thus Nebraskans under the
age of 30 who followed the K-12 and college entry requirements
probably have been vaccinated. Nebraskans over the age of 65 are
likely to have natural immunity to the virus. Many in this age group
had mumps as a child.
Two infected airline passengers may have helped spread Iowa's mumps epidemic.
Iowa health officials last week identified 2 people who were
potentially infectious when they were traveling in late March and
early April [2006].
The CDC said the present outbreak is the nation's biggest epidemic of
mumps since 269 cases were reported in Douglas County, Kansas, from
October 1988 to April 1989.
A mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967.

State health officials say Kansas now has 170 confirmed or probable
cases of mumps in 29 counties.
Local health departments are also investigating an additional 23
patients with potential symptoms of mumps.
Douglas County remains the epicenter of the outbreak, with 87 cases.
The rest are scattered in 28 other counties, with only the southeast
corner of the state apparently spared so far.
Two counties -- Crawford and Trego -- were dropped from the state's
list today after people who had mumps-like symptoms were determined
not to have the viral infection.

The number of mumps cases both confirmed and suspected in Illinois
surged past 100 on Thursday, further dwarfing the infection
occurrence that averaged just 13 in the state over the previous 5
years, Illinois' Department of Public Health said.
As of Thursday morning [20 Apr 2005], Illinois' 110 mumps cases were
evenly split between confirmed cases and possible ones, department
spokeswoman Melaney Arnold said. That's up from 81 total cases -- 42
confirmed, 39 probable -- just a day earlier.
Carol Finley, the assistant programs chief with the department's
immunization unit, said the one-day spike may reflect statistical
catch-up in fielding reported cases from local health agencies over a
3-day holiday weekend last week.
While it appears "like we got a boatload" of new cases in a short
span this week, Finley said, "we're picking up about 11 cases a day.
Our numbers are changing daily," she said.
As of Thursday, mumps had been reported in 31 of Illinois' 102
counties, as well as the city of Chicago. Finley said at least 6 of
the Illinois cases were considered linked to an outbreak in Iowa,
where more than 800 mumps cases had been reported as of Wednesday.
Federal health officials said this week that the outbreak -- more
than 1000 cases -- is the nation's largest in almost 2 decades and is
expected to keep growing.
Mumps is a virus spread by coughing and sneezing. The most common
symptoms are fever, headache and swollen salivary glands under the
jaw. But it can lead to more severe problems, such as hearing loss,
meningitis and fertility-diminishing swollen testicles. Illinois has
had a couple of cases involving swollen testicles but apparently no
other instances of the other complications, Finley said.
In recent weeks, health officials throughout Illinois and elsewhere
have stressed that the virus should pose no cause for alarm. But they
say people should consider precautions, including inoculations
against the virus if they haven't already done so, good hygiene and
avoid contact with people showing symptoms of the illness.
Finley credited the increased public awareness with encouraging more
people to have possible symptoms get checked by a doctor, then
swiftly isolating themselves until those symptoms pass to avoid
spreading the virus.
"Based on help from the media, they're more educated and responsive
to see what they should do for themselves and other people," she said.
As of Thursday, 20 of Illinois' cases have been reported as of
Thursday in Jo Daviess County, wedged in extreme northwest Illinois
along the Iowa and Wisconsin borders, Illinois' health department
said. Another 14 were in far north-central Illinois' Winnebago
County, which hugs the Wisconsin line. Chicago and Rock Island
County, which also neighbors Iowa, each had 9 cases.

Mumps cases are spilling out of Iowa and popping up in several other
Midwestern states.
There are now more than 800 confirmed cases in Iowa and 14 in
Wisconsin, most along the Iowa border.
Racine and Waukesha counties both have one confirmed case, while
Milwaukee County reported 2 cases. Grant County has confirmed 8 cases.
There are also 2 confirmed cases in Dane County.
Although there are no reported cases among Madison school students or
staff, Madison public schools are sending an information letter home
to parents.
The letter answers all the questions parents may be asking, such as
susceptibility, symptoms and how to protect your family from the illness.
School health officials say it's a pre-emptive move to try to help
inform parents of the symptoms.
Mumps is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the salivary
glands in the neck. It spreads through the air by coughing, sneezing
or simply talking.
Children in school nowadays are required to have 2 doses of MMR --
the measles mumps rubella vaccine -- and there's no recommendation to
get another dose if they've already had the required shots.
However, experts say adults born after 1957 who have not had the
mumps vaccine may want to consider getting one.
Mumps is so rare most people don't even recognize it. The virus
swells the salivary glands, creating a chipmunk look in the cheek and jaw area.
Mumps is most often relatively mild. Deafness and death, the most
extreme results, are extremely rare.
There are no deaths and few complications being reported from this
virus, WISC-TV reported.
Cases have also been reported in Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas,
Nebraska and Illinois.
Wisconsin reported only 5 mumps cases in the state last year.

[From the above newswires it appears as though the mumps outbreak is
continuing to spread, and now involves 9 states in the midwest of the
USA (Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Wisconsin and Minnesota). Given the extension, we have decided to
change the thread name to reflect the increase in geographic extent
of this outbreak. There was a CDC Health Alert Network Advisory
(HAN) posted on 12 Apr 2006, discussing the identification of the G
genotype virus in this outbreak, but mentioning that the source of
the outbreak was as yet unknown. (There has been an ongoing outbreak
of mumps in the UK since 2004 involving more than 70 000 cases to
date. See
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/mumps/data_quarter.htm>
for data as of the end of 2005.) Additional information provided in
the HAN advisory was mention that the efficacy of one dose of mumps
vaccine (in the trivalent measles-mumps-rubella MMR vaccine) is 80
percent after one dose and approximately 90 percent after 2 doses of
the vaccine. (see
<http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/HAN/ArchiveSys/ViewMsgV.asp?AlertNum=00243 >
for more detailed information on the outbreak as of 12 Apr 2006
along with more technical information on the disease and control
strategies). - Mod.MPP]
