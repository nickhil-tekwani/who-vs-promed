Health officials have now confirmed 3 cases of infant botulism in East Texas, and a possible 4th case is under investigation. "We are certainly curious about where this originated from," said Russell Hopkins, with Northeast Texas Public Health District. According to Hopkins, 2 cases occurred in Troup, one in Mineola, and they are expecting a 4th case to be confirmed in Tyler.

"We're not really sure what the commonality is, because they are kind of spread out," Hopkins said. "You do have 2 cases in one town, which is unusual. But it doesn't mean they're related. It's generally related to dust that gets kicked up in the air and is then ingested by the infant," Hopkins said.

Warning signs of infant botulism include constipation, decreased movement, poor feeding, and at times, a weak cry. "It is a life-threatening emergency and can end in death," Hopkins said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventoin, the bacteria that cause infant botulism can be found in dust and dirt, even after cleaning. Infants are more susceptible to complications because their digestive tracts are not developed enough to fight off the bacteria which then begins producing toxins.

Botulism is not contagious, according to CDC.
