[We are grateful to Dr Ismail for her contribution. To me, the
negative bacteriological finding suggests that the cause may be
toxic.
We also understand that school meals have been temporarily
suspended which, while preventing further illness, will have a
negative impact on the nutrition of the school children - Mod.JW
