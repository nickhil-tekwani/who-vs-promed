For the last 8+ years I have been doing applied, economic and ecological
research on fire ants in Texas as both a part of my job and a doctoral
program. I have tested dozens of products over the years and am now
in charge of the fire ant applied research program at Texas A&M. The
veterinary and livestock impacts of fire ants have been, and continue to
be under Texas' new Fire Ant Initiative, a major concern of our program
since Texas contains 56 million acres of infested pastureland (the size of
Alabama) and a $6 billion/year industry. Allow me a few moments to
address some of the points I saw in these postings. I'll try to be brief, but
I bet I won't have much luck.
First, I would greatly appreciate a reprint of the Jemal and Hugh-Jones
article. Couldn't find it in our computer databases.
I have personally conducted two large surveys in the past few years to
address fire ant economic and management concerns.
In 1993, surveys were sent to ALL members of the Texas Veterinary
Medical Association. The response rate was about 33% (over 800 vets),
pretty amazing for a "cold" survey to a bunch of overworked vets. In
brief, we documented losses to cattle, pets, wildlife, ratites/exotics in
roughly that order. A full report is available from me, but articles, etc. can
be found in the "Texas Veterinarian" Vol. 57, March (survey results) and
April (treatment recommendations) issues. Another report is available in
the Proceedings of the 1994 Imported Fire Ant Conference, Mobile
Alabama.
There were 872 reports from 215 vets on wildlife injuries, mostly deer.
The total dollar value reported lost for all animals and vet costs was $4.5
million. However, $2.1 million of that was to ratites, which translates to
about zero now, for them. These are reported values with no
extrapolation. The survey was conducted with assistance from the
Texas A&M College of Vet Med. and Tx. Vet. Med. Diag. Lab. as well as
other departments.
In 1994 we sent out surveys to 4,521 members of the Texas and
Southwestern Cattle Raiser's Association living in fire ant infested
portions of Texas. 1,540 surveys were returned. The resulting report is
225 pages long. The high points were:
1) only 70% of respondents reported economic losses
2) the bulk of losses were to electrical equipment, mechanical breakage
and infested hay and fee. Hay producers are getting hammered.
3) animal mortality is sporadic, bad when it happens, and very difficult to
pin on fire ants as the primary causal agent
4) We conservatively estimated that fire ants cost the Texas cattle
industry $67 million per year.
5) Obviously there's MUCH more to this report.
Articles on parts of the report are available in Proceedings of the 1995
and 1996 Imported Fire Ant Conferences held in San Antonio and New
Orleans, respectively.
Regarding fire ants and wildlife. There have been very few good,
scientifically controlled studies because it's very hard to do them. Tons
of anecdotal evidence, but very few reliable studies. The Texas Parks
and Wildlife Dept. swears fire ants do not hurt quail populations. Every
person you talk to on the street swears they do. The existing studies
were done in relatively low fire ant density areas and didn't show much
of a correlation. One of the better studies showed that some species of
rodents are almost non-existent in fire ant infested areas, while other
species have no problems. Depends on how mobile the young are when
born. Another study showed that young quail are very distracted by fire
ant activity, but not directly harmed (Pedersen EK, WE Grant, MT
Longnecker. 1996. "Effects of red imported fire ants on newly-hatched
northern bobwhite quail". J. Wildl. Mange. 60(1): 164-169.
Regarding fire ants and ecosystems. Myrmecochory is well known to
affect, even control, entire vegetative ecosystems in sites around the
world. However there is virtually nothing in the literature on Solenopsis
invicta and vegetation. I just finished a dissertation on the subject and, to
the best of my knowledge, no one else has looked at this phenomenon
down to the plant species level. In short, I found that seeds of a certain
plant species, _Monarda citriodora_, are collected by ants and
concentrated around mounds resulting in large clumps of these plants
the following spring. I also have strong, but less conclusive evidence of
fire ant effects on ragweed, goldenrod, McCartney rose and a few
others. The effects may be due to nutrient concentration around the
mounds (several references available), or even predation on other
insects using those plants as food (other references available for
different ant species). There may be very complicated interactions going
on. My dissertation title is "Influence of Solenopsis invicta Buren on plant
species composition, seed predation and patch creation in a central
Texas grassland" Texas A&M Univ. (Dept of Rangeland Ecology and
Mgmt), 1997. I will be presenting on the subject at this year's fire ant
conference in Hot Springs Ark, April 6-8, as well as publishing soon.
Regarding the phorid flies. NOBODY is claiming that these flies are going
to eradicate fire ants, except the popular press. They only parasitize a
small percentage of foraging and/or disturbed worker ants. What they do
succeed in doing is disrupting the ants' foraging patterns. At least in
South America, when fire ants see these flies, they assume a defensive
posture and essentially hide. (Wouldn't you if you were going to have
your brain eaten out?). This keeps the ants from foraging during the day,
thus costing them some of their competitive edge. As I understand it,
there are two species of flies that have been screened to prey
exclusively on red imported fire ants. The one being successfully raised
and released is a disturbed mound predator, which will only do so much
good as far as disrupting foraging. The other is a foraging trail predator,
which would work fine, but they are having a hard time raising it en
masse. If you want to know more about these flies contact Dr. Sanford
Porter at U. Florida Gainesville (USDA ARS), or Dr. Larry Gilbert at the
University of Texas.
Because we're Extension, we don't have time or money for many journal
articles, but we've got stacks of reports to grantors on applied research
and many other fire ant-related publications. I'll be happy to send
reports, reprints etc. to any one who wants them. Please reply to me
directly.

Thanks for getting back to me. I tend to get pretty riled up when I see so
much "non-knowledge" among professionals about fire ants. I totally agree
with you about their positive aspects, but the problem with that is
two-fold. One, these were surveys and we only know what people
wanted us to know. The general public tends to just blow off the positive
aspects, though most ranchers will readily admit to ticks and chiggers
being less of a problem. Second, putting a dollar value on their beneficial
aspects is at least as difficult as putting a dollar value on the negative
aspects. A value on wildlife impact has been darn near impossible, thus
far.
I'm familiar with Reagan's group's sugarcane work (Whew, better them than
me!) [This research demonstrated a 17% increase in sugar cane production
thanks to the ants attacking 'cane borers'., but there hasn't been anything
even close to that thorough done on any crop in Texas. I think Texans get a
little more radical about fire ants than folks in other states and we have
to focus on what the public wants even if we know it's not even-handed in
order to keep our funding. I think there are two reasons for our Texas'
reaction. One is that we are still on the "invasion front" and people just
naturally get more upset by change. The other is that we are dominated by
the multiple queen form, 200-400 mounds per acre commonly, versus 40-60 in
monogyne areas across most of the South.
What has amazed me about fire ant research is how much we fire ant
scientists don't know after all these years and how much less other
scientists and professionals don't know.
