Egypt: avian influenza situation - WHO update
---------------------------------------------
As of Thu 18 Jan 2007, viruses with a genetic mutation, linked in
laboratory testing to moderately reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir,
have been discovered in 2 persons previously reported with H5N1 infections
in Egypt. Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir for 2 days
before the clinical samples that yielded the viruses were taken.
The 2 patients from whom samples were taken were a 16 year old female and a
26 year old male from Gharbiyah Province, Egypt [NB: The ages and dates in
this update related to the 2 patients may differ slightly from earlier
reports but reflect the most recent information provided to WHO. - Mod.CP].
They were a niece and uncle, respectively, who lived in the same house. The
girl was admitted to a hospital on 19 Dec 2006, while the man was admitted
on 17 Dec 2006. On 21 Dec 2006, they began receiving 2 tablets per day of
oseltamivir. On 23 Dec 2006, they were moved to a referral hospital. The
samples which have so far been tested were taken from the 2 patients on 23
Dec 2006. The girl died on 25 Dec 2006, and the man died on 28 Dec 2006.
In this and all other H5N1 investigations, there is close, ongoing
coordination between Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOH&P) and
WHO. It was Egypt's monitoring and rapid virological analysis conducted at
the Central Public Health Laboratory in Cairo that initially allowed the
diagnoses of H5N1 to be made. Confirmatory testing and genetic sequencing
was done at NAMRU-3 and at 2 WHO Collaborating Centers located in Atlanta,
USA and London, UK.
At this time, there is no indication that oseltamivir resistance is
widespread in Egypt or elsewhere. WHO is not making any changes in
antiviral treatment recommendations for H5N1-infected persons published in
June 2006 because the clinical level of resistance of these mutations is
not yet well established. Current laboratory testing suggests that the
level of reduced susceptibility is moderate. This mutation has previously
been identified in Viet Nam in one case in 2005. Moreover, these mutations
are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the
virus between humans.
Based on these considerations, the public health implications at this time
are limited. Finally, these findings do not indicate a need for a change in
phase level. The WHO pandemic preparedness level remains at 3.
The Egyptian authorities, WHO, and its Collaborating Centers will continue
to share with the public all relevant information from the ongoing
investigations and analyses as soon as it becomes available.
