Government slow to tackle mystery cocoa disease
-----------------------------------------------
A mystery disease that is killing cocoa plants in Cameroon's main
cocoa-producing South-West region [see ProMED-mail post 20101003.3584]
could slash the harvest for several years yet -- the government has
been slow to help. At least 12 000 - 15 000 cocoa trees have been
killed during the past 9 months.

Government scientists and representatives of the National Cocoa and
Coffee Board went to investigate the disease in November [2010], but
results of the outcome are still to be made public, and more cocoa
plants are dying.

A senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development confirmed that the results reached them early in December
[2010]. "But the report is still being studied by the authorities and
appropriate measures to combat the problem will come soon," said the
official who preferred not to be named.

The unknown disease attacks cocoa plant roots turning them
rust-colored and causes the trees to wither and die. The areas
involved are Ekona, Muea, Muyuka, Munyenge, Ekata, Bafia, as well as
the main cocoa-growing and marketing town of Kumba.

[A number of mostly fungal pathogens are known to cause root rot and
dieback symptoms on cocoa similar to what is being reported from
Cameroon.

An outbreak of black pod disease in the South-West growing region
(see ProMED-mail post 20100825.3001) was reported in 2010. Black pod
is one of the primary diseases of cocoa worldwide, and in Africa, the
fungus-like pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are
associated with it. Fungicides were provided by the Cameroon
government in 2010 to fight black pod, but from the report above,
these fungicides do not appear to have had an effect on the new
disease. Therefore, the causal organism may either not be a fungus, or
may be out of reach of the foliar sprays because it is soilborne.

Swollen shoot caused by _Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV; genus
_Badnavirus_) and spread by mealybug vectors, is another major disease
of cocoa in the region. Symptoms vary with different viral strains
from severe effects on shoots and roots to no symptoms at all. In
Africa, CSSV has so far only been reported from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, but an eastward spread cannot be excluded.

Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen is essential for designing
management strategies for the new disease. But the report above does
not state whether the results provided to the government include a
clear identification of the pathogen.
