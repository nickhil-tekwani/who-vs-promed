Another NSW cattle tick case
----------------------------
New South Wales (NSW) cattle producers are being warned to keep a
close watch on their stock, after a 2nd case of cattle tick fever was
found on the state's north coast. More than 10 heifers have died as a
result of the outbreaks.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries says this latest case at
Alstonville is related to the previous one near Muwillumbah, and
likely to be linked to Queensland cattle.

Regional animal health leader, Paul Freeman, says surrounding
properties have been quarantined, but more outbreaks could occur.

"We believe a property next door to the propety at Burringbah is
probably where it started, and we think those cattle originated
possibly from Queensland and then those cattle moved subsequently
down this way," he says.

"Indications are there are only 6 properties involved and small numbers.

"That sort of gives us confidence that we've got this thing under control."

[This sounds very much like the babesiosis cases recently exported to
New Caledonia. The reader is referred to ProMED-mail post
20080313.1006 to understand why it called Tick Fever and not
babesiosis - Mod.TG.]
