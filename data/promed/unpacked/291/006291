Update. Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (8 May 2009 1 PM)
Epidemiological Alerts Vol. 6, No. 24
-------------------------------------
Two new countries have confirmed cases of
Influenza A/H1N1. Yesterday [7 May 2009], Brazil
reported 4 confirmed cases of Influenza A/H1N1
and today, Argentina reported one case. As of 8
May 2009, the total number of confirmed cases of
Influenza A (H1N1) recorded is 3067, including 46
deaths, in 9 countries of the Americas
(Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and the United
States). The increase in the number of cases in
the United States since yesterday is due to the
recent laboratory-confirmation of samples that
were collected in previous weeks.

To date, the United States has confirmed a total
of 1639 cases of Influenza A (H1N1), including 2
deaths in Texas, in 43 states (including the
District of Columbia): 4 in Alabama, 131 in
Arizona, 107 in California, 25 in Colorado, 4 in
Connecticut, 39 in Delaware, 6 in Florida, 3 in
Georgia, 5 in Hawaii, 1 in Idaho, 392 in
Illinois, 29 in Indiana, 5 in Iowa, 12 in Kansas,
3 in Kentucky, 7 in Louisiana, 4 in Maine, 4 in
Maryland, 83 in Massachusetts, 49 in Michigan, 1
in Minnesota, 9 in Missouri, 4 in Nebraska, 8 in
Nevada, 3 in New Hampshire, 7 in New Jersey, 8 in
New Mexico, 174 in New York, 7 in North Carolina,
6 in Ohio, 4 in Oklahoma, 15 in Oregon, 2 in
Pennsylvania, 7 in Rhode Island, 29 in South
Carolina, 1 in South Dakota, 36 in Tennessee, 93
in Texas, 24 in Utah, 14 in Virginia, 33 in
Washington, 1 in Washington D.C. and 240 in
Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are being investigated.

From [1 Mar 2009 to 6 May 2009], Mexico has
reported 1204 confirmed cases of Influenza A
(H1N1), including 44 deaths, in 29 of 32 states.
The states with the highest number of confirmed
cases are the Federal District (Mexico City),
Mexico State, San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo. The
majority of these cases have occurred in previously healthy young adults.

In Canada, to date 214 human cases of Influenza A
(H1N1) have been confirmed in 9 of 13 provinces:
(33 in Alberta, 54 in British Columbia, 2 in New
Brunswick, 53 in Nova Scotia, 11 in Quebec, 1 in
Manitoba, 56 in Ontario, 2 in Prince Edward
Island and 2 in Saskatchewan). Some of the cases
had recent travel history to Mexico. All of the
cases developed a mild form of influenza-like
illness. Some of the cases also presented
gastrointestinal symptoms. Indigenous
transmission is not discarded since not all of
the confirmed cases have recent travel history to Mexico.

On [2 May 2009], Costa Rica notified 1 confirmed
case of Influenza A (H1N1). On [3 May 2009],
Colombia reported 1 confirmed case of Influenza A
(H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed
cases of Influenza A (H1N1). On [5 May 2009],
Guatemala notified 1 confirmed case of Influenza
A (H1N1) in a person that had travelled to
Mexico. On [7 May 2009] Brazil reported 4
confirmed cases of Influenza A (H1N1), all of
them with recent travel history to affected
areas. Today, Argentina reported the confirmation
of 1 confirmed case of Influenza A (H1N1) with travel history to Mexico.

Various countries of the Region are reporting
suspected and probable cases. This indicates that
surveillance enhancement is producing results.
