[The 1st case of locally acquired chikungunya virus infection was
diagnosed on 3 Mar 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110308.0759). Now, there are 12 confirmed and 5 suspected cases. A
previous report stressed the relevant use of impregnated bed nets by
febrile patients suspected of acute chikungunya virus infection (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20110309.0768). If vector control is
focused on adult mosquitoes (spraying or fogging), control of vector
populations and transmission of the virus will be temporary if
mosquito breeding sites in water catchments in and immediately around
houses are not reduced. It is likely that additional cases will occur.
