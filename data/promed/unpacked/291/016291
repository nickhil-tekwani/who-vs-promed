Sarasota County health officials acknowledge that 5 confirmed cases of
cryptosporidiosis occurred this summer, and that hundreds of other children
may have been sickened by the parasite that causes the stomach illness. The
county officials said they didn't warn the public about the outbreak they
discovered in early Jul 2000 or close the downtown fountain because there
was never a direct link between the illness and the fountain.
Bob Levy, who supervises public pools and bathing areas for the Health
Department said "We have to have something positive to hang our hats on in
order to close a facility."
Since discovering the outbreak, Sarasota officials have made numerous
changes in the way the fountain is cleaned. Most notably, city officials
more than doubled the level of chlorine disinfectant added to the
fountain's water. Doug Taylor, deputy director of the city's Public Works
Department, said the agency now changes the water in the 4 000-gallon water
reservoir daily, rather than once a week. The fountain, which opened 3
years ago and draws hundreds of visitors daily, and the area surrounding it
is also being pressure cleaned weekly.
The city plans to shut down the fountain for regular maintenance 1 Nov 2000
and will consider installing an improved filtration system and other
methods of disinfecting the water. They will also consider pre-entrance
showers.

[It seems that we are in an epidemic of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.
Doubling the chlorination will probably have no effect as the parasites are
known to be resistant to chlorine. Rigorous filtration is probably the way
to control outbreaks in pools and fountains. -Mod.EP
