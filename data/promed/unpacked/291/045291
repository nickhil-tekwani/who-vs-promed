In ProMED-mail post 20090219.0694, with the above referenced title,
the 1st paragraph appeared as follows:

"The number of children killed from rabies in Luanda rose to 69 on
Wednesday [18 Feb 2009], up from 50 last month, prompting authorities
to launch a new drive to round up hundreds of stray dogs in Angola's
capital city. The Health Ministry said health workers were rounding
up hundreds of strays in Luanda to counter the deadly virus that is
transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected animal. Almost
1000 dogs have already been collected since the rabies outbreak began
in November [2008]. Those that test positive for rabies are killed;
the others are released. "This is a tragedy because despite all the
efforts to control the rabies outbreak, things aren't getting any
better," Luis Bernardino, the director of Luanda's largest children's
hospital, told Reuters."

The paragraph above is very misleading. Although there is a test for
rabies in humans, the equivalent test is not available in dogs or
other animals or is not available with any degree of reliability.
Testing for rabies in dogs can be conducted only on central nervous
system (CNS) tissue removed from the cranium. Therefore, ProMED-mail
would like to point out that this means it can be done only when the
animal is dead.

A much better approach to controlling the rabies outbreak is to
vaccinate dogs. A good vaccination program safeguards people and
preserves the animals. It has been shown repeatedly in many countries
that mass killing of dogs does not decrease the incidence of rabies.
Successful canine vaccination programs have been implemented in a
wide variety of developing, resource-strapped countries such as
Nigeria and the Philippines, so it can be done. Moreover, it is
highly cost effective. The best way to decrease the incidence of
rabies in humans and to stop outbreaks is through vaccination of
urban dogs.

One note of caution should be thoroughly understood, though. While
there have been highly successful campaigns in a wide variety of
countries, there have also been multiple situations in which
seroprevalence studies on urban dog populations have shown inadequate
protection after vaccination. So while vaccination campaigns can
work, they must be implemented effectively under the local conditions
and with appropriate supporting tactics, such as community education
and stray dog control. - Mods.TG,MHJ,AS,TD,PC.
