Rhizoctonia alert for growers
-----------------------------
Rhizoctonia bare patch could be the main soil borne disease risk to
cereal crops -- particularly those sown late -- this season according
to the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC).

GRDC manager for crop protection Dr Rohan Rainbow said recent dry
seasons and reduced carbon inputs from crop residues had caused a
decline in general biological activity, and this had favoured high
levels of rhizoctonia fungus. "Data from testing of soil samples from
415 paddocks across southern Australia showed that levels of
rhizoctonia were generally high in most cropping regions in South
Australia, as well as in western Victoria, the Geraldton and
Esperance regions of Western Australia and Deniliquin in New South
Wales," Dr Rainbow said.

"Sowing the crop early while the soil is still warm, and encouraging
early seedling vigour, is the best short-term strategy. Other
measures growers can take to reduce the impact of the disease include
deep banding nitrogen, minimising stubble incorporation at seeding,
ensuring adequate nutrition, and controlling autumn growth early."

[Rhizoctonia root rot (or bare patch) of cereals is caused by
_Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_), a
ubiquitous soil borne fungus associated with damping-off, root rot,
basal stem rot (foot rot), and fruit rot in a large number of crops.
It causes crop damage by pruning the root system, which results in
water and nutrient stress to the plant. Yield losses of up to 50
percent have been reported in cereal crops. The pathogen survives in
the upper soil, compost, and infected plant debris, and inoculum
levels increase on the roots of host plants.

The fungus has a wide host range, including cereals, pasture grasses,
oilseed rape, and pulses, making it difficult to control by crop
rotation. Disease management may include seed treatments, cultural
practices (such as fertiliser applications, timing of planting, weed
management during non-crop periods, selection of the style of seed
drill), and use of resistant crop varieties.

The practice of herbicides replacing the plough to improve soil
properties and prevent land degradation has been widely adopted in
Australia. However, the resulting build-up of organic matter and
preservation of fungal structures in the soil favours the pathogen
and consequently these direct-drilled cropping systems often face
very serious rhizoctonia problems.

High levels of inoculum in the soil increase the risk of crop damage.
Other factors, especially soil suppressive activity, which is a
function of the population, activity, and composition of the soil
microbial community, also play a role in disease development. Both
high soil inoculum and reduced soil suppressive activity is being
reported above compounding the risk for the indicated areas.
