Review of the avian influenza situation in Asia
------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health had an exchange
of views on the situation and the measures applicable with regard to avian
influenza (AI) in 10 Asian countries.
Japan and South Korea have submitted their final report on the AI situation
in their territory and on the measures taken to control the disease to the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). These countries can now be
considered free from avian influenza.
The Committee therefore agreed to a Commission proposal to lift the
restrictions applicable to the 2 countries. As we did not import poultry or
poultry meat from those 2 countries, the lifting applies only to pet birds.
For the 8 other Asian countries -- Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
China, Vietnam, Pakistan and Malaysia -- the suspension of the imports of
all poultry products and pet birds, now applicable until 31 Mar 2005 (see
MEX/04/1509), have been extended until 30 Sep 2005, as avian influenza is
either still present in these countries or they cannot be certified as
disease-free. This proposal will be formally adopted by the Commission in
the next weeks.
