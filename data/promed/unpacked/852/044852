New Mexico: 1st Human Case of 2004
------------------------------------
New Mexico has reported its 1st human West Nile virus case of 2004, in a
San Juan County man. The man had only mild symptoms and has recovered, the
state Health Department reported Wed 26 May 2004
The mosquito-borne virus killed 4 people in the state during 2003, all of
them in their 70s or older. The 1st human case in New Mexico was confirmed
in July [2003]. Eventually, 209 New Mexicans tested positive for West Nile
during 2003. This latest case means the West Nile virus season has started
early in 2004, Health Secretary Patricia Montoya said. The disease
typically causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, nausea, headache and
muscle aches. However, it can also lead to encephalitis, an infection of
the brain, or meningitis, an infection of the lining around the brain, and
can be fatal. The elderly are at most risk.
[New Mexico State Public Health Veterinarian Paul] Ettestad said in April
2004 it's difficult to predict what kind of season New Mexico might expect.
Mosquitoes in New Mexico appear in April, increase into May and hang around
until the 1st good frost -- anywhere from late September into November,
depending on the area of the state. West Nile virus was first discovered in
New Mexico in horses and birds in August 2002, but a vaccine for horses
exists. The state Health Department recommends it be given to horses as
early in the season as possible.
The National Animal Poison Control Center warns that insect repellant
should not be used on pets. Cats are highly sensitive to the chemicals, and
both dogs and cats lick themselves and could ingest toxins from the
repellants. So far, both cats and dogs have been fairly resistant to the virus.

[2] Birds - California

California: West Nile virus Suspected Cause of Bird Deaths
---------------------------------------------------
Public health officials suspect that West Nile virus killed dozens of birds
in recent months, including several this week in the San Gabriel Valley.
Crows are genetically susceptible to the disease, which is transmitted by
the bite of an infected mosquito, said Kelly Middleton, a spokeswoman for
the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District.
"Southern California has a tremendous crow population. The fatality rate is
very high in crows -- between 70 to 80 percent,"' she said. "I would say
most of the calls (about dead crows) over the last 3 or 4 days have come
from Arcadia, Covina and West Covina,' Middleton said. "We've found them on
busy streets (and) residential areas. Crows (also) tend to go to school
grounds to feed."
Authorities from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and
the Mosquito and Vector Control District will hold a press briefing this
morning at Arcadia County Park to discuss the scope of the problem and
preventive measures the public can take. Initial testing by the county
indicates that so far in 2003, there could be 44 birds infected with West
Nile virus. However, the California Department of Health Services is still
evaluating those cases to determine whether the disease is present,
Middleton said. The county tests birds for the presence of antibodies to
West Nile virus. If the test comes back positive, then the dead bird is
sent to the state for confirmation, Middleton said. The state then looks
for the live virus in the bird. Antibodies only show that the bird
contracted West Nile at some point, but they don't indicate when. It could
be an old infection that the bird survived, only to succumb to some other
cause of death. The first infected bird in the Valley was found 24 Feb 2004
in the city of San Gabriel, Middleton said.

California: 1st West Nile Virus-positive Mosquitoes in in Los Angeles
--------------------------------------------------
Mosquitos from Pico Rivera have tested positive for West Nile virus, the
1st such laboratory results in Los Angeles County, health officials said on
Tue 25 May 2004. The finding, combined with the discovery of several birds
that died from the disease in recent weeks, prompted officials to warn
residents that California could be in for a large number of human cases
this summer.
"Although no human cases have yet been reported, because of the early
detection of the virus this year, the chance of an epidemic of West Nile
virus occurring in Los Angeles and neighboring counties is high," said Jack
Hazelrigg of the county's Vector Control District. West Nile virus, which
is transmitted from infected birds to people through mosquito bites,
appeared in California during 2003, where 3 human cases were confirmed.

USGS West Nile Virus Maps 2004 Now Being Posted
-----------------------------------------------
County level maps showing 2004 West Nile virus activity in the United
States are now being posted on the U.S. Geological Survey web site:
<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>
The web site has been completely re-engineered for 2004 with major
improvements in efficiency, appearance, and usability (if the site does not
appear different, click the refresh button on your browser to clear out the
old page stored in cache).
The maps depict the information contained in the ArboNET database of
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The maps are updated every
Tuesday using the ArboNET data from 3 a.m. that morning. These same data
are used to prepare the MMWR West Nile virus summary reports for that week.
