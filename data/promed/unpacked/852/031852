The number of inhabitants of the Rostov region who contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) after tick bites has reached 50 people. This dangerous disease was diagnosed in residents of Rostov (1 case), Novocherkassk (1), Volgodonsk and Belaya Kalitva areas (2 cases in the each of these districts), Veselovsky, Dubovsky, Zernogradskiy, Krasny Sulin, Morozovskiy, Myasnikovsky, Neklinovskiy, Oblivsky, Remontnensky and Tselinsky districts (1 case in the each of these districts).

Most cases of tick bites were registered in Salsk (14), Semikarakorsk, Martinovski (7), Orlovsky (5), Zimovnikovskiy (5) and proletarian (3) areas.

Since the beginning of the year [2015], 1 case with a fatal outcome was recorded in the Rostov region. A resident of a remote farm in the Zimovnikovskiy district died from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever after a tick bite. His relatives saw the symptoms of the disease. Only after he fell into a coma and was transferred to the hospital, did it became clear that was the cause of the disease.

[54 CCHF cases were registered for all of last year [2014] in the Rostov region; this year the situation may be worse. CCHF cases continue to be recorded there and in the neighboring regions. So far in 2015, 19 cases of CCHF have been recorded In the Stavropol region and 3 cases have been diagnosed in the Volgograd region. - Mod.NP

The Rostov region is endemic for CCHF virus. There were 39 cases in the region during January-June of 2014. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people active in the outdoors where there are ticks, as well as those involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
