From: Michele Tremblay <MTrembla@santepub-mtl.qc.ca>

A team from the Montreal Public health department (Canada) is presently
working on the risks related to pigeon faeces in the workplace and the
preventive measures that ensue. The team is looking for different elements
regarding the following points and we ask the questions: what is the
estimated dose-response (what is the minimal infecting dose) for the
following agents: _Chlamydia psittaci_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_,
_Histoplasma capsulatum_ and _Candida albicans_?
The Atlanta Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of a
formaldehyde solution to disinfect places contaminated by _Histoplasma
capsulatum_. Is it the only effective disinfectant for this yeast? Can it
be replaced by less harmful solutions for human health such as quaternary
ammonium solutions or Javel water?
