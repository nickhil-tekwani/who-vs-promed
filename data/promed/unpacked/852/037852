Ag officials confirm equine encephalitis outbreak
---------------------
10 horses have died from Eastern equine encephalitis, and another 10 are
believed to have had the disease, the state Department of Health and
Hospitals said Thursday. The horses were in parts of DeSoto and Caddo
parishes, it said in a news release.
Owners should make sure their horses have been vaccinated for the disease
and get in touch with their veterinarians as soon as a horse becomes ill, a
news release said. It said the state veterinarian's office confirmed the
outbreak, which has affected only horses.
People also can get Eastern equine encephalitis. And, like horses, they are
more likely to get seriously ill or to die from EEE than from West Nile.
However, so far in 2004, no people have become sick from that virus --
though there have been 55 human cases of West Nile, 2 of St. Louis
encephalitis, and 2 of LaCrosse virus.
The news release said doctors, clinics, or hospitals that use private
laboratories should ask them to check for EEE as well as West Nile virus,
especially in Caddo and DeSoto parishes.

[A quick look at the ProMED-mail archive indicates the regular occurrence
of both equine and human cases of EEE over the past few years. 2004
started early, with reports in early July. With the highly abnormal
amounts of rainfall from hurricanes and tropical depressions, we might well
expect more reports. A vaccine is available for horses.
There have been approximately 200 human cases in the United States since
1964. Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey usually have the most
cases. - Mod.PC]
