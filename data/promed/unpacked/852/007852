Bird flu might have spread to more provinces in Indonesia
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities have so far confirmed that the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus has infected fowl through 23 of Indonesia's 33 provinces, but
senior officials said new infections were suspected elsewhere and
that the outbreaks increase the risk of the virus mutating into a
strain that's more contagious to humans and could lead to a pandemic
that health experts fear could kill millions.
"It might have spread to more than 23 provinces," Agriculture
Minister Anton Apriantono told reporters. "University students have
collected samples from chickens in Kalimantan, Sumatra and other
places. We are now analyzing them."
Apriantono expected that the test results, conducted on blood and
other samples from fowl collected by veterinary students from 4
universities, would be announced on 15 Dec 2005.

Avian flu threat returns
-------------------------
Virus H5, responsible for the development of avian influenza, was
found 2 days ago, following tests run on samples from a fowl in the
village of Scarlatesti, the commune of Ciresu, Braila County.
This focus of avian flu adds to those already found at Ceamurlia de
Jos, Maliuc and Caraorman, Tulcea County in early October 2005. The
infected samples at Scarlatesti will be sent for further testing at a
specialized laboratory in the UK, as decided by the Anti-epizootic
National Committee. Braila Prefect Nicolae Mitroi ordered that grade
one quarantine be immediately enforced in the village of Scarlatesti.
Manned road blocks consisting of gendarme and police crews prevent
humans, animals and poultry from leaving the village of Scarlatesti
until the avian flu focus has been completely eradicated, and entry
into the focus area is only allowed after the individuals concerned
have been briefed accordingly.
Not only that, the population is also instructed on the danger posed
by avian influenza. Authorities at Ciresu take measures aimed at
ensuring a steady supply of foodstuffs and other bare essentials, the
supplies being ferried without allowing any access to the isolated
area. Local measures have been taken to isolate the virus.
Experts with the Braila Sanitary Veterinarian and Food Safety
Department are coordinating the action with a view towards
eliminating the focus of the viral infection at Scarlatesti. The
vaccination of the local populace began yesterday [27 Nov 2005, see
comment further], and so did the killing and incineration of all the
fowl in the village, with payment of commensurate compensation.
The Agricultural and Rural Development Department sent teams to the
scene to assess the poultry contingent to be sacrificed in any
homestead in order to pay damage compensation. Given that the closest
populated location is 3 km away from the village of Scarlatesti, bird
killings only apply within the radius of the village. Scarlatesti has
nearly 400 homesteads, with an estimated 15 000 fowl. No fewer than
249 test samples have been tested in Braila County since early October 2005.
The European Union maintains the restrictions on imports of poultry
from 6 counties in eastern Romania: Tulcea, Constanta, Galati,
Braila, Ialomita and Calarasi, but will lift the ban for the other
regions starting 1 Dec 2005, the National Sanitary Veterinarian and
Food Safety Authority says. However, the ban on imports of live fowl
from Romania is still in force. The EU suspended in mid-October 2005
the imports of poultry and live fowl from Romania after reports of
fowl infected with the avian flu virus.

[The above Romanian newswire is more lucid and detailed than
yesterday's (27 Nov 2005) posting on the outbreak in Scarlatesti
(20051127.3441). This piece refers specifically to the control
measures and the protection of public health. The vaccination of the
local populace (with the standard annual human vaccine) has been
suggested to prevent mixed infections with human and avian influenza
viruses, a situation which theoretically might lead to virus
reassortment (see item [2] in 20051010.2950). This vaccination policy
was applied in the Netherlands during the H7N7 HPAI outbreak of 2003,
for those at risk of exposure to infected birds . It has been widely
applied in Tulcea, Romania, since the onset of the avian influenza
outbreaks there in October 2005.
According to the official notifications to the OIE, the vaccination
of poultry against avian influenza is not prohibited in Romania.
However, no avian vaccination has been reported. Further information will help.
It will also be useful to be informed about whether the new outbreak
was detected due to clinical manifestation of AI in turkeys or rather
by sampling within the reportedly ongoing surveillance activity
(sera? cloacal swabs? other tissues?). - Mod.AS]
