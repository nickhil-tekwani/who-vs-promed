In a recently released report (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014; 63(25); 552-3 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6325a5.htm?s_cid=mm6325a5_w) during 19 Sep 2013-15 Dec 2013, a total of 175 cases of cholera were confirmed in La Huasteca (159 in Hidalgo, 14 in Veracruz, and 2 in San Luis Potosi).

These cases and those of 2013 occurred in La Huasteca (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Huasteca) area, a geographical and cultural region located in Mexico along the Gulf of Mexico that includes parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, and Guanajuato. It is roughly defined as the area in which the Huastec people had influence when their civilization was at its height in the Mesoamerican period. Today, the Huastecs occupy only a fraction of this region, with the Nahua people now the most numerous indigenous group. - Mod.LL]

A cholera epidemic raging in southern Benin killed 7 out of 150 cases recently counted, the Minister of Health Services said Monday, 14 Jul 2014. "The epidemic (cholera) broke out in the health area of Allada-Ze-Toffo [the separate towns in the south] and has unfortunately already killed 7 people (...) of the 150 cases recorded," said Akoko Kinde Gazar to AFP.

"This is a disease that has quickly evolved due to the non-reporting of some cases. But today, 14 Jul 2014, we have taken steps to control the epidemic," Dr Didier Agbozognigbe, Coordinator of the infected health zone, told AFP.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Bauchi State)
Date: Thu 17 Jul 2014

The cholera outbreak which began in January [2014] in Bauchi State, northeastern Nigeria, is now over. More than 15 500 cases were reported, and about 14 000 of those were treated by MSF teams in Bauchi. 14 of the 20 districts of Bauchi State were affected by the cholera outbreak; however, Bauchi district accounted for over 90 percent of all the cases reported (population of Bauchi district is nearly 608 000). 2 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak, MSF intervened, beginning with a cholera treatment unit (CTU) of 30 beds in Kandahar (a suburb of Bauchi town) then a 150-bed cholera treatment center (CTC) at the main teaching hospital of Bauchi Town.

"This outbreak is more significant than the one we faced 4 years ago in the same state. [The] number of cases is higher, but fortunately the case fatality rate remained low at 0.5 per cent, bringing the number of deaths to 83 so far," said Dr Abubakr Bakri, head of mission in Abuja.

Between 40 and 45 per cent of cases were severe, requiring hospitalization for intravenous rehydration. In total, MSF teams treated over 8500 inpatients in the cholera treatment centers. 30 oral rehydration points were set up by MSF in the district to treat non-severe cases.

In this type of epidemic, and especially in a country or a city where the population is in the hundreds of thousands, it is important to contain the outbreak through preventive measures such as targeted hygiene measures to avoid contamination (especially of drinking water). In Bauchi, water supply is mainly from either public or private wells.

[4] Cholera, suspected - Nigeria (Plateau State)
Date: Mon 14 Jul 2014

http://allafrica.com/stories/201407141641.html


4 children of the same parents and 2 others have died, while several others are said to have been affected by an outbreak of a disease suspected to be cholera in Dangi town, Kanam Local Government Area of Plateau State.

Deputy Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, who is also the Supervisory Counselor for Health, Umar Yakubu Albura, told newsmen at the weekend in Jos, that "the recent outbreak of cholera in Kanam has become a source of worry to the health department of the local government, because 3 days ago, 4 children of one family and 2 other adults died of cholera, and many others are already affected."

Albura added: "We are highly disturbed by the spread of profuse diarrhea and vomiting in Dengi and the surrounding villages. Although we received medical support from the state Ministry of Health in order to curtail spread of the disease, a good number of the affected persons prefer patronizing local health workers for treatment, rather than going to hospital, and that has a negative effect in coordinating and controlling the disease."

But Plateau State Epidemiologist, Dr Raymond Juryit, who led an outbreak investigation team and journalists to Dengi, said: "All the patients admitted were affected by malaria, typhoid and other tropical infections that are associated with diarrhea and vomiting, but it is not cholera. We have gone round to hospitals and clinics within Dengi town, including the General Hospital, but we could not establish a single case of cholera. All those we found had malaria, typhoid, shigella and other infections; 3 weeks ago, we received a report from our Disease Surveillance Officer in Dengi, and when we verified, 34 suspected cholera cases were recorded with one dead."
