Three people, including an 11-year-old child, were hospitalized with
a diagnosis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the Volgograd
Region (Oblast). The healthcare administration has told
representatives of the Regnum News Agency that all 3 patients are
residents of the Kotelnikovskiy district of the Volgograd Region.
According to healthcare staff, the infections were a direct result of
tick bites rather than contact with livestock. The condition of the 3
patients is stable, and not life-threatening.

The 1st fatal case in 2006 of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
has been recorded in Stavropol. Public health officials are alarmed
by the increasing frequency of the outbreaks of this disease this
year. As of 23 May 2006, 4 more people have been diagnosed with the
same disease; they are residents of the the Budenovskiy, Ipatovskiy,
and Petrovskiy districts. All the infections are related to
inadequate treatment following contact with agricultural livestock
[It is unclear what treatment would be effective other than tick
removal. - Mod.LM]. One of the patients has already died. Epidemics
of CCHF have been reported in Stavropol every year, but fatalities
have been rare.
The vectors of the disease are ticks. Public health physicians are
warning that despite special tick control measures, attacks by ticks
on people and animals are continuing. Beginning in the last 10 days
of May and continuing into June, scientists are predicting [enhanced
risk] of infection not only through contact with livestock, but also
directly from the environment [from ticks] during farming and
recreational activities.

[Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic or potentially
endemic in many parts of southern Russia and another 34 countries in
Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The disease is transmitted
by ticks and the reservoirs are domestic animals. CCHF virus can be
transmitted to humans directly by tick-bite, by nosocomial spread in
hospitals, or by blood-borne transmission during the husbandry and
slaughter of domestic animals. Cases arising by transmission from
ticks are usually sporadic, whereas clusters of cases can be
indicative of blood-borne transmission associated with the
slaughtering of animals (mainly sheep, which normally do not exhibit
signs of disease). Livestock raising is an important occupation and
there are thriving tick populations.
Stavropol and Volgograd are located in the Caucasus region of
southwestern Russia:
