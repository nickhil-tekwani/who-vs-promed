The worst affected district by the dengue epidemic, which Health
Ministry sources called "hyper-endemic," is Jaffna, according to
government Epidemiology unit ( GEU) data. The total number of dengue
fever and DHF cases reported through hospital admissions for the
months of January and February this year [2010] was 1580, with a
slight drop in February 2010 (764) compared to 816 in January 2010.

Health sources claim that frequent visitors from Colombo and other
parts of the country to Jaffna following the end of the war last year
[2009], has been the cause for this new surge in the number of dengue
cases in a town which was virtually dengue free in the past.

The number of deaths in the 1st 2 months of the year [2010] in Jaffna
was 8, which was the highest on record in all the districts for the
1st 2 months of the year. Gampaha ranked the 2nd highest high-risk
city for the 1st 2 months of the year, recording 597 cases in January
2010 and 471 in February 2010, with the total number of cases at 1068
with 6 deaths. Colombo took 3rd place with 584 cases of dengue in
January 2010 and 434 in February 2010, bringing the number of cases
to 1018 and 7 deaths.

Other areas which recorded a significant number of dengue cases in
the 1st 2 months of this year [2010] included Batticaloa, which had
541 cases, Anuradhapura with a total of 485, Vavuniya with a total of
414, Trincomalee 430, Puttlam 370, Kurunegala 316 and Kalmunai 279
cases. No cases have been registered in Kilinochchi or Mulaitivu by
the GEU.

Consultant Epidemiologist, Dr. Hasitha Tissera told The Nation that
one of the main causes for the sudden surge in dengue cases was the
proliferation of man-made mosquito breeding sites. He warned of a
further increase in the number of dengue cases with the onset of the
monsoon rains expected in May [2010]. "Dengue is a preventable
disease. The most effective way to control its spread is to reduce
[mosquito vector] breeding sites. The public must take up this
challenge and start cleaning up their immediate environment without
delay," he emphasised.

Last year [2009], which was described as recording the highest number
of dengue cases ever in the history of this island, had 34 896 cases
and 345 deaths. According to health sources, the number of cases
reported in the 1st 2 months of 2009 were less than those recorded
this year [2010]. "So, unless we act fast and make a collective
effort to clean our environment, we could have another, bigger dengue
epidemic on our hands," Dr. Tissera said.

An official says Malaysia is urging people to take precautions
against dengue fever after a rise in deaths from the mosquito-borne
virus. Health Ministry official Lim Chau Leng says 31 people have
died after catching the disease in the 1st 2 months of the year
[2010], compared with 28 deaths in the same period last year [2009].
More than 8000 people caught dengue fever in January and February
[2010], the peak time for infection after monsoon rains. Last week
alone, 6 people died.

Lim said Friday [26 Feb 2010] that people must keep their
surroundings clean and destroy mosquito breeding grounds, such as
stagnant pools of water. They should seek treatment if they have such
symptoms as high fever, joint pains and nausea.

The scenario recorded in units of the Hospital Ana Costa in Santos,
in Santos Baixada [an area that includes Bertioga, Cubatao, Guaruja,
Itanhaem, Mongagua, Peruibe, Praia Grande, Santos and Sao Vicente] on
the Sao Paulo coast, is an epidemic of dengue, a situation soon to be
officially confirmed in the region. Among the 59 admissions of
patients over 12 years of age, 22 had a diagnosis of DHF. Among
children, 12 of 28 [hospital] admissions had this [clinical] picture.
Thus, 39 percent of cases hospitalized in the Hospital Ana Costa
Hospital up to 1 Mar [2010] were DHF.

The study also shows that 173 suspected cases of dengue were reported
in the days between 11 Jan-11 Mar [2010] just in the Santos unit. The
data were presented this morning [3 Mar 2010] by the hospital's
director, Jose Luiz Boechat Paione, the infectious disease physician
and Technical Director of the Division of Communicable Infectious and
Parasitic diseases of FMUSP [Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao
Paulo], Evaldo Stanislau Affonso de Araujo, and the person
responsible for the department of pediatrics, Ana Costa, Paulo Sergio
Ciola.

With data and professional experience, Palone and Araujo believe the
hospital presents a scenario of an epidemic. They cannot say that
situation is the same throughout the state but believe it is an
expected picture that very soon will be officially confirmed.

The Santos Baixada recorded 763 confirmed cases, according to the
last official total reported. Santos and Guaruja already confirmed 3
deaths from the disease.
