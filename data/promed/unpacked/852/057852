Despite a recent increase in the number of serious cases in Israel, including among the fully vaccinated, those who received both doses of the vaccine against COVID-19 are significantly less likely to experience severe illness, according to data released by the Israeli Health Ministry.

As of [Sun 8 Aug 2021], the ministry recorded 85.6 severe COVID-19 cases per 100 000 people among the unvaccinated over the age of 60, compared with 16.3/100 000 people among the fully vaccinated. This makes the unvaccinated elderly more than 5 times as likely to experience a severe case than their immunized counterparts.

For those under the age of 60, the rate of severe illness among the unvaccinated stood at 1.4 cases per 100 000 people - 2.8 times more than the 0.5/100 000 among those who received 2 doses of the vaccine.

According to the data, while the risk of experiencing severe symptoms increases with age for both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, it rises much more dramatically among the unvaccinated. For those aged between 60 and 69, there are 43.4 cases per 100 000 among the unvaccinated, as opposed to only 6.5 for the fully vaccinated. This rises to 65 and 16 cases, respectively, for those aged 70--79 and to 227.8 and 33.1 for those aged 80--89.

Speaking with Haaretz during a live Q&A last week, Professor Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's expert panel on COVID-19, said: "there's no question" that people who are unvaccinated are at a higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. "You can see this in the most simple graphs published by the Health Ministry. When you look at Israelis above the age of 60 and you examine severe illness rates - not numbers, rates, which means the number of illnesses per a specific number of the population - then what you see is that among those who are unvaccinated, there's a considerably higher rate of severe illness than among the vaccinated," he explained.

While the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine may have waned somewhat over the past several months, those who are vaccinated are protected 5 to 10 times as much as those who are unable or unwilling to receive the shot, said Professor Nadav Davidovitch, director of the School of Public Health at Ben-Gurion University of the Desert, Be'er Sheva, and head of the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians. Both the length of time that has passed since vaccination and a patient's age can affect the likelihood of their contracting a severe case of COVID-19. "Those who were vaccinated in January are somewhat less protected compared to those vaccinated in, for example, March," Davidovitch said, adding that it is possible that the more infectious delta variant could also have an impact on the incidence of serious cases.

Israel saw a drop in new coronavirus cases [Sat 7 Aug 2021], with Sun's Health Ministry data revealing 886 new cases. Serious cases rose to 348 on [Sat 7 Aug 2021], 19 more than the previous day. Some 5.8 million Israelis have received at least one shot of the coronavirus vaccine. And of them, 422 326 have received 3 doses as part of the new campaign to give booster shots to the elderly and other vulnerable people.

The Health Ministry said late last month [July 2021] that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection and mild symptoms has dropped to 40%, although the data might be skewed because of issues with the small sampling size. It maintained that the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing hospitalizations and severe symptoms stood at 88% and 91%, respectively.

In a statement on [Mon 9 Aug 2021], the Government Press Office said that prime minister Naftali Bennett and health minister Nitzan Horowitz had held a discussion with the CEOs of Israel's 4 national health maintenance organizations "in order to increase the pace of vaccinations around the country." During a televised speech last month [July 2021], Bennett accused vaccine refusers of "endangering their health, their surroundings and all Israeli citizens."

The purpose of the vaccine had less to do with preventing transmission than providing "protection against mortality and severe illness," although such protection is a "welcome outcome," explained Professor Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University and Davidovitch's predecessor at the Association of Public Health Physicians.

While it now appears that there is "4 or 5 times lower incidence" of severe cases among the vaccinated, a fuller examination of the data, correcting for age and preexisting conditions, may reveal that the vaccine "is even more effective than seen from this graph," he said.

[2] PAHO / WHO: delta variant

Epidemiological update: increase of the delta variant and its potential impact in the region of the Americas
------------------------------------------------------------
In view of the increased circulation of the variant of concern (VOC) delta in several countries within and outside the Region of the Americas, which in some areas is accompanied by an increase in hospitalizations, the Pan-American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO / WHO) recommends reviewing preparedness plans and preparing for a possible increase in hospitalizations.

Introduction
Since the initial identification of SARS-CoV-2, as of [5 Aug 2021], more than 2.6 million complete genomic sequences have been shared worldwide, providing visibility and public access to this information. The ability to monitor viral evolution, almost in real time, has a direct impact on the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allows the identification of changes in epidemiological patterns, changes in virulence, or even a decrease in the preventive efficacy of vaccines, among other contributions. Globally, several countries with an increase in cases and hospitalizations with the emergence of variant of concern (VOC) delta can be observed (Figure 1), including member states in the Americas with high vaccination coverage.

With the VOC gamma as the predominant variant in several countries and territories of the Americas, and the emergence of the identification of VOC delta in these same countries and territories, in addition to other variants of interest (VOI) (Figure 2), such as lambda, for example, exhorts the necessity to point out to the member states of the region the importance of the preparatory process for the expansion of care capacity in the face of a potential increase in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In [July 2020], variant B.1.617.2 was first reported, which was subsequently designated as VOC delta, with significant health damage, however, over 13 months later, it has been reported by 135 countries globally and 24 countries and territories in the Americas Region. It is worth noting that since [April 2021], a global exponential increase in VOC delta samples has been observed.

In [July 2021], a global predominance of VOC delta was observed in almost 90% of the samples worldwide (Figure 3). Such predominance remains even after considering VOI in the analysis (Figure 4). Admittedly, this information regarding the variants must be evaluated with caution due to the possible biased representation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data (GSD), with a higher contribution from high-income countries (1). This bias should be considered when evaluating the graphs presented in this epidemiological update on the presence or absence of a particular variant in a location and its relative frequency.

The presence of a variant does not necessarily mean its circulation in the community as it may be sporadic or travel-associated cases. In addition, not all countries share their data through the GISAID platform, and genetic sequencing capacity may differ from one country to another, which may explain the silence in signaling VOC or VOI circulating in their territories, and therefore negatively influence the ability to structure the system in its healthcare response.

Canada has extended restrictions on direct flights from India to [21 Sep 2021]. In the United States, new coronavirus cases surged to the highest weekly level since early February [2021], fueled by the highly transmissible delta variant. Deaths rose by 49%, the biggest weekly increase since December [2021]. Hospitalizations in the state of Arkansas climbed to a record. The Pentagon will require members of the US military to get vaccinated by [15 Sep 2021]. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised the travel advisory for France and Israel to the highest level. Israel is considering lowering the minimum age for a 3rd dose of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot to 40 or 50 from 60.
