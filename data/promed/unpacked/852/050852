Here are excerpts from the most recent Ministry of Health press release on
the current Dengue Fever situation in Fiji.
Overall, there have been an estimated total of up to 3,000 clinically
suspected Dengue cases seen at Ministry of Health Facilities in the last
five weeks, with as many as 1,500 cases in the past week alone, including 3
deaths due to suspected Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. Actual numbers are
difficult to estimate due to the overflow of patients in Ministry of Health
Hospitals and Health Centres. These figures do not include cases seen by
private doctors. There have been no reports of visitors to Fiji being
affected to date.
Colonial War Memorial Hospital in the capital, Suva reports an average of
150 to 200 suspected cases per day in the outpatient department being
treated for fever and suspected Dengue. There were more than 30 admissions
in the past week, including three deaths from suspected Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever - a two year old girl, a 60 year old woman and a 10 year old boy.
This brings the current death toll to 6. At this rate, suspected cases seen
in outpatient departments to date are estimated at more than 1,200, with at
least 110 admissions at CWM. (The report in the Fiji Times on 15 / 01 / 98
was incorrect in stating that there were 30 to 35 admissions per day at CWM)
Lautoka Hospital reported 20 new admissions in the past week - including
several with signs of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. The epidemic has clearly
spread in the Western Division during the past week. Regional task forces
have been set up by to monitor and control the epidemic. The following
table shows reports and estimates received from the various facilities.
In the Eastern Division, suspected cases have been reported from Kadavu and
Ovalau islands. The islands of the Northern Division, with a population of
150,000 have reported only one case to date, known to have been imported
from Suva. The DMO Northern reports that the North is on the alert, and
that Town Councils and Rural Local Authorities have already organised clean
up campaigns and chemical spraying activities in an effort to prevent the
epidemic from occurring with the severity which it has occurred in Viti
Levu.
[Writer's note - an additional admitted case was reported in the Northern
Division yesterday afternoon, and confirmed on the spot as Dengue using new
screening test kits thanks to training of hospital staff, and assistance
from the South Pacific Commission.
Hospital Admissions since 07/01/98 Outpatients since 07/01/98
Colonial War Memorial ~50 ~700
Nausori / Wainibokasi at least 3 ~100-150
Navua 5
Korovou ??? ???
Levuka at least 3
Kadavu at least 2
Central / Eastern ~55 ~850 to 900
Lautoka 30 100 - 150
Nadi 5 ???
Ba Mission 6 ???
Nadroga 0 8
Tavua 2 ???
Rakiraki 2 23
Western Total 45 ~200
The epidemic is clearly in an explosive phase in Viti Levu, with an at-risk
population of more than 500,000. It is unclear how many persons will be
affected, and difficult to predict areas where the epidemic will spread.
Unless the public and community organisations respond by helping to destroy
mosquito breeding places, there are likely to be extremely large numbers of
persons affected, with the possibility of additional deaths from serious
cases.
The 1990-91 Dengue Fever epidemic claimed 40 lives, and there were at least
4,000 persons infected. The current epidemic, still in its early stages,
has already infected at least 3,000 and killed 6. Without strong support
from the public, business and community groups, the epidemic may worsen
with high costs to the nation in terms of health care expenses, untimely
deaths and lost productivity.
The Ministry of Health is calling for stronger support from the public,
community groups, and other Ministries to help destroy mosquito breeding
sites. Public Health inspectors have reported that the public has been slow
to respond. Clean up campaigns and chemical spraying have been conducted
intensively in affected areas.
