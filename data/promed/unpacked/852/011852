Just a comment or a thought perhaps shared by many, probably. I
wonder if PetSmart is going to track other customers/employees who
may have had contact with kittens using public announcement. This
seems appropriate unless the kittens were always behind solid display walls.

"At PetSmart, we are passionate about pets. We believe that every pet
should have a loving family and healthy, happy life. For this reason,
we made a conscious decision to not sell cats or dogs. Rather, we
dedicate space in every store to more than 3400 local animal welfare
organizations to help homeless dogs and cats find loving homes.
Here's how you can adopt a pet and save a life.
PetSmart and PetSmart Charities are committed to partnering with
animal welfare agencies that are passionate about finding loving
families for pets in need. In 2004, more than 373 000 pets found
homes through the PetSmart Charities Adoption Centers. The Centers
offer pet adoptions to customers year-round during regular store
hours. Adoption costs and pet availability varies from store to
store. Contact your local PetSmart store for details. Each of our
adoption partners is committed to matching pets up with the right pet
parent, promoting responsible pet ownership and safeguarding the
rights of homeless pets. Click here for more details on how your
animal welfare agency can become an adoption partner [see link at URL above].
PetSmart Charities is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization with a
vision of finding a lifelong, loving home for every pet. Its mission
is to create and support programs that save the lives of homeless
pets, and to promote healthy relationships with pet parents. Since
its inception in 1994, PetSmart Charities has given more than $39
million to local humane agencies."

[It was very kind of Dr. Bischoff to have sent in the policy of
PetSmart from their website. In the original posting (see reference
below), there was mention that the kitten came from a local charity
organization. An alert was issued as part of the generalized press
coverage of the event (see
<http://www.gazette.net/stories/060806/princou154652_31963.shtml>.
