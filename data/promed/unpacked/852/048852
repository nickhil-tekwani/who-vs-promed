A Tanzanian doctor working in Uganda who contracted Ebola has died, the 1st health worker killed by the disease in the latest outbreak in the country, Uganda's health minister said on Sat [2 Oct].

"I regret to announce that we have lost our 1st doctor, Dr Mohammed Ali, a Tanzanian national, 37-year-old male," the health minister, Jane Ruth Aceng, tweeted.

She said Ali had tested positive for Ebola on 26 Sep 2022 and died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Fort Portal, a town about 300 kilometres [about 186 miles] west of the capital Kampala.

Authorities in the east African nation announced the outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever on 20 Sep 2022, triggering fears of a major health crisis in the country of 45 million people.

There is no vaccine for the Sudan strain of the disease behind the latest Uganda infections.

The health ministry said on Fri [1 Oct 2022], before Ali's death, that the disease had so far infected 35 people and killed 7.

Ali was among 6 health workers who include doctors, an anaesthesiologist, and one medical student who have contracted the disease.

Ebola mainly spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The viral disease has symptoms including intense weakness, muscle pain, headaches, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, and rashes among others.

[This is very sad. He was only 37 years old and among the doctors and healthcare workers initially reported as infected. He likely became infected before Ebola was identified as circulating. Our sincerest condolences. Please see more on the needs of healthcare workers below. - Mod.LK

[3] Kenya (Kakamega County): ex Uganda, suspected
Date: Thu 30 Sep 2022 12:52 PM EAT

Kenyan health officials are investigating a suspected case of Ebola in the country's west near Uganda, where an outbreak of the deadly virus has been blamed for at least 35 cases and 7 deaths.

Kenya is on high alert after one patient suspected to have Ebola is being treated at St Mary's Hospital in western Kenya.

St Mary's Hospital administrator Hildah Apwao told reporters the man recently traveled to Uganda and visited a health facility there for treatment of a cut. The man is now in an isolation unit at St Mary's hospital located in Mumias, Kakamega County awaiting laboratory results.

Kenya's neighbor, Uganda, has recorded 35 Ebola cases and 7 deaths since the 1st case was confirmed last week [20 Sep 2022].

The current outbreak of Ebola is attributed to the Ebola Sudan strain and is believed to have started in the Mubende district in central Uganda.

Last week, Kenya issued health guidelines -- like screening travelers from Uganda -- following the outbreak. East African health experts advised against closing the border to deal with the virus.

Health officials in Kenya called for more awareness about the disease and better follow-up if symptoms are witnessed. Ebola is a disease spread through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Symptoms include body aches, vomiting, and internal bleeding.

Uganda recorded the presence of a different strain of the virus in 2019 and the Sudan strain was found in 2012.

[Hopefully, the suspect case did not have contact with a large number of individuals before going to the clinic in Kenya upon returning from Uganda. There is a chance this may have been prevented had the 1st step suggested by Mosoka Fallah, who was on the front lines in Liberia serving as the head of case detection for the National Ebola Response team [see ProMED Ebola update (21): Uganda 20221002.8705908], been in place; that is, set up a simple but robust cross-border surveillance system to prevent further spread. But Kenya is now on high alert, which will help, should the case be confirmed as Ebola. - Mod.LK

[4] Uganda: summary
Date: Fri 1 Oct 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/world/africa/uganda-ebola-outbreak.html


In central Uganda, where the cases were reported, at least 6 medical workers have contracted the virus, leading some of their peers to request transfer elsewhere. Parents, concerned their children will catch the highly contagious virus, are withdrawing them from schools. And in a nation that has faced multiple Ebola outbreaks since it reported its first case in 2000, worries persist that another fast-spreading virus could precipitate restrictions that would devastate an economy still reeling from coronavirus shutdowns.

"The whole situation gives me a lot of worries," Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the World Health Organization's representative to Uganda, said in a phone interview.

With the virus spreading to a 4th district on Friday [1 Oct 2022] and affecting an area covering a radius of more than 75 miles [about 121 km], "we are at a disadvantage," he said.

So far, Ugandan officials have ruled out issuing stay-at-home orders or curfews or restricting movement in schools, markets, or houses of worship.

"There is no need for anxiety, panic, restriction of movements or unnecessary closure of public places," President Yoweri Museveni said after a televised speech this week. Mr Museveni, who introduced stringent lockdowns during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic 2 years ago, said his nation had the ability to bring the Ebola virus to heel.

Uganda is also working with neighboring countries, including Rwanda and Kenya, to step up vigilance at land borders and at airports.

The latest outbreak in Uganda became public on 20 Sep 2022, when health officials announced they had confirmed a case in a 24-year-old man who had been admitted to a hospital in the Mubende district, about 90 miles [about 145 km] from the capital, Kampala.

The patient had developed symptoms -- including high fever and bleeding in the eyes -- as early as 11 Sep 2022 and had traveled to multiple clinics seeking assistance. He was eventually isolated and hospitalized on 15 Sep 2022, but died 5 days later.

In his televised address, Mr Museveni said the patient had said people with similar symptoms from his village had also died.

The delay in identifying and tracing the 1st human case, along with the fact that it was reported in a district abutting a key highway, has raised concerns that the virus has spread to major urban centers and neighboring countries. The WHO has said there were at least 18 more probable deaths and 19 more infections linked to the current outbreak.

The Sudan strain of the virus was last detected by Uganda in 2012. Those infected cannot spread the virus until symptoms appear, which can come after an incubation period ranging from 2-21 days.

Existing vaccines -- like the injectable vaccine Ervebo, which proved successful in tackling the Zaire strain in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo -- do not protect against the Sudan strain.

But experts hope that will soon change.

Mr Yonas said at least 6 vaccine candidates were at different phases of development that can possibly guard against the Sudan strain. 2 of those vaccines could proceed to a clinical trial in Uganda in the coming weeks after facing regulatory and ethics reviews from the Ugandan government.

The 2 vaccines likely to go ahead are being developed by the Washington-based Sabin Vaccine Institute and the University of Oxford. If approved, the single-dose Sabin vaccine would most likely be the 1st in line for trial. As new evidence emerges on the remaining vaccine candidates, the W.H.O. said it would work with an independent group of experts to help evaluate their suitability.

For now, health officials and multiple nongovernmental organizations are responding to the crisis by training medical workers, setting up new isolation units, and facilitating more laboratories for testing.

More than 400 people who came into contact with those infected have also been successfully traced. 2 patients were also discharged from the hospital late on Fri, according to the WHO.

Officials have also started multiple outreach campaigns to educate the public on how to protect themselves, not stigmatize the infected and report those showing symptoms, said Oluma Jacob, a health adviser with Medical Teams International, an aid group responding to the outbreak.

This was done, he said, because "there was fear and a lot of panic in the community" when the cases were first reported in central Uganda. That panic was evident among parents in Mubende district, where the 1st case was detected.

Nkwesiga Maxim, the principal of St Kizito Madudu Roman Catholic Primary School in Mubende, said that more than half of the school's students had not been attending classes. "We have too much fear," he said.

His sentiments were echoed by frontline health workers, who say the lack of proper compensation and protection -- particularly for medical interns -- was putting their lives at risk. The 6 health workers who were infected included 4 doctors, an anesthesiologist, and a medical student, Mr Museveni said. On Saturday [2 Oct 2022], Uganda's health minister announced that one of the doctors had died [see item [1] above].

Luswata Herbert, the secretary general of the Uganda Medical Association, said that if the government did not remedy the situation quickly, "health workers will refuse to attend to patients because they fear for their lives and their rights."

[It is critical that 1st responders and healthcare workers have personal protective equipment and complete training to prevent infection when treating patients even before they are confirmed as Ebola cases. They are at the greatest risk at that time and are more likely to take fewer precautions. Tedros @WHO is working with @MinofHealthUG "to strengthen infection prevention & control, & we have sent personal protective equipment to all private & public health facilities in the affected districts. Additional supplies are on the way to Mubende from Kampala." This is good news.

And the community needs good messaging from leaders to educate them about safe practices, which should help to quell fears. The children could be taught in the schools and help pass on the message to their parents at home.

Two survivors have been released from the Mubende Regional Referral Hospital, but sadly one of the recovered patients lost his wife and child to Ebola virus disease. Our thoughts go out to him. - Mod.LK]
