Leishmaniasis, a kind of fever widely reported in the northeast states, has reached Kerala shores. One person died due to the severity of the new found disease in Kozhikode district.

Migrant labourers from Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bangal are the carriers of leishmaniasis. The fever has claimed many lives in these states. Experts in the health department have warned of the spread of the disease through migrant labourers in the state.

They have also identified the species of sand fly that can transmit the virus through biting in Thiruvananathapuram, Kozhikode, and Eranakulam.

A native of Kozhikode who worked as an agent for providing migrant labourers died 2 months ago due to the disease.

The main symptom of leishmaniasis is a chronic fever that may continue for 2 weeks to 2 months.

[No animal reservoir host could be identified despite many surveys, and transmission is believed to be anthroponotic, with infected patients and PKDL* cases constituting the source of infection (Bern C et al. Of cattle, sand flies and men: a systematic review of risk factor analyses for South Asian visceral leishmaniasis and implications for elimination. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2010;4:e599) *[PKDL or "post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis," is a cutaneous condition that is characterized by a macular, depigmented eruption found mainly on the face, arms, and upper part of the trunk. It occurs years after the successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. - CopyEd.MSP].

PKDL occurs in an estimated 5-10 percent of patients and within 5 years of disease onset (Ramesh V. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis Int J Dermatol 1995; 34:95-101). It often remains untreated. A recent survey of 4323 households (2010) in a highly endemic area of Bihar showed a PKDL incidence of 0.5/1000 population (Alvar J et al. and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. India: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671).

Recently, CL cases (12 with active lesions out of 38 people examined) and VL cases (2) have been reported in South India, Kerala, which has implications for the existing elimination program (Kesavan A et al. Indigenous visceral leishmaniasis: two cases from Kerala. Indian Pediatrics 2003;40:373-4; Simi SM et al. Searching for cutaneous leishmaniasis in tribals from Kerala, India. Glob Infect Dis.2010;2:95-100). - Mod.EP
