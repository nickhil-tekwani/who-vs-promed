Health officials have issued a warning for the Greater Glasgow and
Clyde area and begun an "urgent investigation" after uncovering a 5th
case of _Legionella_ pneumonia.

Just hours after a 30-year-old woman arrived at a city hospital
showing symptoms of the potentially fatal infectious disease, health
chiefs have announced an investigation into the unusual rise in
cases.

Dr Syed Ahmed, NHS (National Health Service) Greater Glasgow and
Clyde's Lead Consultant in Public Health, said: "There are always a
small number of cases of _Legionella_ pneumonia in the community every
year, however this rise in the number of cases so close together is
unusual. As a result we have begun an urgent investigation with Health
Protection Scotland and Environmental Health colleagues today to
examine if there is any potential common source or whether these cases
are coincidental, albeit unusual. At this early stage in these
investigations we have established no link between the cases.

"It is important to remember that _Legionella_ cannot be spread from
person to person. It is an uncommon bacterial infection. _Legionella_
bacteria are found in water and can be spread through aerosols
produced from water, such as air conditioning and showers and it
cannot be contracted by drinking contaminated water. The symptoms and
signs of Legionnaires' disease include headache, fever, dry cough,
breathing difficulties, stomach pains and diarrhoea. I would like to
advise anyone currently with these symptoms to contact NHS or their
own GP."

The woman, who has not been named, is currently in a critical
condition and is being treated in an Intensive Therapy Unit. The 3
other people who have been affected are said to be stable and are all
responding well to treatment.

To date, 2 more people have died during an outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease, bringing the death toll to 3.

NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC)
launched an urgent investigation last week after a "most unusual rise"
in the number of cases, and said it was now being treated as an
outbreak. And NHSGGC confirmed a further 2 cases of Legionnaires'
disease, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 7.

[According to the news releases above, there are now 7 confirmed
cases of Legionnaires' disease, including 3 deaths, in Greater
Glasgow, Scotland so far this year. The incidence of
community-acquired Legionnaires' disease varies widely with the
setting and availability of methods for diagnosing the infection.
However, in 2003, 34 countries with a population of 467.76 million in
the European Working Group for Legionella Infections reported a total
of 4578 cases, meaning an average rate across Europe of 9.8 per
million population
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs285/en/).

Greater Glasgow, which consists of all localities that are physically
attached to the city of Glasgow, had a population of 1 199 629 at the
2001 census
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Glasgow). The incidence rate
of Legionnaires' disease for Greater Glasgow for the 1st 5 months of
this year is thus about 6 per million population. The news releases
above do not give the incidence rate for Legionnaires' disease for
Glasgow in prior years, although a recent "most unusual rise" in the
number of cases was noted; nevertheless one of the news releases
states that there is so far no known link between the cases.

No mention is made if there is a species of _Legionella_ common among
the cases or if so, there is a common genotype among the isolates of
the organism. The predominance of one genotype in patient specimens
would suggest transmission from a common source. Frequently, however,
this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks because the diagnosis of
Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than
isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract
specimens, in which case genotyping of clinical isolates is, of
course, not possible.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is a National Health Service board in
West Central Scotland, created from the amalgamation of NHS Greater
Glasgow and part of NHS Argyll and Clyde. It is the largest health
board in the United Kingdom
