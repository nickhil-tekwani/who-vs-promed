Three cases of dengue 1 virus infection from islands in the Gulf of
Thailand, Comm Dis Intell 1998;22:107-109, E Geoffrey Playford, et al.
Abstract: Three Australian tourists who recently traveled to islands in the
Gulf of Thailand developed febrile illnesses associated with myalgias,
thrombocytopenia, and atypical lymphocytosis. Dengue 1 virus was isolated
from all three patients. The patients' clinical features and serological
and virological investigations are presented. These cases highlight the
need for awareness of dengue amongst travelers and the preventive
precautions required when visiting endemic regions. After the urgent
exclusion of malaria, dengue should be considered in the the differential
diagnosis of febrile persons who have recently returned from endemic
regions.
...Although it is considered unlikely that dengue will become endemic in
Australia, large outbreaks can result from imported cases in the dengue
receptive areas. Doctors should be alert to the possibility of dengue in
travelers from dengue endemic areas in order to diagnose cases early.
Prompt notification of suspected cases occurring in the dengue receptive
areas is vital to allow rapid public health action to limit the spread of
the virus.
