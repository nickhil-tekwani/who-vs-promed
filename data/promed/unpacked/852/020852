Hundreds of thousands of apparently healthy cattle could be infected with
BSE, new Swiss data suggest. For every case of mad cow disease in
Switzerland, more than 100 animals may be "silently" carrying the
infection. If this pattern holds true in Britain, the number of British
cattle carrying the disease last year will have exceeded 450,000. Last
year, Switzerland started slaughtering herds in which a case of BSE had
been confirmed. The Swiss Federal Veterinary Office then began looking for
signs of BSE in the brains of these apparently healthy cattle.
These tests have just been repeated using a sensitive diagnostic test
developed by Prionics, a company in Zürich. In the Prionics test, brain
tissue is homogenised, then treated with an enzyme to break down proteins
apart from the rogue form of PrP, the protein that becomes misshapen in
BSE. The mix is then put on a gel in an electric field, which separates the
remaining protein fragments. Malformed PrP is detected using an antibody
that binds tightly to the protein. Previous tests of this type, called
Western blots, have taken three days. "We can have a result in 12 hours,
before a carcass leaves the slaughterhouse," says Markus Moser of Prionics.
Only one or two cases of BSE typically occur in each affected herd in all
countries in which the disease has shown up. "The official theory is that
only the sick cows ate a lump of infectious feed," says Moser. "But other
cattle may be infected, and just haven't shown symptoms."
The Prionics test has confirmed this. Of 1761 healthy cows slaughtered in
the culling programme, eight tested positive for BSE. Six of these were
also picked up by the veterinary office using other tests. Eight infected
cows out of 1761 gives a rate of "silent" infection of 4·5 per thousand
animals -- more than 100 times Switzerland's 1997 rate of clinical BSE.
The Swiss government and Prionics will start testing the brains of 3,000
randomly selected cattle at more than 20 slaughterhouses later this year,
to see if the same rate of infection holds for herds in which BSE has not
yet been recorded. Two abattoirs say they will screen all slaughtered
cattle. Epidemiological data suggest that a similar pattern may emerge.
If so, says Bruno Oesch, head of Prionics, "then 1800 subclinical cases may
have ended up on the table" in Switzerland last year. No one has tested for
subclinical BSE infection in Britain. But if British herds contain more
than 100 infected animals for every one with obvious symptoms, the number
of subclinical cases in 1997 would have been around 460,000.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) says that only older
cows are likely to pose any risk of infecting people. And since 1996, all
British cattle older than 30 months have been destroyed. "This removes the
possibility of any animal harbouring infectivity from entering the food
chain," claims a MAFF spokesman.
But some of the government's scientific advisers remain worried about the
risks posed by subclinical infection. John Collinge of Imperial College
London, a member of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, last
week told the official BSE Inquiry of his fears that some cows may be
carrying a silent infection that could be even more dangerous to people
than overt BSE:
"It may be that there is rather more infectivity in muscle or other tissues
in those animals and that is why they do not have a brain disease."
Collinge has tried to get MAFF to look for subclinical infection using
sensitive tests like the one developed by Prionics, but with no success. "I
have raised that several times," he told the inquiry. MAFF is now
considering plans to study subclinical BSE, but could provide no details.

[One should remember that these 1761 healthy cows were taken from herds in
which one or more clinical BSE cases had been previously identified and
slaughtered. And 6/8 Prionic +ve animals showed positive on other
veterinary tests suggesting that if they had not been slaughtered some if
not all six would have eventually demonstrated BSE. It has been held in the
UK for some time now that preclinically affected animals would have been
slaughtered and butchered as a matter of course. What risk such animals
pose is argumentative with the current restrictions. - Mod.MHJ
