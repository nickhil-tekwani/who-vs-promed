Foot and mouth disease has infected at least 211 pigs in Taiwan during the
past week.
Chupei, Hsinchu - 30 pigs
Taichung - 49
Kaohsiumg, Kanshan - 132
All animals have been slaughtered. This is the second outbreak of the same
type of FMD in pigs this year in Taiwan, and officials believe the
recurrence may be due to lapsed vaccination programs stemming from declining
pork prices.
[This is how a disease becomes endemic. If a foreign animal disease is not
stamped out successfully in a rather short period of time, it becomes
seemingly easier, both politically and economically, to live with the
disease. Unfortunately, critical long term cost benefit analysis rarely
support the wisdom of letting a newly introduced disease become endemic,
rather than gathering the resources needed to eradicate. - Mod.PC
