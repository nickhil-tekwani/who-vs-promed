A dead crow found in the area of London's Trafalgar and Hale
roundabout has tested positive for West Nile virus.

"Finding a West Nile [virus] positive crow is a reminder that the
disease is present in our community and that we need to take steps to
protect our families and ourselves from mosquito bites," said Andrew
Powell, public health inspector with the Middlesex-London Health Unit.
"We're calling on the public to let us know when they find dead crows
or blue jays, as happened in this case, so that we can determine
whether mosquitoes in our area are carrying West Nile virus."

Due to the heavy rain in the spring and early summer [2011], the
health unit put larvicides in more than 230 pools of standing water on
public property and a contractor dropped larvicide tablets into
municipal catch basins.

There were no cases of people infected with West Nile [virus] in
London last year (2010), although the virus was found in mosquito
traps and 2 dead birds tested positive.

[Similar to the report of a dead crow in London in 2009 (see
ProMED-mail posting no. 20090723.2607), this report of a dead crow
this year (2011) and West Nile virus (WNV) detected in mosquitoes and
birds last year (2010), provides additional evidence of the presence
of the virus in the UK. Previous reports in 2006 indicated that
sentinel chickens developed antibodies to WNV or a closely related
flavivirus, and a 2003 publication reported detection of WNV
neutralizing antibody and small WNV-related RNA fragments in migratory
and resident wild birds (Buckley A, Dawson A, Moss SR et al:

infection of birds in the UK. J Gen Virol 2003; 84(Pt 10): 2807-17;
