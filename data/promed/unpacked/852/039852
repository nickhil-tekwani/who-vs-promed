The Moore County (North Carolina) Health Department said it has noticed a significant increase in the number of acute hepatitis B cases among young adults so far in 2015. The health department said in 2014, there were 2 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis B during the entire year. In just the 1st 5 months of 2015, there have been 5 confirmed cases, 2 of which were co-infected with hepatitis C.

Hepatitis B is a viral illness. The county said it can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, fatigue, and fever. In some cases, the infection can persist, causing liver failure and even death. In the USA, hepatitis B is mostly spread through needles and sexual intercourse.

"Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination. Since 1991, all children have been advised to receive the 3-shot series for hepatitis B. Anyone using IV drugs should be tested for immunity to hepatitis B and if they are not immune, they should be vaccinated", Dr. Eric Frizzell of the Pinehurst Medical Clinic said.

The county said the current cases are primarily among young adults who are injecting prescription drugs, particularly Opana or other opiate
medications. The county said it believes it's being spread through either directly sharing needles, or sharing the "cooked" Opana or other opiate with multiple people dipping their needles into a spoon containing the liquid to be injected.

"The Moore County Health Department investigates each reported case of hepatitis B in an attempt to identify close contacts, whether they are through needle-sharing, sexual intercourse, or household contacts", said Kim Duffy, Communicable Disease Nurse for the Moore County Health Department. "Each case and their contacts are offered confidential testing, counseling and education about this highly contagious virus and what they can do to stop the further spread of the disease."

In 2013, the CDC estimated there were a total of 19 000 cases of hepatitis B in the USA.

[As with previous posts regarding hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B is easily spread through sharing needles among illicit drug users, and increasing transmission of all 3 of these viruses have been reported in 2015 among this cohort. Since hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, it would be interesting to know the immunization status of the acute HBV cases. Education regarding these viruses and establishing needle-exchange programs can limit spread.

Oxymorphone (Opana, Numorphan, Numorphone) or 14-Hydroxydihydromorphinone (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymorphone) is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (painkiller) initially developed in Germany in 1914, patented in the USA by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1955 and introduced to the United States market in January 1959 and other countries around the same time. - Mod.LL
