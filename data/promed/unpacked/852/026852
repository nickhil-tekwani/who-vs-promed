A young man has died in Larimer County, [Colorado], in the county's 1st confirmed plague case since 1999. Authorities are still investigating the 8 Jun 2015 death. CBS Denver reports that the teenager acquired the infection most likely from fleas on a dead rodent or other animal on the family acreage. He was a 16-year-old high school athlete who played quarterback on the football team and was a starting pitcher in baseball.

The Larimer County Health Department said this is the 1st county resident confirmed to have contacted the plague since 1999. The agency is leading the investigation with help from experts from the CDC, the State Health Department and the coroner's office. Officials say the family is reaching out to people who visited the home before the cause of death was known. There is a small chance that others could have been bitten by infected fleas.

Plague can spread through rodent populations in a localized area often resulting in mass animal "die-offs." The only animals with confirmed plague so far in 2015 in Larimer County were in an area of Soapstone Natural area that is not open to the public, according to CBS Denver.

The plague killed millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages in a series of outbreaks known as the Black Death. "Now, it's very rare, especially in the USA. There are only about 7 to 10 cases a year, but it still exists," medical contributor Dr Holly Phillips told "CBS This Morning." "Think of rodents in very rural states -- western states, southwest, ranches, farms -- that's likely what happened here."

The plague can be treated with antimicrobials, but Phillips said that because it's so rare and early symptoms can resemble the flu, it may not be recognized in time. The most common form of the disease, bubonic plague, accounts for about 80 percent of cases in humans. It causes painful swelling of the lymph nodes, fever, and muscle aches, and as the bacteria multiply they can spread to the respiratory system and bloodstream.

A 7-year-old girl recovered from the plague after contracting it while camping in southwest Colorado in 2015. Her mother said may have been infected by insects near a dead squirrel she wanted to bury.

In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases are reported each year nationwide according to the CDC. Most human cases in the United States are scattered in rural areas and occur predominantly in northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, and southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada.

[Another report of this case was submitted by Adrienne LeBailly, MD, MPH, Director, Larimer County Dept. of Health & Environment. ProMED-mail thanks both submitters.

There was no report of a bubo in this case, only that the young man had a "flu-like" illness. This appears to be a case of primary septicemic plague.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
