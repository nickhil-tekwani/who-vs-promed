KEMRI [Kenya Medical Research Institute] has completed the testing of
the samples collected from Baringo. We have received the following
results from KEMRI Arbovirology/VHF lab, Center for Virus Research --
the central reference laboratory for yellow fever in Kenya.

Summary of results
------------------
1. All samples were negative by IgM ELISA (NO evidence of acute
yellow fever [virus] infection)
2. One sample was weakly positive by IgG ELISA (evidence of previous
exposure or vaccination)
3. All samples were negative by RT-PCR (flavivirus, YF [yellow
fever], DEN [dengue], and WN [West Nile viruses]). NO evidence of
acute infection by any of these viruses.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Mutonga for this official information. It
dispels the confusion reflected in the earlier reports of YF cases
from this area in Kenya. The suspected YF cases have turned out to be
negative for this virus infection. Apparently, the earlier report of 9
of 16 samples positive for YF virus infection was not accurate.

The government has dispelled fears over the presence of yellow fever
in Baringo and the country in general. Public health minister Beth
Mugo said on Wednesday [4 May 2011] that currently there are no
laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease, allaying fears on the
prevalence of the fever-disease. "I assure the general public that
those intending to visit the country that there are no known cases
that meet the case definition standard or are laboratory confirmed to
be yellow fever," she told journalists at a media briefing at her Afya
House office. However, she cited Baringo, Koibatek, Keiyo, and
Marakwet as yellow fever high-risk areas in the country though
vaccination of the disease was routinely administered at 9 months [of
age] for children in these areas.

On the suspected cases of 16 patients from Baringo county, she said
that initial confirmatory tests had all turned negative for the
disease though a second set of confirmatory tests had been requested.
The results will be released by the end of this week, she said. "We
also conduct catch-up vaccination campaigns every 10 years with the
last one having been done in 2002 and the next one due in 2012," the
minister said adding that the upcoming campaign was not triggered by
the current yellow fever scares in the area.

She urged the public in the high risk areas preventive measures to
keep the disease at bay. "Protect yourselves from mosquito bites by
wearing long sleeved clothing, sleeping under insecticide treated nets
and using mosquito repellents," the minister advised the public.

The minister said that one of the 2 patients suspected to have died
of yellow fever 3 weeks ago at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital had
their blood sample tested negative for the disease at KEMRI
laboratories. "No specimen was taken from the 2nd patient because it
was established that he had drank poison prior to the onset of
haemorrhage," Mrs Mugo said. However the minister said a team from
KEMRI's centre for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases Control research
in Busia had visited Baringo county last week [week of 25 April] and
randomly collected 14 blood samples from patients presenting with
fever at Kapluk dispensary and Kabarnet district hospital and all
tested negative for the disease.

Public health minister Beth Mugo said on Thursday [5 May 2011] there
were no laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease. "I assure the
general public and those intending to visit the country that there are
no known cases that meet the case definition standard or are
laboratory confirmed to be yellow fever," she told a media briefing at
her Afya House office.

Last week [week of 25 April], Baringo North District medical officer
of health Felix Atisa also dismissed claims that a man had died of
yellow fever in the area although the Kabarnet District Hospital
medical superintendent Robert Pukose had said the man died from
haemorrhagic fever, "which is common among patients with yellow
fever."

Dr Pukose told journalists that a post-mortem examination at Moi
Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret confirmed the cause of death
to be yellow fever. He named Baringo, Koibatek, Keiyo, and Marakwet as
yellow fever high-risk areas, although vaccination was routinely
administered at 9 months [of age] for children in these areas.

On the suspected 16 cases from Baringo County, the minister said,
initial tests had all turned negative for the disease [YF virus
infection], although a 2nd set of confirmatory tests had been
requested. The results will be released by the end of this week, she
said.

"We also conduct catch-up vaccination campaigns every 10 years with
the last one having been done in 2002 and the next one due in 2012,"
the minister said. The upcoming campaign, she said, was not triggered
by the current yellow fever scare in the area.

Mrs Mugo urged the public in the high-risk areas to take preventive
measures to keep the disease at bay. "Protect yourselves from mosquito
bites by wearing long sleeved clothing, sleeping under insecticide
treated nets, and using mosquito repellants," the minister told the
public.

for the disease. "No specimen was taken from the 2nd patient because

Control research in Busia had visited Baringo last week [week of 25
Apr 2011] and collected 14 blood samples from patients presenting with
fever at Kapluk Dispensary and Kabarnet District Hospital and all
tested negative for the disease.
