Rabid Raccoon In Baldwin County Prompts Reminders To Immunize Pets
------------------------------------------------------------------
The diagnosis of a rabid raccoon in the Silverhill area in Baldwin
County, Alabama, has prompted public officials to encourage pet owners
to be sure their dogs, cats and ferrets are vaccinated against the
fatal disease. Charlotte Plumb, environmental supervisor with the
Baldwin County Health Department, said, "We strongly caution people
not to approach stray animals, wildlife [or]bats."

Rabies is a disease of all mammals, including humans, and is fatal if
specialized anti-rabies treatment is not obtained immediately. The
primary means of exposure is through a bite or scratch with
contaminated saliva contacting the wound. Transmission of the deadly
virus also occurs if saliva contacts a mucous membrane such as the eye
or mouth.

The most consistent clinical sign of rabies in animals is an
observable change from normal behavior. Any wild animals that suddenly
appear friendly or docile, or that approach humans, should be
considered suspect of being infected, and therefore avoided. Nocturnal
animals such as raccoons and foxes that become active in the daytime
should also be avoided. Several exposures occur each year in Alabama
when children or pets approach these wild animals which have wandered
into their yard.

Dr. Dee W. Jones, associate state public health veterinarian, said,
"If a wild or stray animal is found around your home, it is best to
contact animal control professionals."

Vaccination of domestic dogs, cats and ferrets not only protects the
animals against rabies, but also creates a protective buffer between
wildlife rabies and humans. State law requires that dogs, cats and
ferrets remain currently vaccinated against rabies.

Rabies warning issued in Camden County
--------------------------------------
Health officials are urging St. Marys, Georgia, residents to take
precautions after a stray cat found 11 Feb 2010 in the Forest Mission
area tested positive for rabies. Residents should avoid contact with
wild or stray animals, watch for unusual behavior in pets and
wildlife, and keep all pet vaccinations up to date to protect them
against the potentially deadly virus.

Officials with the Coastal Health District have recommended the
following precautions:

- Do not handle, feed or unintentionally attract wild animals with
open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out overnight.

- Never adopt wild animals, or try to nurse sick animals to health or
bring them into your home. Call animal control or an animal rescue
agency for help.

- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic,
even if they appear friendly.

- Call your local animal control agency to report any animals showing
suspicious behavior.

- If bitten by an animal, seek medical care immediately and contact
animal control officials.

[Pets should be vaccinated against this deadly disease whether or not
there is an outbreak of the disease.

While these articles remind owners of cats, dogs and ferrets to
vaccinate, the same is true for livestock owners. Rabid raccoons can
also bite horses or cows. Vaccination of your animals is cheap
insurance compared to a bite that can cost a human life. - Mod.TG]
