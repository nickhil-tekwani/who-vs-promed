3/4ths of those suffering from the deadly ebolavirus in a small town in northern Guinea have recovered, an unusually high proportion that is puzzling scientists and aid workers. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says that 16 of the 21 people suffering from Ebola who entered its treatment centre in Telimele made a full recovery, compared with only 20-40 percent of victims in Gueckedou, the epicentre of the virus in southern Guinea.

The outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is the largest ever, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which has reported 518 deaths from 844 known cases since February 2014. MSF said it had closed its treatment centre in Telimele because no new cases had been reported for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for Ebola. The WHO said that 10 Ebola sufferers had died in Telimele out of 26 cases, the difference from the MSF figures being due to the fact that the 5 extra cases had not been treated at the MSF centre.

Experts are now trying to work out whether the high recovery rate in the town -- where the sample size was very small -- was due to genetics, culture, more effective aid, a viral mutation, or faulty laboratory tests. Michel Van Herp, who has been working on Ebola for MSF all over Africa for the last 20 years, told Thomson Reuters Foundation the figures in Telimele are very surprising, but there may be rational explanations. "It could be that the people in the north have a different cultural way of taking care of their dead, which may result in a lower viral load, so less virus enters the body than from funeral practices in the south," he said. In Guinea, relatives stroke the body of the dead person as part of their mourning ritual.

"It could also be down to genetics. In Telimele there is one man who has 12 wives, so he may have disbursed his [Ebola-resistant] chromosome around all the families there," Van Herp said. There is no known cure for Ebola, whose victims show symptoms like those of influenza before progressing to massive internal and external bleeding. Palliative treatment has been shown to increase the chance of survival by around 10 percent. "The (Telimele) clinic is in the centre of town, visible and easily accessible. We have a very good relationship with the local people here who are helping us to find victims early and provide them with treatment," Van Herp said.

A foreign laboratory expert familiar with the West Africa EVD outbreak said the dramatic drop in the number of deaths in Telimele and some other regions could be due to immunological causes, a mutation of the virus or false-positive laboratory results. "The observed differences in the survival rate of some Ebola patients might be due to a mutation of the original virus, a natural increased immunity in the respective population or methodological differences between different lab tests," said the expert, who wished to remain anonymous. Of these, faulty lab tests are the most likely reason, he said.

Both the European Mobile Laboratory and the Pasteur Institute have been involved in the blood analysis for testing EVD patients in Guinea, but they have been using different techniques, resulting in a debate on how false positives could have appeared. A "false positive" lab result means that a suspected EVD victim is diagnosed as having the disease when in fact he does not. His "recovery" then distorts the statistics, especially in a small sample, as in Telimele.

"Conducting molecular diagnostics for ebolavirus is technically challenging, especially under limited conditions in the field. As the technology is highly sensitive, the prevention of cross-contamination from a positive patient sample to a negative patient [sample] is an important issue for all lab teams," the expert said. Sakoba Keita of the Guinean Health Ministry told Thomson Reuters Foundation there had been cases of false positives in Guinea but declined to comment on individual laboratories' performance.

[2] Liberia: UNICEF report
Date: 9 Jul 2014
Source: UNICEF-Liberia Ebola Virus Disease: Sit Rep No. 34 [edited]
http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/unicef-liberia-ebola-virus-disease-sitrep-34-09-july-2014


As of 8 Jul 2014, 3 new suspected EVD cases have been reported in Liberia.

According to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), the total number of suspected, probable and confirmed EVD cases reported for Outbreak No. 2 now stands at 133. Of these, a total of 62 are confirmed as EVD positive cases. The total number of deaths for Outbreak No. 2 in confirmed, probable, and suspected cases now stands at 80; 38 deaths have been confirmed as EVD positive cases.

Foya in Lofa County and New Kru Town in Montserrado County remain the epicentres of this Ebola outbreak. According to the MOHSW, emphasis has been placed on improving case surveillance and tracking of contacts, as the number of actual cases could otherwise be under-reported.

UNICEF continues to provide active support to the response in coordination with National Task Force (NTF) sub-committees. On 8 Jul 2014, UNICEF trained 50 religious leaders on how to sensitize their congregations on EVD and provided the group with 50 flip charts and 1000 posters. UNICEF's estimated funding requirement for the EVD outbreak response is USD 1.59 million. The current funding gap remains at USD 1.27 million. Funding is urgently required to replenish supplies and continue support to the EVD prevention and response efforts.

[3] Liberia, health workers flee
Date: 10 Jul 2014

Health workers in Liberia are said to be fleeing and returning from their areas of assignment due to the increasing number of EVD patients. Some have died from treating patients infected by the deadly virus.

Speaking in plenary yesterday [9 Jul 2014] at the Capitol Building, Senate's Committee Chairman on Health Dr. Peter Coleman disclosed that there were 12 cases of health workers infected by the ebolavirus, 10 of whom have already died, and as a result, trained and professional health workers were leaving their areas of assignment at clinics and hospitals for fear of being infected.

The Grand Kru County Senator noted that the only option to maintain these health workers is for the government to direct sufficient funds to efforts against the deadly virus which has engulfed the sub region and could be uncontrollable for months. He said the Ministry of Health has proposed the amount of USD 1.5 million to combat the epidemic, or the population of the country could be in serious danger.

Maryland County Senator H. Dan Morais called on the administration to decide on a national state of emergency, an action that would enable officers of the Armed Forces of Liberia along with health workers to be posted from the Red-light via Gardnerville to the Gabriel Tucker Bridge for inspection and testing to determine carriers of the virus.

The Liberian Senate, through a motion from Lofa County Senator George Tingbeh, agreed that the leaderships of both the House of Representatives and Liberian Senate submit a resolution to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, calling for the immediate provision of the USD 1.5 million in order to combat the deadly disease.

On 1 Jul 2014, a medical practitioner from Uganda, involved with the fight against the spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia, died. Dr. Sam Mokoro, who had worked at the state-owned Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town on Busrod Island in Monrovia, died at the John F. Kennedy Hospital where he had been undergoing treatment for nearly 2 weeks.

Assistant Minister of Health for Preventive Services Tolbert Nyesuah told a local radio station in Monrovia that a nurse of the same hospital last month [June 2014] died after contracting the disease. She had been treating EVD patients when she fell ill. The Ministry of Health reported that 49 persons have died from EVD in Liberia out of 90 confirmed cases as of 29 Jun 2014.

In the fight against the latest Ebola outbreak, under-funded medical workers in West Africa are logistically outmanned.

The number of West Africans killed in the Ebola outbreak has passed 500, and the disease has spread since January 2014 from the Guinean epicenter of Gueckedou to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Medical workers striving to contain the hemorrhagic disease are failing, and at least 32 of them have died after being infected.

International support for these indigent nations has been insufficient, despite assistance from Medecins Sans Frontieres, the United Nations, and scientists from the United States and elsewhere. "If we do not provide the support to stop the transmission," Liberia's deputy health minister, Bernice Dahn, warned during a recent emergency meeting in Ghana, "other countries will get infected as well."

The World Health Organization says USD 10 million will be needed during the next 6 months to address the crisis, which is less than one watchmaker raised through Kickstarter [an American worldwide crowd funding platform]. But throwing cash at the virus won't send it to oblivion. "Logistical challenges are a bigger issue now than money," says George Mason University's Kathryn Jacobsen, the author of a new "call to action" paper published online Saturday [5 Jul 2014] in The Lancet.

Once the ebolavirus jumps from an animal to a person, through the [preparation and] consumption of wild meat, for example, the victim can spread the disease to others, even during funeral rituals. During outbreaks since 1976 in Sudan and what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the disease killed most of its victims.

German researchers reported in May 2014 in Antiviral Research that they cured mice that had been infected for 6 days with ebolavirus using Favipiravir, an anti-viral drug being developed for the treatment of influenza. But that drug is not yet available even in wealthy nations, let alone in West Africa. Other drugs that can provide protection against Ebola must be taken within 2 days of infection, which is an impossibly short time frame to treat a viral pathogen whose symptoms can take 2-21 days to manifest. In the paper, Jacobsen and fellow researchers affiliated with the Mercy Hospital Research Laboratory, which runs an infectious disease surveillance project in Sierra Leone, described the critical problems that are helping ebolavirus run rampant:

Most fevers are treated in the region at home using over-the-counter or traditional medicines. There's very little incentive for the sick and dying to seek expensive medical care. Hospitals lack sufficient staff and equipment. Few, if any, laboratories are capable of safely testing for diseases such as EVD, and that all means that many Ebola cases could be going undetected, allowing the disease to spread. Data sharing and other technological tools for tracking disease outbreaks are severely lacking. The few doctors and nurses working in the region lack access to equipment that would protect them from infection, making some reluctant to provide treatment. Communication between health authorities and the public is often poor.

"It's important both to allocate resources for immediate containment activities and to prioritize longer-term capacity building that will improve future responses to EVD and other emerging infectious disease threats," Jacobsen says.

[The suggestion that some lab tests may have given false positive results is a disturbing one, as is the suggestion that cross-contamination may have been occurring between samples. There should be no reason to suspect such problems in field labs operated by the European Mobile Laboratory and the Pasteur Institute using trained staff, and the RT-PCR tests being used should have appropriate controls. It is, however, interesting that the EVD-negative samples all came from patients with viral hemorrhagic fever symptoms, and we are not told how many of them tested positive for Lassa fever or other hemorrhagic fevers.

There is an urgent need to supply frontline health workers with adequate PPE (personal protection equipment: gowns, gloves, face masks and goggles). It is unreasonable to expect them to continue risking their lives without that equipment.

Given the numbers of survivors being reported, it is time the news media stops plugging the line that EVD "has no cure." It is long past the time that that fear should have been discounted.

Guinea under-reports its EVD cases and deaths, reporting only those that have been lab confirmed. Sierra Leone and Liberia report suspected and probable cases and deaths also. The latest total of 844 cases including 518 deaths (apparent case fatality rate: 61 percent) may be compared with the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in the Middle East of 836 cases, including at least 290 deaths (case fatality rate: 35 percent). - Mod.JW
