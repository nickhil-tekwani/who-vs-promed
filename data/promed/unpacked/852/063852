Thailand's Public Health Ministry warned the public to be alert
regarding dengue fever prevention measures as [12] patients died and
over 10 000 have suffered from the disease during the 1st quarter of
2008, according to Chaiya Sasomsub, minister of public health, on
Monday [28 Apr 2008].

From [1 Jan 2008] to [19 Apr 2008], the cumulative number of dengue
fever patients soared to 10 901 and 99 percent of the patients were
completely recovered, Chaiya said. However, 12 patients in the
country have been killed by dengue fever this year [2008], he said.

"When compared with the same period last year [2007], the number of
dengue fever patients has increased by 80 percent," the minister was
quoted by local news network The Nation as saying.

Chaiya said he had instructed local health officials nationwide to
maintain the campaign to eradicate the mosquito breeding habitats.

In the 1st 3 months of the year [2008], 5 municipal councils have
been singled out as hotspots for dengue fever. They are Shah Alam
(719 cases), Klang (582), Johor Baru (536), Kajang (514), and Subang
Jaya (457).

Health minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai said: "It looks quite serious in
the Klang Valley."

Liow also revealed that Selangor topped the list for dengue fever
with 3742 cases. It was followed by Kuala Lumpur (1119 cases) and
Perak (1084 cases).

"We can prevent this. But we need the cooperation and support of the
public besides cooperation of agencies especially local councils to
come forward and work with the ministry. Then, we should be able to
reduce the number of dengue fever cases." There has been a 29 percent
decline this year [2008] compared to the period between [1 Jan and 31
Mar 2007], which saw 34 deaths. So far, 25 people have died.

Disease Control Division director Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman in a
press statement posted on the ministry's website said there were 776
dengue cases with one death reported from 13-16 Apr [2008]. This was
an increase of 35 cases from the week before.

It had been reported that an immediate stop work order was carried
out on 25 construction sites in the Klang Valley by the Selangor
Health Department for failing to keep the areas free from the _Aedes_ mosquito.

In April 2008, 2 cases of dengue confirmed in residents of Rivier St.
Louis, commune of Saint Louis, were reported to the department of
healthcare of the Reunion Regional Directorate for Health and Social
Affairs (DRASS). A reinforcement of the epidemiological surveillance
was then proposed by the interregional epidemiological department of
Reunion and Mayotte (CIRE RM) in conjunction with the integrated
[pest management] actions of the teams from DRASS's Reinforced
Prophylaxis Service.

[Although 2 dengue cases can hardly be classified as an outbreak, the
severe chikungunya virus epidemic in Reunion and other Indian Ocean
islands in 2005-2006 indicates that a population of _Aedes_ vector
mosquitoes is likely still prevalent there, and if so, could spark a
significant dengue outbreak.

The Rio Grande do Norte is in a state of maximum health alert. The
number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) increased by 1000
percent over the same period last year [2007]. There are now 453
cases of DHF, with 21 deaths. "The situation is very serious. We
currently have 15 municipalities with a dengue epidemic," highlighted
the state secretary of health, Adelmaro Cavalcanti.

The problem of dengue is not confined only to DHF. The number of
notifications of classic [dengue] cases grew 200 percent over the
same period last year [2007], reaching 12 317 cases. The situation is
worse in the region of the Grande Natal, which reported half of the
cases throughout state. The city of Natal decreed a state of
emergency due to the dengue epidemic.

The concern is that the number of victims in Rio Grande do Norte is
even greater than that recorded. The State Health Department admits
that there is underreporting where the doctors and the urgent aid
network of state hospitals are not filling out the notification forms
for suspected cases of the disease. "Since the beginning of the year
[2008], this has been the great struggle of the registry with the
unit's hospitals throughout the state and also is the main topic in
meetings with the municipal [health] secretaries," Cavalcanti said.

The heavy rainfall recorded in the west and the north of Bahia since
the beginning of the year [2008] -- pronounced since the 1st week of
March [2008] -- is of concern to those responsible for public health
of Bahia, who fear an even greater increase in cases of dengue in the
state. In the 1st quarter of year [2008], 12 607 cases of the disease
were recorded, 80 percent more than in same period of 2007. In
Presidente Dutra, in the Irece region 474 km (295 mi) west of
Salvador, for example, a [dengue] epidemic hit a population of 14
000: 2440 contracted the disease this year [2008].

As a reaction, at the end of last week [week of 14 Apr 2008] the
government Bahia inaugurated the state committee to combat dengue,
which brought together the Bahia Secretariat of Health (Sesab),
municipalities and non-governmental organizations. Together, they
launched the campaign "Everyone Against Dengue," the main goal of
which is public awareness of the importance of combating the breeding
of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the transmitter of the virus causing
the disease.

For [state] Governor Jaques Wagner, this is the only measure to
contain the advance of dengue. "All the measures that the government
can do will not stop the cycle of disease," he said. To achieve this
goal, this week the government will run advertising on TV, radio, and
newspapers, with tips on how eliminate breeding foci of the mosquito.
Furthermore, [educational] activities will be held in schools, with
the participation of students." Students are multipliers, which take
what they learn at school into the home, " indicated the secretary of
health, Jorge Solla.

The epidemic of dengue has killed 92 people in Rio de Janeiro in
2008, the largest number of deaths resulting from the disease now
officially registered in the State.

This Tuesday [22 Apr 2008] the State Secretariat of Health announced
that 110 783 people were infected [with dengue virus] this year
[2008]. In addition to the 92 confirmed deaths, another 96 [suspected
dengue cases] are still under investigation as possibly related to
the epidemic.

In less than 4 months, the current epidemic surpassed the 91 deaths
from dengue in 2002, when over 288 000 cases of the disease were
recorded in the State throughout that [entire] year. This time the
proportional fatality of disease is much improved.

More than half of the victims of the [dengue virus] transmitted by
the vector mosquito _ Aedes aegypti _ were in the state capital,
where 56 919 people were infected and 55 died.

About half the dead in the state were less than 15 years [old].
According to experts, the children are more susceptible because they
have not had previous contact with type 2 disease [dengue virus],
which predominates in current epidemic.

The latest weekly report released by the [case] registry shows an
increase of 5 deaths and nearly 18 000 recorded cases recorded in
relation to the previous [weekly] period.

After the capital, the counties hardest hit by the dengue epidemic of
dengue are Duque de Caxias (11 deaths), Sao Joao de Meriti (5), and
Angra dos Reis (4).

Throughout the past year [2007], 66 553 people contracted dengue
[virus infections] in the State of Rio, with 31 deaths. In the
capital, the 56 919 cases this year [2008] far outweigh the 25 107
[dengue cases] last year [2007], when 26 people died in the entire year.

The state health secretary, Sergio Cortes, said last week [week of 14
Apr 2008] that Rio was still "at the apex of the epidemic" and
dismissed [previous reports] that there was a reduction in the number
of cases due to fewer people in queues at hospitals and health posts.

According to him, care was better organized after the adoption of
emergency measures, such as armed forces field hospitals and
rehydration stations for patients.

State authorities expect that, beyond such measures, the fall of
temperature in the coming weeks, after a hot and humid summer, will
help to contain the epidemic.

In 2002, cases fell sharply from April [onward]. While March had 99
861 cases reported, in April the number fell to 31 642, and in May
there were 7208 [cases].
