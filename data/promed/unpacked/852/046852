Coroner: Man who ate at Camden restaurant died from salmonella
--------------------------------------------------------------
A 58-year-old man died from complications of food poisoning after he
ate at a buffet-style restaurant in Camden last week, Kershaw County
Coroner Johnny Fellers said Wed, 25 May 2005. The death, as well as
176 cases of reported food poisoning, prompted officials to issue a
statewide public health advisory for anyone who ate at the Old South
Restaurant from last Thu, 19 May to Sun, 22 May 2005.

The man from Lugoff died early Sunday morning, 22 May 2005, at his
home after he developed an infection in his blood stream from
salmonella, Fellers said. The man ate turkey and dressing, chicken,
rice, peas and apple cobbler at the buffet Thursday evening, 19 May
2005, but DHEC spokesman Thom Berry said the agency is still trying
to pinpoint the source of the salmonella. Salmonella usually comes
from undercooked poultry products and causes nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and fever, health officials said.

As of Wed, 25 May 2005, 65 people had been seen at the Kershaw County
Medical Center emergency room, and 25 patients had been admitted,
hospital chief executive Donnie Weeks said. At least 1 person had
been released Wed, 25 May 2005, Weeks said. DHEC reported 7 other
people had been hospitalized.

The 1st person was admitted last Friday morning, 20 May 2005. Most
of the patients have received fluids intravenously and antibiotics
and their conditions seem to be improving, Weeks said. DHEC has
received calls about possible food poisoning from areas as far away
as Charleston and Rock Hill. After receiving calls from the hospital
Sunday, DHEC sent staff to the hospital and inspected the restaurant
Monday, 23 May 2005. The restaurant received an "A," the same grade
it had been given after a previous inspection. However, after news
of the food poisoning, the restaurant voluntarily closed the
following day.

The investigation into the outbreak is not that unusual, but deaths
attributed to salmonella have been rare in South Carolina. DHEC
reported just 2 deaths in the past 7 years -- 1 in Georgetown County
in 2003 and 1 in Chesterfield County in 2001. In 1996, 244 people
were sickened by a food-borne illness in Greenville County.

[The serotype or serotypes of salmonella in this reasonably sized
outbreak is not stated. A food survey of affected and unaffected
individuals will be useful in assessing the probable vehicle. -
