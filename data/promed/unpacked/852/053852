Although schistosomiasis is a widespread infection in the tropics,
travellers are almost exclusively infected in sub-Saharan Africa, through
exposure to freshwater infested with cercariae of either _Schistosoma
mansoni_ (intestinal schistosomiasis) or _Schistosoma haematobium_ (urinary
schistosomiasis) [1]. Primary infection may cause a febrile
hypersensitivity reaction occurring 3 to 12 weeks post-exposure, with
fever, cough and/or abdominal pain when schistosomules mature to
egg-producing adult worms, the so called "Katayama fever".
Hypereosinophilia is its early diagnostic hallmark. Definite diagnosis
requires antischistosomal antibody detection and/or demonstrating
schistosomal eggs in stools, urine, or rectal mucosa to be found on microscopy.

The mapping of schistosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) was extensively compiled during the colonial period [2,3].
Thereafter, only few studies have examined outbreaks or new foci of
infection [3,4,5], and, apart from occasional reports, there are no recent
comprehensive data on schistosomiasis in travellers returning from the DRC
[1,6].

From 1 Jan 2006 to 31 Aug 2007, as part of a larger ongoing study spanning
10 years of active schistosomiasis seen at our policlinic, we conducted a
retrospective study on clinical presentation and associated biologic
features on active intestinal schistosomiasis in all persons attending the
Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium's outpatient clinic who
had returned from the DRC and in whom _S. mansoni_ eggs were detected in a
faecal sample using a concentration method for ova and parasites.

Our cases from 2006 were incorporated in the latest TropNetEurop report on
schistosomiasis [7]: of the 102 cases reported as being imported into
Europe in 2006, the highest number was from Belgium (33), with the United
Kingdom the next highest (10). Of a total of 25 persons included in our
study, 24 (96 per cent) were of Caucasian origin, 20 (80 per cent) were
male, and 20 (80 per cent) were European. Most of the Europeans were
Belgian expatriates, of whom 12 (60 per cent) were children younger than 18
years old. Applying the World Health Organization's 1993 criteria,
infection was light to moderate (mean EPG 100, range 10 to 710) [8]. Three
presented with symptoms of Katayama fever. All other persons were asymptomatic.

Three major sources of exposure were identified. Bathing in Kalemie, Lake
Tanganyika (North Katanga province) (Google Earth: Kalemie, Congo) infected
3/25 (12 per cent), of whom 2 were Belgian military personnel who developed
Katayama fever after bathing near the area where the Kalemie river flows
into the lake. The northern shore of Lake Kivu, near Goma (Google Earth:
Goma, Kivu), was the source of infection in 4/25 (16 per cent), all of them
Belgian expatriates. Bobandana Bay, east of Goma city, has been a
well-known focus since colonial times [2].

But most acquired the infection in south Katanga (17/25, 68 per cent). Lake
Katebe was the stated source of infection in 11/17 (65 per cent), all of
them expats. Lake Katebe and Lake Wasela are the upstream and downstream
part of a large artificial lake complex on the upper course of the Lualaba
river, the lake Nzilo (formerly Lake Delcommune). The lake complex is
situated northeast from the main Kolwezi mining sites (Google Earth:
Kolwezi, Congo, or Google Maps: Kolwezi, Katanga). Despite an obvious
effluent from a copper mine midstream, schistosomiasis seems to thrive in
the lake complex, which is a popular weekend spot for water sports among
the expatriate community. Systematic mollusciciding of the Lualaba river
basin with copper sulphate was practiced in the 1950s but has declined
since independence [3]. A new influx of international expatriates recently
arrived in sizeable numbers in the Kolwezi area to restart the moribund
mining industry. One might thus expect an upsurge of schistosomiasis in
that community in the near future.

Since the old-hand expatriate community in the DRC is well aware of the
problem, it is likely that the widely practiced intermittent self-treatment
with praziquantel keeps worm loads down. This probably accounts at least
partially for the low fecal egg counts observed. Of course, this treatment
policy will not prevent Katayama fever among hitherto non-infected
expatriates (praziquantel does not eliminate the immature schistosomules)
nor will it be able to prevent neuroschistosomiasis entirely.

Many travellers are unlikely to forgo the pleasures of aquatic sports in an
inviting freshwater environment, even when schistosomiasis is all too
present, so there is a need for an evidence-based prevention and treatment
policy for this specific community to minimise the morbidity associated
with schistosomiasis. A combination of physical measures (thoroughly
rubbing down the skin after bathing) and medications active against both
the immature (artemisinin derivatives) and mature worms (praziquantel) at a
given time after exposure might achieve this. However, the optimal
treatment schedule still needs to be established [9].

[Outbreaks of schistosomiasis in tourists and expatriates were discussed in
our comment to the report of schistosomiasis in tourists in Tanzania
(Schistosomiasis - Tanzania (Lake Eyasi) 20070904.2912). The use of
artemisinin as a prophylactic drug for schistosomiasis has recently been
reviewed (Utzinger J, et al. Artemisinins for schistosomiasis and beyond.
Curr Opin Investig Drugs 2007; 8(2): 105-16.). Both drugs reduce eggs
counts, but praziquantel is more efficient

(De Clercq D, et al. Efficacy of artesunate and praziquantel in Schistosoma
haematobium infected schoolchildren. Acta Trop 2002; 82(1): 61-6). However,
the possible use of artemisinins as a immediate, post exposure prophylaxis
still needs further studies. - Mod.EP]
