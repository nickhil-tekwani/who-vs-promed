A 51-year-old man living in the province of Herrera has been confirmed as the 4th case of hantavirus a disease transmitted by rodents. The Ministry of Health (Minsa) made the announcement on Tue 6 Dec 2022.

The patient, a resident of the Villa Rosa community, El Pájaro township, Pesé district was diagnosed with cardiopulmonary syndrome due to hantavirus [infection], and was transferred to the intensive care unit of the Joaquín Pablo Franco Sayas hospital in Las Tablas, Los Santos province, the Minsa detailed.

According to reports from the Department of Regional Epidemiology, a total of 4 cases of hantavirus have been registered in the province of Herrera, of which 3 patients developed cardiopulmonary syndrome and one patient developed hantavirus fever.

Hantavirus is an emerging zoonotic disease transmitted by rodents, including mice and rats. The disease is characterized by presenting symptoms of fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disorders, followed by a sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, the Pan American Health Organization specifies.

The Minsa recommended that people keep their homes and surroundings clean and grains must be collected and sealed to prevent the rodent from having contact and leaving their feces and urine in the surroundings.

[This is the 4th case of hantavirus infection in Herrera province this year (2022). There were 3 reported cases of hantavirus infections earlier this year (2022) (see Hantavirus - Americas (35): Panama (HE) Chile (LL) susp 20221127.8706931. The virus is endemic in the province and cases are reported there frequently. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that, based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY

The Ministry of Health reported that 27 people have suffered from hantavirus [infections] in Chile this year [2022], which has caused the death of 7 patients, concentrated in the regions of Nuble, Los Ríos, and Los Lagos.

The figures are comparable to those of last year, 2021, when there were 9 deaths and 30 affected by the virus.

So far in the Metropolitan Region, no infections have been found, although the Health Seremi [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], Gonzalo Soto, recommended paying attention to symptoms of fever and muscle pain, followed by respiratory failure.

"It is very important that they can lend a hand, for example, if they have been in a rural sector in the last 40 days; if they were camping and perhaps in an area trekking or in a storage shed that was closed a long time ago in a rural sector," said the authority.

Soto emphasized that being able to share these data "is important for the clinician or clinic, in the emergency department" so that those affected are cared for.

The director of the Intensive Medicine Specialization Program of the Andrés Bello University, Sebastián Ugarte, said that the clinical picture develops differently between patients.

"It can be very mild, almost asymptomatic, or it can gradually evolve into a very serious condition, such as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which begins with a cough, with respiratory distress that may require mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal circulation, and eventually even lead to death", he explained.

From the municipalities, meanwhile, the mayor of La Reina, José Manuel Palacios, asked people to go trekking in authorized sectors and also avoid collecting or eating food in areas with abundant vegetation and low temperatures where rodents can circulate.

"In La Reina we have 2 important parks, we are a community in the foothills, and we have trails that are widely traveled by our neighbors; (for this reason) when you travel, it is very important to be given certain recommendations, such as not eating on the way, not leaving trash, and not leaving the established routes," requested the community head.

In the Metropolitan Region, there have been 5 deaths and 30 infected by hantaviruses in the last decade, mostly in Melipilla and Talagante. Therefore, the Government has called to use campsites that have sanitary authorization.

Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. These cases are in the Nuble, Los Ríos, and Los Lagos regions. Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in these cases is most likely Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY]
