Hepatitis A outbreak in schoolchildren
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A has affected schoolchildren in Ekibastuz [a city
of 14 000 inhabitants in Pavlodar province, which is located in north
eastern Kazakhstan]. Today [1 Nov 2010] another school [school no. 12] has
been placed under quarantine in order to contain the outbreak. Previously
school no. 11 was closed after 18 pupils were diagnosed with hepatitis A.
The newly closed school [no. 12] has so far only had a single case,
nevertheless the school will remain under quarantine until 29 Nov 2010. An
epidemiological analysis has established that the new case in school No. 12
had been in contact with some of the pupils in school no. 11 who were
diagnosed subsequently as hepatitis A cases.

The public health authorities of Pavlodar province have announced that all
those who have been contact with the affected schoolchildren will be kept
under observation for 35 days and all will receive hepatitis A vaccine.
Administrative fines have been imposed on the school staff [probably for
improper or delayed reporting or actions]. The original case was a 7th form
schoolgirl, who is believed to have contracted the infection from
contaminated watermelon.

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted via fecally contaminated food and water,
and annually affects about 10 million people worldwide. The incubation
period for hepatitis A virus infection ranges from 2 to 6 weeks, with an
average period of 28 days.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is
spread when an uninfected (or unvaccinated) person eats or drinks something
contaminated by the stool of a hepatitis A virus-infected person. The
disease is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal
hygiene.

Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the
severity of disease and mortality increases in older age groups. Infected
children under 6 years of age do not usually experience noticeable
symptoms, and only 10 per cent develop jaundice. Among older children and
adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice
occurring in more than 70 per cent of cases. Most people recover in several
weeks -- or sometimes months -- without complications. For further
information, see the WHO hepatitis A fact sheet at
