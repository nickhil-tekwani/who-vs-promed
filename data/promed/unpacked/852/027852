First Report of Leaf Blotch Caused by _Marssonina coronaria_ on Apple in Italy.
G. Tamietti and A. Matta, DIVAPRA-Patologia vegetale, Universita di Torino,
V. L. da Vinci 44, 10095 Grugliasco, Italy. Plant Dis. 87:1005, 2003;
published on-line as D-2003-0605-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 28 May
2003.
During the early summers of 2001 and 2002, in Forno Canavese in northwest
Italy, a leaf disease was observed on the old apple cv. Furnas in a
domestic orchard. Lesions on the upper side of the leaf were brownish,
smaller with more definite margins. Beginning in July 2003, scattered
acervuli (95 to 170 [millimicrons]) were observed erupting through the
epidermis on the upper side of leaves.
Conidia were ampule-shaped, 1-septate, constricted at the septum, hyaline,
guttulate, and 6.1 to 8.4 x 14.6 to 22.0 [millimicrons]. Severely diseased
leaves abscised prematurely. The fungus was identified as _Marssonina
coronaria_ (Ellis & J.J. Davis) J.J. Davis, teleomorph _Diplocarpon mali_
(1) although the conidia were slightly shorter than those originally
described for this fungus.
Monoconidial isolates were obtained by spreading mini-suspensions of
conidia taken from acervuli on malt agar (MA) and transferring
single-germinated conidia to MA, potato dextrose agar, V8 agar, or apple
leaf agar (ALA). The fungus grew slowly, producing small colonies on V8 and
ALA only. On ALA medium, after 3 months incubation at 20 to 22 deg C, the
colonies were 5 to 7 mm in diameter with light brown, irregular margins and
dark brown centers bearing acervuli.
Conidia from pure cultures were collected, suspended in sterile, distilled
water (250 000/ ml), and sprayed on the leaves of three 'Golden Delicious'
apple shoots maintained in a mist chamber at 20 to 25 deg C for 2 weeks.
In 2 independent experiments, the fungus reproduced symptoms like those
observed on 'Furnas' and was reisolated from acervuli. No symptoms were
observed on water-treated controls.
To our knowledge, apple leaf blotch has not previously been reported in
Italy. Although now it is a minor disease, it could become more important
in sustainable crops because of its relatively low sensitivity to copper
fungicides (2), the only products that can be used under that program.

[Marssonina blotch on apple has also been reported in Canada, Japan, India,
Korea, Rumania, and USA. In 2002, apple production in Himachal Pradesh
state was severely affected by the disease. All commercial cultivars were
susceptible, and leaf-shredding was extensive. Only small, maturing fruits
were seen on affected trees. The disease was also found in Kashmir, Uttar
Pradesh and Bhutan. Diseased fruits are of poor quality and not marketable.
The disease can be managed by application of phytosanitary measures,
appropriate pruning, and careful use of fungicides. - Mod.DH]
