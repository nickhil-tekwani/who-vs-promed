[This formal report from Paris confirms the earlier suspicion of multiple outbreaks in the area, but they are well scattered. This is typical of outbreaks following female tabanid biting flies. They probably acquired the pathogen on or about the dead horse in Outbreak #2 noted on 25 Aug 2021. The rest followed on 1 Sep 2021 (#5), 4 Sep 2021 (#6), and 6 Sep 2021 (#1, #3, & #4) with single animals noted in each case. When one has contaminated feed as a source there are usually multiple animals affected on each farm. To find the locations of these farms, go to the OIE report and click on "Immediate notification".

To confirm a common source for the later outbreaks the isolates should be genotyped. If they all match the isolate from the dead horse on farm #2, it is persuasive.

With thanks to my colleague Cristina for extracting the OIE information from this report. - Mod.MHJ
