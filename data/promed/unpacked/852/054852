[The immediate notification of the HPAI H5N9 event in France, provides greater detail on the cases in Landes and Dordogne (see 20151209.3850006), where a new AI subtype was identified. This is the 1st reported occurrence of a highly pathogenic H5N9 subtype in Europe, (see 20151210.3852573).

To date, France has reported 5 outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N1. These outbreaks were located in the departments of Dordogne and Haute-Vienne. The epidemiological comments in the report note that "H5N1 and H5N9 viruses were detected simultaneously in the same farm". See last follow-up report on 8 Dec 2015, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019295_20151209_195727.pdf.

"Laboratory investigations show that the virus is not related to the HPAI H5N1 strain that emerged in Asia in the mid 1990s and entered the EU in 2005, but that it is of European origin." http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/

In addition, 2 outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N2 have been reported. These were located in the department of Dordogne. See last follow-up report on 8 Dec 2015 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019298_20151209_192910.pdf.

For more information on the current situation of avian influenza in France, please go to France's Ministry of Agriculture site at, http://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-la-situation-actuelle-en-france.

Although this is the 1st time that France reports LPAI subtype H5N2, this subtype has been identified previously in Europe.

According to the European Commission's Animal Health and Welfare Directorate (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/): A detailed overview on the situation in Member States and the adopted measures is given in the Chronology of Events. See, "Chronology of main events and list of decisions adopted by the EU, response to HPAI outbreaks in EU Member States during 2015", at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/docs/chrono_hapai_eu_members_2015_en.pdf; and the location of the HPAI outbreaks in 2015 at, http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/docs/map_infected_zones_2015.pdf". - Mod.CRD
