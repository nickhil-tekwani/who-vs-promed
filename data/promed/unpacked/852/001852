Dengue Fever Outbreak in Malaysia
--------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: 2 sisters died from brain hemorrhage caused by dengue fever,
which has broken out in a northern Malaysian state, health officials stated
on Mon 11 Jun 2001. Hospital officials said villages in Perlis State on the
Malaysia-Thai border are being fumigated in an effort to contain the outbreak.
Dr. Abdul Rashid, Acting Director of Kangar Hospital, said 24 people have
been diagnosed with dengue fever in the State. Of those, a 44 year old
teacher and her sister, aged 53, had died; 9 others were being treated in
hospital, and the rest had been released from hospital.
The outbreak is the second in Malaysia this year. In February, 2 people
died and 242 others fell ill from the disease which hit the central State
of Negeri Sembilan.
