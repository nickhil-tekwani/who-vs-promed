With local cases of Legionnaires' disease continuing to rise, public health officials are actively working to reduce the risk of infection and determine the source of _Legionella_ bacteria that caused the outbreak, officials say.

There are now a total of 27 confirmed cases, up from 19 on 7 Oct 2022, with 10 patients currently hospitalized and 2 in ICU care.

People can develop Legionnaires' disease when they inhale aerosolized water droplets containing the bacteria. Public health officials have pointed to the city's 11 cooling towers as a likely source of the outbreak. Cooling towers can harbour the bacteria and spread it through releasing aerosols into the environment.

"Given that we think that it is one of the 11 cooling towers in Orillia, we've asked them to either be shut down or cleaned and disinfected," said the region's associate medical officer of health, Dr. Colin Lee. "Six have been shut down, and the remaining 5 are in the process of being cleaned and disinfected," he explained.

"The usual approach would be to try to use where the cases are, where the cooling towers are, and try to make some predictions on where it might be," he said. "We've taken the approach of we're just going to make sure the risk is decreased as much as possible." Given the size and spread of the outbreak, Lee said the health unit is fairly confident it originated in a cooling tower.

"If the hypothesis is true, then moving forward from the end of next week, or maybe even earlier...we shouldn't be seeing any more cases," he said. "By doing this, even though we don't know exactly which tower it is, we're decreasing the risk to the public as much and as quickly as possible."

Lee said the health unit has taken a number of samples from the city's cooling towers, as well as several from infected patients; he is hoping for results next week. Determining the source of infection is complex, however, Lee said.

"Testing for _Legionella_ in the environmental samples is not like when you go for a COVID test, where it's just positive or negative. It's not easy to interpret," he said. "It's complex to interpret...because if you went to test a number of cooling towers where there's no human disease, you're liable to find some _Legionella_, and the question is, is it enough to cause disease?" said Lee. "Sometimes you might find a little bit of _Legionella_ in a cooling tower, but it's not the same species as the one in the sputum, and therefore can't really say that caused it."

Lee noted that, globally, the source of _Legionella_ infections often goes undetermined. He said the health unit will be working closely with the community to reduce the risk of its spread.

"The most important thing for these cooling towers is really good preventive maintenance, and certainly we will be looking into each of these cooling towers and make sure that they do have (that)...which means periodic inspection, testing, ensuring there's enough biocide to kill germs, that kind of thing," Lee said. "As for people who are in Orillia right now, I would say that moving forward the risk, I think, will be tremendously decreased."

Lee said that, historically, Simcoe Muskoka would see a handful of cases per year, but numbers have increased annually since around 2018. Asked why the number of annual cases is trending upwards, Lee suggested climate change plays a contributing role.

"This is actually quite a big increase, as you can see," he said. "We think climate change has something to do with it because we're getting more hot days than usual, and...you're going to (need) either more cooling towers or cooling towers to be functioning longer. "As it's also hotter, it gives a greater chance for the _Legionella_ to thrive because _Legionella_, in water, thrives at the temperatures between 20 and 45 degrees Celsius," he explained.

People cannot get Legionnaires' disease by drinking water and it cannot be passed from person to person. Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill. Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by the _Legionella_ bacteria. People over the age of 50, smokers, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease. Legionnaires' disease can be treated with antibiotics, and most cases resolve without long-term effects.

[ProMED apologizes for the delay in posting.

ProMED greatly appreciates Dr Colin Lee's response from the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit to our request for more information on this Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Orillia, Ontario. There are now a total of 27 confirmed cases, up from 19 on 7 Oct 2022, with 10 patients currently hospitalized and 2 in ICU care. The city's 11 cooling towers are suspected as a likely source of the outbreak; 6 have been shut down, and the remaining 5 are in the process of being cleaned and disinfected. (There may still be some people incubating the disease after the source has been eliminated, and with a 2-week incubation period for Legionnaires' disease, there should be no additional cases about 14 days after the last cooling tower has been remediated.)

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of isolates of _Legionella_ from the cooling towers can help confirm the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

In 2019, Orillia had 10 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease; 9 people recovered and one person died. See ProMED posts Legionellosis - Canada (05): (ON) comment 20191221.6852109, Legionellosis - Canada (04): (ON) RFI 20191214.6840544, and Legionellosis - Canada (02): (ON) 20191013.6724136. The 2019 outbreak was attributed to a contaminated cooling tower on the basis of genotyping the _Legionella_ strains isolated from patients in the outbreak and the cooling tower (https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/legionnaire-s-outbreak-in-orillia-declared-over-1.4694534).

Orillia (pop., 33 411 residents in 2021) is a city in Simcoe County, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario, Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County), between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, about 87 mi (140 km) north of Toronto.
