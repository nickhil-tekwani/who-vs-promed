The Israeli Health Ministry recorded more than 4300 cases between July 2018 and July 2019, representing a monumental uptick from the year prior, when only about 30 cases were reported.

A 43-year-old flight attendant with El Al died last month [August 2019] after reportedly contracting measles from a passenger in March [2019].

[She] was admitted to Petah Tikva's Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Campus with a high fever, then fell into a coma and had to be placed on a respirator. Tests indicated she had been vaccinated against the measles with only a single shot, instead of the recommended 2.

The Health Ministry also issued warnings this year [2019] about potential measles exposures on El Al flights from London and Thailand, at medical centers, public transportation stops and at Eilat's Underwater Observatory Marine Park.

Despite the outbreaks, Israel's immunization rates are among the highest in the world: According to The World Bank, 98% of Israeli children between 12 and 23 months have measles vaccinations.

The immunization gap, say health experts, is within the country's Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, population. Israel's measles outbreak began in March 2018 in a Haredi community in Safed in northern Israel.

But the lack of vaccinations isn't because of any religious prohibition. "In general, those closed communities use our health care system much less than nonreligious people," Dr. Roy Zucker, a specialist in internal medicine in Israel, told Newsweek.

As of July 2019, there have been more than 1400 cases reported in Jerusalem, plus 400 in Beit Shemesh, 279 in Safed and 212 in Bnei Brak -- all of which have heavily Orthodox populations.

New Zealand's ongoing measles outbreak has hit the milestone of more than 1000 confirmed cases. A total of 1051 people were affected between [1 Jan and 5 Sep 2019], the ministry of health said.

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially fatal illness that causes coughing, rashes and fever. Although effective and safe vaccination is available, some developed countries have seen a measles resurgence in past years.

Worldwide, the number of cases has quadrupled in the first 3 months of 2019 compared with the same time last year [2018], according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The New Zealand outbreak is largely concentrated around the country's biggest city Auckland, with 877 of the confirmed cases seen there. The Health Ministry has issued a statement calling for everyone aged 12 months to 50 years old to get vaccinated if they have not been already.

Immunisation Advisory Centre director Dr. Nikki Turner told New Zealand's Newshub it is a "very sad" milestone to reach. The ministry has also put out a travel advice to get vaccinated at least 2 weeks before visiting Auckland.

The US Center[s] for Disease Control and Prevention has issued advice to get measles vaccination before visiting New Zealand.

Health authorities in Australia are bracing themselves for a major measles outbreak in Byron Bay after a child returned from a trip to New Zealand carrying the highly contagious disease. Reports of the child's return have sparked fears of an epidemic in Byron Bay, a surfing town in northern NSW, [where] 1 in 3 children are not vaccinated, the Daily Mail reported.

New Zealand is in the midst of a huge surge in measles cases, with almost 900 in Auckland and more than 1100 confirmed cases notified across the country. The outbreak in New Zealand is being closely monitored in Australia, with doctors pleading with parents not to travel to countries dealing with outbreaks if anyone in their family is not immunised, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Chair of the Northern NSW Local Health District, Dr. Brian Pezzutti, said parents who take their unvaccinated children to disease-riddled nations are "simply irresponsible."

"It's irresponsible for the child to be exposed in the 1st place but then irresponsible to bring the child back into their own community," Dr. Pezzutti said. "It's all very well for the mothers' groups to tut-tut, but there needs to be more pressure from the community to make sure these children are immunised."

Local health authorities also sent kids who had been exposed to the potentially fatal disease to Byron Bay Hospital to be vaccinated.

A TD [member of the Irish Parliament] has warned of "serious repercussions" after it was revealed the child vaccination uptake has dropped into the World Health Organisation (WHO) red zone. Statistics from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre show up to 25% of infants and toddlers are not receiving shots in parts of Ireland.

Sinn Fein spokeswoman Louise O'Reilly said: "We need to get past all the misinformation on social media and the anti-vaxxers and talk to parents face to face."

Fears are growing that highly contagious diseases such as measles could run rampant again, with experts warning of a possible epidemic.

Officials from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have recorded 10 958 cases of the illness -- which can prove fatal -- across the continent from January to [14 Jul] this year [2019]. It is the worst performance in over a decade and the 1st time the country has been in the range since the anti-vax movement began.

EU countries worst affected are France, Bulgaria, Italy, Poland and Lithuania -- but the slump in Ireland means we could soon be facing an epidemic of our own. The number of measles cases reported tripled last year [2018] with 77 cases -- up from just 25 in 2017.

At least one Hawaii resident has been infected with measles, according to a report. Officials with the state's Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the case on Tuesday [3 Sep 2019], according to Hawaii News Now, which added the resident contracted the virus while traveling to another state.

"Because CDC reports cases based on their area of residence, the individual is counted as a Hawaii case even though they contracted the disease in another state," health officials told the news outlet in a statement. "If DOH had any reported measles case that was locally transmitted, we would announce the information immediately."

No other details were provided.

The case comes after New York City officials this week [1-7 Sep 2019] declared an end [to] the largest measles outbreak the city has seen in nearly 30 years. Officials said New York City spent more than USD 6 million to combat the outbreak, which primarily affected Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn. More than 500 staff were involved in response efforts, which included disseminating pro-vaccination booklets, distributing educational materials in multiple languages, and attending community events, among other efforts.

Separately, last week [25-31 Aug 2019] federal health officials announced the USA is experiencing the highest number of measles cases since the early 1990s. The CDC in its weekly measles cases and outbreaks report said there are 1215 confirmed measles cases in the USA, representing an increase of 12 cases from the week before.

[6] Immunosuppression

Children who catch measles are more vulnerable to other deadly infections for the next 2 to 3 years, experts have warned. Scientists say the disease wipes out a child's immunity against other infections. The findings would help explain the mysterious large drops in mortality of up to 50% following the introduction of measles vaccinations in 1968, the researchers said.

Last month [August 2019] the UK lost its "measles-free" status following a surge in the number of cases being reported across the country.

The research, led by assistant professor Michael Mina from Harvard Medical School in Boston, has been backed by previous studies that show that the measles virus infects a large proportion of the "memory cells" of the immune system. This leads to so called "immune-amnesia," which stops the immune system remembering some of the diseases it has fought in the past.

A UK study of more than 2200 children with measles found they were 24% more likely to need antibiotics in the 5 years after having the disease than children who never had it. They were also more likely to suffer from chest infections, viral illnesses and tonsillitis.

Professor Mina, who will present his findings at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) conference in Bilbao, Spain, urged parents to vaccinate their children. "Prior to vaccination, measles infected nearly everyone," he said.

A girl aged 1 was left critically ill after catching measles from someone who was not vaccinated. [She] was too young to have her 1st jab; [she] became unwell with a high temperature this April [2019] and was admitted to hospital. Doctors diagnosed her with measles, which made her so poorly her eyes fused shut. She spent 8 days at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, London. Her mother said: "It has been absolutely horrific watching our daughter fight this with her eyes swollen shut for 4 days. She has been in the dark, scared with a high fever that lasted for over 2 weeks. It was absolutely awful to go through it." She has now recovered, and [her mother] has posted photos of her in hospital in a bid to dispel myths about jabs and urge parents to get their children immunised.

[Professor Mina:] "We now think that measles infections may erase pre-existing immune memory. By preventing measles infection through vaccination, we prevent future infection with other infectious diseases allowed back into the body by the damage done by measles.

"Epidemiological data from the UK, USA and Denmark shows that measles causes children to be at a heightened risk of infectious disease mortality from other non-measles infections for approximately 2 to 3 years."

Before the introduction of a measles vaccine, there were between 160 000 and 800 000 cases reported a year -- and around 100 fatalities. There were 532 confirmed cases of measles in the UK during the first 6 months of 2019, and more than 2400 cases from January 2016 to June 2019.

Last month [August 2019] figures by Public Health England showed that 1 in 7 young children are not fully protected, rising to 1 in 4 in London. It follows concern over the rise of so-called anti-vaxxers, who have spread now discredited claims on social media that the vaccine was linked to autism in children.

Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, of Public Health England, said: "These findings only add to the evidence of the phenomenal impact of vaccination programmes. UK measles vaccination has prevented 20 million cases and 4500 deaths. No other medical intervention has been as important in the last 50 years."

[To read more about the mechanism behind measles immunosuppression, see Laksono BM et al. Studies into the mechanism of measles-associated immune suppression during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands. Nat Commun 2018;9:4944. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-07515-0.

Abstract: Measles causes a transient immune suppression, leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. In experimentally infected non-human primates (NHPs), measles virus (MV) infects and depletes pre-existing memory lymphocytes, causing immune amnesia. A measles outbreak in the Dutch Orthodox Protestant community provided a unique opportunity to study the pathogenesis of measles immune suppression in unvaccinated children. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of prodromal measles patients, we detected MV-infected memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and naive and memory B cells at similar levels as those observed in NHPs. In paired PBMC collected before and after measles, we found reduced frequencies of circulating memory B cells and increased frequencies of regulatory T cells and transitional B cells after measles. These data support our immune amnesia hypothesis and offer an explanation for the previously observed long-term effects of measles on host resistance. This study emphasises the importance of maintaining high measles vaccination coverage.
