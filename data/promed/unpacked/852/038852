Translation of information received on 20 Jul 2006 from Dr Kanga Kouame,
director of veterinary services and quality, Ministry of Animal Production
and Fish Resources, Abidjan:
End of previous report period: 15 May 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[21]: 407, 25 May)
End of this report period: 20 Jul 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2006.
New outbreak: An outbreak in San Pedro region, near Grand Bereby occurred
at the SO.GB industrial rubber plantation village, 550 km south west of
Abijan, on 10 Jun 2006. About 890 chickens, around 100 ducks and around 10
pigeons (free-ranging system) were susceptible and 5 birds affected. It
appears that a wild bird was also found dead.
Description of affected population: 5 traditional chickens and a wild bird
found dead.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Central Veterinary
Laboratory of LANADA (National Laboratory for Agricultural Development
Support), Bingerville.
Results: RT-PCR; virus isolation on 28 Jun 2006 were positive for H5N1.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Vaccination in response to the outbreaks: In Abidjan district, 114 803
Gallimune Flu H5N9-inactivated oily vaccine doses were given, which
included 9011 poultry in traditional farms around the outbreak in Yopougon
(ring vaccination) and 105 792 poultry in modern farms.
Other details/comments: Despite a heavy concentration of susceptible
animals, there has not been the high mortality usually associated with
avian influenza. In San Pedro region, an awareness and information campaign
for consumers, producers, poultry merchants and the general public has been
carried out. Posters and leaflets have been distributed to the Prefecture,
the Regional Directorate for Agriculture and SO.GB. The implementation of
regulatory sanitary measures has enabled the outbreaks of avian influenza
in Abidjan district to be contained. This led to the reopening on 10 Jun
2006 of 57 poultry markets, which had been closed in compliance with the
conditions laid down in an order regulating the opening of poultry markets.

[Grand Bereby is located at the very south western corner of Cote d'Ivoire,
near Liberia; see
<http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&id=3c73c94b7>.
While the rubber plantation is certainly in a rural part of Cote d'Ivoire,
far away from the capital at Abidjan, the plantation will most likely have
little enclaves within its borders where people live and trade, supporting
much of the economic activity in the area and region. It is most likely
that the outbreak occurred in one such outpost on the plantation. - Mod.PC]
