New York City to vaccinate raccoons against rabies in Upper Manhattan
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Health Department reminds New Yorkers to avoid wild animals and to
vaccinate their pets against rabies.

The Health Department announced today [16 Feb 2010] that it will start
vaccinating raccoons in and around Central Park to protect them and
the surrounding community from rabies. Since December [2009], health
authorities have documented more than 3 dozen rabies cases among
raccoons in Central Park and Upper Manhattan. The vaccination effort
-- a collaboration involving the Health Department, the Parks
Department, the Central Park Conservancy, and the US Department of
Agriculture -- is an attempt to contain the outbreak. Today [16 Feb
2010], wildlife experts will start humanely trapping raccoons around
Central Park, Morningside Park, and Riverside Park. Each captured
animal will be vaccinated and tagged for identification, then released
in the same location.

The trap-vaccinate-release effort will continue for 4 to 8 weeks, and
officials will repeat it next summer [2010] to vaccinate raccoons born
this spring. Traps will be placed in remote areas to keep pets and
park visitors from disrupting them, and each trap will display City
contact information for use in emergencies.

Rabies is seen more in raccoons than any other animal in New York
City. Besides preventing transmission among raccoons, the vaccination
effort will reduce the chance that a rabid raccoon bites or scratches
a pet or person. Such occurrences are rare in the city, but the Health
Department has documented 3 exposures since December [2009] -- one in
which a dog was bitten, one in which a person was bitten, and one
involving a person who tried to nurse a sick raccoon to health. The
dog and both people have received post-exposure treatment, and none
has become ill.

So far this year [2010], 39 raccoons in Manhattan have tested positive
for rabies. The Health Department's rabies surveillance reports are
available online and updated regularly.

To protect yourself against rabies:
- do not touch or feed wild animals, or stray dogs or cats
- keep garbage in tightly sealed containers
- stay away from any animal that is behaving aggressively
- stay away from any wild animal that appears ill or acts unusually
friendly. Call 311 or your local police precinct to report the animal
- animals that have attacked, or seem likely to attack, should be
reported to 911.

To protect your pet against rabies:
- make sure your dog or cat is up-to-date on rabies vaccinations
- keep your dog leashed while outdoors unless at a specified off-leash
area or park
- do not leave your pets outdoors unattended
- do not try to separate animals that are fighting
- if your pet has been in contact with an animal that might be rabid,
contact your veterinarian, and report the incident to 311
- feed pets indoors.

If you are bitten or scratched by an animal:
- immediately wash the wound with lots of soap and water
- seek medical care from your health care provider
- if the animal is not owned, and can be captured, call 311
- if the animal is a pet, get the owner's name, address, and telephone
number so that the Health Department can monitor the animal
- to report a bite, call the Animal Bite Unit (212-676-2483) between 9
a.m. and 5 p.m. during the week. At night or on weekends, call
212-POISONS (764-7667). You can also file a report online at
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/vet/vetegp.shtml>.
- for information about medical follow-up, call 311 or your medical provider.

[The method of vaccination allows for tracking of the animal and
insures which animals have been vaccinated. I expected that the city
might also do some oral bait vaccinations and possibly also be
catching any strays [dogs or cats] that may have come into contact
with the rabid raccoons.

Perhaps the officials from New York City would be kind enough to
notify of us of the strain of rabies. We have assumed it is the
raccoon strain of rabies, but it could be another strain. - Mod.TG]
