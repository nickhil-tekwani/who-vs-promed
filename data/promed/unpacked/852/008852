At least 45 people were admitted to hospital after contracting diarrhea in Limpopo, the provincial health department said on Mon 27 Jan 2014.

"Officials were attending a workshop at a lodge when they were taken to hospital, severely affected," said spokesman Macks Lesufi. "Our provincial Diseases Outbreak Response team is on site. Further tests are being conducted to determine the cause, and the results will be made available."

Nine of those admitted to hospital were in a critical condition, while 36 were treated and discharged from the Voortrekker Hospital on Sun 26 Jan 2014.

Contaminated water or food was suspected to be the source of the outbreak at the lodge, Lesufi said. Lesufi advised those with diarrhea symptoms not to panic but to visit their local health institutions.

The province is prone to disease outbreak, especially during rainy seasons. Cholera and malaria cases have recently been reported in parts of the province.

A cholera outbreak in Koko/Besse local government area of Kebbi State has led to the deaths of 3 people and several others being hospitalized. Chairman of the local government Alh Aliyu Buhari Koko disclosed this to journalists during a tour of the local government.

Koko stated that because of the outbreak, the council quickly constructed 5 boreholes across the 3 villages affected by the epidemic.

Koko said that the gesture became necessary considering the scores of lives involved in the outbreak in order to prevent people from drinking contaminated water.

[3] Diarrhea, dysentery - Zimbabwe (Masvingo, Mashonaland west Provinces)
Date: 13 Jan 2014

26 people died of diarrheal diseases countrywide in one week alone during the festive season, a weekly disease surveillance report has revealed. According to the report, 16 died of common diarrhea, while 10 others died from dysentery during the week ending 26 Dec 2013. The majority of the diarrhea deaths were recorded in Gutu in Masvingo, while most of the dysentery cases were recorded in Hurungwe in Mashonaland West province. An additional 6415 people were treated for diarrhea, while 729 were treated for dysentery in the same week.

Epidemiology and disease control director in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Portia Manangazira said of late that there was an increase in the number of diarrhea cases. Dr Manangazira attributed the increase to flooding and stagnant water bodies common during this season. "It is difficult to contain diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and dysentery as we are in the middle of the rainy season," Dr Manangazira said. In 2013, a total of 598 people died of diarrheal diseases throughout the country, while 579 932 others received treatment from the same diseases.

The government was worried about deaths from diarrheal diseases saying no one should die from diarrhea because it was preventable and treatable. However, the diseases continue to affect many people and claim lives due to lack of adequate and safe water and sanitary conditions in many parts of the country.

[4] Diarrhea - Philippines (Zamboanga Sibugay Province)

A total of 65 children, including babies, have died in an evacuation center in the city, the local health office said on Mon 20 Jan 2014.

City health officer Dr. Rodelyn Agbulos said that the majority of the fatalities were minors, including babies. The deaths were caused by malnourishment and complications from diarrhea. Agbulos said 32 of the victims were children aged 5 years and below, and 33 were children 5 years old and above.

The fatalities were staying at the Joaquin F. Enriquez Sports Complex, which was converted into a huge evacuation center to accommodate the thousands of city residents displaced by the standoff between government troops and Moro National Liberation Front rebels in November last year [2013]. "Those affected were severely malnourished children and with complications of diarrhea," Agbulos said.
