Panama declares meningitis epidemic along border with Costa Rica
----------------------------------------------------
Panamanian health authorities on Wednesday declared an epidemic of viral
meningitis in the province of Chiriqui, on the border with Costa Rica, where
186 cases have been reported in the past 3 weeks. General health director
Esteban Morales, flanked by epidemiologists, said that 237 cases of viral
meningitis had been recorded throughout the country in children under 15
years old.
Morales told a news conference at a Panama City hospital that the Health
Ministry was aware of only one case of bacterial meningitis. Health
authorities explained that viral meningitis is benign, while bacterial
meningitis is fatal in 15 percent of the cases, and results in lingering
problems in the brains of 40 percent of the patients. Most of the 20 or so
children who are currently in hospital with viral meningitis are between one
and 6 years old, Morales said.
He added that schools in the province of Chiriqui would remain closed to
avoid contagion, since there is no vaccine against the disease and the only
way to prevent it is by practicing thorough personal hygiene.
Morales said that viral meningitis is caused by an enterovirus that lodges
in the intestinal wall, and he added that it spreads through oral contagion
and poor hygienic practices. He described meningitis as an infection or
swelling of the membrane that covers the brain and the spinal cord. Symptoms
usually include severe headaches, vomiting, and neck pain and stiffness. A
health official said that bacterial meningitis must be immediately treated
with specific antibiotics, but that there is no specific treatment for viral
meningitis.

particular, coxsackieviruses (A and B types) and some echoviruses. More
information on this outbreak from official sources, including the type of
virus responsible, would be appreciated. - Mods.CP/MPP]
