The recent outbreak related to imported snow peas belies the fact that
shigellosis rates in Denmark and Norway have remained consistently low for
more than 2 decades (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Denmark-shig.png>). This graph was
constructed using a user-driven Gideon menu, which contains over 30 000
base graphs.
