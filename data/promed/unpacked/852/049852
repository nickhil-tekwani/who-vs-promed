OUTBREAK MARKUP LANGUAGE (OML)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: David Ornstein <davido@outbreak.org>, Jack Woodall

Outbreak Markup Language (OML) is an Internet format for capturing
information about outbreaks. This format's most important feature is that
it is simple and meaningful to both computers and people. Having a
standard format will allow easier exchange of outbreak reports between
everyone involved in combating emerging infectious diseases -- particularly
those with access to the Internet. The early work was done by David
Ornstein of Outbreak with help from Jack Woodall of ProMED-mail. [All
errors are David's doing!]
Now it's time to open the doors and let the rest of the world in to help us
figure out what we've missed, so we're releasing the specification for open
comment. If you think you might have useful feedback about such a format,
please have a look at
http://www.outbreak.org/cgi-unreg/dynaserve.exe/oml.html.
We're hoping to have this format in use within the first few months of 1998.
Below is a list of the requirements we've tried to accommodate in the
report format:
- Easy for people to create
- Easy for people to understand
- Easy for computers to process
- Transmissible by plain-text e-mail
- Extensible
- Supports cross-referencing
- Works across non-coordinated organizations
- Non-proprietary
We look forward to your feedback.
