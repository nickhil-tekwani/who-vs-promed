A state official has confirmed the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in South Carolina in 2013.

Dr. Boyd Parr, South Carolina State Veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock Poultry Health, said a foal from Sumter County that recently died tested positive for the disease. Two adult horses that died at the same farm around the same time are suspected of also having EEE, a mosquito-borne illness in horses that can also affect humans.

Clinical signs in horses include stumbling, partial paralysis and the inability to stand. The symptoms usually develop from 2 to 5 days after exposure. Nine out of every 10 horses infected with EEE virus die.

Parr is urging horse owners to consult their veterinarians to ensure that vaccinations against both EEE and West Nile virus are up-to-date.

[This is a staggering statistic of the number of horses who become infected and die. It should make every horse owner want to immediately vaccinate. By the time a horse is reported to have died of this disease, the virus is circulating in the area, and horse owners are already late. Save your horses and have them vaccinated.

It should be remembered that this virus may affect humans; however, it cannot transfer from the horse to the human being. It is transmitted to humans and to horses through the bite of a mosquito.

Mosquito control for humans and for horses is important. Use mosquito repellant spray appropriately labeled for horses.

Protect yourself with mosquito repellant containing DEET. Remove any standing water, such as in old tires, to eliminate breeding locations for mosquitoes. Don't be out at dusk and dawn. Do wear long sleeves even when it is hot, as this is a measure for protecting yourself from this disease.
