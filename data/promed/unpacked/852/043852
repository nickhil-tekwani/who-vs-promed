Over the past months, coconut tress have been falling prey to the mysterious disease [see ProMED-mail post 20120530.1149915] which has been identified as the main reason for decimation of palm tress in Antigua & Barbuda.

With the assistance of the Jamaica Coconut Industry Board, the Plant Protection Unit [PPU] conducted tests to determine the cause. The results confirmed the presence of lethal yellowing. "We took 29 samples of plant material to be tested in Jamaica, and 20 were positive for lethal yellowing," Dr Gore-Francis, PPU, said.

The government is now brainstorming ways in which to tackle the disease. One of the management practices will be to cut down the affected palms. The 1st step taken 2 months ago by the ministry was to impose a temporary ban on all live palms coming into the country. This ban will remain in effect until further notice.

The scourge was 1st identified in the north of the island and appears to be steadily spreading.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm, usually within 4 to 6 months.

The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded, and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities.

Commercial control of LY diseases relies on replanting with resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons for the resistance breakdown are still uncertain.

In Antigua, large scale death of coconut palms was 1st noted early in 2012 and attributed to a "mystery insect pest" (see links to previous news stories below). It is not clear whether this insect infestation may have consisted of infectious LY planthopper vectors or whether the 2 problems are unrelated.
