New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Greshnica, Makedosni Brod, Brod
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Jul 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep, goats / 466 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep, goats / 1.93 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: After reporting to the official veterinarian that there were animals with clinical signs of bluetongue, samples were taken from all animals with clinical signs. The same disease, bluetongue, was confirmed in 2014 on this farm. The National Laboratory under Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Skopje, is sequencing and comparing the current strain with the strain that occurred in 2014. Note from the World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department: As per WAHIS Notification Procedures, the date of last occurrence (i.e. [27 Feb 2015]) is the date when the last event for the reported disease was declared resolved.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, quarantine, zoning, disinfection, disinfestation, vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: control of vectors, vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Sheep, goats / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 9 Jul 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants. Midges of just a few species in the genus _Culicoides_ (the insect host transmit bluetongue virus (BTV) among susceptible ruminants, having become infected by feeding on viraemic animals (the vertebrate host). In many parts of the world infection has a seasonal occurrence. BTV does not establish persistent infections in ruminants, and survival of BTV in the environment is associated with insect factors. Epidemiological systems (episystems) delimited by vector species and their natural history are considered to determine the global distribution of BTV). Recent observations in Europe and the USA indicate that strains of BTV can move between episystems and adapt to different species of vector midges.

Virus may be introduced to a free area via infected insects, live ruminants or in contaminated products that are then transmitted to susceptible ruminants. If appropriate _Culicoides spp._ competent as vectors are present, virus can then be transmitted to other hosts. BTV is not known to cause disease in humans under any conditions." Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.1.3 Bluetongue (Infection with Bluetongue virus) https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.03_BLUETONGUE.pdf.

Between July and October 2014, Macedonia reported 299 outbreaks of bluetongue serotype 4 to the OIE. The event was resolved on 27 Feb 2015. See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15782.

According to the current report, the affected population in Brod is mixed, including both sheep and goats. The epidemiological data do not differentiate between them. However, BTV 4 (as most other BTV serotypes) rarely causes clinical signs in goats; sheep, and in particular European mutton breeds as well as other susceptible sheep breeds (e.g. Chios), may be seriously affected, with mortality that may, in some cases, exceeds 20-30 percent. It will be helpful to know whether goats are included among the 9 cases recorded in this flock. If/when vaccination is applied, goats will not be vaccinated. - Mods.CRD/AS
