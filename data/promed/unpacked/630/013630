An outbreak of brucellosis in cattle has been registered in the
Kletskiy rayon (district) according to the local authorities. The
incident involving 51 cattle happened in the village of Ventsi. A
veterinary post has been installed in the village to prevent trade of
milk and dairy products.

[The most recent official information on the situation of the
zoonotic disease bovine brucellosis (typically caused by _Brucella
abortus_) in Russia, as available on the OIE website, dates back to
2005. During that year, 402 bovines, in at least 3 locations, were
found positive within the Volgograd oblast; no slaughter or culling
of these animals was reported.

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Russia can be seen at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01aA>.
Kletskiy rayon is situated within the Volgograd oblast (No. 41 in the
Southern Federal District map at
<http://www.russiasregions.com/southern_federal_district.html>).
The village of Ventsi is probably too small to appear on available maps.

A laboratory confirmation, excluding _B. melitensis_ (which is also
endemic in various parts of Russia and may infect cattle) is
anticipated. According to Russia's reports to the OIE, _B.
melitensis_ has not been reported from the Volgograd oblast at least
since 2005 (reports available from January 2005 to June 2009).
However, in 2008 there was suspicion that a consignment of sheep
infected with _B. melitensis_ introduced the agent in 2007, from
Volgograd to the Moscow region (see ProMED-mail 20080317.1043).
