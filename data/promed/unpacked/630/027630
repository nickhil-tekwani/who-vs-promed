Another town in Ilocos Norte has been added to the red zone map of African swine fever (ASF) after 2 barangays [village] in Banna town were found to have been infected with the highly contagious viral disease.

Municipal agriculturist Alan Palaspas confirmed this in a radio interview on Thursday [19 Aug 2021] as he reported there are 220 hogs in Barangay Crispina and 424 in Barangay Valdez which needed to be culled to arrest the further spread of ASF to nearby villages and towns.

The municipal agriculturist theorized the water from the irrigation canal where some backyard hog raisers get their water supply may have triggered the spread of the virus or infected meat may have probably entered the municipality amidst stern warning from the local government prohibiting the entry of pig products from other towns and provinces.

Of the 21 towns and 2 cities of Ilocos Norte, at least 7 municipalities, mostly located near upstream are already in the red map or infected zones.

These are the towns of Solsona where the index case was recorded, followed by its neighboring towns of Dingras, Marcos, Nueva Era, Carasi, Vintar, and Banna.

In the meantime, the Provincial Veterinary Office is urging hog raisers to engage in other livestock production to mitigate their loss.
