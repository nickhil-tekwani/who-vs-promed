WHO Statement on Smallpox Vaccination Policy
--------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization, WHO, stated that it is reconsidering
using the vaccine against smallpox, in light of the possible use of
the virus as a biological weapon. Smallpox is considered to have been
officially eradicated in 1980. For years, there have been no cases
reported. Nonetheless, because of the potential for the use of the
virus in terrorist actions, WHO has decided to include it in the list
of 11 diseases that
might be used by extremist groups.
Ian Simpson, spokesman for the organization, stated that WHO's
recommendation to governments is that they verify their level of
preparedness to handle diseases, including smallpox. The resurgence of
fear related to smallpox was prompted by the cases of anthrax in the
US.
However, unlike anthrax, smallpox is a highly contagious disease among
humans. Nonetheless, the vaccine may be effective in preventing or
reducing the severity of the clinical disease, up until 4 days after
the person has been infected. Contrary to popular belief, the immunity
conferred by the vaccine is not for life and, in many cases, it is
necessary to administer booster doses every 5 to 10 years in order to
maintain protective levels of neutralizing antibodies.
WHO calculates that there are close to 90 million doses of the vaccine
stored by governments for use in civilian populations. However,
manufacture of the vaccine involves a complex procedure and some
specialists affirm that it is probable that the WHO will maintain its
recommendations against massive vaccination.
For the time being, although there are no indications of a possible
terrorist act with the smallpox virus, the United States has begun to
multiply its vaccine reserves, according to a multi-tiered plan that
even contemplates immunizing the entire population of the country.
Some scientists calculate that a massive vaccination campaign could
take months, even years, and that by the time of its conclusion, the
threat may well have vanished.

[Smallpox vaccine -- which is made from vaccinia & not smallpox
virus -- saved many more lives than those who died from adverse
reactions. The major problem with restarting mass vaccination in the
absence of disease is that adverse reactions will kill some people --
perhaps many in this age of AIDS & lowered immunity. Remember the
swine flu vaccine problems? - Mod.JW

Smallpox immunity: Request for Information
------------------------------------------
There is considerable agonizing about variola [smallpox. Has anyone
determined the residual immunity in individuals who were vaccinated
prior to 1972? A simple experiment would be to vaccinate 100 or so
people who have had previous vaccinia vaccinations to see how many
vaccinations "take."

[We presume that Cecil Fox's question is being addressed at the
present time, at least by the military. The CDC web-site merely states
that:
"Routine vaccination against smallpox ended in 1972. The level of
immunity, if any, among persons who were vaccinated before 1972 is
uncertain; therefore, these persons are assumed to be susceptible."
A study on a small number of subjects was published in 1978 by A.
Moller-Larsen and S. Haahr (Infect Immun 1978 Jan;19(1):34-90: Humoral
and cell-mediated immune responses in humans before and after
revaccination with vaccinia virus). They reported that 26 healthy
males vaccinated 15 to 18 years ago with vaccinia virus were
revaccinated. Blood samples were collected before vaccination and 3
weeks after. The lymphocytes were tested in a blast transformation
assay with vaccinia antigen and phytohemagglutinin, and interferon
production was measured. The sera were subjected to neutralization and
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) tests. All
results were compared with clinical responses. The only test showing
immunity in all donors before vaccination was the ADCC. The other
tests showed a very limited residual immunity or no immunity at all.
****After revaccination, immunity reactions were found in all tests in
most of the donors. None of the tests made before vaccination could be
used to predict clinical reactions. The ADCC is recommended as a
sensitive serological test.
Perhaps those with up-to-date information would be prepared to share
it? - Mod.CP
