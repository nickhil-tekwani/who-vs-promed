Current outbreak of West Nile virus infection in Israel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 human cases hospitalized in Israel have been identified this summer
(starting from the beginning of Jul until the end of Aug) as having West
Nile Fever on the basis of IgM antibodies in blood or CSF. Serological
testings were performed at the Central Virus Laboratories (The national
virus reference laboratories - headed by Dr. Ela Mendelsohn). The patients
suffered from encephalitis, meningoencephalitis and transverse myelitis.
Ages [of the patients are 30-85. Two of the patients have died.

West Nile virus infection in Israel - immune status
---------------------------------------------------
In the report by Eleanor Kellon (31 Aug 2000) on West Nile Virus in Israel,
it is stated that most Israelis have acquired immunity against the disease.
This information has no basis in fact. In a serosurvey that my colleagues
and I conducted some years ago, about 40% of adults aged 40-55 (in 1982)
had antibodies, in adults aged 20-30 years old (in 1989) only 10% had
antibodies and about 7% of adults aged 18-19 years (in 1987) had
antibodies. According to these data, the overwhelming majority of Israelis
do not have antibodies against West Nile Virus.

fever, sandfly fever Sicilian, and sandfly fever Naples viruses in healthy

West Nile virus Fever in Israel
-------------------------------
A report issued by Dr Rishpon (District Health Officer in the MOH) on 31
Aug 2000 about a meeting at the MOH, includes the following highlights
about West Nile virus (WNV) in Israel. So far [the MOH [has received
reports of 12 human cases with 2 deaths of elderly patients (more than 80
years) this year. Since the beginning of the year there [has been
laboratory confirmation of 23 cases, 14 in the month of August. [This
increase is attributed to [an increase in the rate of positive results and
not to the number of samples. Testing for WNV was not routine for several
years but was resumed in Jan 1999, and serological surveys conducted since
then [indicated that infection was prevalent among veterinarians and geese.
In a survey of 300 reserve soldiers, conducted in 1987 by the Army only 7%
of the 20-30 age group were seropositive. This finding is in accordance
with the present findings that WNV, which was relatively common in the 50's
to the 70's, became more rare until recently. Both the Ministry of Health
and the Ministry of Agriculture are taking measures to monitor and contain
the disease which is not considered a major public health threat at the
present time.

[Although West Nile virus is endemic in the Middle East, knowledge of the
epidemiology of West Nile virus-associated disease and human immune
responses to infection is relevant to understanding of the outbreak in
North America. This thread will be continued but restricted to
consideration of these issues. -Mod.CP
