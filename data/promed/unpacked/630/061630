Action to combat a deadly disease has been given support by national
scientists. The virulent fungal disease is infesting the native
bilberry on Cannock Chase. National plant specialists are watching
the outbreak. There is a containment zone around the diseased area
covering around 2280 acres to avoid spreading the phytophthora spores.

Teams have been cutting and burning the infected bilberry material in
a bid to contain, control and destroy the disease. The infection
could remain in the root system of the plants, but it will not be
known whether this is the case for around 2 or 3 years.

Staffordshire County Councillor Steve Potter said: "The containment
operation has been undertaken with the advice and approval of Defra
and Natural England. We have worked closely with them to ensure we
are following the best possible advice from the national experts. We
will continue to assist our colleagues from the national plant health
agencies to test diseased materials and explore these complex and
uncharted micro-biological interactions. It's going to be a long term
commitment. We are totally dedicated to doing everything we can," he
said.

[The genus _Vaccinium_ (family _Ericaceae_) includes a number of
species from northern America, Europe and Asia colloquially called
blueberries. They are shrubs producing similar-looking edible berries
and include both domesticated fruit crops (such as cranberries and
American blueberries) and wild heathland species (such as bilberries,
blaeberries, lingonberries).

The pathogen referred to above is _Phytophthora kernoviae_, a species
of unknown origin described recently (2005) from the UK and also
reported from New Zealand. It has been found causing severe leaf
necrosis and stem dieback on _Vaccinium_ and related berries in
Scotland and Cornwall. The pathogen appears to have a wide host range
and has also been reported to affect some tree crops, for example
sweet chestnut (_Castanea_ species) and custard apple (_Annona_
species). _P. kernoviae_ occurs both in cultivated and native
habitats, which increases pathogen reservoirs and risk of spread.

The genus includes many pathogenic species, for example _P.
infestans_ (late blight of potato and tomato). These pathogens are
spread by mechanical means, with infected plant materials, water and
soil. Disease management is usually difficult because they are
soil-borne. Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases in
Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful. This
highlights the seriousness of the threat posed by _P. kernoviae_ to
both wild and cultivated species. Further hosts are likely to be
discovered, and these may include additional crops.
