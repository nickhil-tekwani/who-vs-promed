The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) announced Tuesday [22 Jul 2014] it had confirmed 3 more measles cases in Sedgwick County. That brings the total number of cases to 11. Of those 3 cases, current through Saturday [20 Jul 2014], one is the cook at Sumo by Nambara reported to have contracted the disease last week [week ending 20 Jul 2014]. The KDHE did not have information about the 2 other new cases on Tuesday afternoon, said KDHE spokeswoman Aimee Rosenow.

At a Sedgwick County Commission staff meeting, Goering said the county is "expecting more cases to come up", at least through the 2nd week of August. The incubation period for measles can last up to 3 weeks, Rosenow said, and in order for a measles outbreak to be considered over, 2 incubation periods have to pass without new cases arising. The last public onset of the disease was on 15 Jul 2014, she said, so that means the soonest the outbreak could be considered over is by 26 Aug 2014.

"We've been working pretty hard at containing the outbreak," Goering said. "Every day our staff has been going to several homes to take temperatures and check for symptoms when there has been exposure." The county has been meeting twice a day with KDHE officials to update the situation, he said. Employees at Sal's Japanese Steakhouse and Sumo by Nambara -- both of which reported employees contracting the disease -- have been cooperative, he said. He said health officials have also been investigating at the Wichita Marriott on Corporate Hills Drive. Rosenow confirmed that an employee at the Marriott had contracted the disease, creating potential exposure points at the hotel on 29 Jun, 30 Jun and 2 Jul [2014]. So far there have been no cases associated with this exposure point, she said. Investigators have sent letters to employees at the hotel and guests who stayed there on those days informing them of the potential exposure, she said. She did not know what the employee's position in the hotel was. "I'm not sure that it necessarily is relevant where they worked in the hotel," Rosenow said. "Most people in the room would be exposed just because of how contagious this disease is."

The state Department of Health is inching toward declaring the outbreak of measles in Ohio is over. The last time state health officials got a report of a new case of measles was nearly 2 weeks ago -- 9 Jul 2014 -- in Holmes County. But by the rule of thumb of the Centers for Disease Control, it'll be another month, with no new cases, before the state can declare victory. Still, the Ohio Department of Health says things seem to be under control, largely because counties spread the vaccination word -- and the vaccine itself -- and largely because the Amish population of central Ohio was ready to listen. "They got to see what measles actually looked like in their own family or in their own community on 1st sight. Instead of hearing what could/should/may happen to you, I think the fact that they got to see it and experience it around their loved ones helped them to see why the vaccinations are so important in these outbreak situations."

In all, Ohio has had 371 cases of measles reported in 9 counties. That accounts for about 2/3rds of all the cases in the United States this year [2014] -- and this year recorded the most cases of any year since measles was largely eradicated in the US in 2000.

A Tarrant County [Texas] resident has been diagnosed with measles after attending a softball tournament in Kansas where health officials later warned of possible exposure to the virus. Tarrant County Public Health [TCPH] confirmed the diagnosis on Wednesday morning [23 Jul 2014] and said the patient lives in the north east part of the county. A Texas Department of State Health Services spokeswoman said the person attended a July 4th weekend softball tournament in Wichita, Kansas.

Health officials on 17 Jul 2014 announced more than 30 people from Texas who traveled to the tournament may have been exposed to measles virus. At least 3 recreational softball teams from Texas played in Wichita. On Tuesday [22 Jul 2014], 11 cases of measles were confirmed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. A report by The Wichita Eagle listed possible exposure points as a steakhouse, a hotel and the informal softball tournament attended by teams from several states including Texas. The TCPH department said public health officials are also tracing contacts, assessing immune status and offering immunization for those who have not had measles or previous vaccination, the department said in a news release on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014]. On their website, CDC said "adults can also get measles, especially if they are not vaccinated. Children under 5 years of age and adults over 20 are at higher risk for measles complications including pneumonia, and a higher risk of hospitalization and death from measles than school aged children and adolescents."

Health agencies in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and in Zamboanga Peninsula are on alert following a measles outbreak in Maguindanao and Sulu. The Department of Health (DOH) in ARMM said the high number of confirmed cases in the different areas in ARMM prompted local government units to declare the outbreak. Dr Jojo Sinolinding said they continue to expect reports from different provinces regarding the current number of confirmed cases of measles to guide their next step.

Maguindanao has the highest reported number of measles cases at 364, 8 of whom have died. Marawi has 86 cases and 2 deaths, while Sulu has 90 cases and 5 dead. The coordinator for the Regional Epidimiology and Surveillance Unit of DOH Region 9 said they are consistently monitoring the cases reported in Isabela City, Basilan. However, the number of cases has not yet reached the threshold level for an outbreak.

At the present, there are zero cases in Basilan. In Zamboanga City, however, there are 44 cases of measles, but all have not been confirmed. Coordinator for the Regional Epidimiology and Surveillance Unit of DOH added that in the entire region, 346 cases were reported from January to June this year [2014], but only 35 cases were confirmed.

[Zamboanga City, officially the City of Zamboanga (Chavacano: Ciudad de Zamboanga), is a highly urbanized city located in Mindanao, the Philippines. It has a population of more than 807 129 according to the 2010 census. Zamboanga is the 6th most populous and 3rd largest city by land area in the Philippines. It is the commercial and industrial center of the Zamboanga Peninsula.

Zamboanga became the Republica de Zamboanga with Zamboangueno Chavacano as its official language and Spanish as its co-official language. After American intervention, the republic incorporated into the Philippines and became the capital of the former Moro Province, now Mindanao, from 1903 to 1913. On 12 Oct 1936, Zamboanga became a chartered city under Commonwealth Act No. 39.

The recent outbreak of measles in Waikato can in part be linked to a 16 year old research paper by Dr Andrew Wakefield, published in the medical journal The Lancet, discouraging vaccination, and long since discredited. Dr Andrew Wakefield was subsequently charged with professional misconduct.

To date there have been 114 cases of measles in Waikato. 80 per cent of the reported cases are in people aged between 10 and 20 -- the group which would have been due for the vaccine around the time of the fall-out from the Wakefield report. Immunisation Advisory Centre spokesperson Helen Petousis-Harris said Britain had a high uptake of the vaccine before the report came out but immunisation rates here were lower.

"So for us to try and get our rates higher has been, perhaps, more of an uphill battle because of this myth that's lingered on," she said.

Waikato medical officer of health Dr Anita Bell said she expected more measles cases to show up in the region. "And whether it will continue to blip a few a week, or will it sort of start up again with another phase of the outbreak, so we're hoping the 1st, but we have to be mindful that it could be the 2nd, and be on our guard." Anyone in doubt about whether they had been immunised should find out whether they were and, if they were not, get it done without delay.

Health authorities in the Bay of Plenty are on high alert with more cases of measles being reported. People are being urged to make sure they're immunised against measles if they haven't already had the vaccine when younger. Since mid-December 2013, the Bay of Plenty has recorded 18 confirmed cases, with 3 being reported to Toi Te Ora Public Heath this month [July 2014]. Toi Te Ora Public Health includes the Tauranga, Whakatane, Rotorua and Taupo areas.

Nationally, there have been 250 cases since December [2013], with 40 recorded in hospitals and no deaths. Since between 5 Jul and 16 Jul [2014], there have been 13 new cases nationally. Medical officer of health Dr Jim Miller says there have been some more cases locally. "It just underlines that there is an ongoing concern. There is still a risk of measles in our area." The medical officer of health says the recent cases are linked to the issues in the Waikato, as people have caught measles there and come back to the Bay of Plenty. While there is a risk from the cases around the country, there is also a risk of measles being brought into New Zealand from people who have travelled overseas. "Although New Zealand is actually, and it sounds strange, actually measles-free in a sense because we don't normally have measles circulating in New Zealand. It tends to be that people bring it back from their travels and then we get outbreaks locally because we have low immunisation rates."
