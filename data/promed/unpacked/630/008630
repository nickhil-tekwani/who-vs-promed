Six cases of Potomac horse fever have been confirmed in the Hanover area of Virginia, which is just north of Richmond. Equine veterinarians in the Commonwealth are recommending horse owners have their animals vaccinated and booster the vaccine for those already vaccinated.

"Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by an organism called _Neorickettsia risticii_ (formerly called _Ehrlichia risticii_) and can affect any breed, age, or sex of horse. The disease has a seasonal pattern, occurring between late spring and early fall. The organism that causes PHF is found within aquatic insects, and infection in horses is believed to occur when the insects are accidentally ingested. Clinically ill horses are not contagious to other horses.

"Clinical signs are variable but typically include depression and anorexia (not eating), fever (102-107 F / 38.9-41.7 C), mild colic, decreased abdominal sounds, diarrhea (60 percent of cases), and laminitis (40 percent of cases). If you see any of these signs in your horse, please call our office immediately. The antibiotic oxytetracycline can successfully treat the disease if given early in the course of illness. However, if the clinical signs are severe, the horse may need to have more supportive care such as fluids and anti-inflammatories.

"There is a vaccine against Potomac horse fever. The vaccine may not be 100 percent effective against preventing the disease because multiple strains of the organism exist; however, it often decreases the severity of illness if contracted. We are strongly recommending that you have your horses vaccinated against Potomac horse fever if they have never been vaccinated. They will then need a booster in 30 days. If your horses have been vaccinated but not within the last 30 days, we are also strongly recommending that you booster their vaccine."

Horse owners should contact their veterinarian with any questions and to schedule a vaccine appointment.

"In general, standing water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other aquatic insects," said Jeff Deiters, Mosquito Joe of Fredericksburg. The bad news is that even if you don't live near a natural body of water, any standing water poses a threat. The good news is there are easy ways to help reduce populations and exposure to these insects and the diseases they carry, Deiters said. For example:

- Regularly empty ponds, bird baths, fountains, plant pots, buckets, barrels, tarps, kids' toys, pet water dishes or anything else that holds water.
- Walk through the yard after every rain and empty any containers or areas where water has collected. Also, watch for puddles where condensation gathers from the AC unit.
- Clean out gutters to avoid standing water -- examine them for clots and damage that would cause water to collect.
- Make sure there are no low spots under decks where water can hide. For example, Dogs love to make low spots where they rest under decks because it's cool.
- Drill holes in the bottom of tire swings to prevent rainwater from accumulating. Do the same for garbage or recycling bins that reside outdoors.
- Use soil to fill in low areas in lawns and landscaped areas where rainwater may collect and stand for more than 7 days.
- Keep swimming pools clean, properly circulated and filtered. Empty "kiddie pools" regularly.
- Make sure you have good drainage around hot tub areas.
- Repair leaky outdoor faucets.
- Don't be afraid to educate neighbors. They may not realize they have a wheelbarrow full of water behind their shed. Politely offer to turn it over for them.
- Cut grass and shrubs short, as adult mosquitoes gather to rest in shady, cool areas. Keep the yard weed-free and avoid overgrown vegetation.
- Remove yard clippings, leaves, etc. from your yard.

Mosquitoes can only travel about 20 feet before they land, so professionally applied barrier sprays mean mosquitoes have no where to go.

"With any body of water, it is important to use an all-organic spray that protects fish while simultaneously removing mosquitoes," Deiters said. "We've discovered the 1st spray removes about 85 percent of mosquitoes, and usually the 2nd spray sets the property."

[This disease has been referred to in the past as equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, or equine ehrlichial colitis. It is best known for its gastrointestinal signs such as enteritis and diarrhea. This disease is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an intracellular organism, which is a member of the Erlichiaea family.

According to the isolates obtained from clinical cases, there is diversity in the organism, and each isolate has a different pattern of antigenic proteins. Therefore, Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by more than one strain of _Neorickettsia risticci_.

_N. risticii_, _N. sennetsu_, SF agent, and _N. helminthoeca_ are antigenically cross-reactive, and inoculation with _N. sennetsu_ protects horses from Potomac horse fever (15,21).

Current vaccines are only made using one strain, which likely explains its lack of efficacy in some cases.

Cases of Potomac horse fever have a seasonal presentation with the highest number of cases with clinical signs in July, August, and September.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the route of infection and have revealed that a parasite, living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects, is a reservoir for _N. risticii_. The parasites and _N. risticii_ have been found in adult and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies. Therefore, the seasonality of PHF is likely related to the seasonality of the flying insect.

But how does an equid become infected? These types of insects do not feed on warm blooded mammals, so it is likely that an equid may ingest an aquatic insect or snail while grazing, or consume a flying insect that has landed in drinking water. It has also been suggested that the insects might be attracted to the barn area by outdoor lights during the night.

The typical clinical signs observed in horses with PHF include: fever, anorexia, colic, depression, ileus (nonmotile gastrointestinal tract -- the horse does not defecate) or diarrhea, and laminitis [inflammation of the hoof. - Mod.SH].

Clinical signs and severity vary, but common to all cases of PHF is the manifestation of colitis. The onset of colitis can result in depression and anorexia and may or may not be accompanied by a fever and/or diarrhea. However, some horses with PHF can pass normal-looking feces without showing any signs of colitis.

The 1st prominent sign of PHF often observed by owners is a decrease in feed intake. In fact, some horses may not initially show any other clinical signs except not eating. Usually, this anorexia is followed by dehydration and toxemia characterized by very bright looking mucous and a bright red/purple line on the mucosal surface above the teeth (toxic line).

Many equids, upon becoming infected with PHF will develop a fever with an initial rise in temperature of about 103-106 degrees F [39-41 degrees C], but the presence of this fever may go unnoticed as this initial fever resolves within hours. However, it is often followed by 3-7 days of persistent fever, along with other clinical signs.

Laminitis often develops in cases of severe endotoxemia, but in some occasions it can be the only clinical sign. Laminitis in most cases results in euthanasia of the equid within days of the onset.

_N. risticii_ can cause abortions, and it is related to placentitis and retained placenta in most cases. The aborted fetus will show signs of the infection as well.

The drug of choice to treat _N. risticii_ infection in equids is oxytetracycline. The organism is inside the cells and is, therefore, difficult to treat. Oxytetracycline is able to interfere with the control mechanisms of _N. risticii_ and allows the macrophage to eliminate the organism. Oxyetracycline should be administered by a licensed veterinarian once a day for 3 to 5 days, and it is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease.

Several vaccines are commercially available in the United States, but their efficacy is questionable. Research has shown that once an equid develops an infection with _N. risticii_, the equid can develop an immunity to that particular strain for as long as 20 months.

In contrast, vaccination has been associated with a poor immune response. Research has shown that only 50 per cent of the vaccines are protective at 6 months after vaccination, and protection decreases to 33 per cent after 9 months. Vaccination may decrease clinical signs, but it will not prevent infection and illness.
