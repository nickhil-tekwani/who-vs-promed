A small poultry flock in British Columbia's [BC] Kootenay region has tested positive for the avian flu, the 3rd known outbreak in the province.

A statement from BC's Agriculture Ministry says the flock has the highly infectious H5N1 virus and has been placed under quarantine by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

The ministry says 7 wild birds that died between 20-27 Apr 2022 have also tested positive for H5N1 strains of the highly infectious illness. They include 3 snow geese and 1 Canada goose in the Vanderhoof area, and bald eagles near 100 Mile House, Bowen Island, and Vancouver.

The avian flu is sweeping across North America, and BC confirmed its 1st case on a farm in the North Okanagan earlier this month [April 2022], followed by an outbreak in a small backyard poultry flock in Kelowna earlier this week.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's website shows the highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] H5N1 was detected last Monday [25 Apr 2022] in the Turtle Creek area, about 20 kilometres [12.4 mi] south of Moncton, in southeastern New Brunswick.

The agency describes the premises where the disease was found as "small flock," meaning the chickens are kept on "private property which is not designated as a commercial flock."

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, no birds, bird products, or by-products can be moved into, out of, within, or a primary control zone without permission. Movement of live birds into the infected zone is prohibited until the disease is determined to be under control within the primary control zone. At such time, movements can be considered under the restrictions of a specific permit.

In an email to CBC News, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said the outbreak affected fewer than 100 chickens. The agency said any chickens which didn't die from avian influenza were humanely destroyed and disposed of to prevent the spread of the disease.

The detection of H5N1 in Turtle Creek is the first to hit farmed poultry in New Brunswick since the disease began sweeping across Canada in recent months. The disease, however, has been detected in wild birds in New Brunswick, which the agency says it suspects caused the Turtle Creek outbreak.

"Scientific evidence indicates the virus circulates naturally in wild birds and is spread through migratory birds. Highly pathogenic AI is worldwide and outbreaks are currently occurring in the United States and other countries in Asia and Europe."

In March [2022], the Canadian Wildlife Service announced a case was confirmed in a greater black-backed gull in Riverview, which is about 20 kilometres from where it's been more recently detected. The disease has since turned up in other wild bird species in New Brunswick, including Canada goose, mallard, and American crow. The spread among wild birds has led experts to advise people to either take down or frequently clean backyard bird feeders.

Most forms of avian flu are mild but the H5N1 strain can cause serious disease and death in wild and domestic birds. The disease is not considered a significant concern for humans but infections can wipe out a flock in a matter of days. With no treatment, an entire flock must be destroyed to ensure the infection is contained.

Lisa Bishop-Spencer, spokesperson for Chicken Farmers of Canada, said the Turtle Creek outbreak is not a huge concern to her given it's not at a commercial operation.

However, the speed at which the disease has spread shows the need for poultry and egg producers to take precautions with their operations, she said.

Bishop-Spencer said a primary control zone covers about a 10-kilometre [6.2 mi] radius, which subjects any poultry producers to heightened rules and extra bio-security measures.

As for the general public, Bishop-Spencer said commercial poultry products remain safe to consume.

The 1st case of bird flu stemming from an outbreak having led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys has been confirmed in Alaska, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation announced on Saturday [30 Apr 2022].

The case was confirmed in a backyard flock of chickens and ducks in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, according to the department. Alaska's Office of the State Veterinarian is working with the United States Department of Agriculture's [USDA] Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS] on a joint response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to [APHIS]. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

"With this confirmed case, it's clear migrating birds have brought avian influenza to Alaska this spring [2022]," said Dr Robert Gerlach, Alaska state veterinarian, in a news release. "We are relying on flock owners to keep an eye on their animals for signs of illness, and to report any possible cases of avian influenza promptly to their own veterinarian or to our office."

Flock owners should be concerned if they observe sudden death of multiple birds in the flock, nasal discharge, sneezing, and coughing or respiratory distress, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. Other signs include a significant drop in water consumption, diarrhea, lethargy, abnormal behavior or difficulty walking, blue discoloration of the comb and wattles or a swollen comb, wattles, legs, or head. Alaskans can report suspected avian influenza cases to <bob.gerlach@alaska.gov>.

The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have confirmed a positive case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. The virus was found in a commercial poultry flock.

Beginning [1 May 2022], all poultry exhibitions, public sales, and swap meets are banned in the state of Oklahoma until further notice in order to halt any potential spread of this virus. The ban is set to end on [30 Jul 2022], unless evidence shows it should be extended. The order can be found at http://www.ag.ok.gov/disease-alerts.

Flock owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual deaths to state officials. Biosecurity resources and best practices are available at https://ag.ok.gov/disease-alerts. If producers suspect signs of HPAI in their flocks, they should contact their veterinarian immediately. Possible cases should also be reported to the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.

Signs of HPAI include:
- sudden increase in bird deaths without any clinical signs;
- lack of energy and appetite;
- decrease in egg production;
- soft- or thin-shelled or misshapen eggs;
- swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks;
- purple/blue discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs;
- gasping for air (difficulty breathing);
- coughing, sneezing, and/or nasal discharge (runny nose);
- stumbling or falling; and
- diarrhea

[Avian influenza continues to march across North America leaving a wake of dead birds and devastated individuals.

Biosecurity cannot be overemphasized, whether you are a commercial production facility or a school student preparing to show a bird. But sadly, the shows are cancelled in an effort to protect the birds. Biosecurity is everyone's priority when it comes to the birds. Guard your birds, inside, and limit the number of individuals coming onto your premises.

We will all be glad when HPAI H5N1 completely subsides. - Mod.TG]
