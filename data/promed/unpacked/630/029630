Current status of cholera outbreaks in the Region
-------------------------------------------------
In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) to epidemiological week (EW) 33 of 2013, the total number of cholera cases reached 671 033, of which 372 241 were hospitalized (55 percent) and 8231 died. The global case-fatality rate has been 1.2 percent since November 2011, however, with variations between 4.5 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent in Port-au-Prince. Since October 2012, a decreasing trend in the nationwide number of cases and deaths has been observed. However, from EW 1 of 2013 to EW 11, the number of cases and deaths registered at a national level was greater than the respective numbers registered for the same period of 2012 due to outbreaks recorded in the departments of Artibonite, Centre and Nord. From EW 12 to EW 33 of 2013, the number of cases and deaths registered has been lower than what was registered for the same period in 2012.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 31 of 2013 the total number of suspected cholera cases reported was 30 681, of which 454 died. As with Haiti, from EW 1 to EW 9 of 2013, the number of suspected cholera cases and deaths recorded nationwide was higher than the number recorded for the same period of 2012. The increase has been linked to cholera outbreaks registered in some provinces and in the Altagracia prison. Between EW 10 to EW 30 of 2013, the number of cases recorded was lower than the number recorded for the same period of 2012 with an average of 20 cases per week. With regards to the case-fatality, for 2011 the case-fatality rate was 1.7 percent, at the end of 2012 it was 0.8 percent, and thus far in 2013 it has been 2.5 percent.

In Cuba, on 20 Aug 2013, the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point of Cuba reported that following the outbreak recorded in 2012 and during the current year [2013] suspected cholera cases have been analyzed regularly. As a result of the surveillance, cholera cases were confirmed in the provinces of Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and Camaguey, as well as in other municipalities where cases were associated with these 3 provinces.

According to the information provided, the cases recorded in Havana have been linked to 2 food service centers where the presence of asymptomatic persons infected with cholera among food handlers was found. The food outlets have since adopted appropriate sanitary measures.

Included in the confirmed cholera cases are 12 persons who had travelled to Cuba from other countries (2 from Chile, 2 from Germany, 3 from Italy, 1 from the Netherlands, 2 from Spain, and 2 from Venezuela). The cases include 8 men and 4 women, with an age range of 30-74 years (median age of 53). The Institute of Tropical Medicine "Pedro Kouri" confirmed the detection of _V. cholerae_ Ogawa serogroup O1 in all of the cases. They have all since recovered and no deaths have been recorded.

Per the information received, Cuba continues to develop and implement cholera prevention and control plans, to strengthen awareness of preventive measures by the public, to control food preparations sites, and carry out epidemiological surveillance of acute diarrheal diseases. Public health awareness campaigns were intensified during the summer season; particularly those related to hand washing, chlorinated water intake, safe food preparation, washing of fruits and vegetables, and choose processed food.

[In one epidemiological week, 1388 more total cases were reported from Haiti and 10 more were reported from the Dominican Republic. Clearly this ongoing epidemic in Haiti remains quite significant and, although remaining to increase in Haiti's neighbor the Dominican Republic, the better sanitary infrastructure has kept numbers 10-fold lower than Haiti.

Since the recognition of cholera in Granma Province in mid-2012, 9 of the 15 Cuban provinces have been reported to have cases of cholera (La Habana, Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Camaguey, Las Tunas, Granma, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo). Most of the cases are reported from non-governmental sources.

Last week, 3 countries reported 5 imported cholera cases from Cuba. Now the number is 6 countries and 12 cases, all acquired in Havana. The 3 new EU countries are Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Whether there are epidemiological links between the cases is not clear. - Mod.LL]
