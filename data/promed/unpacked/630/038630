Equine piroplasmosis, Ireland
-----------------------------
Information received on 5 Apr 2019 from Dr Martin Blake, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Agriculture House, Dublin, Ireland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 16 Feb 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Feb 2019
Report date: 5 Apr 2019
Date submitted to OIE: 5 Apr 2019
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 9 Dec 2009
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: _Babesia caballi_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Co Kilkenny, Kilkenny
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Feb 2019
Outbreak status: resolved on 1 Mar 2019
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 14 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: The mare in question foaled (one day before due date) on 16 Feb 2019. The foal was born with premature detachment of the placenta (red bag presentation) and died within 3 minutes of birth. On 17 Feb 2019, the foal was submitted to a private laboratory for post mortem examination. Tissue samples taken from the foal tested PCR positive for _Babesia caballi_ on 17 Feb 2019. Further retrospective testing of 2 separate blood samples taken for other reasons from the mare that had been taken on 5 and 9 Feb 2019 were confirmed ELISA and PCR positive for _Babesia caballi_. The conclusion of the post mortem examination and test results showed lesions consistent with a degree of placental insufficiency, a red bag presentation, and infection of the foal with _Babesia caballi_ on [27 Feb 2019].

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 14.29 / 7.14 / 50 / 7.14
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, legal movement of animals.

Epidemiological comments: Following diagnosis, the competent authorities undertook a comprehensive epidemiological investigation. The mare was imported to Ireland from another European country on [18 of Jan 2019]. She was brought to premises in Co. Kildare. She was accommodated at the Kildare premises with 3 other mares. On 24 Jan 2019, she displayed clinical signs including pyrexia and limb oedema and was removed from the paddock and placed into isolation. She was attended to by a private veterinary practitioner. She remained in isolation from 24-31 Jan 2019. Following a positive response to treatment, she was returned to the paddock on the Kildare premises on 1 Feb 2019 with the 3 aforementioned mares. On 14 Feb 2019, the mare was transferred to a premise in Co Kilkenny for foaling where she was housed in a single stable in an open barn with 6 other mares. In order to rule out any spread of the _Babesia caballi_ organism from the mare or her foal to any other susceptible animals while resident in Ireland, the competent authorities identified all other equidae that may have had contact with the mare. Four mares travelled with the affected mare on her original journey to Ireland. These were traced and examined for any clinical evidence of infection with _Babesia caballi_ by an official veterinarian from the Irish competent authority. Samples were taken from each of the mares, allowing sufficient time to ensure that the incubation period of _Babesia caballi_ had elapsed. These samples were tested at Ireland's Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, and all returned negative results following PCR and ELISA testing for both _Babesia caballi_ and _Theileria equi_ between 13-14 Mar 2019. In addition, the 8 mares that may have had contact with the affected mare in both the Kildare and Kilkenny premises were also examined by an official veterinarian. Samples were taken from these mares, again allowing sufficient time to ensure that the incubation period of _Babesia caballi_ had elapsed, all of which returned negative results following PCR and ELISA testing for both _Babesia caballi_ and _Theileria equi_ between 13 Mar and 2 Apr 2019. Therefore, the investigation did not reveal any evidence of disease spread in the susceptible population as a result of _Babesia caballi_ infection in a single imported equine animal. The mare was transported back to the country of origin on the [1 Mar 2019].

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, traceability, quarantine, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (Antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment of the affected mare).
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Irish Equine Centre (Private Laboratory) / Equidae / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 27 Feb 2019 / Positive
Irish Equine Centre (Private Laboratory) / Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 27 Feb 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys and zebra. The aetiological agents are blood parasites named _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. Infected animals may remain carriers of these parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for ticks, which act as vectors.

The introduction of carrier animals into areas where tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease.

The parasites occur in southern Europe, Asia, countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Cuba, South and Central America, and certain parts of the southern United States of America. _Theileria equi_ has also been reported from Australia (but, apparently never established itself in this region), and is now believed to have a wider general distribution than _B. caballi_;" Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.08_EQUINE_PIROPLASMOSIS.pdf.

"Babesia and Theileria do not seem to be entirely species-specific, and some organisms occasionally infect animals other than their usual host. Human babesiosis is still incompletely understood, but _B. caballi_ and _T. equi_ are not thought to be significant human pathogens. While there have been suggestions that these organisms might have caused a few infections in the past, species identification at the time was not necessarily definitive. One recent survey found antibodies to _T. equi_ in 6 percent of veterinarians and under one percent of the general public in Italy. Virological evidence for infection was not assessed in this study, and serological cross-reactivity with other organisms is possible;" Source: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_piroplasmosis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
