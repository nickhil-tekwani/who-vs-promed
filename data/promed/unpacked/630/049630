Jack Woodall's "modest proposal" is thought-provoking. I compliment him on
taking a tack which forces a thorough evaluation of the actions that could
be taken to avoid living with the disease. Some countries have been
successful at fending off the threat and accepting endemicity. Just this
past year, Japan, Korea, and perhaps France fall into that category. In
fact, advance preparations and speedy action make a huge difference. We can
learn from the UK experience; if we are well prepared, we need not repeat
the mistakes of the past.
It appears to me that the key to controlling re-emerging diseases, such as
the global pandemic of Foot and Mouth, is a combination of intensive
disease surveillance (to identify the incursion of an exotic disease) and
emergency preparedness (to stamp it out before it spreads widely). If we
strike out on these 2 counts, then indeed we might find ourselves in the
very difficult scenarios Jack Woodall sketches out.
These premises beg the question of how much we should spend on prevention
and surveillance. One way to calculate spending for FMD prevention is in
proportion to the cost of cleanup multiplied by some factor that changes
with the probability of infection for a state, region or country. This
could best be determined by risk assessment.
The Economist suggests the cost of
cleanup may be stated along the following lines:
A recent report on the effect of the FMD crisis in Britain from accountants
at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) postulates an "optimistic" scenario and a
"pessimistic" scenario. In the optimistic scenario, the loss to the
agricultural industry this year will be a mere GBP 500 million (US $720
million). In the pessimistic scenario, it rises to GBP 1.6 billion. But
Britain's domestic tourism is worth much more than its overseas tourism,
and in PWC's "pessimistic" scenario losses there will amount to GBP 3.4
billion. Overall, the impact of the foot-and-mouth crisis on Britain in
2001 could be between GBP 2.5 and 8 billion, or between 0.3% and 0.8% of GDP.
A recent meeting of US federal emergency management officials from a wide
array of agencies and departments considered the incursion of FMD into the
United States to be probable instead of possible.
The USDA FY (Fiscal Year) 2002 budget provides US $849 million in program
funding for USDA's Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS), an
increase of $174 million over 2001. The budget also strengthens the
Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Program (AQI), which helps protect the
U.S. against animal diseases like foot-and-mouth and BSE.
To continue strengthening these important programs, Veneman [Head of USDA
announced the authorization of an additional $32 million to hire
approximately 350 additional personnel at critical ports and international
airports to protect against pests and diseases. This authorization of
personnel includes 127 permanent officers and technicians, 27 canine
officers, 173 temporary inspector positions, and 20 veterinarians. These
positions are over and above the levels indicated in the FY 2001 and FY
2002 budgets, and will be financed from available revenues in the APHIS
user fee account. This decision provides an additional $13.5 million in
resources for FY 2001 and $18.6 million for FY 2002 for staffing.
What determines how much we should spend on prevention? Does anyone have
hard data on projected national or regional costs under various scenarios
of FMD spread? Are there good estimates of the probability of entry into
the United States, estimates which are hopefully informed by the current
global prevalence of FMD? Is there any mechanism for tracking changes in
probability over time, one of the key indicators in how much should be
spent on prevention?
Nations are used to spending money for disasters like FMD once they occur.
Spending real dollars to prevent disease from occurring has always been a
tough, uphill battle, politically. Any hard data or soft opinions would be
welcome.

[David Harvey´s working paper on the current epidemic in the UK projected a
worst case cost of GBP 10 billion (US $15 billion), 20% more than the PWC
estimate. Javier Ekboir´s estimates for the worst case cost of an outbreak
in California are US $9.3 billion to the State plus another US $4.2 billion
in lost US trade, totaling US $13.5 billion -- referable to a single state.
It would be good if someone could tell us how much FEMA has currently
available in disaster funds. The UK MAFF website shows that although some
compensation was available to UK farmers last month (April 2001), the
balance will not be paid until October. Would US farmers accept a delay of
7 months before payment? - Mod.JW
