While the delta variant of the coronavirus has quickly become the dominant strain in the United States, it's not the only variant circulating in the population. The lambda variant, first identified in Peru, is also making headlines, as it has started to be identified in several states. Houston Methodist Hospital reported its 1st case of the variant this week. Scientists at the Medical University of South Carolina recently announced they had found the variant in a virus sample taken in April [2021].

According to a database for scientists tracking coronavirus variants, fewer than 700 cases of the lambda variant have been sequenced in the United States so far out of more than 34 million coronavirus cases reported to date. But the United States has sequenced only a tiny fraction of its cases, so that number does not reflect the actual number of lambda cases in the country.

Fewer than 1% of US cases in the last 4 weeks have been identified as the lambda variant, according to GISAID, a repository for genome data. So do we need to add lambda to our list of big worries in the United States? Not yet, according to public health officials and experts.

The delta variant, which is more than 2 times as transmissible as the original strain of the coronavirus, now accounts for 83% of new coronavirus cases in the United States. Delta continues to be the central concern for public health officials.

What we know about the lambda variant: The lambda variant was first identified in Peru in August 2020, according to the World Health Organization. Cases with the variant have now been identified in 28 countries, according to GISAID -- though many of those have identified only a handful of lambda cases.

Dr. Stuart Ray is a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he specializes in infectious diseases. Ray opened one of the 1st COVID-19 wards at Johns Hopkins in March 2020, and he has also overseen Johns Hopkins' COVID-19 sequencing efforts. He tells NPR that lambda is "sort of a cousin of the alpha variant" -- one of the earliest identified variants of concern.

Lambda spread until it became a dominant sequence in people with COVID-19 in Peru. The WHO noted last month [June 2021] an elevated presence of lambda in other South American countries, including Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. And now we know it's present in the United States.

The lambda variant carries a number of mutations with suspected implications, such as potential increased transmissibility or possible increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies, the WHO says. But it says the full extent of those mutations' impact isn't yet well understood and will need further study.

While there hasn't been clear head-to-head data, the evidence so far does not suggest the lambda variant has any great advantage over the delta variant, Ray says. "Delta is clearly dominating right now. And so I think our focus can remain on delta as a hallmark of a highly infectious variant. And there's some evidence that it might cause greater severity per infection, although that's still a developing story," he says.

There [aren't] yet full data on vaccine effectiveness against the lambda variant. But so far, studies have found that the vaccines available in the United States provide protection against the major strains of the virus, including the highly transmissible delta variant.

"We know that vaccination almost uniformly protects people," Ray says. The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the United States now are among unvaccinated people.

Studies have found that the vaccines are less effective at generating neutralizing antibodies against the variants of concern than against the original strain of the virus. But T cells also play a significant role in the body's immune response, and T cell response isn't measured in neutralizing-antibody clinical tests -- meaning that the vaccines could be more effective against the variants than is suggested by tests of antibody response alone.

The WHO now assigns Greek letters to strains of the coronavirus that are classified as variants of concern or variants of interest. A variant of concern is one that has characteristics such as being significantly more transmissible or more virulent.

The alphabetical order of the variants' Greek-letter names indicates the order in which they were identified as potentially important -- they are not in any particular alphabetical order of severity. The alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants are all considered variants of concern by the WHO.

The WHO classified lambda last month [June 2021] as a global "variant of interest" -- a step below variant of concern. That means it exhibits genetic changes suspected of affecting its transmissibility and disease severity and has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] keeps its own list of variants of concern and interest within the United States. Notably, lambda is not on the CDC's list as being a variant of interest, concern or high consequence.

Ray says tracking variants is important so that we don't get blindsided by one's sudden arrival. "We have to be vigilant for these new variants and track them. Genomic epidemiology remains an important activity for us to understand this epidemic," Ray says. "But I think right now lambda is a variant of interest, and we'll see whether it becomes a variant of concern."

The things we need to do to counter new strains are the same things that we already know to do to counter the coronavirus -- and the stakes are high because delta is so transmissible. That means vaccination is more important than ever, Ray says: "As the variants become more infectious, then the proportion of vaccinated people required to control the epidemic increases."

["The lambda variant, also known as 'C.37,' is driving a rapid increase of COVID-19 throughout South America, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean."

"Early studies by the University of Chile indicate that the variant confers significant resistance to neutralizing antibodies induced by the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine, one of the major vaccines used in South America. The study showed a 3-fold drop in neutralization against the lambda variant relative to the wild-type virus compared with a 2.3-fold drop for the gamma variant and a 2-fold drop for the alpha variant. The effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines [against] the variants has yet to be reported" (https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/07/16/-a-new-threat-on-the-rise-in-south-america/?sh=6420cc373337).

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 23 Jul 2021 at 05:55 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 31 293 062 / 419 502 / 301
Bangladesh: 1 140 200 / 18 685/ 112
Pakistan: 1 000 034 / 22 939 / 102
Nepal: 674 726 / 9661 / 325
Sri Lanka: 291 298 / 3959 / 184
Afghanistan: 143 439 / 6357 / 160
Maldives: 76 454 / 218 / 396
Bhutan: 2458 / 2 / 3

Over the last 7 days, 266 233, 68 426, 16 315, 12 156, 10 755, and 4388 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 273 879, 82 555, 14 243, 11 190, 10 597, and 7465 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a very slow decreasing trend in India, a slightly increasing trend in Pakistan and Nepal, a stable trend in Sri Lanka, a decreasing trend in Afghanistan and also in Bangladesh after exponential rising over the last 3 weeks or so.

The current proportional case-positivity is much higher in Bangladesh compared with any other South Asian countries. Because the case-positivity was 32.19% yesterday (22 Jul 2021), the highest ever recorded, a decreasing trend of total number of cases detected last week compared with the immediate past week could be simply due to the variation in the total number of samples tested. The country temporarily withdrew the strict lockdown from 15 to 23 Jul 2021 to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha ("Feast of Sacrifice") across the country. As much movement of people started, the case-positivity also started to creep up again after falling to around 27% before the relaxation of the lockdown imposed. The country has reimposed a 2-week-long strict lockdown effective from today (23 Jul 2021) which would be extended further if the situation does not improve or aggravates further.

Although the delta variant is seemingly spreading across Pakistan, the number of new cases didn't increase significantly over the last 7 days compared with the previous 7 days. The country has, however, crossed a grim milestone of more than one million laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, after India and Bangladesh in South Asia. The next couple of weeks will be crucial for Pakistan to see whether any significant peak of new cases develops due to spread of the delta variant and mass movement of people during the festival days of Eid-ul-Adha. The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk.

The weekly number of total cases in India is now receding very slowly, which indicates that the virus is still very active in the country, and thus building of a new wave cannot be entirely ruled out from an almost static sustained trend anticipated to see in the near future. But the good news is that 423 400 000 doses of vaccines have been administered in the country as of 23 Jul 2021, as indicated item [B] above. Despite this massive vaccination effort and natural spread of the delta variant, one-third of the population in the country is still susceptible to the virus as they were found to be seronegative to the virus according to the results of a serological survey conducted recently in the country (see ProMED-SoAs archive no. 20210722.8536700).

[3] Viet Nam: surge

Viet Nam, which won praise for controlling COVID-19 in earlier pandemic months, is now battling a quickly rising delta variant (1617.2) surge, with lockdown measures starting in Hanoi tomorrow [24 Jul 2021] and a lockdown extension for Ho Chi Minh City.

Viet Nam today [23 Jul 2021] reported another record daily high for cases, with 7307 new infections, up sharply from 6194 reported yesterday [22 Jul 2021], according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. Nearly 5000 of the cases were reported from Ho Chi Minh City, where officials today announced that the city's lockdown will be extended until 1 Aug 2021 (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/asiapacific/2021-07/23/c_1310081007.htm).

In Hanoi, a new wave of activity over the past few days triggered similar measures today [23 Jul 2021], with strict measures in effect for the next 15 days, according to Reuters. Roughly one-third of Viet Nam is under stay-at-home orders (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-ho-chi-minh-city-extends-virus-lockdown-aug-1-2021-07-23/).

Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia reported record deaths today [23 Jul 2021], with 1566 new fatalities. Other countries reported new single-day highs for cases, including Malaysia with 15 573 and Thailand with 14 575.

The delta variant is spreading quickly in Europe and is now dominant in 19 countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) European office and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said today [23 Jul 2021]. The overall proportion is 68.3%, overtaking the alpha (B117) variant, that is now at 22.3%. Delta levels are rising most rapidly in those ages 15-24 years, increasing 5-fold in that group over the past month.

Hans Henri Kluge, MD, MPH, who heads the WHO's European office, urged countries -- especially those easing measures -- to expand access to free testing, add incentives for quarantine, and strengthen contact tracing.

In the United Kingdom, the delta variant makes up 99% of cases, and 45 cases of a delta sub-lineage (AY.1) have been detected, according to a weekly update from Public Health England (PHE) (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-variants-identified-in-uk). In a separate part of the risk assessment, PHE said distinct delta clades are starting to be identified, mainly distinguished by changes outside of the spike protein, with an unknown biological significance -- findings that have triggered lab investigations.

PHE scientists said they see the 1st signal of potential reinfection from delta, as compared to the alpha variant. Confidence in the finding is low, and further investigation is underway. PHE also said it is tracking a new variant under investigation (B1621), for which 16 cases have been detected, most of them linked to international travel. So far there is no indication that the variant causes more severe disease or evades natural of vaccine immunity, but scientists are investigating.

[4] Malnutrition

Adults and children with COVID-19 and a history of malnutrition may be more likely to die of their infections or need mechanical ventilation, according to a study yesterday [22 Jul 2021] in Scientific Reports.

The researchers looked at 8604 children (mean age, 6 years) and 94 495 adults (mean age, 53 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 across 56 US hospitals from March-June 2020 and compared those with a malnutrition history from 2015-2019 with those without. Twenty-one children and 4706 adults died.

Children with malnutrition made up 7.5% of severe pediatric COVID-19 cases (39 of 520) and 1.5% of mild pediatric COVID-19 cases (125 of 7959). As for adults, those with malnutrition made up 4% of severe COVID-19 cases (453 of 11 423) and 1.8% of mild cases (1557 of 81 515).

Overall, 1.9% of pediatric patients (164) and 2.1% of adult patients (2010) in the cohort had a history of malnutrition.

Data indicated that children older than 5 and adults ages 18-78 with previous malnutrition were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than the same age-groups without. While children younger than 5 and those older than 79 had higher odds of severe COVID-19 if they were not malnourished, the researchers say this could be due to a lack of medical data and a general high risk for COVID-19 infection, respectively.

"Emphasis has been placed very early into the pandemic on the impact of age and comorbidities on the risk of severe COVID-19 and obesity has been the focus of the nutrition conversation," the researchers write.

"This study established that the long-term effect of (or preexisting) malnutrition is also a critically important piece of the puzzle. While the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased incidence of malnutrition, malnourished patients or patients at risk of malnutrition are also at risk of suffering more severe forms of the disease."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"...There have been increases in the incidence of malnutrition among older adults with severe COVID-19 (12-14). This suggests that COVID-19 or its complications may be triggering malnutrition or related physiological processes. This is of crucial importance because malnutrition dampens the immune system, increases mortality, hospital length of stays, and the risk of unplanned hospital readmission (15-17). Furthermore, acute and chronic malnutrition predispose patients to significantly increased risk of bacterial and viral infection and increased severity of these infections (15). Consequently, it is expected that a malnourished patient will have a worse prognosis than a patient without nutritional deficiency in all diseases as well as in severe COVID-19.

"There is, however, the question of nutritional deficiencies not brought upon by COVID-19 or during hospitalization for COVID-19. Could there be a long-term effect of malnutrition and severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients? Does the associated risk (if any) depend on the age of the patient and is the mechanism essentially different between the pediatric and adult populations? The objective of this study is to assess whether patients with documented history of malnutrition are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and compare the results between children and adults. In essence, does any degree of malnutrition predispose patients to severe COVID-19? This information may help with the development of proactive intervention protocols and revisions of existing nutritional care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19."

"There is an association between past diagnoses of malnutrition and severe COVID-19 through a statistical interaction with the age of the patient in both pediatric and adult medicine. On the one hand, in the pediatric population, the effect of a history of malnutrition on severe COVID-19 is highest in younger children (less than 5 years) but this risk drops only slightly with age. On the other hand, children who are not at risk of malnutrition (or who have no history of a diagnosis for malnutrition) have a much steeper drop in risk for severe COVID-19 with age, such that patients over 5 years of age are at lower risk for severe COVID-19 than their peers with malnutrition. Consequently, all children at risk of malnutrition require nutritional care and support to address their nutritional needs (4). However, the most opportunity for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 through nutritional intervention exists among older children.

"Poor outcomes due to COVID-19 are more dire among older adults. This study established that there is a larger gap in COVID-19 outcomes among adults between 18 and 78 years than in older patients. These imply that there is an opportunity to target and improve the outcomes of younger adults with nutritional issues although older patients are more likely to have worse outcomes in general. It is already well known that nutritional assessments play a significant role in the clinical course of patients at all ages. But understanding the gaps in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to malnutrition provides an opportunity to improve the prognosis of patients with history of malnutrition."
