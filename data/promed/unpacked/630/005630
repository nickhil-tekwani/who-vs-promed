After vesicular stomatitis virus was found in 1 mule and potentially several horses in southern Utah in May 2015, the disease has since spread to livestock in several other Utah counties, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

The virus was detected in animals in Beaver, Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, Grand, Kane, San Juan, Uintah and Weber counties, according to state veterinarian Dr. Barry Pittman. Tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in New York confirmed the 1st case, and since then other animals in various areas of Utah have tested positive.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral livestock disease that rarely affects humans, but causes a flu-like illness when it does, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. It primarily affects cattle and horses, but can also occasionally affect swine, sheep and goats. Because there isn't a specific treatment or cure for vesicular stomatitis in livestock, the affected areas are currently in various stages of quarantine. Symptoms of vesicular stomatitis include lesions on the animal's tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves and udders. The blisters often leave raw, painful tissue, and infected animals generally refuse to eat or drink and may show signs of lameness. As a result, severe weight loss typically occurs and milk production often drops in dairy cows. While vesicular stomatitis does not generally cause animals to die, it can still cause economic losses to livestock producers, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food said.

The animals diagnosed in Kane County in May traveled from Arizona and arrived in Utah with some of the animals already beginning to show symptoms. Arizona and New Mexico had reported cases of vesicular stomatitis in 9 locations in late April 2015.

Many states have applied interstate movement restrictions of various types to livestock from states where this disease has been diagnosed, so owners intending to travel out of state with their animals are advised to check with the destination state animal health authorities before entering another state, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food said.

How to stop the spread of the disease:
-----------------
When a definite diagnosis of vesicular stomatitis is made on a farm or ranch, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food recommend that livestock owners do the following:

- Separate animals with lesions from healthy animals, preferably by stabling. Animals in pastures tend to be affected more frequently with this disease.

- As a precautionary measure, do not move animals from premises affected by vesicular stomatitis until at least 14 days after lesions in the last affected animal have healed.

- Use on-farm insect control methods that include the elimination or reduction of insect breeding and the use of insecticide sprays or insecticide-treated ear tags on animals.

- Use protective measures when handling affected animals to avoid human exposure to the disease.

Any livestock owner who sees any symptoms of vesicular stomatitis should report it to a local veterinarian or the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food at 801-538-7109.
