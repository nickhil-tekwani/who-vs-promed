[1] Cholera, Burundian refugees - Tanzania

An outbreak of cholera has infected 3000 people in a Tanzanian border region where refugees fleeing political unrest in Burundi have massed, the UN Refugee Agency said Friday, 22 May 2015. Some 300 to 400 new cases of cholera are being reported daily. At least 31 people -- 29 refugees and 2 Tanzanians -- already have died of the disease, according to UNHCR.

More than 64 000 Burundians have fled to Tanzania in recent weeks, UNHCR said, escaping the unrest sparked by their president's bid for a 3rd term that many say is unconstitutional. UNHCR and its partners appealed for help Friday, saying USD207 million is needed to respond to the humanitarian crisis and assist some 200 000 Burundians who have taken refuge in Tanzania, Congo and Rwanda. The refugee agency said the number of people fleeing Burundi could double in the next 6 months.

Between 500 and 2000 Burundians are arriving daily in Kagunga -- many more than the population of the tiny fishing village on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.

[2] Cholera - Kenya

At least 65 people have died of cholera across the country, the Cabinet was told Thu 21 May 2015. During a meeting chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta Thursday at State House in Nairobi, the Cabinet was further told that 3234 cases of cholera have been reported in 11 counties since December 2014.

It was noted that the major contributing factor to the spread of cholera is poor sanitation, especially in informal settlements. Consequently, Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia was directed to take measures to stem further spread of cholera. County governments were also urged to institute measures to contain the outbreak in their respective regions by enhancing health education.

And separately, the national government yesterday told county health authorities to take decisive action, including banning street foods and unhygienic food outlets, to stop the cholera outbreak.

During the day-long meeting, it emerged that health systems in some counties have been overwhelmed by the disease. Nakuru Country has had the highest cholera death toll among the 11 affected countries. There have been 16 deaths from 199 cases with 70 percent being males mainly aged between 25 and 45.

[3] Cholera, prison - Kenya (Mombasa)

2 remandees [prisoners] have died and 30 others been admitted following a cholera outbreak at Shimo la Tewa prison in Mombasa. The 2 were serving sentences for stealing and rape, Coast Prisons boss James Kodeny told the media yesterday.

"The relatives of the deceased have been informed, and all the previous cases have been managed," Kodeny said. "The county government has brought in medicine to help us solve out the problem." He said the 2 died of diarrhea-related complications at the prison's public health centre. Kodeny said the admitted remandees have been isolated from other prisoners to prevent the disease from spreading.

He said preliminary investigations show that inmates at block C were infected by some remandees admitted last week. The inmates were isolated and treated within the facility because of security concerns. Kodeny said public health officials from Mombasa and Likoni have contained the outbreak.

[4] Diarrhea - Bangladesh (Khulna Division)

As many as 345 diarrhea patients have been admitted to Meherpur General Hospital in the last 3 days [16-18 May 2015], as the diarrhea situation has taken an alarming turn in Meherpur district [Khulna division]. 3 people have died: a 20-year-old woman and 2 men, 26 and 38 years old.

A total of 95 patients [were admitted on Sat 16 May 2015], 105 on [Sun 17 May 2015], and 145 others yesterday [18 May 2015], officials said, adding that around 2000 people [afflicted] with the disease received treatment there in 20 days since [28 April 2015]. Of the 100 beds of the hospital, only 10 are meant for diarrhea patients, so the authorities are struggling to cope with the worsening situation.

The influx of patients gives a picture different from the one that usually happens during the onset of monsoon, said Dr Alok Kumar Das, resident medical officer of the hospital.

Doctors suspect that drinking of contaminated water and taking of chemical-mixed seasonal fruits along with the rise in temperature may be the reason behind the sudden outbreak of the disease. "2 medical teams, each consisting 4 members, are working to find out the causes," said Dr Azizur Rahman, civil surgeon of Meherpur. Another team from ICDDR,B (International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh) led by its Principal Scientific Officer Dr Narayan Chandra Das is also working at the hospital to detect the cause behind the outbreak.

Municipality Mayor Mutasim Billah Motu said they have collected water samples from diarrhea-affected areas for laboratory testing and started distributing oral saline and water-purifying tablets to control the situation. Meanwhile, shortage of medicines affects treatment at the hospital.

Mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose- or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
