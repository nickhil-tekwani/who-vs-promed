One more scrub typhus patient died in the state taking the death toll due to the disease to 14. The medical health and family welfare department confirmed a scrub typhus death in Bundi district after which teams of the department inspected the Nainwa area of the district. Bundi chief medical health officer Dr OP Verma on Wednesday [24 Oct 2012] claimed that the situation is not alarming, as no more cases of scrub typhus have been found in the area. The department officials had conducted a door-to-door survey of the area on Tuesday [23 Oct 2012] to find out if there are more cases of the disease in the area. The officials only found patients suffering from fever and other illness.

The health department is taking help of the agriculture department to keep the area safe from various kinds of diseases due to unhygienic conditions. Dr Verma said the agriculture department would inform people in the area of what kind of chemicals they can use to kill mites and other microorganisms that cause illness.

The cases of scrub typhus were first reported in Alwar and since then several cases have already been reported from 11 other districts. The other districts are Ajmer, Bharatpur, Bhilwara, Dausa, Dholpur, Jaipur, Karouli, Sikar, Sawai, Madhopur, and Tonk.

A health department official said scrub typhus is a new disease [in the state?] and than 140 cases have already been reported from various parts of the state. So far, 14 deaths have been reported. The department has taken measures to control the spread of the disease, including creating awareness about the new disease.

[The current report says that there is a total of 14 deaths due to scrub typhus in 12 of 33 districts in the Indian state of Rajasthan. However, in a prior ProMED-mail post in September 2012 concerning scrub typhus in Rajasthan (Scrub typhus - India (07): (RJ) fatal, susp. 20120917.1297397), scrub typhus was said to have claimed 36 lives in just 2 districts, 30 in Alwar district and 6 in Dausa district. For a map showing the location of Rajasthan districts, see http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/rajasthan/districts/.

This discrepancy in number of scrub typhus deaths could be in part due to difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of scrub typhus. Scrub typhus commonly presents as a nonspecific febrile illness. In regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation, a diagnosis based only on clinical findings is likely to be inaccurate. The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test, which continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, has, however, poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf).

The gold standard is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. These difficulties are alluded to in a prior news report that refers to blood samples being collected in Rajasthan districts by a team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) based in New Delhi (ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (07): (RJ) fatal, susp. 20120917.1297397).

For a discussion of scrub typhus, see a prior ProMED-mail post on this outbreak: Scrub typhus - India (07): (RJ) fatal, susp. 20120917.1297397. Humans become infected with _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganisms that is the cause of scrub typhus, when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation [and get bitten by the mites]. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Rajasthan is located in northwestern India, bordered by Pakistan to the west. For a map of India showing the state of Rajasthan, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_Rajasthan_locator_map.svg.
