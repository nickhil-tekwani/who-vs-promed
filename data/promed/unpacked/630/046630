The Vidigal favela, in the south of Rio, is suffering an acute hepatitis A outbreak. A total of 92 cases have been reported, most of them between 20 and 30 years old. It is suspected that the outbreak in the favela is related to water contamination.

Agents of Rio's prefecture are monitoring the water in Vidigal, collecting samples at 8 distribution points in the favela. The samples are being analyzed by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) and in Sanitary Surveillance laboratories.

According to the city hall, the Municipal Health Department has already adopted prevention, control and assistance measures in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. The Vidigal health post has vaccinated children and relatives of infected people.

"All the cases reported are being monitored by the Health Department. We have all the cases registered, children up to 4 years, 11 months and 29 days are being vaccinated, but some factors make vaccination difficult, such as rainy weather, in which children stay at home, "commented the owner of the portfolio, Marco Antonio de Mattos. "In addition, health workers identify the households and take the vaccine or ask the mothers to bring their children to our municipal health center."

According to information published by "Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz)" and the City hall of Rio de Janeiro, there is an ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A virus in a slum community of Rio de Janeiro, called "Vidigal". During the last days, 92 suspected cases were notified by the local health center and 75 were confirmed.

The most probable source of the outbreak is water; thus, water samples have been collected in different locations and points of the community and sent to Fiocruz for analyses. Samples were collected from artesian wells, pipes of the State Water and Sewage Company (CEDAE), ice factories and water distributors, in addition to the houses where the cases were confirmed. The results will be available in the next days.
