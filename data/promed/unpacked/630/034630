I have received some corrections from Ramon Noseda to what was posted previously.

Though the farmer claimed that the herd had been vaccinated 120 days before, he was unable to provide a certificate of vaccination [my mistake]. And in conversation with the owner's veterinarian, it emerged that the affected bull had not been vaccinated because it refused to go into the chute. As this farm has a history of anthrax -- the previous outbreak was in 2014 -- and these counties are at enzootic risk, it would seem that the animals were inadequately protected while grazing, and history repeated itself, as we have seen elsewhere. The owner was lucky that only 2 animals went down.
