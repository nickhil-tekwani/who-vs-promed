At least 80 goats have perished in the Sessa Nagaon area of Dibrugarh West revenue circle [Assam state] in the past week, causing panic among goat breeders. According to locals, the animals started dying of an unidentified disease after floodwaters began receding. The area had remained submerged for over a week.

"We have been forced to watch our means of livelihood die in front of our eyes. The goats start watering from the mouth and nose after returning from grazing, followed by heavy and laboured breathing. Then they just collapse. Many households in the area have lost their animals to the disease," said a local goatherd.

District veterinary officer Budhin Kumar Bora on [Mon 8 Aug 2016] said a team of the North Eastern Regional Diagnostic Laboratory, Khanapara, has collected samples of the carcasses for testing. "Primarily, it seems like a case of lung infection caused by pneumonia. Poisoning is unlikely since the heart and the liver have not been affected. However, we are still waiting for the final report," Bora said. Following the outbreak of the disease, livestock in the area have been given antibiotics.

According to veterinarians, a wide swing in climatic conditions such as wet weather conditions, high daytime temperatures, high humidity and lower evening temperatures set the stage for pneumonia among goats. The young ones who find it difficult to control body temperature under such conditions are most susceptible to the disease.

[Epidemiological information on the disease deserves to include the morbidity and mortality rates and the age distribution in the flocks/affected animals. Clinical observations deserve to include body temperature. It is not clear if the suspicion of pneumonia is based upon observed lung lesions.

Pathological changes observed and results of the laboratory investigations are expected. In case domestic animals of other species are kept on the affected premises, information on their respective species and any observed health problems will be appreciated.

The most prevalent pneumonia-related caprine diseases in India are PPR (peste des petits ruminants), pasteurellosis, and CCPP (contagious caprine pleuropneumonia). Floods may be followed by various bacterial and parasitological diseases in animals, such as leptospirosis (not a lung-related infection).
