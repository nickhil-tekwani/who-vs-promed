Zimbabwe
--------
Zimbabwe's Agriculture Minister, Joseph Made, said Tue 30 May 2011,
FMD had broken out in the south of the country, affecting thousands of
cattle. He said the area, on the border with Botswana, had been
quarantined with restrictions on cattle movements. Animal disease
control teams had also been deployed to check the FMD situation. Made
said the disease was suspected to have been transmitted to cattle
after they came into contact with infected buffaloes. A large part of
the area is forest land populated by wild animals.

The official said Botswana, which has a large beef industry, was
providing vaccines to help Zimbabwe quickly grapple with the outbreak,
and prevent it from spreading to its territory. Made said Zimbabwe was
also working jointly with Mozambique and Zambia to control buffalo
movements along their common borders to prevent outbreaks of FMD.

Zimbabwe frequently suffers from the disease, which has persisted
partly because of shortages of vaccines. It is because of this that
the European Union has banned beef imports from the country
(see

SADC countries
--------------
Veterinary authorities from 5 SADC countries (Southern African
Development Community; see map at
http://www.infosa.org.na/images/sadc_map1.gif) are working jointly
to find ways of containing the sporadic outbreaks of FMD along the
countries' borders. Botswana, South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique, and
Zimbabwe met and resolved to work together to deal with outbreak of
the disease (see http://allafrica.com/stories/201105310807.html).

Uganda
------
Meanwhile, the Ugandan Commissioner of Veterinary services has
imposed quarantine in the 2 sub-counties of Dzaipi and Arinyapi in
Adjumani district due to an outbreak of FMD. This is to prevent
movement of livestock. Veterinary officials confirmed that in May
2011, at least 13 animals died, with several others showing signs and
symptoms of the disease. The veterinary officer, Mr Lawrence Akuti,
said most people defied the quarantine imposed when there was an
outbreak in Moyo 3 months ago (see
http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1173474/-/c0w8shz/-/).

FMD is an infectious viral disease that affects both domestic and
wild, hoofed animals. The virus causes high fever for about 2-3 days,
followed by blisters in the mouth and on the feet that may rupture
causing the animal to limp. It is spread through aerosols, fomites,
and domestic and wild animals. FMD is a transmissible animal disease
of great socio-economic cost to nations, and financial costs to
individual dairy cattle producers. While the disease is severe and
contagious and affects livestock with economic impact on farmer's
earnings, it holds no danger for humans. - Mod.OOB
