The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) recorded 3 cases of _Streptococcus suis_ infection in June 2015. The 1st case was a 52-year-old woman with good past health. She presented with fever and right knee pain since [18 Jun 2015] and was admitted to a public hospital on the same day. Her right knee joint aspirate and blood specimen collected on [18 Jun 2015] grew _S. suis_. Clinical diagnosis was right knee septic arthritis with sepsis. She underwent arthroscopic surgery and was treated with antibiotics. Her current condition was stable.

The 2nd case was an 80-year-old man with underlying illness. He presented with fever and left knee pain and swelling on [23 Jun 2015] and was admitted to a public hospital on [24 Jun 2015]. His blood specimen taken on [24 Jun 2015] grew _S. suis_. He was treated as left knee septic arthritis. He underwent arthroscopic surgery and was treated with antibiotics. His condition remained stable.

The 3rd case was a 46-year-old man with good past health. He presented with fever, headache, dizziness, sore throat and abdominal pain since [23 Jun 2015] and was admitted to a public hospital on [26 Jun 2015]. His blood specimen taken on [26 Jun 2015] grew _S. suis_. He was treated as sepsis with antibiotics. His condition was stable.

All 3 patients recalled having handled raw pork but denied any previous skin wound or contact with pigs. Their home contacts were asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing.

Human _S. suis_ infection is a zoonotic infection associated with pigs. The infection can be fatal, particularly if the specific strain produces certain toxins. _S. suis_ infection can manifest itself in meningitis, toxic shock, septicemia, and endocarditis.

Eating undercooked infected pork and blood paste are common ways people contract the disease. Proper cooking of pork meat or porcine organs eliminates the risk of infection with _S. suis_. The infection in humans is not only seen in those who consume raw pork, but also in those who slaughter and prepare the meals.

_S. suis_ infection can be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

To prevent the disease, members of the public are advised to always practice personal and environmental hygiene. They should avoid contact with pigs that are sick or dead from diseases and their excreta or body fluid. If contact with pigs or raw pork is necessary, one should:
- use protective gloves;
- wash hands after handling pigs or raw pork;
- clean and cover all wounds properly;

[The 3 patients whose blood samples tested positive for _Streptococcus suis_ recalled having handled raw pork but denied any previous skin wound or contact with pigs.

Human infection by _S. suis_ occurs mainly in adults and is often related to occupational exposure through wounds on the skin while handling infected pig or pork.

_S. suis_ is an emerging zoonotic pathogen found in the upper airway, reproductive system, and digestive tracts of pigs. This organism can enter the human bloodstream via direct contact through open wounds, or through inhalation and survives in dust and feces in the usual swine environment, feces and nasal secretions of carriers. Flies and rodents may play a role in mechanical spread. _S. suis_ can survive on flies for at least 5 days.

Last year (2014) a fatal case of infection by_ S. suis_ was reported by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. Initial investigation by CHP revealed that the patient had no history of consumption or contact with raw or undercooked pork (see PRO/MBDS posting: Streptococcus suis, human - China: Hong Kong, fatal 20140825.2719335).

People with suspect symptoms should consult their doctors as soon as possible and report their relevant exposure histories. Common occupations at risk include pig breeders, abattoir workers, meat processing and transport workers, butchers, and cooks. Local delicacies, such as undercooked pig tonsils, intestines, or uterus and fresh pig blood, may also represent important sources of infection.

More epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings of recent human _S. suis_ infection in Hong Kong need to be identified the potential risk factors for the infection.
