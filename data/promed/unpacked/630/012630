[This report gives numbers of cases and fatalities but no indication of the etiologies of the encephalitis. Previous reports from this area in northeastern India attribute cases to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections and to a generic acute encephalitis. Previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES (acute encephalitis syndrome). Previous reports also indicate that immunization drives have been taken in the affected areas, but the types of immunization were not specified. Presumably, it was JE virus vaccine, since the etiology of the AES cases is not identified. Prevention and control of AES will be difficult until there is a clear indication of the etiologies involved in these cases.
