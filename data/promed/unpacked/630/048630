Re: Ongoing chronic wasting disease surveillance
In order to avoid any misperceptions (e.g., silence = subterfuge), we're
responding to Martin Hugh-Jones' request for further comment on his 11
November 1997 posting. There is not much to add.
Chronic wasting disease is enzootic in northeastern Colorado and
southeastern Wyoming. The Coloradoan article referred to by Hugh-Jones was
encouraged as part of our efforts to remind local hunters about
participating in this year's harvest survey. Such surveys have been
conducted in various enzootic areas for over a decade, and similar articles
have appeared during hunting seasons for the last year or two. Hunting
seasons in Colorado and Wyoming are still underway, and our surveys are
still in progress. Because well over 2,000 samples have been collected in
Colorado and Wyoming so far this year, diagnostic evaluations and data
analyses are also incomplete.
Consequently, any additional data provided now would be premature and
likely subject to change as our analyses are completed. To us, it seems
somewhat unnecessary to burden ProMED-mail subscribers by reporting our
surveillance findings incrementally. Chronic wasting disease isn't new,
and the only thing about it that's really "emerging" is awareness among
some scientists and publics outside the areas where it's been studied for
nearly three decades. Although much of the information being collected is
considered original research intended for peer-reviewed publication, the
Colorado Division of Wildlife, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and their
host of collaborators remain committed to providing reliable public
information on chronic wasting disease. As in the past, we will continue
to communicate important research findings via press releases and internet
postings in a timely fashion when such communications appear warranted.

[I met Elizabeth & Mike at the Tampa International Wildlife Disease
Conference this summer and they kindly agreed to provide ProMED-mail with a
proper and complete review of CWD when this tissue collecting season is
over. As we can see they have their hands very full. We must just contain
ourselves with patience. It will be worth the wait. Martin Hugh-Jones,
