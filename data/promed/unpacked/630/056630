A man from Cameroon may represent the 1st reported African case of infection with bacteria carrying [a novel variant of] New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase [NDM]-4, an enzyme that blocks many antimicrobials, according to a letter yesterday [14 Aug 2012] in Emerging Infectious Diseases [Dortet L, Poirel L, Anguel N, Nordmann P: New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 4-producing _Escherichia coli_ in Cameroon [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2012 Sep [date cited]; http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1809.120011].

Infections with New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-producing (NDM-1) bacteria were first described in 2010 in India [actually 2009: Yong D, Toleman MA, Giske CG, Cho HS, Sundman K, Lee K: Characterization of a new metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaNDM-1, and a novel erythromycin esterase gene carried on a unique genetic structure in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ sequence type 14 from India. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009; 53(12): 5046-54. Available at http://aac.asm.org/content/53/12/5046.full.pdf+html]. Since then, NDM-2, NDM-4, and NDM-5 variants have been identified, with NDM-4 having a higher carbapenemase activity than NDM-1.

Yesterday's [14 Aug 2012] letter details the case of a man with Hodgkin lymphoma who was treated with chemotherapy 1 year before his current 1 month hospitalization for an inflammatory disorder with kidney failure. After transfer to a hospital in France, a rectal swab revealed NDM-4 [-carrying] _Escherichia coli_. The strain was resistant to all beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs, including imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem, and to fluoroquinolones. It was also resistant to all aminoglycosides except amikacin. A literature search turned up only one previously reported NDM-4 case, in a patient from India.

[In 2008, a novel carbapenemase, the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-1 was first detected in a _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolated in Sweden from an Indian patient hospitalized previously in New Delhi, India (1). Variants of the NDM-1 carbapenemase, such as NDM-2, NDM-4, and NDM-5, have subsequently been described.

Cases of colonization or infection with NDM-producing Gram negative bacilli have been reported worldwide as either imported cases in patients with a travel history to, or contact with healthcare systems on the Indian subcontinent, and less frequently as cases following secondary transmission or as autochthonous cases with no history of travel to the Indian subcontinent (2). NDM has been predominantly found in _Enterobacteriaceae_, mostly in _K. pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia coli_ isolates. However, NDM carbapenemases have also been found in non-fermentative Gram negative bacteria such as _Acinetobacter_ spp. and _Pseudomonas_ spp.

Plasmids that carry the NDM gene can also carry a number of genes that encode resistance to other classes of antimicrobial drugs such as aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolones, in addition to beta-lactams. Many NDM producers remain susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin. The fact that NDM gene is carried by a highly transmissible plasmid is thought to account for its rapid, widespread dissemination.

The variant NDM-4 was first described in a patient hospitalized in India (3). However, the patient described in the news report above had no history of travel to India (4). This patient was transferred from Cameroon, where he had previously completed chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, to a hospital in Paris. A rectal swab specimen collected from the patient on transfer grew an _Escherichia coli_ strain that was fully resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, except amikacin, and fluoroquinolones (4). Several plasmid-encoded carbapenemases, including both NDM-1 and the variant NDM-4, were identified in this strain. Fecal carriage in this patient of _E. coli_ carrying plasmid-encoded NDM-1 and NDM-4 genes was attributed by the authors to its selection following multiple courses of antibacterial drugs that included carbapenems in Cameroon (4).
