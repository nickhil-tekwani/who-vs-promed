A total of 3 victims of [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)]
virus, from Quetta, Chaman, and Sanjavi areas, have been admitted to
the Chest Hospital [in Quetta, Balochistan province -- previously
spelled Baluchistan] over the past 4 days. Hospital sources said a
35-year-old woman from Sanjavi area in Ziarat district, who was
bleeding from nose and mouth, was admitted on Tuesday [14 Oct 2008]
and kept in the isolation ward. Another woman from Quetta and a
26-year-old man from Chaman also had symptoms of CCHF virus
[infection]. "We have put them under observation in the isolation ward."

They said most of [CCHF] virus cases usually came from Loralai, Zhob,
and Musakhail. The sources said over a dozen patients had been
admitted over the past 2 months and 3 of them died. "Most of the
patients were shepherds."

Around 100 people have [contracted CCHF virus infection] in the
province over the past 2 years. The health department has established
an isolation ward in the Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital for [CCHF virus
infection] and other viral diseases.

During the last 2 weeks, 3 people have died [in Quetta, Balochistan
province] of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Several others
have been admitted to the Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital.

"We received a new case of the disease just this morning [19 Sep
2008]. The patient belongs to Zhob district," an official of the
hospital told Dawn on Friday [19 Sep 2008]. He said the patient -- [a
22-year-old male] -- was bleeding when he was brought to the
hospital. So far, 6 patients had been brought to the hospital from
Loralai and Zhob and 3 of them had died. "One of the patients died
yesterday [18 Sep 2008]." The condition of [another patient] from the
Murgha Kibzai area of Zhob district, was quite critical when he was
brought to the hospital, he added; 2 other patients died last week
[week of 15 Sep 2008]. They were from Loralai.

The virus, first isolated in the African country of Congo, is carried
and transmitted by ticks. Hospital sources told Dawn that all the
victims of CCHF were shepherds.

A team of specialist doctors has been sent to Loralai, Zhob, and other
affected areas to identify and then assist patients.

[CCHF is endemic in this region and Pakistan is one of the countries
most affected by the disease. The causative agent is a bunyavirus
belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_. CCHF virus is transmitted from
cattle and sheep to humans via a tick vector and can also spread from
person to person via infected blood. Cases usually occur singly among
shepherds or among small groups of individuals in contact with
livestock or animal products. Occasionally, clusters of cases occur
as a result of nosocomial transmission in hospitals. Mortality can be
as high as 40 percent in extreme situations but is normally in the
region of 15 percent. The distribution of CCHF follows that of the
principal tick vector (_Hyalomma _ spp.), and CCHF is maintained both
by alternation between mammalian hosts and ticks and by vertical
transmission in ticks.

An image of a _Hyalomma_ tick, a map of the limits of its
distribution, and other information relating to CCHF can be found at
