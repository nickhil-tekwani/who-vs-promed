On Friday a 25-year-old farmer from North-West province was admitted to
Johannesburg's Garden City Clinic with Congo fever [Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever = C-CHF, caused by C-CHF virus, a virus of the genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family Bunyaviridae. - Mod.CHC. The patient had high
fever and internal bleeding on admission to the clinic. Congo fever is
endemic to South Africa and treatment is routine. The disease is contracted
from the bite of the bont-legged tick, found in dry Northern Cape regions.
The patient is believed to have contracted the disease while on holiday at
a game farm near Vaalwater in the Northern Province. His condition is
stable but he remains in isolation.

[This article said that Congo fever is "one of the viral haemorrhagic
fevers related to Ebola" but "is not as severe as Ebola fever". In fact,
these two diseases are related only insofar as they are hemorrhagic fevers.
C-CHF is caused by a member of the family Bunyaviridae (ibid), Ebola fever
is caused by a member of the family Filoviridae. C-CHF is treated with
ribavirin.
Our own Jack Woodall was the author of one of the first articles regarding
isolation of Congo virus, from the blood of a human in Zaire. It was later
shown that Crimean hemorrhagic fever was cause by the same virus, hence the
portmanteau phrase "C-CHF virus". - Mod.CHC
