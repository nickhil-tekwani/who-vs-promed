[1] Vaccine property rights
Date: Wed 5 May 2021

Today [5 May 2021] the Biden administration said it supports an initiative to waive the intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines. A statement from US trade representative Katherine Tai said, "The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines."

The statement was made during talks at the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) general council meeting. The proposal was first floated last fall [2020], but many wealthy countries opposed it. The WTO will require unanimous agreement on the temporary waiver of property rights and is expected to formally vote on the issue in June [2021]. Proponents of the waiver say it will be in place for a handful of years, until the pandemic is under control. "This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures," Tai said. "The Administration's aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible."

Across the United States, COVID-19 cases and fatalities continue to drop, a sign that the forthcoming summer could offer some return to normality for much of the country. The US reported 40 733 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [4 May 2021], and 933 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, the US has tracked 32 544 460 cases, including 579 122 deaths.

The drop in cases is due to an aggressive vaccination campaign mounted in the last 100 days. But despite a federal pipeline of vaccine made available to all states, tribes, and territories based on population, vaccination rates remain uneven across the country. The latest report from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that as of 29 Apr 2021, the share of adults who had received at least one vaccine dose was 55% overall, ranging from 41% in Alabama to 74% in New Hampshire.

Vaccination rates are higher in larger states, such as California and Pennsylvania, but much lower in small states. And vaccination rates across all states continue to drop: The rate of 1st dose administration per 100 000 in the last week dropped 27% for the country overall and for almost every state (45 of 51), Kaiser reported.

Southern states have lower vaccination rates than those in the Midwest and Northeast and are beginning to see a drop in demand for vaccines. According to the Associated Press, Oklahoma is no longer accepting its full allocation of doses from the government. Yesterday [4 May 2021] the White House told governors that the COVID-19 vaccine doses they don't order will become available to other states, the Washington Post reports.

The doses will be steered into a federal bank available to states seeking additional supply. This is a significant change, as just weeks ago Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer was refused extra doses of vaccines when her state saw a spring surge of virus activity.

In related news, both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans are easing up on mask wearing, according to a new Axios-Ipsos poll. The poll found that 57% of Americans report wearing a mask at all times when they leave the house, down slightly from a mid-April [2021] poll; 63% of vaccinated people say they wear a mask at all times, down from 74%. Among unvaccinated, mask wearing fell from 49% to 47%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said fully vaccinated Americans can safely go maskless in most outdoor settings, as well as in small indoor gatherings.

Today [5 May 2021] CDC described in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report the emergence of 2 variants of COVID-19 that originated in the US: one from New York and 2 from California. The data show the importance of genomic sequencing and provide evidence of how quickly the variants can circulate in a population.

In Colorado, state public health officials have tracked the emergence of 2 variants -- B.1.427/B.1.429, a lineage first identified in California -- from 3% to 4% of sequenced viruses in late January to 20% to 22% in early March [2021]. Ninety-one per cent of the Colorado cases with that lineage were symptomatic, and 8 deaths have been associated with that variant in Colorado.

In New York City, variant B.1.526 emerged as a variant of interest in November 2020. Though the possibility of that strain causing reinfections first alarmed health officials, preliminary evidence suggests that the variant does not lead to more severe disease or increased risk for infection after vaccination.

"By April 5 [2021], the B.1.526 variant accounted for 40% of all viruses sequenced by 2 major laboratories from a relatively representative sample of NYC COVID-19 cases," the authors wrote. "Although the proportional increase in B.1.526 infections suggests that this variant might be more transmissible than other SARS-CoV-2 variants, the secondary attack rate was not higher."

[2] Risk: what level is acceptable
Date: Thu 6 May 2021
Source: Nature [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01220-7


On 24 Apr 2021, Perth in Western Australia entered a snap 3-day lockdown when 2 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 -- the first community infections recorded outside hotel quarantine in the state in more than a year. Pubs, gyms and playgrounds shut, remembrance-day services were cancelled, and people were confined to their homes.

Australia is part of a group of countries -- including Bhutan, China and New Zealand -- that has applied a zero-tolerance approach. When outbreaks are detected, the response is swift and severe: mass testing, sudden lockdowns and closed borders. But this cannot be sustained indefinitely. "We have to accept that people will get infected, will go to hospital and will die from COVID-19 in the future," says James McCaw, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, who advises the Australian government.

As more people get vaccinated, scientists and health officials are pondering how societies can live with the virus, and what level of risk they are willing to absorb. In some countries, such as Australia, the threshold is low. But in some nations worn down by a year of restrictions, such as India and the United States, communities remain open even in the face of high transmission.

Researchers say there is no universally agreed number of hospitalizations and deaths that societies will find acceptable. But there are some situations that most nations will do their best to avoid, such as excess deaths caused by hospitals being overrun.

Annual deaths from diseases such as influenza -- which before the pandemic killed between one-quarter of a million and half a million people each year globally -- offer a barometer. And in Israel, where vaccination rates are high and life is returning to normal, people seem to have settled on a few deaths a day as the acceptable number, says Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who has modelled the pandemic and advises the government.

Scientists and public health officials are beginning discussions about the acceptable level of risk, but the decisions involve cultural, ethical and political factors, and differ widely between regions. "Each country will set its own threshold," says Sylvie Briand, head of infectious-hazards management at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. "Every country is almost another experiment in public policy," says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

Researchers are still unclear how annual deaths from COVID-19 will eventually compare with deaths that societies have been willing to endure from influenza and other endemic diseases. In the United Kingdom alone, seasonal flu epidemics kill thousands of people each winter. "This seems to be an acceptable risk to society, and repeated vaccination and some continued distancing measures might keep COVID-19 deaths to this level," says David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, UK.

But the pandemic has made some societies more risk averse concerning deaths from respiratory infections. In New Zealand, for example, lockdowns almost eliminated the incidence of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of colds. Researchers there are now discussing whether returning to previous numbers of deaths from those pathogens is acceptable, or if more effort should be made to control them.

COVID-19 also presents unique risks that make comparisons with flu difficult. It is a new virus that is deadlier than influenza, which means that its uncontrolled spread could quickly escalate into a devastating situation at hospitals, says Segal.

Societies will also have to consider the impact of "long COVID", the ongoing symptoms that affect between 10% and 20% of those infected, says Alex James, a mathematical modeller at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Even if deaths are low and hospitals can cope, if many people end up with long-term disabilities because of COVID-19, that would be a signal that the rates of infection are too high, she says. One factor governing what nations will consider an acceptable level of hospitalization and death will be health-system capacity, including the capabilities of intensive care units (ICUs). "If we have to postpone elective surgeries because our ICUs are full of COVID-19 patients, that's a very poor position," adds James.

Segal estimates that Israel hits that point when 500 ICU beds are filled nationwide. Beyond that precipice, the quality of health care rapidly declines and death rates increase. It's wise to implement a lockdown before that point, he says. The UK has followed this general rule throughout the pandemic. There have been 3 nationwide lockdowns, and each was begun when "it was clear that the number of cases was growing to the point that hospitals were unable to cope", says Graham Medley, an infectious diseases modeller at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who advises the government.

Israel has among the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 60% of its population having received at least one dose, and it offers a glimpse of what baseline levels of severe disease and deaths might be in a post-vaccination world. The country began opening its economy in February [2021], when about one-third of its population had been fully vaccinated, and numbers of hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline. In the past few weeks, fewer than 100 new cases have been detected daily, despite high testing rates; a handful of people have been admitted to ICUs each day; and 2-5 people have died. If those rates are sustained, COVID-19's death toll in Israel could stabilize at 1000-2000 a year, says Segal. "Even if those numbers were to rise, nobody would close down the economy now. They would only consider closing if we saw, again, the danger of losing control."

Since the pandemic began, the risk equation -- the way people balance the risks from infection against problems caused by harsh restrictions -- has changed for many. Early on, many countries compared the outbreak with the flu pandemic that began in 1918, which killed at least 50 million people, says Briand -- "The fear was really intense". But since then, perceptions have changed, as people have balanced the risks from COVID-19 with considerations such as increased unemployment, she says. Around 3.2 million people are currently known to have died of COVID-19, and the final figure is not expected to be as high as in 1918-20.

A gruelling year has made some people less willing to adhere to restrictions, and politicians reluctant to impose them. For example, when the B.1.1.7 variant surged in parts of the US Midwest earlier this year [2021], transmission reached levels that had triggered restrictions early in the pandemic -- but the response this time was much more muted. "People's tolerance today is very different," says Osterholm.

A year ago, the fear of an unknown virus galvanized governments into implementing harsh social restrictions. The risks have since been articulated more clearly and people have begun to factor them into their daily lives, says Medley. This means that people might be more willing than before to put up with the risk of a certain level of hospitalization and death, and that the bar for imposing social restrictions is now higher. But the exact position of that bar is still unknown -- and it could come down again if new variants threaten gains from vaccination campaigns, he says.

[While COVID is basically a public health problem, it also is a work-life issue affecting how and where we conduct daily business, and it also affects our old concepts of live entertainment and travel and sociability. In the future, in the developed world, there will likely continue to be focal outbreaks, as there are with measles, in pockets where vaccination is low or where new strains emerge that are poorly neutralized by vaccine, as with flu. Long-term sequelae are a serious problem not only for those experiencing them, but also for society in general, and as a burden on hospitals and health care workers. These may continue for years.

With time, people will come to accept the level of risk COVID raises. Wearing of masks will always be a good preventative measure for those at greater risk and may be worn more commonly in the USA and elsewhere, as they were in China before COVID. As Sylvie Briand, head of infectious-hazards management at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland stated above, "cultural, ethical and political factors will differ widely between regions", affecting the point at which the government will launch an all-out response. And individuals will need to make personal decisions as to what level of risk they will tolerate.

In low- and middle-income countries, the problem is more severe. See Hotez PJ, Fenwick A, Molyneux D. The new COVID-19 poor and the neglected tropical diseases resurgence. Infect Dis Poverty. 2021; 10: 10. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00784-2.

Furthermore, practices that lead to emergence of zoonotic pathogens and spillover into new naive hosts need to be curtailed, as they have global consequences. It is important to find sources of food that sustain people that are not sylvatic wild animals or domestically farmed and sold wild animals. - Mod.LK]

[3] Routine immunizations amid COVID-19
Date: Wed 5 May 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/global-groups-draw-plan-boost-routine-immunizations-amid-covid-19


Following a recent World Health Organization (WHO) survey that found that 37% of countries' programs for routine immunizations were still experiencing pandemic-related disruptions by the end of 2020, last week WHO and its partners announced their Immunization Agenda 2030, with the goal of bolstering vaccinations worldwide and reaching 90% coverage in children.

While the need for this comprehensive strategy existed before the pandemic, COVID-19 has worsened the situation, and immunization is just one of the healthcare services that countries are struggling with. WHO partnered with the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance on the strategy.

The results of the WHO survey, published in late April [2021], included responses from 135 countries and showed that 94% were still experiencing disruptions. About one in 5 countries reported disruptions in their emergency, critical, and operative care interventions, and more than 40% reported disruptions in their primary care, rehabilitative, palliative, and long-term care.

The pandemic affected program-specific essential health services, with countries reporting an average of 39% disruption in these areas. Mental, neurologic, and substance use disorder program disruptions affected the most countries (45%), and although reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition affected the least, more than one in 3 had at least some difficulty fulfilling normal services (35%).

Neglected tropical disease programs showed the highest burdens of disruption. Besides being the second most named program (44%), 19% of countries said more than 50% of their programs were disrupted.

Respondents attributed disruptions to workforce issues (66%), community fear or mistrust (57%), decreases in patients presenting (57%), and cancellation of elective care (47%). Basic supplies were also in shortage, including personal protective equipment (26%) and essential medicines (22%). Overall, 29% of countries reported supply chain disruptions of any kind.

"No further information is available on medical product/drug shortages [from the data]," WHO told CIDRAP News in an email. "However, WHO recommends countries establish real-time monitoring of readiness of health facilities in terms of availability of essential health products including tracer medicines, diagnostics, medical equipment and supplies, to better identify bottlenecks and guide planning and investments."

The health care services in lower- and middle-income countries tended to experience the most disruption, according to the report. Whereas only 26% of high-income countries reported service issues, 48% of upper-middle-income countries, 42% of lower-middle-income countries, and 36% of low-income countries did.

"By providing a rapid snapshot of the situation, the survey results can support decision-makers to systematically take stock of current challenges and inform policy dialogues and decision-making at national, regional and global levels to guide resources as the pandemic progresses," the report authors write. Of the 216 requests the WHO received for assistance, the most common reason was for maintaining essential health services during COVID-19 (40), followed by monitoring and evaluation capacities (27).

Pandemic effects on aid organizations varied. UNICEF reportedly delivered 28 million fewer vaccine doses in 2020, a 12.2% drop from 2019's 2.29 billion doses, according to the Immunization Agenda 2030 press release, and 37% of the countries surveyed said they had some disruption in non-COVID immunizations.

"A question I get asked commonly is, 'Was service affected by supply shortages?' The answer to that is no," says Robin Nandy, principal advisor and chief of immunization at UNICEF. What actually happened, he says, is that countries' mitigation and resource reallocation efforts created a ripple effect on healthcare and transportation services. UNICEF halted campaign-style immunization programs because they involved bringing people together. Non-COVID vaccine transportation difficulties occurred, but UNICEF was able to offset those with new, oftentimes more expensive, arrangements with freight and airline companies. When vaccines were delayed, countries had supply buffers. He adds, "Typically in the 2nd quarter of the year -- later on as services started being provided [again] -- people were unable to access them because of lockdowns, transport disruptions, and simply fear of coming into contact with COVID patients." Most of the catch-up deliveries occurred in the 4th quarter of 2020, he says.

"For 2 or 3 months [if immunization programs are disrupted], we are not that worried, but as it goes into 16 months, years, it builds up the number of susceptibles in the populations," Nandy says. His biggest fear is if child immunizations continue to drop as people focus on the COVID-19 vaccine. After all, he says, as the world focused on Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in recent years, many more deaths actually occurred because of pediatric measles.

Despite the continued disruptions, the WHO survey shows healthcare is faring better than during its 1st-round results, published in August 2020. At that time, half of 35 measured services were disrupted; now, 36% are. Similarly, 24% of countries said at least 75% of their services were disrupted versus 8% now. About one in 10 countries (11%) said they had no service disruptions at all by the end of 2020, compared with the 5% who claimed the same in August. Fewer countries reported PPE shortages (43% to 26%) and health products (30% to 22%), as well.

The commonest ways countries addressed service issues were community communications (67%), triaging to prioritize patients (60%), recruitment of additional staff (56%), redirection of patients to alternate care sites (54%), and home-based care where appropriate (51%). Telehealth was often centered around higher-income countries, the data show.

Officials hope that Immunization Agenda 2030 will help restore global healthcare services. Focusing on the deficit in pediatric immunizations and including a blueprint for COVID immunizations in adults, the agenda outlines a framework to achieve 90% coverage for essential vaccines in childhood and adolescence in 9 years. Other goals are to halve the number of children receiving no vaccines worldwide and completing 500 introductions of new or underused vaccines, such as those for COVID-19, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus.

"This vision and strategy was developed before the pandemic but it has proven even more relevant in the context of the COVID-19 vaccine roll out," the WHO said in the email, attributing the quote to its immunization colleagues. "We propose to implement the plan in 2 phases: first to respond to the pandemic with efficient rollout of vaccine and restore and maintain immunization programs, and in phase 2 to build stronger systems within PHC [primary healthcare] for the future."

Minimizing contact with healthcare workers during vaccinations, using barcodes on vaccine vials, building on pediatric immunization programs to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine for adults, and more are included in the agenda, Nandy says. "The old saying is, 'Don't let a crisis go to waste,' and now it's important we don't just build back to where we were prior to the pandemic, but to build back better."

[4] COVID-19 recurrence
Date: Wed 5 May 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/news-scan-may-05-2021


Less than 0.1% of all COVID-positive patients in the Intermountain Healthcare system had probable or possible recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to a PLoS One study yesterday [4 May 2021; Peltan ID, Beesley SJ, Webb BJ, et al. Evaluation of potential COVID-19 recurrence in patients with late repeat positive SARS-CoV-2 testing. PLoS ONE 2021; 16(5): e0251214. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251214]

The full cohort of 23 176 COVID-19 patients was pared down to 1301 patients who had at least one additional SARS-CoV-2 test 60 or more days after the initial diagnosis. Almost 10% (122) had a positive test, of which 114 had sufficient data for recurrence evaluation (median test interval, 85.5 days).

Using both clinical and cycle threshold (Ct) values, the researchers found that 4 patients had probable and 6 had possible COVID-19 recurrence. Taken together, that's 4.3 people with probable or possible COVID recurrence per 10 000 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 7.9), or 0.04%. Of the 4 patients with probable recurrent infections, all had symptoms and 3 required a higher level of medical care than with the initial illness.

The researchers note that using the adjudication standard adapted from Abu Raddard and colleagues (published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1846) resulted in a probable or possible COVID-19 recurrence in 31.9 per 10 000 patients (CI, 25.1 to 40.1). Probable and possible recurrence numbers also increased to 44 COVID-19 patients if patients were assessed via purely clinical means.

"Neither clinical criteria nor Ct assessment alone appeared sufficient to accurately categorize likelihood of COVID-19 recurrence," the researchers write. "Although reinfection seems more likely in these immunocompetent patients, reactivation is also possible."
