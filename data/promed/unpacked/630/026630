Hepatitis E virus outbreak in Kashmir
-------------------------------------
The health authorities have confirmed an outbreak of hepatitis E in Ishber
and Harwan areas days after they found 400 people infected with jaundice
clinically during a survey conducted in the affected areas. Sources in the
Department of Microbiology, Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar told
Greater Kashmir, "Out of 9 blood samples collected from the infected
persons, 4 adults were confirmed as suffering from acute hepatitis E virus
infection, a 12 year old boy was confirmed as an acute hepatitis A case and
another patient was [diagnosed] with a more equivocal result for hepatitis
A. The patients suffering from hepatitis E virus infection showed high IgM
(acute infection) antibodies."
According to specialists in the Department of Social and Preventive
Medicine (SPM), GMC, the outbreak of hepatitis E can prove fatal for
pregnant women as they are highly susceptible to the virus. "The disease
has a high mortality rate among pregnant women and females suffering from
hepatitis E should be immediately rushed to SKIMS or SMHS hospital for
treatment," a specialist said adding any delay could prove fatal for both
mother and child.
The disease, the health expert said, damages the liver immensely. "Due to
the disease the functioning of liver gets hampered as bilrubin metabolism
is hindered," the expert said. The expert cautioned the people especially
the pregnant women living in the affected area not to drink the tap water.
"The chlorination of water in the treatment plant doesn't kill the
hepatitis E virus but is effective for other type of pathogens," the expert
said adding the people should continuously boil water for 20 minutes to
kill the virus. The expert said Srinagar Municipal Corporation should gear
up and launch a continuous and sustained cleanliness drive in the area.
"The SMC should ensure proper disposal of waste in the affected areas," the
expert further said.
Giving details about the virus and the type of disease, renowned
gastroenterologist Professor Muhammad Subhan Khuroo said, "Hepatitis E is
an enterically transmitted, self limiting, acute viral hepatitis caused by
well characterized RNA virus, the hepatitis E virus. The disease causes
large scale waterborne epidemics of viral hepatitis and is the most common
cause of acute sporadic hepatitis and hepatic failure."

ProMED-mail rapporteurs Brent Barrett and Joseph P Dudley
[This outbreak of jaundice probably reflects a deficiency in the public
water supply rather than an unusual prevalence of hepatitis E virus. In
fact hepatitis E virus is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas of
the world. Contrary to the implication in this report hepatitis E virus is
not more resistant than hepatitis A virus and indeed transmission of
hepatitis E virus from person-to-person is less common than in the case of
hepatitis A virus infection.
