People hoping to adopt a cat from a [New York City (NYC)] shelter for Christmas or Hanukkah were disappointed after a breakout of bird flu sickened 125 shelter felines, and adoptions were suspended while Animal Care Centers (ACC) of NYC gets a hold on the virus.

As of 20 Dec 2016, there were 91 cats in the Manhattan ACC shelter that tested positive for H7N2, the bird flu, 30 in Brooklyn, and 4 in Staten Island out of a total 201 cats with test results. Additional test results are pending.

According to the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, only the cats in NYC animal shelters have tested positive for H7N2. Cats that have been adopted from the ACC have not been tested.

More than 350 people were screened for the virus, with one veterinarian testing positive. Flu symptoms were mild and the person has completely recovered, according to the Health Department.

Testing began mid-November [2016], 1st with 45 cats in an ACC shelter in Manhattan testing positive for the flu, most experiencing mild illness and expected to recover. One elderly cat had underlying health issues, developed severe pneumonia and was humanely euthanized, the Health Department said.

Signs of the virus include sneezing, coughing, runny nose and runny or red eyes. It can spread if a cat has contact with another infected cat or with objects (such as kitty litter or food bowls) used by sick animals.

There is no influenza vaccine for cats and there are no medicines available to treat the flu in cats. Veterinarians may use other medicines, such as pain relievers, antibiotics or intravenous fluids, to help the cat recover.

Illness is usually mild and most cats recover quickly.

The infected cats have been separated so as not to expose other animals at the shelter.

The Health Department, working with ACC, the ASPCA and New York City Emergency Management, will soon move cats to a new quarantine location, which will allow shelters to resume their normal intake and adoption of cats.

Cats are the only animals that have tested positive for the flu, so all other shelter operations have continued.

Until cats are removed to the new location and the cat facilities are disinfected, New Yorkers should not drop off cats at any ACC shelter.

The risk of transmission of H7N2 from cats to humans is low.

The symptoms of seasonal flu viruses and H7N2 are similar, and medications that treat seasonal flu also treat H7N2 virus infections, the Health Department said.

One person has been found with a "presumptive diagnosis of this virus."

[Kathy Toohey-Kurth, at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, working with the University of Wisconsin-Madison Shelter Medicine Program, made the initial identification of the strain, and the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the test results. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Shelter Medicine Program continues to work with the ACC Manhattan shelter to manage the illness.

Although the ACC is testing the cats, the article is not specific if samples are being sent to Cornell University in New York state, or if they are sent to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory or to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.

This is a low pathogenic avian influenza that has been passed to felines and is apparently capable of spreading within the feline colonies, such as animal shelters and other catteries. It seems this particular virus has been designated feline flu because it is in felines, but was originally avian. All influenza viruses can and often do mutate rapidly, adapting to the situation and therefore capable of spreading to other species. Now this particular strain has made a leap from felines to humans. We know that birds and swine often pass the influenza virus, which is concerning because the virus may then infect humans with increased virulence. Currently the feline passage to humans appears to be of low virulence, producing a mild disease in the human. Hopefully it will stay this way and not increase in virulence or develop the ability to transmit between humans. - Mod.TG
