This is a preliminary report from Hastings, Nebraska USA.
Infection control reports 2 hospitalized adult males with mumps orchitis.
The local health department reports 14 clinical cases and 2 lab confirmed
cases. One hospitalized case has reported normal IgM. Two adult males had
been to an Iowa wrestling tournament during the incubation period. One is a
teacher, the other a physician. Travel by one teenager to Colorado during
her infectious pre-clinical presentation is reported. It appears most cases
have had immunization with mumps-containing vaccines. One case had a
history of natural mumps.

Number of Mumps Cases Swells Across Iowa
-----------------------------------------------
A mumps epidemic is sweeping across Iowa in the biggest outbreak in the
country, puzzling health officials and worrying parents.
As of Thursday [1 Apr 2006], 245 confirmed, probable or suspected cases of
mumps had been reported to the Iowa Department of Public Health since
mid-January 2006. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said it is the only major outbreak in the nation.
"We are calling this an epidemic, not just an outbreak," said Iowa state
epidemiologist Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, explaining that mumps has spread to
more than a 3rd of the state and does not appear to be confined to certain
age groups or other sectors of the population. Quinlisk said Iowa has had
about 5 cases of mumps a year in recent years, and this is the 1st large
outbreak in nearly 20 years. "We're trying to figure out why is it
happening, why is it happening in Iowa and why is it happening right now.
We don't know," she said.
CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said the federal agency has no answers yet.
Quinlisk said one theory is that the infection was brought over from
England -- perhaps by a college student -- because the strain seen in Iowa
has been identified by the CDC as the same one that has caused tens of
thousands of cases of the mumps in a major outbreak in Britain over the
past 2 years. "It may have been a college student, since we did see the 1st
activities on college campuses, but we can't prove that," Quinlisk said.
The Public Health Department said 23 percent of the 245 reported patients
are in college.
Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include fever,
headache, muscle aches and swelling of the glands close to the jaw. It can
cause serious complications, including meningitis, damage to the testicles
and deafness.
A mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967. Iowa law requires schoolchildren to
be vaccinated, and the state's last major outbreak was in 1987, when 476
people were infected.
Of the 245 patients this year [2006], at least 66 percent had had the
recommended 2-shot vaccination, while 14 percent had received one dose, the
Public Health Department said.
"The vaccine is working," Quinlisk said. "The vaccine certainly was made to
cover this particular strain, because it's a fairly common strain of
mumps." Quinlisk said the vaccine overall is considered about 95 percent
effective.
Quinlisk said the mumps started in eastern Iowa and is spreading statewide
and possibly into the neighboring states of Illinois, Minnesota and
Nebraska. Those states may have one or 2 cases of the mumps, she said.
When an [11-year-old boy] of Davenport starting feeling sick in mid-January
2006, his family thought he had a bad case of the flu. But his face and
throat swelled, and his temperature climbed to 103. His parents took him to
the doctor, and he was diagnosed to their surprise with full-blown mumps.
About 2 weeks later, his 21-year-old sister came down with the mumps too.
Both children had gotten the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR. So
had their other 13-year-old brother who did not get the mumps.
"He had all the shots and everything. You don't think you're going to get
the mumps after you've been inoculated," said boy's father.
