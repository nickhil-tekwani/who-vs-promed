Is bitter cassava raised in the Philippines? Throughout the Indonesian
archipelago, only the sweet variety is planted, which requires no special
preparation due to low cyanogen-cyanide content. If that is the case, the
cyanide hypothesis is a no-starter.

Manila suspects pesticide poisoning behind deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Philippine doctors said on Sat 12 Mar 2005 that they suspected pesticide
contamination as the possible cause of the food poisoning that killed
dozens of children in a remote village.
Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit said test results that could show the cause
of death of 27 school children on the central Bohol island will be
announced on Mon 14 Mar 2005, as government toxicologists ran more tests on
food, blood and vomit samples.
"Our working diagnosis was organophosphate poisoning," Harold Gallego, the
chief doctor in the Mabini town hospital, told Reuters. "Most children
brought here responded to atropine phosphate, an antidote for pesticide
poisoning."
He said symptoms shown by the children, aged between 6 and 13 years, who
fell ill after eating cassava fritters and balls were consistent with
cyanide and pesticide poisoning. But, those poisoned by cyanide would not
react to atropine phosphate, said Gallego. Sodium nitrate and sodium
thiosulfate are normally given to victims of cyanide poisoning.
Initial tests made by experts from the Philippine root crop agency tend to
back the doctors' theory, because samples of cassava found at the kitchen
where the snack was prepared and cooked showed a lower level of cyanide.
"We concluded that the poison (cyanide) in the cassava is low, and it can
be eaten, so it is not the cause of the death of the children," said
chemist Cynthia Budoy.
Villagers said that they would avoid cassava until authorities find the
cause of death. "I won't allow my children to taste any cassava again,"
said a local mother, while giving soup to her 2 sons in a hospital ward in
Mabini town. "From now on, I will personally prepare their snacks." 3 of
her children were hospitalized.
But a neighbor said her family would still continue to eat cassava, a
staple among most poor families on Bohol island. "I don't believe the
cassava is poisonous," she told Reuters. "Since I was a child, I have been
eating cassava, because we don't have enough rice. There must be something
else that poisoned the children."

[Awaiting formal report of the chemical analysis of clinical specimens, the
evidence seems to be leading away from cassava-associated cyanide poisoning
in this tragic event.
ProMED thanks Dr. Marzolf for his comment regarding the growing of sweet,
as compared to bitter, cassava in the area, the latter being the type
associated with cyanide toxicity. This may be the case, but if it were
totally true, one would think that the issue of cyanine poisoning initially
would not have been suspected by local authorities. Reviewing cassava
toxicity reports produces the observation that almost all are from the
African continent, but reports do occur from Asia (i.e., Ariffin WA, Choo
KE, Karnaneedi S: Cassava (ubi kayu) poisoning in children. Med J Malaysia.
1992; 47:231-4). - Mod.LL]
