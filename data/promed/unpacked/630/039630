Cases of a lethal tick-borne virus in Japan are reportedly set to start passing the 100-people-per-year mark for the 1st time since record keeping on the condition began in 2013.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases announced on [19 Nov 2019] that the 2019 total of 96 people affected with Huaiyangshan banyangvirus [severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome], also known as the SFTS virus, had surpassed the previous high of 90 in 2017. Additionally, the mortality rate is high, and due to the risk of infection being passed on by pets, the institute is warning people to be cautious. [There is a unique case of a cat transmitting SFTS virus to a veterinarian and veterinary nurse in Japan (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927). The usual transmission is via ticks. - Mod.TY]

The virus that causes SFTS was discovered by a group of Chinese researchers in 2011. It lies dormant in the body for around 6 days to 2 weeks, when it then shows symptoms including a fever, diarrhea and bloody bowel discharges. Mortality rates of 30% have been reported. Only symptomatic treatment is available for those suffering from the virus, and there is no vaccine.

The institute has been seeking reports from medical institutions across the country regarding all patients since 2013, and an upward trend has been visible since the 1st set of reports showed 40 patients in the initiative's 1st year.

It is believed that there has not been an increase in infections, but rather that as a newly understood disease it has gradually become more easily recognized by medical professionals.

As of the end of October [2019], an overall total of 491 patients had been diagnosed with the condition [since 1st diagnosed in the country in 2013], and at the time those reports were filed 70 of [the patients] had died. It is possible that the number of the deceased has increased since that time. SFTS is particularly dangerous for elderly people, with 90% of recorded cases among those aged 60 and over.

The virus is carried by wild animals including deer and boars; if a tick (such as the Asian longhorned tick) sucks the blood of an infected animal and then later bites into another one, it passes on the virus. While it is important to be vigilant when out in hills and fields, there is also a danger of pets transmitting the disease to their owners at home after going outside.

Masayuki Saijo, head of the institute's Department of Virology 1, said, "When your pet is feeling unwell, wear protective items including thick gloves, and try not let them bite you."

[SFTS virus apparently has become established in Japan. There were cases every year from 2013 to present, but more cases occurred in 2017 and 2018. Cases were widely disbursed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. The best way to avoid infection would be to avoid tick bites.

SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
