Subject: PRO> Enteric disease surveillance,
Sewage effluent samples taken even after treatment are known to
harbor Salmonell sp. The inherent problem which exists with treatment
plants is the fact that all organic materials are not removed and
pathogens can hide in particulate matter and escape being eradicated
by chlorine. In a recent survey we just completed that Salmonella was
cultured in almost all sites irregardless of the type of sewage treatment
plant (ie secondary or tertiary treatment levels) and chlorination
concentration determined at the final effluent.
