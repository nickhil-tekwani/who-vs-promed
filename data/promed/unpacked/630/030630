Poppy companies confirm mildew outbreak spread by infected seeds
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tasmania's poppy industry has confirmed they are fighting a new virulent and damaging mildew selectively attacking poppies. The mildew does not discriminate between poppy varieties and has been spread across Tasmania by infected seeds.

Fungicide trials to manage the spread of the mildew have failed and the only way to effectively control the spread of mildew next [2015] season is to identify and eliminate infected seeds.

The poppy industry says 'it can't afford to fail' and has flown in an international expert on systemic mildew. Professor Hermann Voglmayr says the new mildew that also exists in Europe, _Peronospora somniferi_, is highly infectious. "It is systemic, which means that the plant is totally infected at a young stage as a seedling," he said. "Because the disease is inside [the plant] you can't fight it with fungicides."

The disease is a more severe type of downy mildew [than the one] that already exists in Tasmania and is easily treated with regular fungicides.

Dr Voglmayr says eliminating infected seeds from breeding crops is the best way to manage future outbreaks. "In infected seeds the pathogen is already close to the plant when it germinates and can infect it. This can then cause big epidemics if the weather conditions are favourable." He says it would be pure speculation at this stage how it travelled from Europe to Tasmania.

[Different varieties of poppy (_Papaver somniferum_) are grown to produce poppy seed (as edible seeds or for oil extraction) or as a source of alkaloids. Downy mildew is one of the most economically serious diseases of the crop worldwide. Infections can develop either locally (via plant surfaces, mostly by air borne spores) or systemically (through the vascular system, for example via infected seed). Symptoms may include spots, necrosis and distortion of leaves, failure of flower development, stunting and collapse of plants. The disease is favoured by humid conditions, especially wet leaves.

The spores can be spread up to hundreds of kilometers by air currents in viable conditions; within a crop spread occurs mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungi survive between crops on infected plant material or volunteer or alternate weed hosts. Disease management may include cultural measures and phytosanitation, but downy mildews are mainly controlled with fungicides.

The main downy mildew fungi previously reported to affect poppy crops are _Peronospora arborescens_ and _P. cristata_. However, recently species in the genus found associated with poppies in Europe and Asia have been reclassified by molecular methods. Six different species were distinguished phylogenetically, including _P. somniferi_ which was described and identified as a new species (Voglmayr et al 2014, PLoS 9, see link below). It will be important to identify the source and pathway of this recent pathogen incursion in Tasmania in order to improve biosecurity and protection of primary industries.
