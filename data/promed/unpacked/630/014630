Further information
-------------------
Norwalk-like viruses (NLV) are a common cause of outbreaks of
gastroenteritis in New Zealand. Last week's hotel outbreak affected some 60
of 150 staff and an unknown number of guests (many had left the hotel
before developing symptoms). Results from faecal specimens are not yet
available, but the picture is consistent with NLV.
The index cases at the hotel were members of a tour party which had been
travelling together for some time. In all, around 25 of its 30 members have
developed symptoms consistent with NLV. The first cases in this party
occurred before they reached New Zealand.
