Orr's Fine Meats and Deli is recalling Smoked Fish from the marketplace because they may permit the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_. Consumers should not consume the recalled products described below.

The following products have been sold from Orr's Fine Meats and Deli in Parry Sound, Ontario.

Recalled products:
Brand Name / Common Name / Size / Code(s) on Product / UPC
None / Smoked White Fish / Variable (1 filet) / All / None
None / Smoked Lake Trout / Variable (1 filet) / All / None

This recall was triggered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) inspection activities. The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings.

The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing recalled products from the marketplace.

There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
