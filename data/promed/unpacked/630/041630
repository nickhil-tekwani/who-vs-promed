First Report of _Fusarium oxysporum_ on Lettuce in Europe.
A. Garibaldi, G. Gilardi, and M. L. Gullino, DIVAPRA-Patologia
vegetale, Via Leonardo da Vinci 44, 10095 Grugliasco, Italy. Plant Dis.
86:1052, 2002; published on-line as D-2002-0703-01N, 2002.
Accepted for publication 10 Jun 2002.

In spring 2001, plants of lettuce cv. Salad Bowl showing symptoms of
a wilt disease were observed in several commercial plastic greenhouses
near Bergamo, in northern Italy. Wilted plants were first observed
during the spring and summer of 2001 at temperatures between 26 and
35 degrees C. Symptoms were observed in the same area and the same
farms in March 2002, again under periods of high temperatures.

Distribution of disease plants was generally uniform, but symptoms
were severest in the central part of the greenhouses where temperatures
were warmest.

Symptoms were first observed at thinning, when seedlings (30 days
old) appeared wilted. Vascular tissues of affected seedlings appeared
red or brown. Affected plants were stunted and developed yellow
leaves and brown or black streaks in the vascular system. The vascular
streaks in the yellow leaves extended from the crown and were
continuous with a red-brown discoloration in the vascular system of
the crown and upper taproot. Symptoms were typically not visible on
the outside of the crowns or roots.

_Fusarium oxysporum_ (Fo) was readily isolated from symptomatic
vascular tissues on a _Fusarium_-selective medium (2). Seeds of cv.
Salad Bowl were planted in steam-sterilized soil artificially infested
with 10 000 CFU/g soil of each of 2 isolates of Fo obtained from
infected plants. Plants grown in noninfested soil served as uninoculated
controls. Plants (25 per treatment) were grown at 25 to 28 degrees C in
growth chambers.

In duplicate pathogenicity tests, wilt symptoms and vascular
discoloration of roots, crown, and veins developed 20 days after
seeding for all plants grown in the infested soil, and Fo was
consistently reisolated from infected plants.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fo on lettuce in Europe. A
wilt of lettuce attributed to _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _lactucae_ was
reported in Japan in 1967 (3) and in the United States in 1993 (1). In
the latter case the incitant organism was described as _F. oxysporum_
f. sp. _lactucum_.
