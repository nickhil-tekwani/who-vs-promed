One of the 2 residents of Kadamjay district in Batken region who were admitted to local hospital with suspected anthrax was confirmed to have [the disease], the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyzstan said.

[Maps of Kyrgyzstan can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3700456,48189. Batken oblast is at the furthest western point of the lower prong of provinces along the southern border of the Fergana valley -- an anthrax hot spot -- and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Kadamjay is on the NE border of Batken, see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KG/09/Frunze.html, on the road connecting Fargona and Shakhimardan, an Uzbek pocket in the interior of Kyrgyzstan. This raises the possibility that the 2 men got infected from handling contaminated Uzbek meat bought in Kadamjay.

If I am correct in my supposition, this would explain the size of the medical team (5 MDs and 30 nurses) as such a team would be needed to track down everyone else with contact with a contaminated market meat source, and initial treatment, if only preventative. Reports of anthrax in Batken are sporadic and concentrate more on human cases than the source livestock outbreaks or related events.

But maybe our 2 Batken gentlemen were exposed when butchering their own dead animal and the medical team is checking others possibly exposed in their village. - Mod.MHJ]

The State Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision Agency of Kyrgyzstan said 17 human cases of anthrax have been registered in Kyrgyzstan in 2015.

Director of the Center of Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections, Asylbek Sydykanov, told about anthrax prevention measures. Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects mostly animals. It is contagious and can be transmitted through contact or consumption of infected meat. Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by pneumonia and severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse.

According to the data of the Ministry of Health, for the 1st 9 months of 2015 in all the republic, there were 17 human cases of cutaneous anthrax reported, including 7 cases in Jalal-Abad, 4 in Osh, 3 in Naryn, 2 in Batken, and 1 in Chui region.

Of the 17 cases of cutaneous anthrax, 15 patients were laboratory confirmed, 2 patients were diagnosed as clinically indicated [that is, not laboratory confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]. 16 people were infected with anthrax when participating in the forced slaughter of farm animals and one from contact with infected meat.
