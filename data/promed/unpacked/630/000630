Abstract
--------
"Background: From January to May 2019, large measles outbreaks affected Nigeria. Borno State was the most affected, recording 15 237 suspected cases with the state capital of Maiduguri having 1125 cases investigated and line-listed by March 2019. In Borno State, 22 of the 27 local government areas (LGAs or districts), including 37 internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps, were affected. In response to the situation, an outbreak response immunization (ORI) campaign was conducted in the 13 most affected LGAs. In addition to conventional vaccination teams, special teams were deployed in security compromised areas, areas with migrants, and for nomadic and IDPs. Here we describe the outbreak and the ORI campaign. We also assess the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) coverage and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in order to quantify the population-level impact.

"Methods: We reviewed the ORI activities and conducted an analysis of the surveillance and the outbreak investigation reports. We assessed VE of MCV by applying the screening method. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to assess the effect of final classification of cases on the VE of MCV. The MCV coverage was assessed by a post-campaign coverage survey after completion of the ORI through a quantitative survey in the 12 LGAs that were accessible.

"Results: Of the total 15 237 reported measles cases, 2002 cases were line-listed and investigated, and 737 were confirmed for measles by week 9 of 2019. Of the investigated cases, 67.3% (n  =  1348) were between 9 and 59  months of age. Among the 737 confirmed cases, only 9% (n  =  64) stated being vaccinated with at least one dose of MCV. The overall VE for MCV was 98.4% (95% CI: 97.8-98.8). No significant differences were observed in the VE estimates of lab-confirmed and epi-linked cases when compared to the original estimates. The aggregated weighted vaccination coverage was 85.7% (95% CI: 79.6-90.1).

"Conclusion: The experience in Borno demonstrates that adequate VE can be obtained in conflict-affected areas. In complex emergencies affected by measles outbreaks, health authorities may consider integration with other health strategies and the engagement of security personnel as part of the ORI activities."

From the full article:

"Conclusions: Our findings suggest that decreased VE is unlikely to explain the recurrence of measles outbreaks in Borno State. Insecurity resulting in lack of health and immunization services, frequent population displacements and clustering of susceptible children in IDPs are more likely contributors to measles morbidity and mortality in the State [25]. Despite the estimated VE from the ORI activities, sub-optimal RI coverage is insufficient to maintain population immunity and prevent the accumulation of susceptible children that allow outbreaks to occur." - Mod.LK

The Ministry of Health is planning to roll out a massive immunisation campaign in West Pokot and Garissa counties following a measles outbreak.

According to a disease outbreak report by the ministry, dated 29 May 2021, a total of 615 cases of measles have been reported, out of which 31 are confirmed, and one death [has been] reported. Of the confirmed cases, 8 are in Fafi Sub-County, Garissa County and 23 in West Pokot. The death was reported in Pokot North.

The report noted that the outbreak in West Pokot has been continuous since October 2019, affecting Pokot North, Pokot Central, Pokot South and West Pokot sub-counties. Director of public health, Ministry of Health, Francis Kuria said improved outreach visits to improve immunisation coverage for affected areas [are] ongoing. "Campaigns to boost immunisation of measles alongside polio and other childhood diseases will boost uptake of immunisation and avert outbreak of diseases," said Dr Kuria.

Abstract
--------
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine measles immunisation and supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) in most countries including Kenya. We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region.

"Methods: Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020.

"Results: In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 34% (8-54). As the COVID-19 contact restrictions are nearly fully eased, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak will increase to 38% (19-54), 46% (30-59), and 54% (43-64) assuming a 15%, 50%, and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 43% (25-56), 54% (43-63), and 67% (59-72) for the same coverage scenarios, respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of all restrictions can be overcome by conducting a SIA with  95% or greater coverage in under-5s.

"Conclusion: While contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly once these restrictions are lifted. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks given the roll-back of contact restrictions in Kenya."

From the full article:

"Conclusions: Measles SIA originally scheduled for February 2020 in Kenya would have been well-timed as population immunity was below herd immunity threshold. Interruptions to RI since the start of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Kenya have now widened the measles immunity gap, but the associated risk of large measles outbreaks were partially mitigated by COVID-19 contact restrictions in place. As these measures have almost been fully lifted, we estimate that measles outbreak risks will dramatically increase, and an immediate SIA will be required to close measles immunity gaps."

While personal protective measures taken in response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 have reduced transmission of air-borne infectious diseases, measles being one, the lifting of restrictions may lead to new outbreaks of these diseases, or exacerbation of continuing outbreaks. Vaccination efforts are critical to build immunity back to these other diseases, just as it is important to protect against COVID. - Mod.LK
