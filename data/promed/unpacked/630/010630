Diagnostic tests conducted at Charlottetown's Atlantic Veterinary College confirm the presence of bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) in Prince Edward Island's bat population.

The 1st dead bat was found in the Bonshaw area, west of Charlottetown, in early February [2013].

"While this finding was expected, it is more bad news for bats in eastern North America," said provincial biologist Rosemary Curley in a news release Wednesday [27 Feb 2013].

"Since it was 1st discovered in the US in 2006, WNS has decimated bat populations, and, unfortunately, there is little that can be done to protect them from this disease."

White-nose syndrome is a fatal fungal infection that causes bats to wake up frequently during hibernation. Because there are no food sources available, they die from starvation and hypothermia.

Since the 1st report in early February [2013], government officials have received 19 reports of dead and live animals from 10 locations across the province. Staff were able to collect 8 bats for testing.

Over the last several years, it is estimated that more than 6 million bats in eastern North America have died from the disease, which continues to spread into new regions. In New York state, where the disease 1st appeared in North America, it is estimated 90 per cent of the population has died.

The public is being asked to report any further observations of bats out in the winter, whether they are alive or dead.

[The geographical distribution of WNS as of 1 Mar 2013 can be seen at http://whitenosesyndrome.org/resources/map.

To better assess the significance of this finding, it would be helpful to know which bat species were affected and whether the fungus was detected in healthy or diseased/dead bats that had the typical signs of the disease.
