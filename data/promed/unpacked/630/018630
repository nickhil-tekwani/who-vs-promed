The Office of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare] in the Stavropol Territory reports the 1st case of infection with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) this year [2020] in the southwestern Russia region.

The patient is a resident of the Arzgir district with confirmed diagnosis of CCHF after a tick bite.

In 2019, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever was confirmed in at least 38 people in the Stavropol Territory.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[CCHF is endemic and occurs frequently in the Stavropol region. The South of Russia (Stavropol, Rostov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan regions, Kalmykia, Ingushetiya, Dagestan, Karachay-Cherkessia, and disputed Crimea) are endemic for CCHF. Between 2005 and 2015, 1397 total cases, including 42 fatalities and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.2% were recorded. The highest numbers were registered between 2006 and 2008, which coincides with official Russian MOH statistics. In 2016, 162 cases were reported in total for Russia with 6 fatalities (based on reported cases, CFR 3.7%) and in 2017, 72 cases were reported by ProMED-RUS for Russia with 4 fatalities (5% CFR; https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(18)33924-9/fulltext).

Healthcare personnel are at risk from nosocomial infections and the 1st such cases were described in Pakistan and later reported from many countries. Severe CCHF with associated hemorrhage presents the highest risk and failure to recognize the initial non-specific clinical features of CCHF remains a challenge both in endemic settings and in exported cases in travelers (http://archive.lstmed.ac.uk/7577/1/PLoS_0182315_8_9_17.pdf). - Mod.UBA
