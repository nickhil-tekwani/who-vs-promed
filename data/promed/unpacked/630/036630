ARLINGTON AUTHORITIES SEEK BOY EXPOSED TO RABID BAT IN PARK
Arlington health officials were cited as saying yesterday that they are
seeking a boy who may have been exposed to a rabid bat last Friday.
[Presumably, 17th April]
Officials said a white male child with short hair believed to be between 9
and 13 years old gave a park ranger in Glencarlyn Park a box containing a
bat that he said he found on the bike trail.
The boy spoke to the ranger about 7:10 p.m. The ranger was in his truck near
Shelter No. 1 on the Third Street side of the park, which is at 301 S.
Harrison St.
The bat tested positive for rabies, county officials said. Rabies is almost
invariably fatal to humans.
Arlington health officials say the child should be tested for rabies as soon
as possible. [Please, no comments on this jounalistic error. MHJ] Anyone
with knowledge of the incident should contact the Arlington Animal Welfare
League at 703-931-1508 and ask for the animal warden.

[While one might presume that the local news media have blanketed the area,
there is nothing to be lost by advertising for this boy more widely. -
