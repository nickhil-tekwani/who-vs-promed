Sarawak's State Ministry of Environment and Public Health has sounded
the red alert following an explosion of dengue cases, with about 10
new hospital admissions in Miri City alone every day. Already, 5
people have died throughout the state, 4 of them in Miri City and one
in Kuching. The number of infected people has reached the 4000 mark,
with 873 patients in Miri City alone.

The ministry and the State Health and Medical Services Department are
especially worried because probes carried out into the dengue
outbreak have found _Aedes_ mosquito larvae [eggs] that can survive
for days and hatch even in a small droplet of water inside the home.
[Maturation of larvae and pupae requires somewhat more than a drop of
water, but small, persistent amounts or water are adequate. - Mod.TY]

Assistant State Minister for Environment and Public Health, Dr
Stephen Rundi, on Wednesday [16 Dec 2009] announced that state
authorities have told all hospitals to be at the highest level of
alert. "This is becoming a big problem for the state because the
number of people infected has shot up by 3 times compared with the
same period last year [2008]. We have mobilised all available
resources of the health department, the city and district councils,
hospital authorities and residential committees to halt the spread.
We must stop the number of fatalities and bring down the rate of
infection. Every day in Miri, 8-10 new patients are being admitted
into the hospital for dengue. We are very worried because the wet
season is just starting," he told a press conference here.

On Wednesday [16 Dec 2009], Dr Rundi held a meeting with Miri Mayor
Lawrence Lai, State Health and Medical Services Department deputy
director Dr Faizul Mansor, Miri Hospital director Dr Uma Devi, local
councillors and other agencies to discuss the latest situation on the outbreak.

The latest dengue fatality happened 2 days ago here in a sprawling
squatter colony in Pujut.

Dr Rundi said initial probes carried out by his ministry into the
outbreak have uncovered some alarming findings, among them:

* _Aedes_ mosquitoes are more difficult to kill compared with before
because their larvae have become very hardy and resistant, and can
survive for days in very tiny droplets of water and hatch into adult
mosquitoes;

* Up-market residential areas have become major breeding grounds
because rich folk in Miri do not allow their premises to be dirtied by fogging;

* Squatter colonies have become even dirtier and are also major
breeding grounds for _Aedes_ [dengue virus] carriers; and

* The public in general continues to remain indifferent to all
efforts to stop the outbreak.

Dr Rundi said the Miri City Council has initiated even more
aggressive measures to stop the outbreak and has formed "search and
destroy squads" to detect and kill _Aedes_ mosquitoes and larvae.
"The city and district councils have been given authorisation to
enter every house, including those belonging to the rich and famous,
to search for mosquitoes. Anyone found with mosquito breeding grounds
would be issued a compound [fine] of RM 500 [USD 146]," he said.

Dr Faizul said previously, it was only the squatter colonies that
were breeding grounds for mosquitoes, but now, even the cities' and
towns' centres and up-market housing estates have become dengue hotspots.

Mayor Lai has ordered intense fogging to be carried out
simultaneously throughout Miri City, which has a population of 300
000, to be repeated every 3 days.

Dr Uma said the Miri Hospital has run out of space for dengue
patients due to the surge in new admissions daily, adding that
additional wards have to be found soon.

The north Queensland city of Townsville now has 2 separate dengue
fever outbreaks, with the wet season yet to start in earnest.
Queensland Health said it had confirmed 9 locally-acquired dengue
[virus] type 1 cases and 2 type 3 cases, in the suburbs of Garbutt,
Heatley and Wulguru. Results on 4 other cases are expected later on
Friday [18 Dec 2009].

Queensland Health medical officer Dr Steven Donohue said the fact
that there were now 2 separate strains in the city, following the
declaration of a fresh outbreak last month [November 2009], was of
great concern. "We are unaware of the origin of this new dengue
[virus] type 3 outbreak, but significant mosquito breeding sites have
been found by mosquito control officers in Wulguru," Dr Donohue said
in a statement. "This is a bad sign given that we have not even had
significant rains yet, and lots of people travel around over Christmas."

He said scientists would test the virus to compare it with the dengue
[virus] type 3 epidemic strain that occurred early this year [2009].
But he said it was unlikely the strain had persisted through from last season.

People who have had another dengue type previously are at increased
risk of more serious illness with a 2nd dose of the disease. This can
include complications such as DHF, which can lead to death.

Doctors have been put on alert, and disease surveillance and mosquito
control staff will be patrolling over the Christmas break.

The north Queensland dengue epidemic during the last wet season was
the worst in 50 years. More than 1000 people were infected with the
virus during the outbreak, which began in November 2008, including an
elderly woman who died due to complications in March this year [2009].

Dengue mosquitoes breed around homes and in urban areas, and
residents have been asked to get rid of water-holding containers and
wear strong repellent.

[The 17 Dec 2009 issue of ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Co.)
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/17/2774231.htm> reported
that the number of locally acquired type one dengue fever cases in
Townsville, in north Queensland, has risen to 11. Another case has
been confirmed in the western suburb of Garbutt. Queensland Health
says 5 people are still waiting on test results to see if they have
the disease. The 18 Dec 2009 report by ABC (Australian Broadcasting
Co.) <http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/18/2775860.htm>
indicated that blood banks in Townsville have stopped taking red cell
and platelet donations during the dengue outbreak, with 11 confirmed
cases of the disease in the area.

The concern about the spread of dengue virus infections in Queensland
is justified, given the large area where the mosquito vector _Aedes
aegypti_ is found. _Aedes albopictus_, also a dengue virus vector, is
only found in Torres Strait islands on the northern tip of Queensland
(<http://www.health.qld.gov.au/dengue/dengue_fever/mosquito.asp#dengueAustralia>).

Health Affairs in Jeddah has said that 10 cases of dengue fever have
been registered since floods hit the city's east. "Eight cases have
been recorded since the beginning of this week," said Health Affairs
Director Sami Badawood. "All are in a stable condition."

Jeddah Governor Prince Misha'l Bin Majed held an emergency meeting
Tuesday [15 Dec 2009] of the recently formed Public Health Committee,
headed by Badawood and consisting of representatives from 6 bodies
including King Abdulaziz University, the Red Crescent, Presidency of
Meteorology and Environmental Protection, and other government
bodies. The committee was set up to address any health concerns
resulting from the floods.

The Minister of Health, Ramiro Tapia, yesterday [9 Dec 2009]
expressed his concern about the increase of dengue cases in the
country, mainly in Pando, where 148 affected people have been
recorded, of a total of 172 reported [dengue cases] in the 2nd half
of the year [2009] in all of the national territory. Minister Tapia
indicated that this is an alarming situation because it is an
important epidemiological outbreak. To face this situation, he said
that cleanup campaigns and fumigation will be strengthened in Cobija
and other municipalities in Pando. We are going to propose to the
Pando Health Services that we carry out a day cleanup and spraying in
Cobija, he added.

According to Tapia, of the total [dengue] cases confirmed from June
2009 to the present, 12 are from Santa Cruz, 8 from La Paz, 3 from
Beni and one from Cochabamba [departments; state or province
equivalents]. In relation to Santa Cruz department, the interim chief
for the dengue departmental Health Services program (SEDES), Virgilio
Prieto, stated that the situation is under control. He said that
since [epidemiological] week 45, that is to say since the 1st week of
November 2009, all the suspected [dengue] cases have yielded negative
laboratory results. Prieto indicated that the prevention campaigns by
district, developed by SEDES and the mayor's office, have given good
results. The proof of this is that between January and December
[2009], the [household _Aedes aegypti_] larval infestation rate has
been reduced from 50 percent to 13 percent. This signifies that at
the beginning of the year [2009], 50 or every 100 houses had mosquito
larvae [present], while currently the vect!
or, in its larval phase, is present in only 13 of every 100 homes, he
explained.

Nonetheless, SEDES thinks that prevention campaigns in the provinces
most affected during the dengue epidemic at the beginning of the year
[2009] must be strengthened. Because of this, 56 lightweight and
heavy fumigation machines were delivered, which will be distributed
to all the provinces in the department. The greatest number of
machines are destined for Cordillera and Obispo Santistevan.

[In 2008 and early 2009, lowland Bolivia, and especially the
Department of Santa Cruz, suffered an intense dengue outbreak that
overloaded the medical facilities in the city. One hopes that
situation will not be repeated in the coming months and that the
early preventive measures being implemented will be effective.

Teachers, students and friends of Professor Claudemir Bergamo (Tito),
the 8th fatal victim of dengue in Sinop, protested yesterday night [7
Dec 2009] in the session of the municipal council against the
increasing number of deaths in order to press the city for tougher
measures to be taken in order to contain the infestation of the
mosquito that transmits the disease [virus]. Professor Rosa Eulen dos
Santos showed a poster reading: "Dengue: must someone in your family
die, so that you do something about it?" In an interview with So
Noticias, she said that just mobilization will not minimize the
serious problem in the city. "It is our obligation to take charge and
require those who have conditions [for vector breeding sites] to
change to improve this scenario. I believe that we are taking the 1st
part to require action, and, at the same time, we [need] to act and
take care of our homes, inform our neighbors; [this] is our role,
too. But the authorities have the power at hand. I believe we came to
the correct location, to the city council, to ask them to change this
dire situation," she charged.

Cleaning up land and backyards is essential for the elimination of
the mosquito but not the only measure that should be taken, says
Eulen. "The councilors are talking all the time about clean yards,
clean troughs, while dengue fever is not only that. The disease also
involves fast response [FR] service; we need to know what the FR is
offering, how it is dealing with the situation, thinking that
speaking about dengue is much more than talking about cleaning
yards," she charged. After the charges, some council members went to
the podium and made speeches demanding more action.

The largest outbreaks of the disease are in the central area.
Saturday and Sunday [12, 13 Dec 2009], the committee for fighting
dengue is conducting "fine-toothed comb" [action] to eliminate foci
of outbreaks. Thu 16 Dec 2009, a hearing is scheduled for further
action to be taken. According to the latest update released by
Municipal Health, Sinop has, from January 2009 to date, 2491 cases of
dengue fever, 22 of dengue with complications, 17 cases of DHF, 2 of
[dengue] shock syndrome and 6 confirmed deaths, 4 of DHF and 2 with
shock syndrome and 2 under investigation. Of the 3708 [case] reports,
1037 were discarded.

Professor Tito, as news has just reported, died on Sunday night [6
Dec 2009] of DHF. He was 40 years old and lived in the center of the city.

According to latest data from the state Secretariat of Health (SES),
up to October this year [2009], Minas Gerais recorded 75 556 cases of
the disease, a decrease of 2.6 percent over the same period last year
[2008], when there were 76 552 [dengue] infected persons. Considering
all Brazil, according to the Minister, the drop was 46 percent in the
number of cases in comparison with 2008. "I do not see this reduction
as negative for the state. In analyzing the situation of Minas
Gerais, we see that the disease is concentrated in about 20
municipalities in a total of 853," said the state Secretary for
Health, Marcos Pestana.

SES data show that in 2006, 714 people were infected by the mosquito
[-borne virus] in Governador Valadares. In just 3 years, the number
increased 9 times, rising to 6290 cases. For the Superintendent of
Epidemiology of SES, Francisco Lemos, the fact that dengue occurs
periodically and hits, often, the same cities does not permit one to
say that there has been negligence or flaws in public policy in these
municipalities, especially in the Vale do Arco. "The year 2009 was
characterized by increased rainfall across the state," he said.

Belo Horizonte, which this year [2009] stepped up actions to combat
the vector, recorded, according to recent data from the Municipal
Secretariat of Health, 22 755 reports of the disease. Of this total,
12 603 cases were confirmed. The north region still has the highest
number of cases, 6036 confirmed, followed by the regions of Venda
Nova, 1410, and northeast with 1379. "The fight must not stop,"
stated the state Secretary of Health, Marcelo Teixeira.

An outbreak of dengue is worrying the authorities of Carangola in the
Zona Mata [forest area], 359 km from Belo Horizonte. In recent days,
the municipal Secretariat of Health reported at least 40 cases, of
which 7 have been confirmed in a laboratory accredited by the SUS.
The recorded [cases] are concentrated in the Bairro do Triangulo, the
most populous of the municipality, where entire families have
contracted the virus. The municipal Secretary of Health, Amaury
Costa, met with representatives of Regional Health Management (GRS)
of Manhumirim to try to draw up a strategy for confronting [the
disease]. To combat the disease, a health barrier will be placed in
the most critical region. In addition to 22 full-time employees of
the National Health Foundation (FUNASA), another 12 will be hired on
an emergency basis for application of insecticide by means of
backpack sprayers.

The [current] situation:

Cities at risk of an outbreak: Governador Valadares, Ipatinga

On alert: Belo Horizonte, Araguari, Betim, Contagem, Coronel
Fabriciano, Divinopolis, Ibirite, Itabira, Juiz de Fora, Monte
Carlos, Pedro Leopoldo, Ribeirao das Neves, Sabara, Santa Luzia, Sete
Lagoas, Teofilo Otoni, Timoteo, Uberaba, Uberlandia, Vespasiano

Stable situation: Conselheiro Lafaiete, Patos de Minas

With the approach of the austral summer in a year marked by the
climatic phenomenon "El Nino," which will increase rainfall and
changes in the temperatures of the region, specialists fear dengue
virus will hit South America harder.

With changes in habits and education -- although insufficient -- as
the maximum preventive tools, the region faces the challenge of
fighting the expansion of the dengue [virus] mosquito vector, _Aedes
aegypti_, which prefers to live near humans in humid places.

Here are some facts of the disease, which appears to have approached
half a million cases this year [2009] in South America: * In 2009,
the countries of the Southern Cone -- Argentina, Brasil, Chile,
Paraguay and Uruguay -- reported 438 704 cases of dengue to the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO), according to data at the
beginning of December [2009], placing it well ahead of Central
America, in 2nd place with 206 810 cases.

* The cases of DHF, which is the most serious form of the disease, in
the Andean Region and the Southern Cone in 2009 are around 17 000,
which is almost equal to 70 percent of the total registered in the
American Continent.

* As for the number of deaths from the disease, of a total of 364 in
all the Americas, the Southern Cone and the Andean Region -- composed
of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- recorded the
highest rates in 2009, with 47 and 20 percent, respectively.

* Brazil, which according to PAHO has 60 percent of the cases of
dengue in the Americas, was one of the countries most affected by the
epidemic of last summer, followed by Bolivia.

* Concerning the average [mean] number of reported cases between
2000-2007, in the Southern Cone, the number of recorded [cases] in
2008 was an increase of 153 percent, with 585 866 cases.
