Three women have died as a result of an unknown fever in Kalma camp, South Darfur. The North Darfur Ministry of Health has pledged to fill the gap of health services in the state by constructing health units in El Fasher.

The Secretary-General of the camp, east of Nyala city, reported the deaths of the [2 women] and an 11-year-old [girl] on Wednesday [29 Oct 2014]. Saleh Issa added that the symptoms of the disease are headache, severe fever, diarrhoea, and bleeding from the nose and mouth. He pointed out that many of the cases have been reported to the camp administration.

In June this year [2014], Radio Dabanga reported that an unknown disease claimed the lives of 18 people living in Kalma during one month. The symptoms of this disease were a loss of appetite, headache, pain in the chest, diarrhoea, vomiting, and a high fever.

In North Darfur, the Federal Ministry of Health acknowledged that there is a lack of health services in the state. Under-Secretary Essam Mohamed Abdallah this week pledged to fill the gap over the next 2 years by building family health units and centres. A fund of the Darfur Regional Authority would finance the construction, including new buildings at the El Fasher hospital. He also pledged to address the provision of equipment and other support to rural hospitals.

[The news report says that the illness is manifested by high fever, loss of appetite, headache, pain in the chest, diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding from the nose and mouth. There have been multiple reports of undiagnosed illness in the refugee camps in the Darfur region of Sudan in the past year, and undiagnosed hemorrhagic fevers have been reported sporadically in various parts of Sudan.

Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague. There is no information provided in the report above that suggests any specific virus, nor is it indicated that samples are being taken to permit laboratory diagnosis of the disease. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available.

Sudan is a country in the Nile Valley of North Africa. It is divided into 18 states or wilayat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). South Darfur, with an estimated population of approximately 2.89 million (2006), is one of the 5 states (Central, East, North, South, and West Darfur) that comprise the Darfur region in western Sudan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Darfur).

El Salam is a camp for displaced persons near the city of Nyala. Nyala has a population of 565 734 (2007) and is the capital of South Darfur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyala,_Sudan).
