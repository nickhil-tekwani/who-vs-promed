According to UC Davis spokesperson Pat Bailey, a horse admitted to the hospital on 1 Aug 2016 was diagnosed with equine influenza, or horse flu. The horse was taken to the hospital for an unrelated elective surgery, Bailey said. A few of the horses that had been kept near that infected horse also tested positive for influenza. UC Davis officials didn't say how many horses got sick.

All of the horses which tested positive for the flu have been put in an isolation unit that is separate from the main barns or sent home.

Dr. Pam Hullinger, a veterinarian and director of the Large Animal Clinic, said that if the hospital didn't act as fast as they did, it could have been much worse. "We were very fortunate that the hospital's routine surveillance screening and diagnostic program detected the initial case early so that appropriate measures could be implemented rapidly to limit the exposure of any additional horses," she said. Equine influenza viruses are highly contagious among horses, but they do not infect people, dogs, or other animals. According to UC Davis health officials, the virus is seasonal and is more prevalent in competitive horses and barns that are constantly transporting horses in and out of barns.

Dr. Hullinger said horse owners are advised to make sure that their horses are up-to-date on their vaccinations.

In the meantime, the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital is limiting its appointments for horses to emergencies and critical re-check appointments only, UC Davis said. They want to make sure the hospital is completely free of flu before they resume normal operations.

[The only difference between this outbreak in a veterinary hospital and a similar exposure at a racetrack or agricultural show is the speed or recognition and appropriate clinical and quarantine response. It was Davis this week. It could be you next week. So be constantly aware. - Mod.MHJ
