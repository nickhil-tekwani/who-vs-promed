Bird flu has now spread to 14 flocks in 9 North Dakota counties and infected nearly 167 000 birds, mostly in 4 commercial turkey flocks. There also have been a total of 197 confirmed cases of avian influenza in nearly a dozen different types of wild birds in more than 20 counties, including Burleigh.

The bird flu outbreak in the United States has resulted in the slaughter of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in numerous states, according to The Associated Press. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms to try to limit the spread of the virus. This year's [2022] outbreak is the worst since 2015, when about 50 million chickens and turkeys were killed.

North Dakota's 1st case this year was identified [29 Mar 2022] in a backyard mixed species flock in Kidder County. Since then, there have been confirmed cases in backyard bird flocks in Richland, LaMoure, Barnes, Sheridan, Cass, Dickey, Renville and Stutsman Counties, with Stutsman having 2 confirmed cases. There also have been cases in 4 commercial turkey flocks: 2 in LaMoure County and one each in Dickey and Richland Counties, according to the state Agriculture Department.

The department is not identifying the owners or specific locations of the infected flocks, citing North Dakota law that allows the State Board of Animal Health to keep such information private. Data from the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shows a total of 450 birds have been killed in the backyard flocks, along with 166 500 in the commercial flocks. "No infected birds or meat will enter the food chain," North Dakota Turkey Federation vice president David Rude said. "Poultry is safe to eat."

There are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing about 1 million birds annually, according to the Agriculture Department. Producers have implemented biosecurity measures on their farms to try to stem the spread of the virus, according to Rude. "It won't devastate the industry, but for the producers involved it is devastating -- for their loss of production for this year [2022], with no income for these flocks," the Tolna producer said. "We are still on heightened alert to continue to keep our birds safe." That includes working with wildlife officials to try to keep migratory birds away. Bird flu can spread in various ways, including through wild birds.

"Waterfowl may carry and shed this virus without any signs, while birds like domestic poultry and raptors get severe illness and rapidly die," said Dr Gerald Stokka, North Dakota State University (NDSU) Extension veterinarian and livestock stewardship specialist. "Currently, little is known about the risk of transmission and illness in songbirds." Federal data show confirmed wild bird cases throughout North Dakota. The bulk of the cases have been in snow geese and Ross's geese, but there also have been documented cases in other species including bald eagles, sandhill cranes, turkey vultures, owls, hawks, crows, Canada geese, a duck and a common goldeneye.

"It is expected that the potential for transmission and new cases will decline following migration," said Miranda Meehan, NDSU Extension livestock environmental stewardship specialist. "Unfortunately, the (recent) winter weather we are experiencing is slowing down migration and causing migratory birds to remain in the state longer."

The federal Agriculture Department has confirmed nearly 1000 cases of bird flu in wild birds around the country, including more than 50 bald eagles -- 4 of which were confirmed in North Dakota. The national wild bird death total is nearly 10 times higher than the 99 confirmed cases in wild birds during the last outbreak in 2015, according to AP.

With an increasing number of wild birds testing positive for bird flu, homeowners and landowners should be aware of what steps to take if they see sick or dead wild birds, according to Stokka. "The primary carriers of avian influenza A are waterfowl, gulls, terns and shorebirds," he said. "People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Wild birds can be infected without showing signs of the infection."

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes the public health risk from the bird flu outbreak is low, but the agency still advises avoiding direct contact with sick or dead birds. They can be reported at https://gf.nd.gov/wildlife/diseases/mortality-report. Questions can be directed to the agency's telephone number.

North Dakota's Board of Animal Health last month [April 2022] canceled all shows, public sales, swaps and exhibitions of poultry and other birds within the state as a prevention measure, at the request of the Turkey Federation. The order applies to events or sales where birds from different locations would be co-mingled. Private sales, catalog sales and retail sales are still allowed, though the use of online marketplaces is encouraged.

The board issued a similar edict in 2015, when the state had 2 cases of bird flu, in Dickey and LaMoure Counties, affecting more than 100 00 birds.

[2] Washington (Clallam County): back yard flock

Six backyard flocks infected with avian flu, more under investigation
----------------------------------------------------------------
Two more detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, this time in Clallam County, make it 6 affected flocks in Washington state. With a half-dozen cases since the first confirmed detection less than a week ago, biosecurity has never been more important for bird owners. State veterinarians are urging flock owners to be hyper-vigilant in ensuring there is no farm-to-farm transfer of the virus from infected flocks and eliminate exposure of domestic flocks to wild birds as much as possible.

"With so many suspicious cases in domestic flocks and wild birds pending investigation, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to avoid exposing your flock to wild waterfowl, shorebirds, and other domestic flocks," Dr Amber Itle, state veterinarian, said.

The 2 most recent cases of HPAI were in non-commercial backyard flocks in Clallam County and confirmed yesterday afternoon [11 May 2022]. Flock owners contacted the Washington State Department of Agriculture's (WSDA) sick bird hotline to report an unusual number of sudden deaths in their flocks as well as other sick birds. The 2 are unrelated flocks, with 1 flock of a dozen geese and the other of 10 chickens. The state veterinarian quarantined both premises and the birds having not already succumbed to the virus will be euthanized. Both flocks reported their birds had direct contact with wild waterfowl.

Itle says one step flock owners should continue to take is preventing contact between their flocks and wild birds by eliminating access to ponds or standing water on your property and keeping different domestic species like ducks and geese penned separately from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, and peacocks. Flock owners should also limit access to their farms, not lend or share farm tools or equipment, and not share or sell eggs from backyard flocks. While eating cooked eggs does not pose a health risk, transferring eggs off-farm could also transfer the virus. "Now is the time to be extra disciplined, even if it seems extreme. If flock owners could remain diligent for just a few weeks until the waterfowl complete their migration north, we should be able to get through the worst of it with lower impact," Dr Itle said.

There is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detected. As always, the meat from both wild game birds and domestic poultry should be properly cooked.

Report unusual, multiple deaths or illness among domestic birds to the WSDA Avian Health Program. Report dead or sick wild birds using the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife's online reporting tool.

Since [5 May 2022] when the 1st case of avian influenza was announced in Washington, 6 counties have had infected domestic or wild birds, and several other suspect cases are being investigated. "Avian influenza is here," Itle said. "Whether it has been confirmed in your county yet or not, you should be taking steps to protect your birds and prevent the spread of this virus which could wipe out your flock. With statewide detections from Pierce to Pacific and to Spokane counties, we can assume where ever there is wild waterfowl, there is avian influenza."

Avian influenza can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic birds through direct contact, fecal contamination, transmission through the air, environmental contamination, and shared water sources. The virus can also be spread from farm to farm. Both wild and domestic waterfowl can be infected with the virus and not show signs of disease.

Reducing or eliminating contact between wild birds and domestic flocks and practicing good biosecurity is the best way to protect domestic birds from this disease. Bird owners should bring their flocks inside or undercover to protect them from wild waterfowl.

Bird flu found in flocks in 2 more Wisconsin counties
-----------------------------------------------------
Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been found in domestic flocks in 2 more Wisconsin counties, the state's Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) announced on Monday [16 May 2022]. The latest confirmed cases were in Dunn and Marinette Counties. A total of 13 counties have now reported at least 1 positive case in a domestic flock since mid-March [2022] when Wisconsin's 1st case since 2015 was reported in Jefferson County.

Both of the latest cases happened in backyard flocks, DATCP said. Birds in both flocks will be depopulated to keep the virus from spreading. The state's Department of Health Services said there is "no imminent threat" to the state. Poultry is safe to eat if cooked to a temperature of 165 degrees [F, 74 deg C] the agency said.

Avian flu found in another Pennsylvania flock in Berks County
------------------------------------------------------------
Avian flu has been found in another Pennsylvania flock. The latest positive is in Berks County at a commercial table egg layer facility. Those chickens lay the eggs you buy at the grocery store. So far, 6 flocks in Berks County and 8 in Lancaster County have tested positive for avian flu.

More than 4.2 million birds have been destroyed since avian flu was first discovered in Pennsylvania in April [2022].

If you suspect live poultry are infected, you are asked to report it to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Service. The line is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Signs of avian flu in poultry include a lack of energy and appetite.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza confirmed in Monmouth County poultry flock
----------------------------------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) have confirmed the state's first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) case in a Monmouth County non-commercial backyard poultry flock. The disease response is being coordinated between state and federal partners, according to a press release on [18 May 2022] from the NJDA [New Jersey Department of Agriculture].

The test samples were collected from a duck and chicken flock in Monmouth County and were tested at the New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory. The duck flock had experienced high mortality and some displayed neurologic signs before succumbing to the disease. Congruent testing was completed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, which confirmed the detection of the disease on [17 May 2022], according to the press release.

State and federal personnel are following the appropriate response plan, including implementing site quarantine, proper biosecurity measures and depopulation of poultry on the premises. Outreach to poultry owners, live bird markets and the general public at <www.nj.gov/agriculture> has been completed to provide recommendations on poultry management and measures to ensure the maintenance of a healthy flock, according to the press release.

Signs of HPAI in poultry can include sudden death; decrease in feed or water consumption; respiratory signs such as coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge; swelling around the eyes; open-mouth breathing; darkening of the comb/wattles; reddening of the shanks or feet; decreased egg production; and lethargy.

HPAI spreads through contact with bodily secretions, including feces, ocular, nasal or oral secretions from infected birds. The virus can spread on vehicles, equipment, shoes, etc. Practicing good biosecurity can help prevent the spread of HPAI onto a farm.

Those biosecurity practices include:
• eliminating exposure of domestic birds to wild birds. Minimize standing water and extra feed in the environment that might attract wild birds;
• avoiding contact with other poultry;
• keeping a specific set of shoes and clothing for tending to poultry. Disposable boot covers or a foot bath that is changed regularly are other measures that can be used;
• minimizing the number of people who visit the birds;
• avoiding sharing equipment with other flocks and using appropriate disinfectants for equipment which must come onto a farm.

HPAI is a reportable disease. Any individual who gains knowledge or suspects the existence of the disease must notify the NJDA. Deceased birds suspected of having avian influenza should be double-bagged and stored appropriately for testing. Do not expose dead poultry to the environment, other poultry, or wildlife/wild birds. Wash your hands after handling sick or dead birds.

Anyone who suspects HPAI is asked to alert the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Division of Animal Health.

[Parts of North America are still experiencing the northerly migration of wild birds. Consequently, this outbreak is still raging.

Guard your birds from other birds, and limit the foot and vehicle traffic onto your premises. Check to be sure drivers and other individuals coming onto your property have not been around other known sick birds. Disinfect tires, shoes, and change coveralls, and perhaps wear a face mask when entering a bird facility. Do not let your birds have access to wild birds. While many wild birds especially migrating birds may not show clinical signs, they may still be carrying the virus and able to transmit it to your birds. Keep the birds inside and away from other birds.

While it may be trite: Practice extreme caution and strict biosecurity. - Mod.TG]
