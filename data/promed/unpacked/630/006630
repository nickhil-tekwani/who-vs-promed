A cow in an Alpena County dairy herd has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD).

The discovery was announced Friday [22 Jun 2012] after a cow within a herd of 50-99 cattle was found to have the bacterial disease through routine testing done by MDARD and the United States Department of Agriculture, said James Averill, MDARD animal industry division director. The herd is now under quarantine and will undergo further testing until officials are satisfied it's disease-free.

A public hearing is scheduled for 12 Jul 2012 in Alpena Community College at 7 p.m., Averill said. Rick Smith, who oversees the TB program, will answer questions and talk about what's ahead for the farm in question. He'll also discuss preliminary findings from an investigation of the source of the disease.

"It's just meant to be an informational hearing to let the general public know what's happening, and let them know where we are in the process," he said.

Averill said the testing had nothing to do with 3 deer shot in Presque Isle County in 2011, adding the herd was "quite a distance away" from where the deer were taken.

"The (dairy) herd was identified through routine whole-herd testing that we do in that part of the state on an annual basis," he said.

Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, and Oscoda counties fall within a modified accredited zone, a USDA designation that sets rules for cattle movement, identification and testing, according to MDARD.

This is the 2nd time the farm has found a TB-positive cow within its herd, Averill said. The previous time was more than 5 years ago. Since then, the farm has adopted a plan to eradicate the disease within its herd. Farmers also have taken steps to keep wildlife from spreading the disease to its herd, as TB can be carried by whitetail deer and other animals.

While the farm has complied with its wildlife risk mitigation plan, these steps can only reduce -- but not eliminate -- the risk of wildlife spreading the disease to its cattle, Averill said.

Next week, personnel from several departments and the Michigan State University Extension will come to the farm to search for the source of the investigation, Averill said. They'll talk to the farmers and check to see if wildlife have been living in close proximity to the herd. This will include trapping raccoons and opossums on the farm. These animals serve as carriers of the disease, but are unlikely to spread it to cattle. "Some of that information will be shared during the 12 Jul 2012 meeting," Averill said.

The team will continue to gather data through the month.

Cattle sold to [trace-ins] and from [trace-outs] the farm also will be checked to ensure TB neither originated from, nor spread to, another farm, Averill said.

A total of 54 herds have been found to be TB-positive since testing began in 1998, 2 of which were found this year [2012], Averill said. The latest herd is now going through a test-and-remove process, during which the herd goes through a series of tests every 60 days. If any new cattle are discovered to have TB, they'll be pulled from the milking line, euthanized, and necropsied.

Tests will continue "until there's been a 95 percent confidence there's no disease in the herd, and they'll do another test 6 months after that," he said. "Then they'll be released from quarantine."

An alternative would be to depopulate the herd and humanely kill each animal, Averill said. It's not uncommon for dairy farmers to opt for the test-and-remove process instead.

The dairy farm still can sell milk during the quarantine, although federal rules prevent the sale of any milk from a cow found to be infected, Averill said. Any bacteria in the milk would be killed by pasteurization.

[The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). This bacterium is in the same family with bacteria that cause Johnes disease and leprosy. Adult cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.

Since the bacterium is usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows, the most common clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.

When calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the most common lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.

Other species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical signs. _Mycobacterium avium_, causing infection by ingestion and lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.

Live, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.

Nationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.

Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.

Science has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.
