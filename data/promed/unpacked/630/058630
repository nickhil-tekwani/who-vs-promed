This year [2018] the state has recorded 17 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases so far with 5 cases in Muzaffarpur, 4 in Sitamarhi, 3 in Patna, and one each in Bhojpur, Lakhisarai, Gaya, Sheohar, and Nalanda districts.

State epidemiologist Dr Ragini Mishra reportedly said, "We are keeping a close watch on the situation. It has been observed that JE cases registers a sharp increase by the last week of August [2018]. Like every year, we have issued certain guidelines for civil surgeons, government hospitals and district administrations to combat the spread of the 3 diseases [JE, dengue and chikungunya]."

According to the Wire report, a new study led by a team of researchers and scientists of the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC) has identified proteins that facilitate entry of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus inside the brain cells. Japanese encephalitis infection happens when viral attachment proteins interact with cellular membrane proteins of host cells.

However, the doctors of Bihar state said that _Aedes_ mosquito is the main vector which is responsible for dengue and JE.

Dr Mishra also reportedly said, "Community participation is very important for preventing the spread of dengue and JE. Stagnant water is a breeding ground or mosquitoes. People should not allow water to accumulate in pots and other containers."

[JE virus is endemic in north eastern India, including Bihar state and cases occur every year. The last statement above about _Aedes_ being the main vector of JE virus is incorrect. _Culex_ genus mosquitoes are the JE vectors. It is not stated above if the 17 JE cases are laboratory confirmed. Frequently, encephalitis cases are attributed to JE virus infections and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology. However, AES is not mentioned in the above report, nor is there mention of JE vaccination status of the 17 cases or of vaccination campaigns in the state.

Vaccination is more effective at preventing JE cases than fogging of residences or environmental spraying. The _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JE virus breed in extensive wetlands, including rice paddies. These mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive. Long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticide-treated bed nets may also reduce numbers of JE virus vector mosquitoes in houses.
