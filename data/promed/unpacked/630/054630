There has been a large outbreak of dengue in Timor over the past 4 months.
It came to our attention because of the large number of cases seen in
volunteers, aid workers, visitors and armed forces personnel. At present we
have diagnosed about 150 cases seen in Darwin and in Western Australia,
though many more will have been identified in other states or through the
armed services laboratories. Also there are likely to have been many cases
who were not tested.
Unfortunately the Western Australian cases have included a death due to
dengue shock syndrome in a Timorese woman. It certainly emphasised that you
cannot be complacent about this infection, even in modern health care
settings.
In terms of the diagnostics, we had been working on our flavivirus PCRs and
this provided an ideal opportunity to evaluate the dengue PCR. We chose the
Fort Collins method (Lanciotti RS, Callisher CH, Gubler DJ, Chang G-J,
Vorndam AV. Rapid detection and typing of dengue viruses from clinical
samples by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. J Clin
Microbiol 1992; 30: 545-551) for detection and typing and we have now
tested about 60 serum samples from Timor and elsewhere, with 41 positives.
At the moment we have only compared this with HI and indirect
immunofluorescence for IgM. The serological results indicated that Timor
was largely dengue 2 and dengue 3, but with occasional dengue 4 and dengue
1. The PCR has also shown dengue 2 and 3 predominant, as well as some
dengue 4, but the serologically dengue 1 cases known to be from Timor have
turned out to be other types by PCR. Culture is still pending for most
samples, but previously dengue 2 has been isolated from cases by the
Arbovirus Research and Surveillance Laboratory at the University of Western
Australia, and in the PathCentre laboratory.
The PCR also proved useful in identifying dengue in postmortem tissue, and
in a case of clinical dengue without any detectable IgM. It has also
provided a type in cases with IgM responses to multiple serotypes, and was
positive in early samples that were IgM negative. Obviously this is still
being evaluated and the data is 'provisional', but is in keeping with that
reported in the literature. It has certainly helped in deciding that there
are 3 dengue serotypes causing infection in Timor.
