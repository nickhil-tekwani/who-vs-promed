A mountain town in the eastern part of the province [Nueva Vizcaya]
has been under a state of calamity, especially in one of its
extremely remote villages as a result of last week's outbreak of
typhoid fever with more than 100 residents already affected with the
illness.

Dr Edwin Galapon, PHO officer-in-charge said that last Monday's [28
Jan 2008] move of the Kasibu municipal council to place the far-flung
mountain village in a state of calamity was intended to enable it to
utilize its 20 percent calamity fund for the further prevention of
similar occurrences to take place.

Last week, 50 of the 103 residents reported to have been affected
with typhoid fever in the area were confined at the Kasibu district
hospital and the Nueva Vizcaya provincial hospital in nearby Bambang
town for treatment.

Typhoid claimed a life and landed 3 people in hospital in the
Northern Division at the weekend [2-3 Feb 2008]. On Friday night [1
Feb 2008], 3 of the villagers from Nailou, in the district of
Tunuloa, Cakaudrove, were evacuated to Savusavu Hospital, while one
person is believed to have died in the village last week.

The incident has prompted a warning from interim minister for health,
Dr Jiko Luveni, who called on people to boil all drinking water and
practice safe and good hygiene to avoid getting typhoid. She said it
was important for people to take heed of advice from the ministry,
especially after Cyclone Gene.

Commissioner Northern Inia Seruiratu yesterday [4 Feb 2008] said
records obtained from their Cakaudrove office confirmed the deceased
was a 33-year-old woman. Of the 3 who were admitted to hospital, 2
are a father and his 6-year-old daughter. The 3rd person is a
12-year-old girl.
