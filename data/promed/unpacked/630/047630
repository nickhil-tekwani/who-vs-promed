Wyoming state veterinarian, Dr Jim Logan, has been notified by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory there is another new case of brucellosis in a cattle herd in Wyoming -- this time in Sublette county, which is in the Wyoming Brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area (DSA). Serologic testing at both laboratories has shown reactor level results on 2 animals from 1 herd. Further testing, including bacterial culture, will be conducted to confirm serology results.

Logan, and assistant state veterinarian, Dr Thach Winslow, are working with the owner of the infected cattle and are conducting an epidemiologic investigation. The herd with known _Brucella_-positive animals is under quarantine at this time. No sexually-intact cattle can be moved from the quarantined premises until conditions of the quarantine release are met. There are 4 contact herds associated with this case which will be required to have their herds tested. The herd owners have already been notified.

This case is not related to the case found in early October [2018] in Park county or the case found in Teton county earlier this month [November]. There is no epidemiologic link between any of these cases but it is expected that infected elk are the source of all 3.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause cattle, elk, and bison to abort their pregnancies, typically late-term. All of Wyoming's brucellosis cases since 1988 have been determined to have been caused by transmission from infected wildlife to cattle or domestic bison. For more information contact the Wyoming Livestock Board field office at 307-857-4140.

[Most ranchers believe that wildlife is responsible for this disease in their cattle, while most wildlife individuals believe that cattle are responsible for bringing the disease to wildlife. Either way, in a perfect world, treatment for both wildlife and domestic animals would be considered quite the advancement over test and slaughter.

While this is a difficult situation for the rancher, as he is not able to move some cattle to market, it is also part of the risk of being a rancher in this area. Unfortunately, this has been the case for the last many years (a decade or more?).

We wish the workers of the Livestock Board and the State Veterinarian's office great success in bringing this situation to a speedy close. - Mod.TG
