Kompas.com [news agency] confirms that rabies virus has now claimed
108 victims in Bali. A 55-year-old man from Bangli died at the Sanglah
General Hospital shortly after presenting with the clinical symptoms
of rabies. "The victim was experiencing seizures, difficulties in
swallowing, and phobias to both water and light," explained Dr. Ken
Wirasandhi of the rabies control team at the hospital. The man died
only 2 hours after his admission to the hospital on Tue 7 Dec 2010.

Dr. Wirasandhi confirmed that the man in fact had been bitten by a
dog. However, before the dog could be isolated and observed to see
whether it succumbed to rabies, the animal died after being
accidentally struck by a car. Unfortunately, the dead animal's carcass
was not tested for rabies, and the victim of the attack neglected to
obtain anti-rabies serum [and presumably prophylactic vaccination].

Since the initial confirmation of rabies in Bali in late 2008, the
number of deaths attributed to the disease now stands at 108.

[The number of human cases of rabies continues to rise, and the
provision of rabies prophylaxis remains inadequate. The precise number
of rabies fatalities in Bali remains uncertain. In the previous
ProMED-mail report in this thread, Merritt Clifton reported that,
according to the Malay Peninsula Standard on 24 Nov 2010: "The death
toll for 'suspected' rabies is now 106 people, 46 of whom were rabies
positive based on laboratory test results." Every recent media report
places the total number of deaths as upward of 100, and as many as 130
deaths are now possible. Merritt Clifton himself has provided in
previous ProMED-mail reports details of 79 rabies victims by age,
residence and date of death.

What is certain is that rabies remains a concern for both the local
inhabitants and travellers intending to visit the island of Bali.
