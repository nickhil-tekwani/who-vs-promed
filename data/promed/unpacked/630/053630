INFECTION CONTROL - ECUADOR
===========================
Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 15:45:22 -0400
From: "DOUCE, RICHARD" <rdouce@HCJB.COM.EC>

I am the chairman of the infection control committee in our small
hospital here in Quito, Ecuador. Up into January I did not want to
report any data because I was convinced that we weren't doing the Kirby
Bauer correctly (at least the discs were bad). We should have some
data available by June. I agree that we should talk more about human
infectious diseases and have an interest in what is going on regarding
TB control in hospitals in the States. About 80% of our hospital
personnel is PPD positive, 50% have PPD's greater than 20mm. Primary
INH resistance runs around 13%. We have several candidates for "strain
W".
