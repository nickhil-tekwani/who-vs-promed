It has been reported that there is an outbreak of cholera in Yealie Boyah, Kambia town, and some other parts of the district. It was reported that over 15 people died within the past 3 days including women and children due to mainly the lack of toilets, water facilities, and limited drugs in the health centres.

A boat captain who plied that routine disclosed to this reporter that toilets and protected water wells are only available at the Community Health Centre and the Church of God of Prophecy Primary School, Yealie Boyah. He reiterated that several people had died during the past weeks due to limited drugs and people execrate in the open or on the sea because the township is an island and the water wells are not chlorinated and protected.

This reporter spoke with several people from Yealie Boyah and its environs who disclosed that several of the cholera cases were referred to Lungi and the families depend on hammock as there is no ambulance to convey patients.

The Department of Health (DOH) on Tue 19 Jun 2012, declared a cholera outbreak in Catanduanes due to the alarming rise of cases of the disease in the province from 1 Jan 2012 to 13 Jun 2012. DOH Undersecretary Ted Herbosa said that at least 8 people out of the 1370 total cases have reportedly died in the province. He said that a total of 748 with 6 deaths have been recorded in Virac town.

DOH Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said a team from the department's central office in Manila has been dispatched to Catanduanes to assist the local health personnel.

Health Secretary Enrique Ona, meanwhile, said one cause of cholera outbreak in the area is drinking of water from the rivers contaminated with cholera bacteria. "They drink water from the river and that's dangerous," Ona said.

The spread of cholera can also be prevented by boiling of water before drinking, proper hand washing and by avoiding contaminated foods.
