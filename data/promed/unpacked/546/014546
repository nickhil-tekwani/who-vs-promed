A sexually transmitted disease that was all but wiped out in Alaska just a few years ago is back, and the state is calling it an outbreak. Now, concern is also on the rise about what may be fueling this alarming increase in syphilis cases.

Officials are linking the dramatic increase to apps that make it easier than ever to hook up. Health officials believe the ease of access to anonymous, no-strings-attached sex between men that apps like Tinder, Grindr, and GROWLr provide is fueling an alarming trend. "They're having sex with individuals they don't know and they're acquiring syphilis," said Alaska HIV and STD program manager Susan Jones. "And we also have an uptick in the HIV cases."

The number of syphilis cases in Anchorage rose 60 percent recently; from 20 cases in 2012 to 32 cases in 2013, according to the Department of Health and Social Services. So far this year [2014], 22 syphilis cases -- all men -- have been reported in Alaska.

Some in the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] community say social media isn't to blame, and what this STD trend boils down to is personal responsibility or a lack thereof. "I don't think it's the apps, we're all human," said RJ Haywood, promotions manager at Mad Myrna's [bar and gay entertainment complex]. "We're going to hook up one way or another." Haywood believes the problem lies in a lack of education and a lack of healthy fear in younger gay men that didn't live through the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 90s. "Their entire generation was devastated," said Haywood, referring to how AIDS impacted the gay community in the 80s. "It's not so much a death sentence anymore. Now you've got these kids that have never seen the true horror of what it can actually be, so syphilis isn't their biggest fear."

Health officials are urging those engaging in high-risk sexual behavior to take personal responsibility and protect themselves and their partners. But Haywood said far too often, people opt to learn that lesson hard way. "One time there was a group of military boys that I was hanging out with and they all got genital warts and after that they were really good about wrapping it up," he said. "It takes a good scare but it also takes education within the community."

Mad Myrna's has been serving the Anchorage LGBT community since the early 90s. Managers there said they've taken it upon themselves to offer free condoms to customers and to invite organizations in to do free HIV testing for customers.

State health officials say they're alarmed by increased numbers of syphilis and gonorrhea cases in Oregon. The Salem Statesman Journal reports that Oregon Health Authority figures show that early syphilis cases are at their highest levels since 1989.

The agency says gonorrhea cases jumped 18 percent from 2012 to 2013.

Dr Sean Schafer, a medical epidemiologist with the authority, says the numbers are reminiscent of those from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Oregon's syphilis rate, at 10 per 100 000 people, is almost twice that of the national rate, 5.3 cases per 100 000.

[The following is extracted from the moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (07): rising incidence, predominantly MSM 20140514.2470763:

After reaching a historic low incidence rate in the United States in 2000, primary and secondary syphilis rates have since rebounded. These increases are occurring mainly among young men, and is associated in particular with men who have sex with men (MSM), as has been reported in many parts of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below). In the 35 reporting areas in the US that reported the sex of sex partners for 70 percent or more of male cases, the proportion of male primary and secondary syphilis cases attributed to MSM increased from 77.0 percent (6366) in 2009 to 83.9 percent (8701) in 2012 (1).

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. - Mod.ML
