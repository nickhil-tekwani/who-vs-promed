Lassa fever in Netherlands -(import from) Sierra Leone
------------------------------------------------------
Lassa Fever has been diagnosed in a surgeon working in Sierra Leone (not in
Freetown), while visiting his relatives in the Netherlands. While in Sierra
Leone on July 11 a bout of fever was diagnosed as malaria (on the basis of a
blood smear). The patient was treated with artemisine. On July 14 the
surgeon arrived in the Netherlands for a short leave He still had fever,
but no cough; a thick smear was negative. On July 15 he was admitted to
hospital. On July 16 he exhibited fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, but no cough.
By July 20 clinical deterioration was apparent and intravenous ribavirin
treatment was begun. On July 22 the results of a PCR test from a blood
sample taken on July 19 became available. The test was performed by
Bernhard Nocht of the Institut fur Tropenmedicin (Prof. Dr. H. Schmitz) and
revealed 10_to the power 7 Lassa fever virus RNA molecules/ml. An antibody
test, using the Lassa fever virus, Josiah strain (the strain prevalent in
Sierra Leone), was negative. By July 24 the condition of the patient was
poor with multiple organ failure, and the patient was transferred to
intensive are.
Contacts were traced by the Municipal Health Service and asked to take and
report body temperature twice daily for three weeks. The patient has been in
isolation since July 17, and staff at risk are reporting body temperature
twice daily. Other hospital staff are being kept informed. The airline
company is tracing passengers who were seated close to the patient on the
flight from Sierra Leone on July 13. Cabin attendants are reporting body
temperature twice daily. WHO has been informed.
