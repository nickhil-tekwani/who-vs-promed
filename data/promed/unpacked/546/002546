New Disease Hits UK Pigs Saved From Foot-And-Mouth
--------------------------------------------------
A new deadly disease is stalking Britain's pigs, threatening the lives of
animals which just months ago escaped slaughter during a foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) epidemic and classical swine fever (CSF) outbreak,
veterinarians said. The disease, called PMWS [Post-weaning Multisystemic
Wasting Syndrome, which takes 2 forms, has spread across 40 percent of the
England's pig herd and is expected to kill thousands more animals in what
vets said could be "the final blow" for dispirited farmers.
"I think the whole pig population is at risk," Roger Harvey, a pig
specialist from Britain's most densely populated pig area in eastern
England said.
Coming at what officials hope is the end of a devastating FMD epidemic
and just months after Britain fought CSF, the new disease has hit hard an
industry reeling from the effects of low prices and a strong pound.
Almost 250 000 pigs were slaughtered so far to combat CSF and FMD, and
experts say another 300 000 could die from the new disease --
Post-weaning Multi-systematic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS).
Harvey said spread of the disease, which can cause sudden death in pigs
or leave them listless and gaunt, had already reached epidemic
proportions and had no known cure. It was closely linked with another
disease, Porcine Dermatitis Nephropathy Syndrome.
"These diseases are spreading fairly steadily throughout Britain," he
said, adding they were first uncovered in Britain about 2 years ago but
were contained in 1 area. In recent months, they have spread north.
Producers have already lost 21 million pounds this year due to increased
mortality and feeding costs to get surviving pigs back up to a marketable
weight.
With most cases lasting for around 2 years, the epidemic is set to
continue, Harvey said.
"The virus is a very resistant virus, so you are going to get it spreading
on lorries. And probably locally, it will spread on the wind," he said.
Some said birds could play in role in spreading the disease.
"Clinicians in England are now generally of the opinion that birds are
likely to be a significant vector of PMWS," said Andrew Gresham,
Veterinary Laboratories Agency, adding the group had carried out a large
case study to aid further research.
Vets agreed more research was needed to find a way to treat the illness,
which thrives on dirty or mismanaged farms, but that would not help
farmers in the short-term.
"The main methods we are using to control it are good hygiene and good
husbandry. It's all about management. There is no magic drug to give
them," Harvey said. "It's another pressure after FMD and CSF."

Official Warns New Deadly Pig Disease Could Spread
--------------------------------------------------
A new deadly pig disease could spread from Europe as far as Asia and Latin
America and countries should be extremely cautious over imports, an animal
health officer with the United Nations food body said.
Peter Roeder, animal health officer who oversees viral diseases for the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said the risk of Post-weaning
Multi-systematic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) could grow.
"The disease could spread to areas having intensive pig production
systems, such as the Far East and Latin America," Roeder told Reuters.
"Countries should be extremely careful about bringing into the country
pigs from any source, and they should conduct risk assessment," he
added.
Roeder urged countries to ensure their animal health professionals were
aware of the disease.
He said the disease, associated with the Circo 2 virus, was already
present in continental Europe and can be spread by contact between
animals, such as the transport of pigs around the world for breeding
stock.
