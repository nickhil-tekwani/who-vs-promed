A 34 year old farmer from Sindhuwadi village in Tirthahalli taluk tested positive for KFD on Sat 4 Apr 2020. He was suffering from high fever and fatigue. Both patients have been admitted to the Government JC hospital in Tirthahalli for treatment.

Residents in the villages located within a radius of 5-km around Gundugadde and Sindhuwadi are being vaccinated against the disease. Officials of the Department of Health and Family Welfare have conducted meetings in both villages, cautioning people against venturing into the forest to collect firewood and grazing cattle to avoid coming into contact with the ticks that spread the disease from monkeys to humans.

With this, the total number of positive cases in Shivamogga district since [1 Jan 2020] has risen to 129, including 105 cases from Tirthahalli taluk and 24 cases from Sagar taluk. As many as 4 persons have succumbed to the disease here during this period.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was 1st identified in 1957, after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka state, India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html.

As per the above media report, 4 deaths and 129 cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) have been reported in Shimoga district of Karnataka state so far in 2020. There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to cover exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites.

Shimoga district, officially known as Shivamogga district, is a district in Karnataka state of India https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoga_district. - Mod.GS
