Flu cases are spiking in Central Florida and across the state, and doctors say they are seeing them in numbers they typically don't see until January. In the past week, 250 confirmed cases have been reported at Centra Care urgent care's 21 locations. That is double from just a week ago.

"Normally, we don't see flu ramp up at this rate until about January, so we are a couple of months early," Centra Care's Dr. Tim Hendrix said. Most people who have been diagnosed with the flu did not previously receive a flu shot, Hendrix said. After flu symptoms develop -- fever, body aches, sometimes a cough -- it will be too late for the vaccine. However, doctors urge those people to take Tamiflu, which will cut down on the life span of the flu [virus].

Pharmacist Bharat Sharma preaches the importance of a flu shot to his customers, but he didn't think his 2-year-old daughter would be a victim. "She has a runny nose a little bit, a little fever, 99.7 F. So I know she's getting there." Sharma said he's going to wait another day or 2 before taking her to see a doctor. He's confident she'll need Tamiflu soon.

[Is this another early warning of an impending outbreak of influenza virus infection in the northern hemisphere following the similar report from Georgia a week ago? The most recent World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Update concluded that there was no evidence of this as yet: see ProMED-mail post: Influenza (106): WHO update 20121123.1422001. Unfortunately, neither report has been backed up with precise diagnostic data. The WHO and ECDC weekly updates continue to report only limited influenza virus activity globally. More precise diagnostic information is awaited from these 2 southern states.
