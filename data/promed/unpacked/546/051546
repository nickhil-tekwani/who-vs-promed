Update: Unexplained Deaths Following Knee Surgery -- Minnesota
-----------------------------------------------
Since 13 Nov 2001, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), in
collaboration with CDC, has been conducting an investigation of 3 patients
who died unexpectedly within one week following knee surgery (1). Patient 1
had received a knee osteochondral allograft, and patients 2 and 3 had
undergone total knee replacement surgery. Epidemiologic and microbiologic
investigations have not linked the deaths of the 3 patients.

Blood cultures obtained from patient 1 before his death grew a clostridial
species that was identified subsequently at MDH and CDC as _Clostridium
sordellii_ by biochemical and molecular typing. Blood cultures from
patients 2 and 3 did not yield growth of any bacteria. Molecular and
special studies have not identified any _Clostridium_ species in autopsy
tissues from patients 2 and 3, and the cause of death in these patients
remains unexplained. On the basis of investigative findings, MDH lifted a
moratorium on elective knee surgery on 25 Nov 2001.

As of 4 Dec 2001, neither surveillance in Minnesota by MDH nor enhanced
case finding by CDC outside of Minnesota and follow-up of reports to CDC
have identified any additional cases of _C. sordellii_ infection associated
with severe hemodynamic collapse or death in patients recently undergoing
knee or large joint surgery. Because infection associated with contaminated
graft tissue is a known but uncommon complication of allograft surgery (2),
MDH, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration have initiated an
investigation to determine whether the osteochondral allograft might have
been the source for the _C. sordellii_ found in patient 1. Nonimplanted
knee tissue from the same donor source as the allograft used in patient 1
was obtained by CDC from the same tissue bank. Preliminary cultures of this
tissue have yielded growth of _Clostridium_ species; biochemical and
molecular testing to identify the species is under way. Reports of other
allograft recipients infected with clostridial species have been received
at CDC and are being investigated.

Clinicians should consider possible clostridial infection in patients with
evidence of infection following allograft implantation. Clinical evaluation
should include looking for symptoms and signs of sepsis, including fever,
hemodynamic compromise, and/or abdominal pain. In some patients, only local
symptoms (e.g., knee pain) may be present during the early course of
infection. Diagnostic evaluation should include 2 sets of blood cultures
for both aerobes and anaerobes; these cultures should be incubated for 7
days. If appropriate, other specimens (e.g., knee aspirate or tissue)
should be obtained and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. If
appropriate, health-care providers should consider expanding empiric
therapy to include anaerobic coverage. Consultation with an infectious
disease physician might be helpful.

Health-care providers should report cases of clostridial infection
following allograft implantation to their state health department or CDC's
Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, telephone 800-893-0485.

[The article in reference 2 above (Septic arthritis following anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction using tendon allografts. MMWR

This article presents and discusses 4 patients with postsurgical septic
arthritis considered as probably associated with contaminated
bone-tendon-bone allografts used for anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction that occurred in Florida and Louisiana in 2000. The report
concluded: "This report underscores the need for 1) standard practices for
screening, disinfecting, sterilizing, or discarding potentially
contaminated allografts; 2) mechanisms for certification and oversight of
tissue banks and adherence to quality standards; 3) a system for reporting
and investigating infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) potentially
transmitted through human tissues; and 4) the development of safe and
effective sterilization methods for musculoskeletal tissue. When septic
arthritis occurs after use of an allograft, allograft contamination should
be suspected, especially when the infection is polymicrobial or associated
with Gram-negative organisms."

The absence of identification of _C. sordellii_ from 2 of the patients does
not rule out the possibility of allograft contamination prior to
implantation for the patient in whom _C. sordellii_ was identified as the
cause of death. We await results of the additional studies underway. -
