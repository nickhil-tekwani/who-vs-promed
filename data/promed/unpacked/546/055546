North Coast Seafood has voluntarily removed from sale Fresh Tuna
Steaks that were sold at Shaw's, Star Market and Big Y Stores in New
England.

The recalled product was sold between 20 thru 24 Jun 2009 to retail
stores throughout New England and was removed from sale on 24 Jun
2009. The product was recalled because of possible elevated levels of
histamine that may result in symptoms that generally appear within
minutes to an hour after eating the affected fish. The following are
the most common symptoms of scombroid poisoning. However, each
individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
tingling or burning sensation in the mouth, rash on the face and upper
body, hives and itching of skin, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. There
have been 3 reported incidents by consumers.

North Coast Seafood feels that while these were isolated incidents,
every precautionary measure should be taken when it comes to consumer
safety. This recall does not impact any other fish or seafood sold by
Northcoast. Customers who purchased this tuna and may have frozen it,
are urged to bring the product back to the store for a full refund or
replacement.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of
accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced
and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally
occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held
at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F / 21.1 to 32.2
deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures
(over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately
after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish
poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and
mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and
are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish
(such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also
have been implicated.

It should be noted that those taking isoniazid (INH) might have more
significant reactions because of the drug's histaminase inhibition in
the GI tract. See: Miki M, Ishiwara T, Okayamai H. An outbreak of
histamine poisoning after ingestion of the ground saury paste in 8
patients taking isoniazid in tuberculous ward. Internal Medicine 2005;
44: 1133-6 (available at
