Four prairie dogs found dead on the Pawnee National Grasslands north east of
Greeley have tested positive for plague, according to the Weld County
Department of Public Health and Environment.
To date, 43 positive cases of plague in animals have been documented in
Colorado. No human cases have been reported in 2006 in Colorado.
"Plague is most commonly found in the prairie dog populations in the
grassland areas of Weld County. People need to take precautions from being
bitten by fleas when walking out in the grasslands," said Sara Evans,
environmental health manager at the Weld County Department of Public Health
and Environment.
Evans suggests that people:
- use insect repellent particularly on the lower legs and ankles
- treat pets for fleas
- avoid any contact with rodents
Cats are of particular concern because they can become severely ill and
transmit the disease directly to humans. Cats infected with plague will look
extremely ill, run a high fever, become lethargic, and may have swelling
around the face and neck or abscesses draining blood and pus. Any cat with
these signs should be isolated from other animals and people and examined by
a veterinarian immediately, Evans said. [see moderator's comment below]
Plague is a highly infectious bacterial disease maintained by various types
of wild rodents and is transmitted primarily by flea bite. Although human
cases don't occur often, the illness can be severe and even
life-threatening. Plague is easily treated with antibiotics when recognized
early.
Three Coloradans contracted plague in 2004 and one person died. In 2005
there were also 3 human cases of plague.
Symptoms of plague in humans can begin 2 to 6 days after infection and
include sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and
vomiting. With bubonic plague, individuals may develop a large swollen,
painful lymph node called a bubo in the area of the flea bite, usually the
groin or the armpit.
For more information, call Environment Health Division at the Weld County
Department of Public Health and Environment at 304-6415 or the Colorado
Emergency Line for the Public (CoHelp) at (877) 462-2911.

[Cats are not always apparently ill. This is especially true early in the
course of the disease. Since cats naturally spend considerable time
sleeping, some owners may not be aware that their cat is more lethargic than
normal. The buboes or abscesses may be swollen and sensitive to the touch.
They may be found prior to rupturing and draining, but one should be careful
when examining these swellings. They may easily rupture, thus releasing the
plague organism, _Yersinia pestis_. Any swelling on your pet is reason for
concern, and a veterinarian should be consulted. - Mod.TG]
