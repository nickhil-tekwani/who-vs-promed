Pig classes at this year's [2019] Tockwith Show have been cancelled after an outbreak of swine dysentery nearby.

Organisers said it was a tough decision but there would still be plenty of animals and attractions to keep visitors entertained at the show on 4 Aug 2019.

Show secretary Steve Ross said: "The committee has been working hard for months and are confident that this year's Tockwith Show will, as always,
offer a great value day out for the whole family.

"We were disappointed to have to cancel the pig classes this year; the decision was not taken lightly and was reached after careful consideration for the wellbeing of the pig breeding community, and with the agreement of our senior steward Georgina Watson.

"Nevertheless, visitors will have much to entertain them. The show field is looking great, the weather has improved lately, and now we can't wait for it all to begin!"

[The justifiable decision to cancel the inclusion of pigs in the (74th) Tockwith Show, was based on the information about an outbreak of swine dysentery at an open air pig farm very close to the show ground. It likely addressed the risk of bringing the pathogen back to their farms of origin.

Swine dysentery (SD; also known as "bloody scours") is a mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease of pigs that affects the large intestine. Its essential causal agent is _Brachyspira hyodysenteriae_, an anaerobic spirochete that produces a hemolysin, although other organisms may contribute to the severity of lesions. It is endemic in many pig rearing countries, where control is limited by the lack of effective vaccines and by the emergence of _B. hyodysenteriae_ strains with reduced susceptibility to common antibiotics.

SD is not included in OIE's international list of notifiable diseases.

Further information is available at http://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/intestinal-diseases-in-pigs/swine-dysentery. A comprehensive review is available in ref. 1.

The Tockwith Show (Harrogate district of North Yorkshire) is a 1 day agricultural themed event held on the 1st Sunday in August every year in Tockwith (https://www.tockwithshow.org.uk/).
