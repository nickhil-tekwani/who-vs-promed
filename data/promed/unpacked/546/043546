Health Minister Dr. Hisham Inamullah Khan has said that government is making efforts on war footing for prevention of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the province and a special cell has been set up to cope with the outbreak of the skin disease.

According to a handout issued here [Peshawar] on Wednesday [13 Feb 2019], so far 21 258 cases of leishmaniasis have been reported throughout the province, including 19 072 from tribal districts.

In his message, Dr. Hisham said that there was no need to worry about that type of disease, as it was curable. He said that government would ensure that each patient suffering from leishmaniasis was given proper treatment besides taking practical measures for prevention of the disease in the affected areas.

The minister said that WHO also provided 9500 vials of injections for treatment of the patients. He said that special centres were established at sentinel sites where patients were being treated under the guidelines of WHO in the affected districts.

[This statement from the Minister of Health, Dr. Hisham Inamullah Khan, provides an official estimate of the number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the tribal areas. Cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions on the face often result in life-long scars, and treatment has side effects. Prevention is based on control of the vector, the sandfly, and the reservoir, small rodents. Treatment of individual cases will not reduce the transmission and the burden of disease. - Mod.EP
