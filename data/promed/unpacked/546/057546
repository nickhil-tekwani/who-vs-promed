A 58-year-old man from Nacogdoches, who was infected by a bacterium
while swimming off Galveston County's Crystal Beach, still faces the
threat of losing a leg, and possibly his life, despite 3 surgeries.
The man has necrotizing fasciitis [often called the flesh-eating
disease and may be caused by a number of bacteria - Mod.LL] caused by
a bacterium called _Vibrio vulnificus_. The retired oil company
marketing consultant also is suffering from multiple organ failure
because the disease has caused a blood infection, his physician said
Tue 17 Jul 2007.
The bacterium thrives in warm salt water and is most prevalent during
summer months. The man's wife said she and her husband routinely
vacation in Galveston each summer.
Swimmers with compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients or
people with liver disease [and diabetes - Mod.LL], are most
susceptible to more severe disease. To be contracted through
contaminated water, the bacteria need a point of entry, such as an
open wound.
The patient, who is diabetic, had an ulcer on his lower leg that he
believed was nearly healed when he went swimming during a fishing
trip on 8 Jul 2007, his wife said. His leg became infected 3 days
later and he began running a high fever.
Doctors quickly diagnosed the problem. Diseases caused by _Vibrio
vulnificus_ are rare, but most cases occur along the Gulf Coast,
according to the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention).
The bacterium also can infect people who eat contaminated seafood and
causes nearly all seafood-related deaths in the USA, the agency says.
While everyone who eats seafood should be aware of the risk of
infection, healthy swimmers don't need to worry, said Dr. Robert
Atmar, a professor at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine who
specializes in infectious diseases.
"I wouldn't alter (swimming) activities based on this, if you're
otherwise healthy," he said. "People who have chronic illnesses like
diabetes or on steroids or have cancer or chronic liver disease, if
they have open wounds or sores, shouldn't go wading in the Gulf during
the summer."
The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 54 cases of
_Vibrio vulnificus_ infection in 2006. At least 16 were caused by
water contact.

The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html>:
_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative,
opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and
associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish
(oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors
responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and
in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of
dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water and
acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not
imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.
Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with
sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body
on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.
The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals
with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The
organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals,
the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock,
rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70
percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions
