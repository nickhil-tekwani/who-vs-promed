An outbreak of foot & mouth disease in flocks in Ramallah district
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of FMD has been discovered in 2 small-ruminant [sheep and
goats - Mod.AS] flocks in the vicinity of the villages Ein-Yebrud and
Deir-Dabwan, near Ramallah. From samples sent to the Veterinary
Institute at Beit-Dagan by the Director of the Veterinary Services of
the Palestinian Authority, FMD virus of the serotype O was isolated.
In the 2 flocks, which have not been vaccinated this year, 40 out of
the 200 animals were found sick.
"There is no danger to the public", Dr Oded Nir, the director of
veterinary services in the [Israeli] ministry of agriculture has told
Walla!news. "This is one of the diseases not infecting humans, thus
there is no direct nor indirect danger. The only possible danger is
to cattle, small ruminants and pigs". Dr Nir reassured that meat and
dairy products can safely be consumed.
According to Dr Nir, FMD is an economic disease which affects
agriculture and not public health: "The State of Israel vaccinates
constantly against the disease, different to the UK policy; this is
why we are generally not concerned. In addition, the relevant virus
strain is a local one against which the cattle have been vaccinated.
The Palestinian Authority has not carried out vaccinations this year,
and this may explain the infection in the 2 sheep flocks".
