So far this year [2010], Guerrero has reported 9000 cases of
conjunctivitis due to changes in temperature and rainfall, said the
director of the State Institute of Ophthalmology, Pablo Vargas
Mendez. He said the Costa Grande region is highest in cases of
conjunctivitis, as there have been 450 cases per month of patients
with this disease. He said that 50 percent of cases are found in
Acapulco, with the rest in the region of the Costa Grande, Chica and
the center of the state.

He explained that although it is a disease that does not have serious
implications, nevertheless people should take measures to prevent
transmission to others. He also recommended avoiding touching the eye
area with unwashed hands, and, if infected with the disease, avoiding
shaking hands. He asked people who suffer from the disease to not
self-medicate or use home remedies, because they can generate a
stronger infection.

Vargas Mendez commented that the disease goes away after 5 days; "if
the pain continues after this time, the patient will have to go to an
ophthalmologist who will prescribe a lubricant as well, " he
explained.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer (conjunctiva)
that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the
eye. Inflammation can cause blood vessels in the eye to become
larger. And that can make the white of the eye look pink or red.
Thus, conjunctivitis is often called "pink eye" or "red eye."
Conjunctivitis is a common health condition worldwide. In Mexico,
conjunctivitis is an eye infection common in coastal areas due to the
high temperatures and humidity. An outbreak in the coastal state of
Collima was reported at the beginning of September 2010 (see:
Conjunctivitis - Mexico: (CA) 20100903.3155).

The 3 most common types of conjunctivitis are 1) viral, 2) bacterial,
and 3) allergic. Viral conjunctivitis can be caused by a number of
different viruses, many of which are associated with an upper
respiratory tract infection, cold, or sore throat. Adenoviruses and
picornaviruses are the most common etiologic agents. Viral
conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Most viruses that cause
conjunctivitis are spread through direct hand-to-eye contact by hands
that are contaminated with the infectious virus. Viral conjunctivitis
is typically mild, with symptoms being worst on days 3-5 of
infection. The condition usually clears up in 7-14 days without
treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually begins in one eye and is
typically mild, lasting as few as 2-3 days. Further information can
be obtained at: <http://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/index.html>.

It is presumed that the outbreaks of conjunctivitis in the coastal
states of Colima and Guerrero are consequences of viral infection,
but this is not clearly stated in either report. A map of the Mexican
state of Guerrero, showing the location of Acapulco, can be accessed
