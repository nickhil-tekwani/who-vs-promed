New malaria cases in Mumbai related to building site
----------------------------------------------------
After 10 resident medics were diagnosed with a
deadly strain of malaria, a resident doctors'
association sent a strong letter to BMC [Bombay
(now Mumbai) Municipal Corporation] and dean
blaming developer for dirty project sites. Ten
resident doctors from KEM [King Edward Memorial]
hospital are not only battling a deadly strain of
malaria, they are also locked in a battle with
construction giant Indiabulls [a major Indian
company/corporation] over unmonitored
construction debris which may have turned into a
breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Nearly 3 months after the city emerged from a
long spell of malaria epidemic, several doctors
from KEM hospital were diagnosed with falciparum
malaria last week and are undergoing treatment. 3
of them have been shifted to the intensive care
unit after their condition deteriorated.

"Initially, I mistook it to be viral fever and
popped paracetamol. Eventually, my condition
worsened and my colleague got me admitted," said
a 26 year old 2nd year resident doctor from the
orthopaedics department who tested positive for
falciparum malaria on 17 Dec 2010, has been
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
(MICU). He is presently being tended to by his
parents who rushed from Pune after being informed of his hospitalisation.

Both the falciparum and vivex strain of malaria
mosquitoes breed in clear water during the
monsoons and doctors at the KEM are blaming the
construction activity around the hospital campus for the untimely outbreak.

In a strongly worded letter -- in possession with
his newspaper -- to the KEM dean and municipal
commissioner, the association of resident doctors
has blamed construction giant Indiabulls for the
accumulating debris which has become a veritable
breeding ground for malarial mosquitoes.

Indiabulls however maintained that the company
complies with all BMC guidelines. "We have a very
proactive pest control. Several companies have
been operating from the same building and no one
including any labour working on the site has
fallen ill due to this in the last few years,"
said an official spokesperson citing the several
awards the building has won for the "thorough
checks, systems and procedures" adopted by the company.

The resident doctors however are not impressed.
"There are 3 major construction projects going on
around our hostel," said Dr Pankaj Nalawade,
general secretary, KEM, Maharashtra Associations
of Resident Doctors (MARD). "Not only are doctors
falling prey to malaria, there are others
suffering from pollution related diseases. Water
in our tanks is also contaminated because of this," he alleged.

He blamed the builders for not taking enough care
to stop the sites from turning into disease
spots. "Workers are supposed to pour anti-larvae
oil over puddles to prevent breeding but nobody
does it. Every month at least 5 doctors from KEM
hostel are falling ill," he said.

[There have been several reports of malaria in
Mumbai in 2010, and it seems that malaria has
been reintroduced in Mumbai and transmission is
established from a local reservoir in the city.
Of note, according to the world malaria report
2009 map of malaria in India, the state
Maharastra, is classified as low risk with less
than or equal to one case per 1000 inhabitants per year. - Mod.EP]
