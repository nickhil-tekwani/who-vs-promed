[The yellow fever (YF) outbreak peaked in weeks 48-51 of 2018. Numbers of confirmed cases fell abruptly on 1 Jan 2019, and confirmed cases have remained a low level to date but suspected cases have continued between weeks 1 and 6. The ongoing mass vaccination campaign in affected states in 2019 has reached or exceeded 90% in 5 cases and nearly so in Plateau state. That coverage has undoubtedly contributed to the decline in case numbers, and its continuation is prudent, as YF virus will not disappear from the country. - Mod.TY
