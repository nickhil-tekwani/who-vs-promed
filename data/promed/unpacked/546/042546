DH confirms new cases of cholera
----------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) on 1 Sep 2003 and 5 Sep 2003 called on
members of the public to be on guard against food-borne infections
following the confirmation of cholera cases in Hong Kong.
One case involved a 19-year-old female who suffered from diarrhea and mild
abdominal pain on 23 Aug 2003. She sought medical treatment in Tseung Kwan
O Hospital on the following day. Her stool specimen yielded positive
result for cholera and the strain type was identified as Ogawa. She is now
in Princess Margaret Hospital in stable condition. The patient's home
contacts were asymptomatic. Her home in Tseung Kwan O was disinfected by
the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD).
The second case involved a 25-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea on 21
Aug 2003. He sought medical treatment at a government clinic on 26 Aug. His
stool specimen yielded positive result for cholera. He is also now in
Princess Margaret Hospital in stable condition. The patient's home contacts
were asymptomatic. His home in North Point was also disinfected by the Food
and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD).
Neither patient had traveled outside Hong Kong during the incubation
period, and both cases were classified as local. DH and FEHD are
investigating the source of the infections.
These are the 5th and 6th cholera cases in Hong Kong so far in 2003, and
all the cases are local ones. In 2002, there were 4 cholera cases, of which
2 were imported.

Cholera in Liberia - Update 5
------------------------------
On the basis of the assessment team's visit and analysis of the data (see
previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_08_25/en/>), WHO has now reported a
cumulative number of 6353 cases since the beginning of the outbreak in
Monrovia in June 2003 until 17 Aug 2003. Systematic reporting of deaths
from cholera has not been undertaken in health centers. WHO has put an
emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap.
The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 Jul 2003. The weekly average
decreased by end July or early August 2003, although the worsening security
situation prevented cholera patients from attending health care facilities.
Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of
registered cases has been rapidly increasing. According to figures
collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727
registered cases during 4-10 Aug 2003 and 1203 cases during 11-17 Aug 2003.
More people are now returning to their homes or to refugee camps outside
Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading from central
Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighboring districts.
There are approximately 230 000 people in internally displaced persons
camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is
poor, and safe water is scarce, with only 2 liters per day per person
available. In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit
cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners,
has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The
chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun, and the process will
be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished.
Nutrition screening carried out by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
found that 40 percent of the children screened are suffering from acute
malnutrition, which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases. Medecins
sans Frontieres France and Belgium and MERLIN have opened cholera treatment
centers near the most affected areas.
The Cholera Coordination Committee has been reactivated to ensure the
effectiveness of the efforts of partners (Ministry of Health, WHO, NGOs)
operating in Liberia during this post-war phase. In particular, NGOs have
been encouraged to better inform the population on cholera preventive measures.
