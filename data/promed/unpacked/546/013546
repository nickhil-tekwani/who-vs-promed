Michigan livestock and pet owners are being urged to vaccinate their
animals against rabies after a horse in Lapeer County tested positive
for the disease.

"It is essential pet and livestock owners take steps to vaccinate
against rabies and other diseases because of the possibility [of]
human exposure to the disease from interaction with infected horses,
cattle, dogs, and cats," said Michigan Department of Agriculture State
Veterinarian Steven Halstead, DVM. "By working with their
veterinarian, owners can take significant steps toward providing a
safe and healthy environment for their families and animals."

Quarantine was issued on the Lapeer County horse farm and will be
monitored by county animal control officers. Feral cats and any pet
cat on the premises showing clinical signs consistent with rabies or
with a history of biting someone within the previous 10 days will be
tested. [In order for the animal to be tested, it must be euthanized
and its brain examined. - Mod.TG] A total of 6 people, including the
owner, trainer, and veterinarian, that might have been exposed to the
rabid horse are receiving a series of preventative rabies shots. No
other humans or animals are known to have been exposed at this time.
[Post exposure prophylaxis is needed for human beings having been
exposed to a rabid animal . - Mod.TG]

This is the 3rd case of rabies in Michigan thus far in 2010 --
previous cases include a rabid skunk in St Clair County and a bat in
Kent County.

"It is important to make sure animals attending fairs or exhibitions,
field trials, or shows receive additional vaccinations to protect
against diseases they may be exposed to in group housing or stressful
situations. Owners should consult their private veterinarian to
develop an appropriate vaccination program specific for their
animals," Halstead said.

State law requires ferrets and dogs to be vaccinated against rabies by
a licensed veterinarian. It is also important to make sure that cats
kept indoors also be vaccinated as bats frequently get into homes
exposing the cats.

[Especially for livestock that may be going to a fair, rabies vaccines
are important. Horses and cattle, and even porcines that are going to
a livestock show or rodeo or any other type of gathering should have
their rabies vaccination in addition to other communicable disease
vaccinations deemed necessary by the owner and veterinarian.

Cats and dogs should also be vaccinated against rabies.

If Dr Halstead knows the strain of rabies that the horse had, we would
appreciate being able to post the strain. Bat and skunk are the most
common in many areas of the US, but raccoon strain may be more common
in other areas. So it would be nice to know the strain that affected
this horse. - Mod.TG]
