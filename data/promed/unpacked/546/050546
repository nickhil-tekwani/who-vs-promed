Livestock farmers in Lyantonde district have appealed to the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries to combat an outbreak of a strange disease in cattle.

Dr. Ronald Bameka, the district veterinary ofﬁcer, said the rare strain has killed more than 300 head of cattle. According to Bameka, the disease was ﬁrst reported in April [2020] when several farmers lost cattle.

The areas where it was prevalent at the time are Kaliiro village, Lyantonde town council, and the sub-counties of Mpumudde, Lyakajula, Kansagama, and Kinuuka.

Bameka said the disease has symptoms similar to black quarter disease, an acute and infectious disease. He said an animal suffering from black quarter disease presents with inﬂammation in the rumen, as well as the skeletal muscles. He added that when the disease advances, the infection blocks blood ﬂow in the veins and, eventually, kills the animal within 24 to 48 hours from its onset.

Although the disease is suspected to come from contaminated pasture, Bameka said they are still carrying out studies to establish its actual cause. Bameka said the disease can easily be contained through vaccination of animals of 6 months and older, annually.

He added that livestock farmers are also advised to burn the top layer of the soil, in addition to sprinkling lime over a carcass at burial. He warned that people he called bad-hearted butchers, who usually buy the sick cows, slaughter them and sell the meat to unsuspecting members of the public.

"The disease is transmissible and can lead to death in both human beings and animals, just like the Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever. Therefore, the livestock farmers and meat consumers should be cautious, to avoid contracting it," he said [but see comment].

In September 2018, Rift Valley fever broke out in Kitazigolokwa village (Katovu parish) and Mityekula village (Kasagama), killing at least 11 people in 2 months and leaving dozens admitted in health centres. [Six of those who died] were believed to have consumed meat from infected cows, sheep or goats.

[Black quarter, also called blackleg, is an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_, characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. _C. chauvoei_ occurs naturally in the intestinal tract of animals; contaminated pasture appears to be a source of organisms, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.

Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without premonitory signs. Acute, severe lameness and marked depression are common. Initially, there is a fever, but by the time clinical signs are obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At first, the swelling is small, hot, and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges, there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes cold and insensitive with decreased blood supply to affected areas. General signs include prostration and tremors. Death occurs within 12-48 hours. In some cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and the diaphragm.

Prevalent worldwide and (in contrast with the information in the media report) not a zoonosis, blackleg is not an OIE-listed disease. Most cases occur in cattle from 6 months to 2 years old; vaccination, if performed according to the prescribed regime, is safe and reliable.

Additional information on the disease is available at https://www.msdvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/clostridial-diseases/blackleg.

In the absence of reported detailed clinical signs, pathological changes and until laboratory results become available, the information presented in the above media report leaves room for other bacterial (e.g., anthrax) and viral etiologies to be considered. In view of past history of cattle diseases in the region, Rift Valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne zoonotic viral disease that is known to occur in Eastern Africa for decades, deserves to be included in the differential diagnosis. RVF is known to occur in livestock (sheep, cattle, goats, camels) following periods of excessive rains. The rainfall in northwestern Uganda during September 2020 significantly exceeded (2-4-fold) the normal rainfall for this month (see 30-day rainfall map, eastern Africa, at https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/international/africa_arc/africa_arc_30day_ea_pnorm.gif).
