A cheetah at a zoo in Nuremberg has died after contracting an illness
similar to mad cow disease, becoming the 1st confirmed case in
Germany of so called feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), city
authorities said Thursday [6 Sep 2007].
Lulu, a female cheetah born in 1998, had suffered for 6 weeks from
problems that included trouble balancing and weakness in her hind
legs, the Nuremberg city government said in a statement.
The animal eventually was euthanized. Tests by Bavarian and federal
labs were positive for FSE, the statement said.
It was unclear how and when Lulu became infected with the disease,
which has a several-year incubation period, but Nuremberg authorities
said it likely happened in the Netherlands, where she was born [see
commentary below].
Lulu moved to Germany at the age of 15 months, returned to the
Netherlands 5 years later and arrived at the Nuremberg zoo in March 2006.
Thursday's [6 Sep 2007] statement said that no FSE cases had been
detected at the 2 previous zoos in which she lived.

[FSE was initially identified by the Bristol Veterinary School in
1990. As a matter of fact, it was the 1st indication that BSE is
capable of crossing the species barrier. Since then, about 100 cases
have been registered in domestic cats, most of them in the UK. This
problem has been addressed by measures preventing the inclusion of
BSE-suspected material in commercial cat food. Sporadic cases in
captive wild _felidae_ exposed to BSE infection when fed in zoos with
infected bovine offal, and manifesting clinical FSE after the lengthy
incubation period, have been registered in several countries.
For further background on FSE, which is essentially BSE in _felidae_,
subscribers are referred to the commentary in post 20030824.2132.
Both the Netherlands and Germany were infected by BSE during the
years 1998-1999. It is probable that the exposure of the cheetah to
BSE took place during its 1st year, in the Netherlands.
The following statistics have been derived from DEFRA's page on
Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy, last modified 6 Sep 2007 (see at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/statistics/incidence.html>):
A total of 22 cases of spongiform encephalopathy have been confirmed
in exotic _felidae_, the last one in 2007, as follows:
Asian Leopard cat: 3 cases (1995 - 1999)
Cheetah: 5 cases (1992 - 1998)
Lions: 5 cases (1998 - 2007)
Ocelot: 3 cases (1994 - 1999)
Puma: 3 cases (1992 - 1995)
Tiger: 3 cases (1995 - 1999).
Cases of FSE may still be expected in adult _felidae_ brought up in
BSE-infected countries during their young age. - Mod.AS]
