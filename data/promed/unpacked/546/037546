The [following] text is from an abstract submitted and accepted for
presentation at the Annual meeting of the Israeli Microbiological Society.
The work was done by R. Handsher(1), E. Mendelson(1), E. Anis(2), B.
Abramovitz(1), I. Silberstein(1), M. Neuman(1) and L. Shulman(1) at (1) the

Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashome and (2) The Department of

ASEPTIC MENINGITIS DUE TO ECHOVIRUS TYPE 4 IN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY IN 1997

An outbreak of aseptic meningitis, due to Echo 4 occurred in Israel and the
Palestinian Authority between April and October 1997. Echo 4 has not been
isolated in Israel since 1980. Specimens were sent from all parts of Israel
and from Gaza and Hebron. 145 isolates (61% of all isolates) were
identified as Echo 4 by neutralization with specific antibodies and/or by
immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. However, WHO standard
antibody pools failed to identify the isolates. 13.4% of the isolates were
other enteroviruses and the remaining 25.6% are still untyped. 11% of the
Echo 4 isolates were from infants (<1yr); 15% from 1-4 yr old; 54% from
school age children (5-17 yrs); and 20% from adults. 64.2% were from males
and 35.8% were from females. Molecular analysis was performed by sequencing
of a 435 bp fragment from the 5' non-coding region which was amplified by
RT-PCR using common primers. The sequences of 25 of 28 isolates from all
geographical regions and throughout the time course of the outbreak were
related (>95% homology). The remaining 3 isolates were <95% homologous to
these and to each other. Interestingly, the sequence of the 5' non coding
region of the Echo 4 isolates was more closely related to a previously
published Echo 6 sequence rather than Echo 4 sequence. Our data suggest
that the virus was apparently a new variant of Echo 4, a fact which
facilitated its massive circulation in the community.
