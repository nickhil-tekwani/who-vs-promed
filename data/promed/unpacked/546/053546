There were no immediate answers yesterday [5 Mar 2008] about what
could have made 8 family members on a flight to Canada from the
Caribbean so sick that the plane had to make an unscheduled landing
in Florida. The 8 on Montreal-based Air Transat's Flight 477 from the
Dominican Republic to Edmonton began sweating, trembling and
hyper-ventilating after takeoff, one of their relatives told The
Canadian Press.

A male family member said the family was about to leave when one
young woman started getting sick at the hotel and became increasingly
ill as they all waited in the airport. Her symptoms spread, seemingly
through touch, after the plane had taken off. "Whatever sickness they
had, as soon as someone touched them, and caressed them, cuddled
them, or comforted them, they got sick as well, within 20 minutes,
half an hour."

The plane was diverted to Fort Lauderdale late Tuesday [4 Mar 2008],
and the 8 were transferred to hospital. They included the man's
14-year-old nephew, the only one who had complained of stomach
problems, and one of his daughters, a paramedic who had been treating
the others. All were released by the time the flight finally resumed
and landed in Edmonton around 8:30 a.m. yesterday [5 Mar 2008].

The families had all eaten at the same place Tuesday [4 Mar 2008]
afternoon. But the man said not everyone who ate at the restaurant
got sick, and although some of the young adults had been drinking
alcohol, his brother-in-law who doesn't drink was also ill. "He spent
more time in contact with his son who got sick, and then his wife as
well, and his other son. They got sick as well."

Greg Meyer, an airport spokesperson in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said
officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control interviewed
everyone on board and determined the sick passengers were not
suffering from any airborne illness.

The man said he had not yet heard from his family in Florida and
wasn't sure what doctors had told them. He couldn't offer any
explanation, but speculated that perhaps drugs were involved. "We
only guess that maybe something got slipped in a drink."

Jim Rudolph, a spokesperson at the Edmonton International Airport,
said there were no further illnesses reported on the flight once it
resumed. Capital Health cleared the plane once it landed in the
Alberta capital. Passengers said they had been told originally that
the aircraft would have to be decontaminated upon arrival, but that
was cancelled once officials knew the sick people had been released
from hospital.

The plane sat quarantined on the hot runway at the Florida airport
for about 6 hours while the remaining 245 passengers and 9 crew were
cleared by disease control officials. "We weren't allowed off at
all," said Dave Gordon, who was traveling with his wife and
2-year-old daughter.

People grew increasingly uncomfortable as the wait in Florida wore
on, said Gordon. He said there was some confusion but no panic as the
sick passengers were being treated before the plane landed in
Florida. "They all kind of got chauffeured up to the front of the
plane while we were still in flight. ... People were trying to see
what was going on." He said the only moments of panic came when
special equipment was brought out. Gordon said it was 14 hours from
the time everyone got on the flight in the Dominican Republic to the
time it landed in Edmonton.

[The news story is somewhat confusing, but apparently 8 members of a
large family who were traveling together became ill on a return
flight to Canada from the Dominican Republic. Illness in the index
case started at their hotel after the family had all eaten lunch at
the same restaurant, apparently just before departing for the
airport. The illness then spread to other family members within a
short time once aboard the plane. The food items eaten at the
restaurant are not specified. Some, but not all, had alcoholic
drinks. The illness involved both adults and children and men and
women, although the exact breakdown by age and sex is not given. The
symptoms were sweating, trembling and hyperventilation; GI symptoms
developed in only one patient. The presence of fever in ill family
members is not mentioned. The other 245 passengers and 9 crew aboard
the plane remained well, and the 8 involved family members were soon
well enough to be released from the Florida hospital.

The relatively sudden onset of symptoms suggests a common source
exposure with a relatively short incubation period. Exposure to a
toxin either aerosolized or ingested in a common food exposure is
possible, but most of the involved family members did not complain of
what would be expected respiratory (other than hyperventilation) or
GI symptoms.

Another explanation is mass psychogenic (sociogenic) illness, which
is said to be characterized by symptoms that suggest organic illness
but have no identifiable environmental cause with little clinical or
laboratory evidence of disease. A typical complaint is
hyperventilation. Mass psychogenic illness typically affects groups
under stress and females disproportionately more than males. Symptoms
often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case.
They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be
aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently
resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from
the environment in which the outbreak began (Jones TF, Am Fam
Physician. 2000 Dec 15;62 (12):2649-53). However, the distinction
between mass psychogenic illness and mass intoxication may be
difficult.

From a prior ProMED posting, Undiagnosed illness - Bangladesh (02):
mass hysteria 20070720.2327:

"In a prior ProMED-mail posting from 2002, when there was a
multistate outbreak of rash illness (see Unexplained rash illness -
USA (multistate) (06) 20020605.4409), a reporter in a New York Times
article, Margaret Talbot, had the following background material:
"Well-documented outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness do occur.
Between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass hysteria in
medical journals; most took place in self-contained communities, like
schools, barracks, and factories. Symptoms spread by "line of sight"
-- people get sick as they see other people getting sick -- which is
quite different from what happens with a viral illness. Adolescents
and preadolescents are particularly susceptible, and girls are more
likely to fall ill than boys. Girls' heightened susceptibility to
mass psychogenic illness need not be seen as due to their more
"hysterical" nature, but to their propensity to talk among themselves
about their health. Additionally, women are more likely to seek
medical attention, and presumably, therefore, to take note of their
own symptoms, than men.

One does wonder whether now that the Internet age has arrived
worldwide, there was increased communication among the school
attendees (both students and teachers) that resulted in the "line of
contact" being further facilitated by the Internet (a query 1st
proposed by Mod.JW in his discussion accompanying the outbreak in
2002)."
