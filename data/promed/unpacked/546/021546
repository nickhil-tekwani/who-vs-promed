A woman, KK, told the outlet that she was bitten in an apartment complex parking garage last [Thu 13 Jul 2017] night off Memorial Drive [near Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park]. She said the bat bite felt like tiny needles.

The bat was later trapped by firefighters at the scene and was tested for rabies. A day later she was contacted and told that the bat did in fact carry the disease. Now KK is undergoing a series of rather expensive rabies treatments, which according to her have been in excess of USD 4000. Without insurance it is a costly burden to bear.

As locals know one of the largest collections of Mexican Free-tail bats in the city reside under the Waugh Street bridge. It is a nightly highlight at dusk to watch the flying creatures roaming about for a feast of [mosquitoes]. It is a popular tourist attraction, although not for the faint of heart or those scared of bats.

Today comes a reminder that here in Houston for all of our modern conveniences us Houstonians are still sharing the city with wildlife, some which can hurt you.

[I watched those bats a number of times come out at dusk from roosting in the girders under that bridge and in their thousands before they head out into the surrounding countryside. Mexican Free-tails are common in Texas. I have seen them roosting under overpasses on the I-10 and other freeways. Many years ago I collected a couple of dozen from the ceiling space of an old slave quarter in the New Orleans French Quarter; some were rabies infected. And children in Texas have it driven into their heads to never, but never, pick up a bat. Wise advice. And these infected bats are why it is wise to have your cats and dogs vaccinated; sick bats fascinate them. - Mod.MHJ]

[Sanofi offers a patient assistance program for un- and under-insured patients that meet eligibility criteria to help ensure they get HRIG and/or rabies vaccines following exposure events. For more information on the program view the CDC's information page (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/programs.html). Instructions and request forms can also be found at either of these locations: http://www.sanofipatientconnection.com/ or https://www.rxhope.com/PAP/info/PAPInfo.aspx. - Mod.JH
