Last Thursday [27 Jan 2000], a pig farmer of Selangor's Batu Satu died of
Nipah [virus infection]. The fatality once again highlighted the plight of
the pig farmers and their families. For about 200 people who had tested
positive for the Nipah virus, news of the death was a bad omen. There is
much confusion surrounding this disclosure, and the 200 are still unclear
about the implications of testing positive.
"We are not sure whether we are carriers of the actual virus or simply its
antibodies," said Lay Yong Tee, Chairperson of the Negeri Sembilan Nipah
Virus Committee (NSNVC). A medical lecturer from a university told
malaysiakini that "there is no evidence yet to conclude or seclude
[exclude] whether they are carriers, but a positive reaction to the Nipah
virus does not mean they are sick, it simply means that they have been
infected."

{"Testing positive" undoubtedly indicates having antibody. This is good,
not bad. Whether people can have antibody and be persistently infected is
another, unlikely, story. What is significant about this news story is that
the recent human infection indicates persistence of the virus in Malaysia,
possibly in persistently infected animals, such as pigs. I wonder whether
pig retroviruses could bring about an acquired immunodeficiency state, such
that pigs could be persistently infected with
Nipah and other viruses. In any case, the virus has not been eradicated
from Malaysia and red flags should be going up all over the place. - Mod. CHC]
