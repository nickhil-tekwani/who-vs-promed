A Dundee farmer is suing the KwaZulu-Natal Conservation Service (KZNCS) for
R3.8 million after more than 200 of his cattle died of the fatal bovine
"corridor disease".
Gert Ehlers acquired 5 buffalo sold by the conservation body at an
international game auction last year, but says the animals infected his
cattle and ruined his cattle farming operation.
KZNCS sold 22 buffalo for between R90,000 and R100,000 each at the auction,
and now faces 2 further law suits of about R10 million for losses relating
to 13 other buffalo.
Five of the buffalo were bought by a Pretoria businessman for a
buffalo-breeding project.
Meanwhile, upon the advice of KZN veterinary services, Ehlers has had to
remove all his cattle from the farm for 18 months. "But gamefarming is only
a sideline. I cannot survive from that alone and I need to continue
farming," explains Ehlers.
He and the businessman are now facing ruin.
