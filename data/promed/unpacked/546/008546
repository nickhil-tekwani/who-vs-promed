On 27 Mar 2006, a cluster of cases of _C.
difficile_ associated disease (CDAD) in a
hospital in northern France (hospital A) was
notified to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire
(InVS) through the national healthcare-associated
infection notification system (1).
From 24 Jan to 9 Apr 2006, 33 patients in
hospital A developed CDAD within 0 to 128 days of
admission. All cases were confirmed by toxin A/B
enzyme immunoassays; 29 patients (88 percent) had
simple diarrhea and 4 developed pseudomembranous
colitis. The male:female ratio of patients was
9:24, and the median age was 82 years (range: 37
- 95 years). Cases occurred in the following
wards in the hospital: geriatrics (n=16), 2
rehabilitation wards (n=6), one surgical ward
(n=2) and one medical ward (n=2). A total of 4
cases occurred on 4 other wards, and 3 patients
were admitted with their disease [for figure see
original URL - Mod.LL]. No patients were admitted
to the intensive care unit or had surgery for
CDAD treatment but 13 (39 percent) died within 11
to 63 days following disease onset; including 9
(27 percent) who died within 30 days. A mortality
review was conducted: CDAD was not found to be
the primary cause of these 13 deaths.
On the geriatrics ward, the CDAD cumulative
incidence rose during Jan to Mar 2006, from 14
(95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.3 - 73)
to 101 (95 percent CI: 47 - 183) CDAD cases per
1000 admissions (p=0.02). The CDAD incidence
density rate rose during the same period from 13
(95 percent CI: 0.0 - 50) to 116.3 (95 percent
CI: 53 - 205) CDAD cases per 10 000 patient-days.
The investigation included a systematic review of
patient details, disease, outcome, microbiology,
hospital admission history and known CDAD risk
factors; audits of infection control measures and
antibiotic prescribing practices; a retrospective
review of laboratory results and the
implementation of a prospective surveillance of healthcare-associated diarrhea.
Of 33 cases, 11 (33 percent) strains were
available and 5 were sent to a central laboratory
for typing. 4 of the 5 strains were similar and
characterized as toxinotype III, PCR-ribotype
027, contained the binary toxin cdtB gene, had an
18-bp deletion in tcdC gene and were resistant to
erythromycin and moxifloxacin. These are the
characteristics of the epidemic strain already
isolated from severe CDAD outbreaks in Canada,
the USA, the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands (2-5).
Control measures were implemented on 21 Mar 2006
by hospital A's infection control (IC) unit
assisted by the regional infection control
coordinating centre. Control measures were based
upon international guidelines and included
reinforcement of standard precautions and hand
hygiene (using soap and water), contact
precautions (gloves and gowns), isolation or
cohorting of case patients, environmental
cleaning (with hypochlorite) and closure of the
geriatric ward for a week (6, 7). CDAD patients,
their families and the healthcare facilities they
were transferred to were informed about the
infections. No further cases have occurred since 9 Apr 2006.
Discussion:
Transfers of patients between healthcare
facilities in northern France and Belgium are
frequent, especially between nursing homes. Two
patients were admitted from a single nursing home
in Belgium, 1 of the European countries that
experienced PCR-ribotype 027 _C. difficile_
outbreaks in 2005 (4). However, to date, no
PCR-ribotype 027 strain has been isolated from
these 2 patients and investigations conducted by
Belgian public health authorities did not
identify other cases of diarrhea in this
facility. Therefore the origin of this outbreak in hospital A remains unknown.
This is the first notified PCR-ribotype 027 _C.
difficile_ cluster in France and investigation is
still ongoing. Since the first European reports
about this epidemic strain, the InVS has ensured
the French regional infection control
coordinating centres and healthcare facilities
are informed. Recommendations for reporting,
investigation, surveillance and control of CDAD
in France have been developed, taking account of
recent discussions at the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (8).

[Although this hypertoxin-producing strain of _C.
difficile_ has caused more severe disease
including poor response to treatment, need for
surgical intervention, and increased mortality,
in this French outbreak these features were not
found. Only 4 of the 33 cases, in fact, were
diagnosed as having pseudomembranous enterocolitis. - Mod.LL]
