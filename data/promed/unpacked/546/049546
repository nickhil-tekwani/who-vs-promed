To enhance information within ProMED's AMR network, we are looking for two Moderators to join the team. Preference will be given to those applicants residing in WPRO and EMRO WHO regions.

Position Description:
The ProMED-AMR Moderator position with the International Society for Infectious Diseases' (ISID) Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) covers surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in human, animal and/or plant pathogens. The individual will join an international team of global health specialists reporting emerging diseases via innovative surveillance techniques. This individual will have a focus on antimicrobial resistance events in the WHO region in which they reside. The moderator will work closely with ProMED leadership and moderators to expand ProMED to include an emphasis on AMR reporting through nontraditional information sources, focusing on:

1) Event-based reporting of unusual resistance patterns (including outbreaks involving resistant organisms, cases of infectious diseases failing to respond to antimicrobials, or new resistance phenotypes);
2) Clinical human/veterinary reporting of drug resistant infections;
3) Reporting from the academic sector on novel / unusual resistance mechanisms.

• Both post and respond to requests for information regarding disease outbreaks in your region.
• Translate reports from regional languages into English (or other languages) as needed and/or as requested by other members of the ProMED staff.

Subscriptions and Communications:
