3 die from mystery illness in Angola
------------------------------------
3 people died from an unidentified illness Wed, 16 Mar 2005 at a hospital in
northeastern Angola, bringing the death toll from a mystery ailment there to
64 in the past 3 months, officials said.
The deaths have all been recorded at the main hospital in Uige, the capital
of a province of the same name which lies about 180 miles northeast of
Luanda, the capital, provincial health director Dr. Henrique Benji told
Catholic radio station Ecclesia.
The province lies along Angola's border with Congo. Tens of thousands of
refugees who fled Angola's 2-decade civil war have returned home from Congo
in recent months, crossing the border in Uige.
Benji described the illness as a hemorrhagic fever but said the symptoms
were not comparable to those of the deadly Ebola virus, which is found in
Congo. Dick Thompson, an official at the WHO in Geneva, said the UN health
agency has a team in Uige investigating the outbreak. The team was taking
samples but had not yet diagnosed the illness, Thompson said by phone. The
Angolan authorities also have sent samples for analysis to a laboratory in
South Africa.
Benji said the Uige hospital lacked sophisticated medical equipment, as well
as masks and gloves, to care for seriously ill patients.
The province's vice governor, Mendes Domingos, told Ecclesia that
authorities were halting the repatriation program which has been guided by
the UN refugee agency. More than 100 000 Angolans were due to return from
Congo via Uige during Mar 2005.

Re: Unknown epidemic kills 56 in Angola
---------------------------------------
56 people have died in Angola with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks. It
begins with fever symptoms for 2 days and then the patient begins to cough
up blood, falls into a coma, and dies within 4 days, he explained.
These are also the symptoms of acute-onset pneumonic plague. The recent
exodus of mine workers from the plague-affected area of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, which borders Angola on the north and east, should be
sufficient to include _Yersinia pestis_ as a differential. The 2 countries
share a major railway connection, the Kwango (Cuango) River and several
highways, facilitating movement of people and rodents between population
centres.

>From January to 15 March 2005, 39 deaths from suspected acute haemorrhagic
fever syndrome have been reported to WHO from Uige Province in northern
Angola.
A task force has been put in place at the national level and laboratory
samples have been collected for analysis. The WHO country office is
supporting the Ministry of Health. Active surveillance and retrospective
analysis are in place.
The WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has alerted members of the AFRO
rapid response network, and staff from the AFRO Inter-country Programme for
Southern Africa are planning to bring supplies of protective equipment for
the investigation and management of suspected cases.

[We await further information on the epidemiologic and laboratory studies,
as well as the age distribution of all reported cases. We do know that the
last 3 deaths have been 2 children and one adult (health care worker).
There was a newswire suggesting that the majority of cases were among
children, with 2 health care workers involved. One wonders if this might be
one of the more "common" culprits discussed in the 1st posting on this
outbreak, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever or yellow fever. Again, this is
not the 1st occurrence of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever in Angola, so the
temptation is very strong to speculate that we might be on the verge of
identifying a new or novel virus that produces a hemorrhagic fever syndrome
there.
The addition of pneumonic plague to the differential may be possible, based
on the somewhat sparse clinical descriptions of this outbreak, but the
likelihood of this being related to the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic
Republic of Congo is very low. Geographically the outbreak of pneumonic
plague in the Dem. Rep. of Congo is in the northeast of the country, whereas
the border Angola has with the Dem. Rep. of Congo is in the southwest of the
country. For those of us in North America, it is comparable to the distance
from Montreal to San Diego. - Mod.MPP]
