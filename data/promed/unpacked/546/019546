[Member of Legislative Assembly] Kulgam Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami expressed serious concern over the outbreak of disease in apple crops in Kashmir and urged the Horticulture Department to take immediate action to control the situation. Intermittent downpours have badly affected the horticulture, especially in southern parts. The outbreak of diseases like scab, alternaria in apple crops has hugely affected the apple production. The growers are now facing upheaval as the production has dwindled.

Till now the response of the Horticulture Department has been poor due to which the orchardists are in panic. Apple crop is mainstay of Horticulture sector and thousands of families are dependent on it. There is every likelihood that the production of apple will be badly hit.

Keeping in view the prevalent weather conditions, the Agriculture University authorities must advise the growers how to save their apple and other fruit crops. For the growers who suffered extensive damages due to disease, he urged the state government to disburse financial relief.

[Apple scab (also called black spot) is caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 per cent. The pathogen infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

A number of species from _Alternaria_ species complexes have been associated with diseases of apple, such as leaf blotch (_A. mali_), fruit spot, some fruit rots and (together with a range of fungi from other genera) dry core rot. Development of these diseases is generally favoured by high humidity and prolonged leaf wetness. These risk factors may be increased by common orchard practices designed to improve yields, such as high density plantings and sprinkler irrigation. Spread may occur with contaminated plant material (including crop debris), by mechanical means (including insect and human activities), wind and rain. Disease management may include cultural practices to improve air circulation and reduce humidity in the orchards, as well as phytosanitation but relies mainly on fungicide programmes.

Other species in the genus _Alternaria_ cause, for example, early blight of potato and tomato (_A. solani_); leaf blight of tea (_A. alternata_); purple blotch of onions and related crops ( _A. porri_); almond leaf spot complex (_A. alternata_, _A. arborescens_, _A. tenuissima_).
