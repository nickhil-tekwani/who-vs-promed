LISTERIA ADVISORY: AIRLINE PASSENGERS: DATE CORRECTION
***********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[see: Listeria advisory: airline passengers 990209091246]
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 08:40:00 -0800
From: Ralph Meer <rmeer@U.Arizona.EDU>

The date quoted in the message indicates that "burritos supplied to
American Airlines at the end of last year [1988]"; is this date a misprint
and it should be 1998?
[Yes, of course it should -- thanks to Ralph & others who pointed this error
out
