[Xinjiang autonomous region borders the province of Qinghai, where an
extensive outbreak in wild geese and other wild birds was eventually reported
by the Chinese authorities on 21 May 2005 (see item 3 in 20050523.1423; the
initial request for information was included in ProMED post 20050510.1278 of
10 May 2005, followed by several newswires).
Situated in Northwest China and in the center of the Eurasian continent,
Xinjiang covers 1/6 of the entire territory of China and is the biggest
province (an autonomous region). It also borders Gansu and Qinghai Provinces
in the southeast, Tibet in the south, Mongolia in the northeast, Russia in the
north, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan in the northwest and west, and
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in the southwest. Geographically, Xinjiang is
also marked by the Altay Mountains in the north, the Tianshan Mountains in the
east and west, and the Tarim Basin in the south, as well as the Junggar Basin
in the north. - Mod.AS]
[While it is good to have official confirmation of H5N1 HPAI in China,
significant questions still remain. Key among them is whether this is the same
virus that has been circulating in Southeast Asia and where the virus
originated. Sequencing of the virus should allow determination of its
relationship to other circulating Avian Influenza viruses. Determining the
origin of the virus may be a harder question to answer and may require
good "shoe leather" epidemiology. Surveillance in local poultry flocks and
defining the geographic boundaries of the present outbreak will be a key to
preventing further spread. Updates, as information becomes available, will
be very helpful in determining how much the geographic field for Avian
Influenza has enlarged in Asia.- Mod. PC].
