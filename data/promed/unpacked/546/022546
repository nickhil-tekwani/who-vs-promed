Dengue Outbreak Under Control
-------------------------------------
Deputy Minister for Municipal and Rural Affairs Prince Mansoor ibn Miteb
said yesterday [11 Nov 2006] that the cases of dengue fever in Jeddah and
Makkah were "under control." The prince was inaugurating a 3-day workshop
entitled, "Mosquitoes Transmit Dengue Fever."
He said various government agencies under instructions from Minister of
Municipal and Rural Affairs Prince Miteb were continuing efforts to combat
the disease, which had appeared in some areas of Jeddah.
"The support given to the Municipality of Jeddah in excess of SAR 1.4
billion [USD 373 million] will continue so we can combat the disease and
reach an environmental solution that will safeguard all citizens and
residents in the region and in other regions of the Kingdom," he said.
Prince Mansoor went on to say that an additional sum of SAR 7 billion [USD
1.9 billion] had been allocated to Jeddah Municipality for the finalization
of the city's sewage systems.
For his part, Jeddah Mayor Adel Fakieh said that 209 cases of dengue fever
had been recorded in Makkah and Jeddah since the beginning of this year
[2006]. He added that the number of cases in the Western Region had
increased to 80 cases per week.
According to the mayor, the disease spread in Jeddah quickly because "the
majority of districts do not have a sewage system" and because of standing
water in the city.
He said that several projects had been approved by the municipality, "some
of which are immediate and others term projects in order to combat dengue
fever and eliminate the insects that carry the disease."

The total number of people affected with dengue fever in India has climbed
to 9940, as 32 fresh cases of the disease were reported nationwide.
Health officials in the country say that the incidence of dengue is likely
to decline. The death toll across the country has hit 183.
As of Tuesday [14 Nov 2006], the National Vector Borne Disease Control
Program reported 32 new cases. A health official told the Press Trust of
India, "Out of these cases, 22 are from Delhi."
Government reports confirm 172 deaths from dengue in India. In 2005, 157
died, while 11 985 were affected by the mosquito-borne disease.
In the capital, New Delhi, 3 people died from dengue on Tuesday [14 Nov
2006]; all 3 deaths took place at the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences, a hospital where thousands of patients have been treated for
viral fever since an outbreak in October [2006].
In the meantime, health workers are turning to insecticide sprays across
New Delhi in an attempt to kill mosquito larvae.
Typically, dengue spreads as the monsoon tapers off, leaving behind
stagnant water for the insects to breed in.
Generally, India's yearly outbreak ends when the mosquito-breeding season
is over in November. Nonetheless, health inspectors have been checking
overpopulated residential areas for stagnant water left behind from the
monsoon. In New Delhi last week, authorities stopped all water fountains as
a preventive measure.

The Department of Health has declared a dengue outbreak in Cabuyao, Laguna,
after its representatives confirmed a sharp rise in the incidence of dengue
inside a relocation site here, the provincial health officer said Wednesday
[8 Nov 2006].
Dr. Alsaneo Lagos said from zero last year [2005], there have been over 10
incidents of confirmed dengue cases inside the 53-hectare Southville
Housing Project. He said, however, that of 10 reported dengue deaths, only
3 have been confirmed as caused by the mosquito-borne dengue virus. Two of
the victims were children aged 3 and 5 who died in a Mandaluyong hospital
recently. "We declared a dengue outbreak based on the recommendations and
findings of the DoH. The dengue cases in Southville have reached a
problematic stage," Lagos said. He added that 8 more victims, all of them
children, are still confined in several hospitals.
During their visit to the resettlement site Tuesday [8 Nov 2006], Lagos
said they discovered that many children were also suffering from colds and
fever. He said they immediately conducted a check up on the children and
other residents in the area. "We will put up a screening center inside the
relocation site. We will monitor the whole area everyday until we can clear
it of dengue," Lagos said.
Aside from regular monitoring, Lagos said they have activated the "Brigada
Kontra Kiti-kiti (Brigade Against Mosquito Larvae)" so to eliminate
mosquito breeding grounds.

The head of the Department of Health apologized on Monday [6 Nov 2006] for
a statement made by a Center for Disease Control official, who allegedly
said that "dengue fever is an unbreakable curse on the people of Kaohsiung."
Disavowing the statement, Hou Sheng-mao also pledged to step up his
agency's fight against the outbreak of the disease, which has infected 575
people since the beginning of the summer and resulted in 2 deaths from
among the 14 who contracted dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Most of the cases have been concentrated in southern Taiwan, with 404
patients in Kaohsiung City, 156 in Kaohsiung County, 9 in Pingdong County,
2 in Tainan County, 2 in Tainan City, one in Taipei County, and one in
Keelung City.
The DOH has come under some pressure this year [2006] because the outbreak
has exceeded the maximum targets set at the beginning of October 2006 of
"under 500 dengue fever cases and zero deaths from the disease."
Hou said that unless the outbreak is out of control, the central government
had no plans to take over, but he indicated the DOH was already pooling the
resources of local and central governments, including the Environmental
Protection Administration and Defense Ministry, to assist in disinfecting
and spraying pesticides in affected areas.
CDC Deputy Director and spokesman Chou Chih-hao said that incentives to
report dengue fever cases will be in place from now to the end of the year
as part of an effort to fight the disease. He said that an outpatient
doctor who reports a dengue fever case will be rewarded TWD 1000 [USD 31],
while an inpatient doctor be awarded TWD 3000 [USD 92] for every case reported.

Viet Nam's southern Mekong Delta has so far this year [2006] witnessed 37
deaths caused by dengue fever, up 30 percent over the same period last year
[2005], according to local newspaper Youth on Friday [10 Nov 2006]. An
Giang is the hardest-hit province in the delta, with 9 fatalities.
Over the past 4 weeks, some 4000 local people in the delta suffered from
dengue fever. In the province alone, over 800 people contracted the disease.
An Giang and some other provinces like Dong Thap are hit hard by dengue
fever because weather conditions there and residents' habits of storing
water in containers at their houses favor the breeding of mosquitoes, the
disease's transmitter.
Local healthcare agencies are asking residents in localities nationwide,
especially those in the southern region, to frequently clean up the
environment around their accommodations, including keeping water containers
clean and killing mosquitoes and their larvae. Viet Nam reported 49 400
cases of dengue fever infection, including 51 fatalities, last year [2005],
down 32.7 percent and 49.5 percent respectively from the previous year
[2004], according to the country's General Statistics Office.

An epidemic of dengue fever that flooded hospitals and may have killed as
many as 100 Cubans has been brought under control by a fumigation campaign.
The outbreak was the worst in a quarter of a century and appears to have
afflicted thousands during its peak in September and October 2006.
Infections have slowed to a few dozen new cases this month [November 2006],
said a senior doctor familiar with the scope of the epidemic, who added
that the response was initially slowed by government secrecy.
Cuba's Public Health Ministry subsequently confirmed the outbreak.

Dengue, type 4, death - Roraima (Boa Vista)
-----------------------------------------------
A fatal case of DHF was confirmed yesterday [31 Oct 2006] by the Secretary
of Health, Namis Levino. The fatal case, due to dengue type 4, was a child
of 4 years residing in the Caimbe neighborhood. According to Secretary
Levino, the child had been hospitalized for 2 weeks in the Santo Antonio
Children's Hospital.
This is the 1st case registered in Boa Vista this year [2006]. The
municipality is investigating the area, making household visits, and
developing a strategy to combat the mosquito vector.

[The state of Roraima is next to Venezuela, where dengue virus type 4 is
circulating. In 1982, the 1st dengue epidemic in recent times occurred in
Roraima, with dengue virus types 1 and 4 circulating. After this outbreak,
dengue virus type 4 disappeared from Brazil. The current risk is that
dengue virus type 4 will be introduced into the rest of the country from
Roraima, with the fear that there will be large epidemics with cases of
DHF. - Mod.JS]

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management. (Abstracted from the
WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
