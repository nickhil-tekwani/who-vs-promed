12 additional MERS cases, a total of 138
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Welfare's MERS-CoV Task Force as of 13 Jun, has confirmed 12 additional positive cases of MERS-CoV (12 Jun 2015).

- 4 diagnosed cases have been in contact with case no. 16, 3 of them are suspected to be infected at the Dae Cheong Hospital (22-28 May 2015), and 1 case at the Gunyang University Hospital (28 - 30 May 2015).

- 2 diagnosed cases have been in contact with case no. 14, suspected place of infection is Samsung Medical Center Emergency Room (27 - 28 May 2015).

- 1 of the diagnosed cases is an ambulance driver, who was in contact while transporting case no. 76 on [5-6 Jun 2015].

- Remaining 5 cases are related cases at Samsung Medical Center and are currently under epidemiological investigation.

- Meanwhile, the Task Force has announced one fatality case; it is the 14th death due to MERS-CoV.

- The 14th fatality, case no. 118 (female, 67 year old, hypothyroidism/hypertension) had been in contact with case no. 14 at the Pyeongtaek Good Morning Hospital from 25-27 May 2015], and has been quarantined from 9 Jun 2015 at the Ajou University Hospital. She was diagnosed on 10 Jun 2015 during hospitalization, but her state deteriorated and she died 13 Jun 2015 (at 3:30 AM).

[As of this latest report, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection is now 138 cases including 14 deaths bringing the reported case fatality rate to 10.1 percent. As mentioned below, unfortunately the majority of the cases were in the hospital for other medical reasons, hence they are at serious risk of severe morbidity and higher risk of mortality.

Noteworthy in the descriptions of the cases: one of the cases is a 4th generation case, an ambulance driver who transported a 3rd generation case to the hospital. A key concern at present is the volume of 4th generation cases -- those cases whose exposure was after significant control measures were implemented.

A list of hospitals that have had MERS-CoV infected individuals come to the hospital can be found at the MOH website as a downloadable pdf file: http://english.mw.go.kr/front_eng/al/sal0201vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=1002&MENU_ID=100203&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323365

[2] South Korea, 3 new deaths - media report

S. Korea confirms 3 more deaths from MERS, total rises to 13
------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea confirmed 3 more deaths from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on Friday [12 Jun 2015], while reporting 4 new cases that brought the number of people diagnosed with the disease here to 126.

A 72-year-old woman died earlier in the day while undergoing treatment at a hospital in North Jeolla Province, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

She was diagnosed [4 Jun 2015] after spending 8 days in a hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, which had treated the country's 1st MERS patient in mid-May [2015]. She had been in a coma for the past 5 days, according to ministry officials.

Two other deaths were reported later, raising the number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 13. Both were male patients who were infected with the virus after coming in contact with a confirmed MERS patient last month [May 2015]. One was 73 years old and the other was 78.

With those additional deaths, the death rate from MERS in South Korea has risen to 10.3 percent, the 1st time that it has been in double digits since the 1st case was confirmed on [20 May 2015].

The total number of people diagnosed with the potentially deadly disease came to 126 as the country reported an additional 4 cases.

The 4 new patients were infected while visiting hospitals affected by MERS.

All 126 confirmed cases so far have occurred in hospitals, meaning the disease has not infiltrated into the daily lives of people, the ministry said.

Later in the day, an elementary student below the age of 10 tested positive for MERS in the 2nd round of testing.

The student was suspected of having been infected with the disease outside of hospitals where MERS cases were reported or where MERS patients stayed but the government later confirmed that the patient visited a hospital where MERS cases were confirmed last month [May 2015].

If confirmed, the student would be the 1st case of a person below the age of 10 to be infected with MERS. Medical authorities have said that it is rare for a child aged 10 or younger to contract the disease.

Still, more than 3800 people were in isolation as of Thursday [11 Jun 2015] for possible infection after coming in close contact with a MERS patient or visiting one of the hospitals affected by the viral respiratory illness.

The number, however, dropped to 3680 on Friday [12 Jun 2015], marking the 1st drop since the outbreak was initially confirmed on [20 May 2015].

The fall came as a growing number of people previously isolated for possible infection are being released after testing negative for MERS or developing no symptoms over the maximum incubation period of 14 days, according to ministry officials.

As of Friday [12 Jun 2015], 1249 people have been released from isolation.

The officials said the drop may also be a sign that the spread of the disease is now on the wane.

They said the upcoming weekend may become a turning point in the battle against MERS as the rise in the number of newly infected people has also slowed to 4 on Friday [12 Jun 2015] from 14 on the previous day [11 Jun 2015].

South Korea's acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan sought to keep the foreign community here calm and well-informed.

"Taking into account South Korea's advanced medical service sector and high level of expertise of its health professions, there is no doubt that the current MERS situation will be contained," he said in a meeting with foreign diplomats and business leaders in Seoul.

Signs that the outbreak is being brought under control include the lifting of a mandatory shutdown on schools in 2 affluent districts of Seoul.

The order for a temporary shutdown was issued at the start of this week after a MERS-infected doctor was found to have crisscrossed the 2 districts -- Seocho and Gangnam -- before his diagnosis.

The order had affected 69 kindergartens and 57 elementary schools.

Starting next week, the schools' own principals will be allowed to decide whether to cancel classes, Seoul's Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon said.

The move apparently came as hospitals have been identified as the only source of infection so far. The government has been updating daily a list of hospitals and clinics affected by MERS, which was at 55 facilities as of Thursday [11 Jun 2015].

To help small and medium-sized hospitals suffering from a shutdown or loss of patients, the government said it will provide emergency relief funds.

The government earlier said it will provide up to 400 billion won (USD 360 million) in such funds for businesses and communities affected by MERS.

MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans with the 1st case [confirmed and] reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Some 1100 cases have since been reported in about 20 countries, mostly in and around the Middle East.

[According to the official MOH reports on these fatalities, the 11th fatality was case no. 51, a 72-year-old female with history of pneumonia, renal failure, and multi-organ failure who was a 2nd generation case, having been admitted to the same ward as the index case (see http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323354 [in Korean] for details).

The 12th fatality was case no. 23, a 73-year-old male with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma who was a 3rd generation case having shared a room with case no. 16.

The 13th fatality was case no. 24, a 78-year-old male, also a 3rd generation case, with history of hypertension and asthma, and who also shared a room with case no. 16 (see http://www.mw.go.kr/front_new/al/sal0301vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=04&MENU_ID=0403&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323368 [in Korean] for details on fatalities no. 12 and 13).

To date, all fatalities have occurred in individuals with pre-existing disease, having been at the hospitals for their underlying illnesses when exposed to other cases with MERS-CoV infection. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Situation in Korea
Between [8 and 12 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 62 additional confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 6 deaths.

Additional information on the outbreak in Korea
To date, a total of 126 MERS-CoV cases, including 11 deaths, have been reported. One of the 126 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

The median age of the patients is 56 years old (ranging from 16 to 84 years old). The majority of cases are men (59 percent). 10 cases (7.9 percent) are health care professionals.

To date, all cases have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities (excluding the index case). So far, authorities have identified 44 hospitals where either transmission occurred or a confirmed MERS patient visited before diagnostic confirmation.

Scientists in Korea and China have completed full genome sequencing of coronaviruses from the current outbreak. Findings were analysed by a group of virologists convened by WHO. Preliminary analysis of these findings does not suggest that a more transmissible virus is emerging in Korea. An explanation for the rapid expansion of Korea's outbreak almost certainly lies elsewhere.

Public health response
National authorities are implementing a containment strategy which consists in early detection of cases, early isolation and contact tracing. As of [12 Jun 2015], 3680 contacts have been identified (3453 are under home monitoring and 227 under facility monitoring) and 1249 contacts have been released. The large number of contacts currently being monitored makes the detection of at least some further cases inevitable.

In addition, on [10 Jun 2015], public health authorities in Korea carried out a MERS-CoV screening day in about 3000 health care facilities to proactively detect cases.

A joint Korea-WHO high level mission is currently ongoing to gain information and review the situation in the Republic of Korea including the epidemiological pattern, the characteristic of the virus and clinical features. The team will also assess the public health response efforts and provide recommendations for response measures going forward. The joint mission ends on [13 Jun 2015.]

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1289 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 455 related deaths.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing, should be adhered to.

WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not advise special procedures at points of entry, or travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event.

Starting from [12 Jun 2015], Disease Outbreak News concerning MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea will be published on a bi-weekly basis (on Tuesdays and Fridays).

[The important message here thus far is that there is a single chain of transmission. In the past 24 hours, apparently case no. 119 was reclassified as a 4th generation case, and his contact case (no. 52) was reclassified as a 3rd generation case.

There has been an announcement that WHO will convene the panel of experts next week to review the situation vis a vis whether the current situations (with continued transmission in the Arabian Peninsula and the ongoing transmission in South Korea) represent a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

A key concern is that the index case had a history of travel to the Arabian Peninsula, but did not have contact with camels or camel products such as milk or urine, and did not visit a healthcare facility while there. So, that leaves most likely community transmission ... a more worrisome location for transmission.

What studies are underway in the countries of the Arabian Peninsula vis a vis transmission routes?

Of note is that in the USA, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has issued a health advisory for healthcare providers and public health officials to maintain awareness of the need to consider MERS-CoV infection in ill persons who have recently traveled from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula or in the Republic of Korea. This was sent through the Health Advisory Network (HAN) and dissemination of this information to "healthcare providers, especially infectious diseases specialists, intensive care physicians, internists, infection preventionists, and to emergency departments and microbiology laboratories" is requested. (The full HAN advisory can be found at: http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USCDC/bulletins/10932eb.) - Mod.MPP]

[4] Saudi Arabia, 1 new fatal case - MOH 12 Jun 2015, RFI
Date: Fri 12 Jun 2015

http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2015-06-12-001.aspx


As of 12 noon today (12 Jun 2015), there have been a total of:
1030 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
453 deaths
568 recoveries, and
9 cases currently active including 1 case on home isolation

In the past 24 hours, there has been
1 newly confirmed fatal case reported

Information on newly confirmed fatal case:
A 77-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof was report as newly confirmed case. At the time of the initial report on 12 Jun 2015 the patient had reportedly expired. He was noted to have had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, and to have had contact with another case(s) in either the healthcare environment or the community.

[The outbreak in Hufoof continues on a slow but steady pace, with 31 cases including 15 deaths reported since 20 Apr 2015. Again the overwhelming majority of cases have a history of contact with other cases. This outbreak has continued now for over 3 incubation periods. A question that comes to mind is: What are the specific transmission chains? How many generations of cases have been documented? And is the transmission purely nosocomial now or is there a community transmission component as well?

Do any of our readers in Saudi Arabia have any answers to these questions? ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information.
