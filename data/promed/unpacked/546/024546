["Caprine arthritis/encephalitis (CAE) of goats and maedi-visna (MV), of sheep are persistent virus infections caused by closely related lentiviruses. Maedi-visna is also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Sheep can be experimentally infected with CAE and goats can be experimentally infected with MV. In addition, phylogenetic analyses comparing nucleotide sequences of MV virus (MVV) and CAE virus (CAEV) show clear indications of the existence and epidemiological importance of cross-species transmission between sheep and goats without demonstrating clearly that one virus has emerged from the other. MV and CAE are characterised by lifelong persistence of the causal agent in host monocytes and macrophages, and a variable length of time between infection and induction of a serologically detectable antiviral antibody response. Most infected sheep and goats do not exhibit clinical disease, but remain persistently infected and are capable of transmitting virus.

"Maedi-visna is an Icelandic name that describes 2 of the clinical syndromes recognised in MV virus (MVV)- infected sheep. 'Maedi' means 'laboured breathing' and describes the disease associated with a progressive interstitial pneumonitis, and 'visna' means 'shrinkage' or 'wasting', the signs associated with a paralysing meningoencephalitis. Whereas progressive lung disease is the primary finding with MVV infection, chronic polyarthritis, with synovitis and bursitis is the primary clinical outcome of CAEV infection. Encephalitis occurs primarily in kids [baby goats], aged between 2 and 6 months following CAEV infection, but careful differential diagnoses need to be conducted to rule out other syndromes or infections in kids. Indurative mastitis occurs in both syndromes. The lungs of sheep affected by MV do not collapse when removed from the thorax and often retain the impression of the ribs. The lungs and lymph nodes increase in weight (up to 2-3 times the normal weight). The lesions are uniformly distributed throughout the lungs, which are uniformly discoloured or mottled grey-brown in colour and of a firm texture. Udders affected by MV are diffusely indurated and associated lymph nodes may be enlarged.

"When MV or CAE is the suspected cause of clinical disease, confirmation of the diagnosis can be achieved by a combination of clinical evaluation, detection, and identification of the viruses, or by serology and, when necessary, histological examination of appropriate tissues collected at necropsy. Important tissues to examine include lung for progressive interstitial pneumonitis, brain and spinal cord for meningoencephalitis, udder for indurative mastitis, affected joints and synovium for arthritis, and kidney for vasculitis. The nature of the inflammatory reaction in each site is similar, consisting of an interstitial, mononuclear cell reaction, sometimes with large aggregates of lymphoid cells and follicle formation."
