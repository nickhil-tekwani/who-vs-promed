D.C. postal worker has inhalation anthrax
----------------------------------------------------
A Washington, D.C., postal worker has been diagnosed with inhalation
anthrax, the third confirmed case of this most serious form of the
disease since 1 Oct 2001, Washington health officials told CNN on
Sunday. Washington Mayor Anthony Williams said the employee works in
the Brentwood mail facility that processes almost all mail to the
District of Columbia.
The man was hospitalized on Friday at Inova Fairfax Hospital in
northern Virginia with flu-like symptoms. Hospital spokeswoman Janice
Moore told CNN the man is in "serious" condition.
Latest developments
-------------------------
The most recent tests for anthrax in Gov. George Pataki's Manhattan
offices were negative, New York state health officials said Saturday.
A preliminary test of a sample from one area of the offices came back
positive Wednesday. More complete tests are being conducted on that
sample. Results from 90 additional tests came back negative. [This
suggests that the original results may have been false-positive. -

Anthrax tests at ABC News come back negative
------------------------------------------------------------
Tests for anthrax at ABC, where a 7-month-old boy was believed to have
contracted the disease, and other New York media organizations have
come back negative, the mayor said Sunday. The baby, the son of an ABC
producer, had visited the network's offices, leading investigators to
believe the infection may have occurred there. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said investigators had not identified the source of the infant's
infection, and no suspect letter had been found.
Environmental samples from several other media outlets and schools had
all yielded negative results, Giuliani said. Several results were
still pending. He did not list the organizations that were tested.
Most of the tests were environmental, but at NBC more than 1300 people
have been tested for exposure to anthrax. All came back negative, the
mayor said.
An anthrax-contaminated letter was found unopened Friday in the
mailroom of the New York Post, where an employee was diagnosed with
anthrax last week. It was addressed to "Editor, New York Post" in
similar block letters to those sent to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. It remained unclear Sunday what
infected the employee, an assistant to the newspaper's editorial page
editor. [The employee] said she remembers opening another piece of
mail addressed in block capital letters, the newspaper reported.

Washington [DC] postal worker diagnosed with inhalation anthrax
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----
Government officials ordered the testing Sunday of an additional 2150
mail employees after a capital postal worker became "gravely ill" with
inhaled anthrax, Mayor Anthony Williams said. The unidentified man,
the third person to come down with the most serious form of the
disease, checked [himself] into a suburban hospital on Friday and was
diagnosed Sunday morning, said Dr. Ivan Walks, chief health officer
for the city. Walks said it was not known immediately if the man was
exposed to the same letter found in Daschle's office.
Postal inspector Ken Weaver said [that] how the worker with inhaled
anthrax was exposed was still being investigated. More than 2000
employees at the Brentwood central mail processing center for the
nation's capital and another 150 employees at the air mail handling
center near Baltimore-Washington International Airport will be tested
for exposure to anthrax spores and receive treatment beginning Sunday,
Williams said. Dan Mihalko, a U.S. Postal Inspection Service official
in Washington [DC], said the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention began testing employees at the Brentwood facility's
government mail section for possible anthrax exposure a few days ago.
He said the CDC also ran tests on the mail machinery.

At the Trenton Main Post Office in Hamilton Township, NJ, early tests
found widespread anthrax contamination, the Associated Press reported.
The state epidemiologist reportedly told union members last night that
13 of 23 samples from the building's work areas contained anthrax.

As the seventh and eighth cases were confirmed -- [the NY Post
employee] & the second New Jersey postal worker -- an English
handwriting expert, Margaret Webb, of the British Institute of
Graphologists, said that the use of block capitals on envelopes sent
to Senator Tom Daschle and the NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw pointed to a
male.
"In my experience, men use capital letters, and this writing would
suggest a macho male, the type found in a uniform, and one who was
also trying to mask his persona," she said from her home near Reading,
Berkshire.
She was sent the copies of the envelopes by the Washington Times, and
explained that FBI handwriting experts could tell more from the
pressure marks on the originals. Mrs Webb, who worked on the case of
the serial killer Dr Harold Shipman, said the variable size of the
letters and their slant suggested someone controlled, but with
underlying violence, and a man who was "heavy-hearted, or depressed".
Did the writing look as if it was done by a man more used to Arabic
script? "No, but I am told that the number one in the post code is
written in a style taught to older Americans -- people who might be 70
years old," she said.
[I´ve always understood that the use of block letters by criminals of
either sex was simply an attempt to disguise their normal
handwriting -- or else that the person was only semiliterate. -

This is an official CDC Health Advisory
Distributed via Health Alert Network
October 18, 2001, 21:30 EDT (9:30 PM EDT)
Priority: Medium
Purpose: to update public and private labs and others on rapid anthrax
test.
HAND-HELD IMMUNOASSAYS FOR DETECTION OF Bacillus anthracis SPORES

Hand-held assays (sometimes referred to as Smart Tickets) are sold
commercially for the rapid detection of _Bacillus anthracis_. These
assays are intended only for the screening of environmental samples.
First responder and law enforcement communities are using these as
instant screening devices and should forward any positive samples to
authorities for more sensitive and specialized confirmatory testing.
The results of these assays should not be used to make decisions about
patient management or prophylaxis.
The utility and validity of these assays are unknown.
At this time, CDC does not have enough scientific data to recommend
the use of these assays. The analytical sensitivity of these assays
is limited by the
technology, and data provided by manufacturers indicate that a minimum
of 10 000 spores is required to generate a positive signal. This
number of spores would suggest a heavy contamination of the area
(sample). Therefore a negative result does not rule out a lower level
of contamination. Data collected from field use also indicate
specificity problems with some of these assays. Some positive results
have been obtained with spores of the non-anthrax _Bacillus_ bacteria
that may be found in the environment.
For these reasons, CDC has been asked to evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of the commercially available rapid, hand-held assays for
_B. anthracis_. When this study is completed, results will be made
available. Conclusions from this study are not expected in the near
future.

CDC Update: CDC case definition of anthrax and summary of confirmed
cases
October 20, 2001/2:00 PM, ET
Contact: CDC, Media Relations
Tel: (404) 6393286
CDC case definition of anthrax
-------------------------------------------
CDC defines a confirmed case of anthrax as 1) a clinically compatible
case of cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal illness that is
laboratory confirmed by isolation of _B. anthracis_ from an affected
tissue or site or 2) other laboratory evidence of _B. anthracis_
infection based on at least two supportive laboratory tests.
Based on this definition, CDC is reporting 6 confirmed cases of
anthrax: 2 in Florida, 3 in New York, and one in New Jersey. However,
there are two additional cases with less laboratory evidence being
reported by local investigators.

[My esteemed colleague and friend Jack Woodall points out, "Contrary
to rumors, the CDC sites are up & running. Also, referring to Martin´s
comment on Anthrax - USA (11) that CDC should have current info on its
website, it ... is there on <http://www.bt.cdc.gov/>." -- see [7
above.
I apologise to CDC if I have offended their URL efforts.
The lateral contamination from these letters is severe. I think that
this "letter attack" has revealed a hole in our knowledge. People like
myself and Paul Keim strive mightily for zero contamination -- the
cost is too high in wrecked DNA studies -- but also our lab is of an
old design and cannot be decontaminated easily or safely. On the other
hand, the military went for massive contamination, i.e. Provo Proving
Grounds in Utah, with extraordinary volumes of carefully prepared
spores. The envelope small-load was overlooked, and how well the
spores have to be prepared to get the opener infected, to get others
in the room infected, to contaminate the room, etc. with various
expanding scenarios. I would hate to have to run such experiments
because of the tedium of cleaning up all the time.
As of tomorrow [22 Oct 2001 the anthrax postings will be undertaken
by Tam Garland as I am travelling all week. Anyone wanting to contact
me will have to leave a message on my computer for me to find,
possibly, on Friday. I carry a cell phone only for real emergencies
involving the AA and such. - Mod.MHJ
[I believe Martin´s reference to AA emergencies is to automobile
assistance, not Alcoholics Anonymous! - Mod.JW
