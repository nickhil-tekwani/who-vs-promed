Abstract
--------
Keystone virus, a California-serogroup orthobunyavirus, was first isolated in 1964 from mosquitoes in Keystone, Florida. There are no reports of isolation from humans, despite studies suggesting that about 20 percent of persons living in the region are seropositive. We report virus isolation from a Florida teenager with a rash and fever.

[Keystone virus, a member of the California serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses, has been detected on the eastern coast of the USA for over 50 years, but was not considered of public health importance until the case above was diagnosed. It is interesting to note that with a Keystone virus antibody prevalence of 20 percent in people living in the area in Florida, this is the 1st case of clinical disease due to infection with that virus. This makes one wonder if there have been other human cases of rash and fever due to Keystone virus infection that were not diagnosed. Keystone virus was first isolated from _Aedes atlanticus_ mosquitoes in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. The virus was shown to be transmitted transovarially in this mosquito species and infect gray squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) in the Pocomoke Cypress Swamp on the eastern shore of Maryland. - Mod.TY
