From 2012 through [15 Oct 2018], the total global number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO is 2262 with 803 associated deaths.

The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR 2005 to date [1 Nov 2018]. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date [1 Nov 2018] through follow-up with affected member states.

[According to the above report, during the period from 2012 through 15 Oct 2018, there have been a total of 2262 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including 803 associated deaths, bringing the reported case fatality rate to 35.5%. New information provided in the above report includes a history of pre-existing co-morbidities for 7 of the 8 cases presented. Outcomes on these cases were available for 7 of the 8 cases: 4 were reported to have recovered, 3 were reported to have died, and 1 is still pending outcome information. New information included identification of case nos. 1, 2, and 3 as healthcare-acquired cases.

While the number of newly confirmed cases reported during this period is less than in prior equal periods, it is not nil. It is safe to say that MERS-CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia with a majority of primary community-acquired cases, some with history of contact with camels, but others without an identified high-risk exposure, and periodically there are increases due to nosocomial transmission, or intrahousehold transmission. - Mod.MPP]
