2 West Nile fever cases reported here
-------------------------------------
The Health Ministry has reported the first 2 cases this year of patients
who contracted West Nile fever [WNF]. According to the ministry's
assessments, the appearance of the disease at the end of the summer denotes
that there will not be a renewed and widespread outbreak of the disease
this year. Ministry officials have, however, called on the public to take
precautions against mosquito bites. Israel experienced a severe outbreak of
WNF in 2000, with some 400 individuals falling ill and 29 fatalities
recorded. Since then, there has been a significant fall-off in the extent
of the disease, with 2001 seeing 14 people fall ill and 2 fatalities, and
2002 seeing 7 people contract the disease and 1 death.

[According to a Ministry of Health (MOH) press release dated 21 Sep 2004,
(<http://www.health.gov.il/news/news.asp?ID=242>, in Hebrew), one of the
patients, a woman in her 30s, was infected in July in Jericho and admitted
to hospital in August in Jerusalem, where lab diagnosis was obtained (no
further details provided); released following recovery. The other patient,
a man of 63, was bitten by mosquitoes on 5 Sep 2004 in Eilat, admitted to
hospital due to encephalitis; still in hospital, condition "good".
According to the MOH statistical data, the cumulative total number of WNF
cases for 2003 was 21; the same figure appears for 2002: see
<http://www.health.gov.il/download/docs/units/epi/week03/IWER52.xls>.
Most cases of WNF occur in Israel during August-October. In 2003, the 1st
case was diagnosed in May. - Mod.AS]
