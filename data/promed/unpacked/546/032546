The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 23 Nov 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 403, with 356 confirmed and 47 probable. In total, there were 231 deaths (184 confirmed and 47 probable) and 120 people healed.
- 56 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases: 2 in Katwa, 1 in Kalunguta and 1 in Beni. (The case confirmed in Musienene reported in the bulletin of 23 Nov 2018 was reclassified to Butembo after investigations.)
- 3 new confirmed case deaths, including 2 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo.
- 2 new people healed in Butembo.

News of the response
- On Fri 23 Nov 2018, the sensitizers of Beni, accompanied by 2 local actors, organized a motorized caravan to remind the population of the 5 citizen commitments to protect themselves against Ebola and put an end to the epidemic. The caravan left the administrative office of Butanuka district, before continuing to the small markets of Mabakanga and Kalinda, before stopping at the Ngongolio roundabout. Contests were held at each stop with distribution of rewards for those who answered the questions correctly. Many children and adults participated, and it was the children who won the most gifts.

Vaccination
---------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 34 839 people have been vaccinated, including 16 832 in Beni [North Kivu] . . .

- The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 22 Nov 2018:
Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 399, with 352 confirmed and 47 probable. In total, there were 228 deaths (181 confirmed and 47 probable) and 118 people healed.
- 91 suspected cases under investigation.
- 6 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni, 2 in Katwa, 1 in Oicha, and 1 in Musienene.
- 6 new confirmed case deaths, including 3 in Beni (including 1 postponed from 22 Nov 2018), 1 in Oicha, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Musienene.
- 1 new person healed in Beni.

News of the response
- This Fri 23 Nov 2018, the coordination of the response made a short trip to Lubero to participate in a working meeting with the rapid intervention team and arrived in the locality on Wed 21 Nov 2018. Following the increase of cases in the health zone of Butembo and its surroundings, the coordination decided to send additional intervention teams to the areas of Katwa, Kalunguta, and Lubero. The role of the teams in Lubero is to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance in a preventive way and to train local healthcare providers to identify and treat possible cases of Ebola and high-risk contacts from Butembo. Healthcare providers, who accept it, will also be vaccinated.

Vaccination
----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 34 091 people have been vaccinated, including 16 635 in Beni [North Kivu], 4544 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 4309 in Katwa [North Kivu], 2090 in Butembo [North Kivu], 1751 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 732 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 359 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 292 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 241 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 234 in Musienene [North Kivu], 178 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 34 in Alimbongo [North Kivu].

[2] WHO - Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo disease outbreak news: update
Date: Thu 22 Nov 2018
Source: WHO disease outbreak news, 22 Nov 2018, Ebola virus, DR Congo [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-november-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Containing the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a complex and challenging task, but WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be successfully contained in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners.

On 16 Nov 2018, an armed group attacked the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) base in the Boikene district, in the city of Beni, close to the UN Ebola response residences. Response operations in Beni were briefly paused, but all activities, including vaccination, resumed by [Sun 18 Nov 2018]. WHO condemns the attacks on peacekeepers who are integral to the ongoing efforts to manage the EVD outbreak. WHO will continue to evaluate the situation and risks involved and remain vigilant about measures to protect responders and civilians.

Health centres have been identified as a source of disease transmission. Medications administered via injections were a notable cause of infection.

Current efforts are focused on improving infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, including providing water and products for cleaning, training health providers at informal health centres, and encouraging the provision of medications that do not require injections.

During the reporting period (14-20 Nov 2018), 36 new confirmed EVD cases were reported from Beni, Mutwanga, Kalunguta, Butembo, Katwa, and Oicha, while 7 probable cases were reported from Kalunguta. Seven of the new cases were newborn babies and infants aged less than 2 years; 6 were children aged between 2 and 17 years; and one case was a pregnant woman. Five health workers from Beni and Katwa were among the newly infected; 39 health workers have been infected to date. Ten additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni (6) and Butembo (4) and reintegrated into their communities; 113 patients have recovered to date.

As of 20 Nov 2018, 386 EVD cases (339 confirmed and 47 probable), including 219 deaths (172 confirmed and 47 probable), have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu province and 3 health zones in Ituri province (Figure 1). The overall trends in weekly case incidence reflect continued community transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu (Figure 2). Given the expected delays in case detection and ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends, especially in the most recent weeks, must be interpreted cautiously.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the DRC, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from Uganda and Zambia; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 20 Nov 2018 (n=382)* [see updated case numbers in MoH report [1]. - Mod.LK]

* Onset date unknown for 4 cases. Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response
-----------
The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports published by the WHO regional office for Africa: Ebola situation reports: DRC.

WHO risk assessment
----------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO's risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the DRC based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice
--------
International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information . . .
For more information, see the following:
- WHO statement on the latest attacks in the DRC;
- Summary report for the SAGE meeting of October 2018;
- Statement on the October 2018 meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the DRC;
- WHO interim recommendation for Ebola vaccines;
- WHO recommendations for international travellers related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the DRC;
- Ebola virus disease in the DRC: Operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries; and
- Ebola virus disease fact sheet.

The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results.

- 23 Nov 2018. Ebola in Congo now infecting newborn babies, UN says
[AP News, edited]
https://apnews.com/7218446381a247118466fa7d03f15fe1

The World Health Organization says a worrying number of the newest Ebola cases amid Congo's ongoing outbreak are in patients not usually known to catch the disease: babies.

In an update published this week [week of 19 Nov 2018], the UN health agency reported 36 new confirmed cases of Ebola, including 7 in newborn babies and infants younger than 2 years old. Six cases were reported in children aged between 2 and 17, and one case was in a pregnant woman.

While Ebola typically infects adults, as they are most likely to be exposed to the lethal virus, children have been known in some instances to catch the disease when they act as caregivers.

Few cases of Ebola in babies have been reported, but experts suspect transmission might happen via breast milk or close contact with infected parents. Ebola is typically spread by infected bodily fluids. WHO noted that health centers have been identified as a source of Ebola transmission, with injections of medications "a notable cause."

The outbreak has been plagued by security problems, with health workers attacked by rebels in districts where the virus has been spreading. Earlier this month, Ebola containment operations were paused after seven UN peacekeepers and 12 Congolese soldiers were killed, but all activities have resumed.

The increasing number of cases in children and health workers -- 39 health workers have been infected to date -- suggests outbreak responders are having major problems stopping the virus in health clinics and convincing people to seek help when they develop symptoms. This is the 1st time this part of Congo has faced an Ebola outbreak.

WHO said the risk of the outbreak spreading to neighboring countries remains "very high," but it does not recommend travel restrictions. Uganda this month [November 2018] started vaccinating health workers against Ebola in a heavily traveled border district near the outbreak.

[It is not clear how the virus is spreading from infected patient to healthcare worker in the clinics, but it is important to determine what the route of transmission is in order to take the proper measures to stop it. Similarly, it is important to know how newborn babies are becoming infected in order to protect them. As stated, breast milk is a possibility, but equally likely is close contact following birth with an infected mother. - Mod.LK]

[4] Prevention and control
- Sat 24 Nov 2018. Randomized clinical trial protocol for experimental therapeutic Ebola treatments approved by ethics committee
Ministry of Health [edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=e724fba405

The ethics committee approves the randomized clinical trial protocol for experimental therapeutic Ebola treatments
---------------------------

The ethics committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa has issued, in its decision ESP / CE / 129/2018, a favorable opinion on the protocol of the randomized clinical trial of the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of experimental treatments for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD).

Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, 4 therapeutic molecules have been used to treat patients in all established Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), namely mAb 114, ZMapp, Remdesivir, and Regeneron.

To date, these 4 therapeutic treatments have been administered to the majority of Ebola patients in the current compassionate epidemic, or, more formally, under the emergency controlled use protocol for unlicensed interventions (MEURI). However, the use of therapeutic treatments under this protocol does not provide for the generalization of scientific evidence collected on the efficacy and safety of each of these treatments. In addition, compassionate use is only permitted when there is no clinical trial in progress.

The joint scientific committee has now agreed on a clinical trial protocol. Valuable information on the effectiveness of the treatments obtained in the clinical trial will help develop these treatments on a larger scale to save more lives.

The clinical trial began this week with 3 of the 4 therapeutic molecules, namely Zmapp, mAb 114, and Remdesivir, only in the CTE of Beni. In the future, the test could be extended to other sites and include the 4th molecule. For the moment, the other CTEs in place will continue to administer therapeutic treatments on a compassionate basis according to the MEURI protocol.

From a practical point of view, the patient (or the patient's family) will have to give their firm and informed consent to participate in the clinical trial and to benefit from a therapeutic treatment, just as it was the case with compassionate use. The major difference is that the choice of treatment administered to the patient will be randomized; that is to say, it will no longer be based on a decision of the CTE doctors, but will be done by lottery to avoid any risk of subjectivity.

Patients may refuse to participate in the clinical trial. They will still receive a level of care equal to the participating patients and will continue to benefit from symptomatic treatments (such as rehydration, blood transfusions, blood pressure monitoring) whose benefits remain significant. Patients participating in the clinical trial will continue to be treated in the CTE; symptomatic treatments will always be administered in addition to therapeutic treatments, and patients will be followed by clinicians until fully recovered.

The number of patients who will participate in the clinical trial during the current outbreak will depend on the evolution of the epidemic and the willingness of patients to participate. Data collected during the North Kivu epidemic alone is unlikely to be sufficient for a complete study and to draw definitive conclusions about the safety and efficacy of these molecules. Thus, the current clinical trial protocol may extend over a 5-year period to cover several EVD outbreaks in several affected countries.

Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), and Dr. Richard T. Davey Jr., deputy director of the Division of Clinical Research of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), are the 2 principal investigators (PI) of this clinical trial.

[Robert A et al. Biorxiv 2018. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/113506

New Results

Abstract
-----
Background: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at risk of infection during Ebola virus disease outbreaks and therefore may be targeted for vaccination before or during outbreaks. The effect of these strategies depends on the role of HCW in transmission, which is understudied.

Methods: To evaluate the effect of HCW-targeted or community vaccination strategies, we used a transmission model to explore the relative contribution of HCW and the community to transmission. We calibrated the model to data from multiple Ebola outbreaks. We quantified the impact of ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies, and reactive HCW and community vaccination.

Results: We found that, for some outbreaks (we call "type 1"), HCW amplified transmission both to other HCW and the community, and in these outbreaks prophylactic vaccination of HCW decreased outbreak size. Reactive vaccination strategies had little effect because type 1 outbreaks ended quickly. However, in outbreaks with longer time courses ("type 2 outbreaks"), reactive community vaccination decreased the number of cases, with or without prophylactic HCW-targeted vaccination. For both outbreak types, we found that ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies had an impact at coverage of 30 percent.

Conclusions: The optimal vaccine strategy depends on the dynamics of the outbreak and the impact of other interventions on transmission. Although we will not know the characteristics of a new outbreak, ahead-of-time HCW-targeted vaccination can decrease the total outbreak size, even at low vaccine coverage.

[The importance of vaccinating HCW cannot be overstated. They are sacrificing themselves to save patients and should be protected. They also contribute to virus transmission in clinics if they become infected. This paper supports the role vaccination of HCW can play in controlling Ebola virus outbreaks. - Mod.LK
