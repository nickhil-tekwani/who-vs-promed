[No source of the anthrax is given, but livestock outbreaks in December are usually the result of a contaminated feed. And being on the border, the feed could be of one country or the other. We must await the results of their investigation. If it was feed, from my experience there will be multiple outbreaks because the feed will not have been sold to just one farm -- the distribution is spatially random reflecting the purchasers -- and are usually over within 21 days. - Mod.MHJ
