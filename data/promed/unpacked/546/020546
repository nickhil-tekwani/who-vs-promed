The 1st positive sample of West Nile virus reported in Louisiana this year [2020] was found on 1 Mar [2020] in a trap not far from Claiborne Elementary school in Baton Rouge.

While this potentially deadly virus has been found earlier in the year, most years, it waits until May or later to surface, and last year [2019], it did not appear in Baton Rouge until August 2019, said Randy Vaeth, interim director of East Baton Rouge Parish's Mosquito Abatement and Rodent Control office. "It is quite early in the season right now," said Vaeth. Vaeth said LSU released the test results on Friday [13 Mar 2020].

The positive sample means that Vaeth's office is revving up its mosquito abatement work in a one-mile radius around where the mosquito larvae were discovered. Nighttime sprays have yet to start because of still cool evenings and occasional high winds, and aerial sprays won't occur until later in the year, he said.

It's possible West Nile won't show up again in samples for weeks, or it could spread fast, Vaeth said.

In any case, Vaeth is urging residents to start taking precautions to prevent mosquito bites: wearing insect repellent while outside for long periods of time, restricting time outside during the early morning and late evening hours when mosquitoes are most active, and wearing long sleeves if possible. He also advises dumping any containers with standing water around homes.

Last year [2019], 20 Louisiana residents got sick from West Nile virus, and 2 died. The most serious type is a neuroinvasive infection, which can lead to paralysis, brain damage and death.

[West Nile virus occurs frequently each year in the southeastern USA, including Louisiana, infecting both humans and horses. The virus is maintained in a transmission cycle involving wild birds and _Culex_ mosquitoes, with spillover to humans and equine animals.

As the official indicated above, although this is an early indication of the presence of the virus in mosquito vectors, it does not necessarily indicate that an earlier transmission season has begun. Ongoing transmission of the virus will depend on abundance of vector mosquitoes juxtaposed with ample susceptible bird hosts. Nevertheless, avoidance of mosquito bites and vaccination of horses are prudent preventive measures to be adopted currently. - Mod.TY
