Here is a reference of primary work done on heat decontamination of water
done in our laboratory. This article is accompanied by an excellent
editorial review by Dr. Howard Baker.
Groh CD, MacPherson DW, Groves DJ. Effect of heat on the sterilization of
artificially contaminated water. J Travel Med 1996; 3: 11-13.

In as much a question as an answer, one comprehensive index to such
information is:
Mitscherlich E, Marth EH (eds)
MICROBIAL SURVIVAL IN THE ENVIRONMENT
1984, Springer-Verlag, Berlin
I don't have a copy handy, but wonder if: (1) it contains sufficient
information to answer your question; (2) list members know of more recent
compendiums of the same nature.

In response to the above item, the moderator (mhj) requested information on
boil water advice for inactivating microorganisms. Please see the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), September 16, 1994, Vol. 43, No. 36,
pp. 662-663 and 669.
This publication discusses boiling times for waterborne bacteria, viruses
and protozoa and provides a list of references.
