Isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is commoner than had been thought among children, particularly in Europe, according to the results of a study published online 1 Jun 2015 in Pediatrics [1].

About 15 per cent of tuberculosis cases are resistant to isoniazid, but little is known about the percentage of children who are resistant, nor about where they live. Resistance is difficult to identify in children because specimens typically do not harbor enough bacteria to test drug susceptibility.

Undiagnosed resistance can result in ineffective treatment and increases the risk for treatment failure and death. Cases of isoniazid-resistant TB in children have been reported from all over the world, but the proportion and number of cases have not been evaluated. These measures could inform public health policy.

Courtney M Yuen, PhD, from the Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues conducted a systematic literature review (43 reports) that used World Health Organization data to estimate the proportion and number of children aged 0 to 14 years with TB and isoniazid resistance by region.

For 2010, 12.1 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI], 9.8 per cent - 14.8 per cent) of all children with TB had isoniazid-resistant disease, which corresponds to 120 872 (CI, 96 628 - 149 059) cases. Although most of the cases were in the Western Pacific and South East Asia, the greatest proportion (26.1 per cent; CI, 20.0 per cent - 33.6 per cent) of child TB cases that were isoniazid-resistant was in Europe.

"The finding that 1 in 8 children with TB globally have isoniazid-resistant disease has enormous implications for the effectiveness of treatment," the researchers write. Extrapolating from the 7.6 million new latent TB infections in the 22 nations with the highest TB burdens to a global level, the researchers estimate that more than a million children contract isoniazid-resistant infections annually. Many cases trace to adults with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis, they hypothesize.

The investigators caution that other resistances may be present too, and advise that in areas in which isoniazid resistance status is not known, and specimens from children are not obtained, a minimum of 4 drugs should be deployed for the initiation stage of treatment. They add that if resistance to isoniazid alone is known or the child has been exposed to such a case, the child should receive at least 3 drugs (rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 6 months.

Limitations of the study include reliance on previously published data collected from 1995 to 2013 and the assumption that the data were applicable to 2010, spotty coverage of countries in the WHO data, and the assumption that proportions of resistance in adults are parallel among children.

Abstract
-------
Background: Isoniazid has been the backbone of tuberculosis chemotherapy for 6 decades. Resistance to isoniazid threatens the efficacy of treatment of tuberculosis disease and infection. To inform policies around treatment of tuberculosis disease and infection in children, we sought to estimate both the proportion of child tuberculosis cases with isoniazid resistance and the number of incident isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis cases in children, by region.

Methods: We determined the relationship between rates of isoniazid resistance among child cases and among treatment-naive adult cases through a systematic literature review. We applied this relationship to regional isoniazid resistance estimates to estimate proportions of childhood tuberculosis cases with isoniazid resistance. We applied these proportions to childhood tuberculosis incidence estimates to estimate numbers of children with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis.

Results: We estimated 12.1 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 9.8 per cent to 14.8 per cent) of all children with tuberculosis had isoniazid-resistant disease, representing 120 872 (95 per cent CI 96 628 to 149 059) incident cases of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in children in 2010. The majority of these occurred in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia regions; the European region had the highest proportion of child tuberculosis cases with isoniazid resistance, 26.1 per cent (95 per cent CI: 20.0 - 33.6 per cent).

Conclusions: The burden of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in children is substantial, and risk varies considerably by setting. The large number of child cases signals extensive ongoing transmission from adults with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis. The risk of isoniazid resistance must be considered when evaluating treatment options for children with disease or latent infection to avoid inadequate treatment and consequent poor outcomes.

The authors of this study reported in 2013 from a literature review of reports of children with tuberculosis disease who had isolates tested for susceptibility to isoniazid that in 35 of the 55 studies that reported rifampin susceptibility results for children with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis, the majority of the strains resistant to isoniazid were not resistant to rifampin -- that is, were not multidrug resistant (MDR) (MDR is defined by resistance to at least INH and rifampin.) (2). The authors reported in 2014 that the local risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children under 15 years of age and in treatment-naive adults with tuberculosis were nearly identical (3).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimates that in the United States in 2003, 10.6 per cent of foreign-born persons with TB had TB with primary isoniazid resistance, compared with 4.6 per cent of US-born persons with TB (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5412a1.htm).

The American Thoracic Society, CDC, and Infectious Diseases Society of America have made the following recommendations for the treatment of TB in children in the US (4):

"Because of the high risk of disseminated tuberculosis in infants and children younger than 4 years of age, treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis of tuberculosis is suspected. In general, the regimens recommended for adults are also the regimens of choice for infants, children, and adolescents with tuberculosis, with the exception that ethambutol is not used routinely in children [because of the difficulty doing visual testing in young children]. Because there is a lower bacillary burden in childhood-type tuberculosis there is less concern with the development of acquired drug resistance. However, children and adolescents may develop "adult-type" tuberculosis with upper lobe infiltration, cavitation, and sputum production. In such situations an initial phase of 4 drugs should be given until susceptibility is proven. When clinical or epidemiologic circumstances (Table 6) suggest an increased probability of INH resistance, EMB can be used safely at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg per day, even in children too young for routine eye testing. Streptomycin, kanamycin, or amikacin also can be used as the 4th drug, when necessary.

"Most studies of treatment in children have used 6 months of INH and RIF supplemented during the first 2 months with PZA. This 3-drug combination has a success rate of greater than 95 per cent and an adverse drug reaction rate of less than 2 per cent. Most treatment studies of intermittent dosing in children have used daily drug administration for the first 2 weeks to 2 months. DOT should always be used in treating children.

"Because it is difficult to isolate _M. tuberculosis_ from a child with pulmonary tuberculosis, it is frequently necessary to rely on the results of drug susceptibility tests of the organisms isolated from the presumed source case [usually a family member] to guide the choice of drugs for the child. In cases of suspected drug-resistant tuberculosis in a child or when a source case isolate is not available, specimens for microbiological evaluation should be obtained via early morning gastric aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, or biopsy."

In resource-poor countries, testing for isoniazid resistance is usually not done; optimally testing for rifampin resistance, which is used as a surrogate marker of MDR-TB, is done. One recent study reported that, while testing for INH mono-resistance may still confer individual-level benefit (through improved outcomes if INH-resistance was recognized and the treatment adjusted accordingly) and also likely will be cost-effective, efforts to change population-level epidemiology of MDR-TB should focus on widely implementing rapid tests for TB and RIF-resistance rather than additionally incorporating tests for INH-mono-resistance (4).
