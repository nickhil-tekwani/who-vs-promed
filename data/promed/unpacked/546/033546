Nearly 200 cases of leishmaniasis have been registered in the
southern province of Missan [Maysan], about 350 km south of Baghdad,
a local health official said on 19 May 2009. "So far, we have
registered 190 cases of leishmaniasis in different parts of the
province, both in urban and rural areas and among different age
groups," Zamil Shia, the provincial health chief, told IRIN. Shia
said the epidemic was manageable at present and teams were monitoring
affected areas.

Leishmaniasis is also known as Baghdad boil, oriental sore, Aleppo
button, Jericho boil and Delhi boil. In its most unpleasant form --
visceral leishmaniasis -- organ failure and death can result. It is
transmitted by the bite of the female sandfly. Dogs and other animals
can act as a source of infection to humans. Rodents, especially
certain species of rodent, are considered the main carriers.

Shia said people in affected areas tended to sleep in the open and in
places with poor sanitation.

According to the World Health Organization, the 20 or so infective
species or subspecies of the leishmaniasis parasite cause a range of
symptoms like fever, malaise, weight loss and anaemia, as well as --
in its visceral form -- swelling of the spleen, liver and lymph
nodes. Cutaneous leishmaniasis -- the most common form -- causes
1-200 simple skin lesions which self-heal within a few months but
which leave unsightly scars. The disease's incubation period is up to
6 months, so doctors say thousands could have the disease without knowing it.

[Leishmaniasis is widespread in Iraq, and ProMED reported
leishmaniasis from the southern province in May 2008 (see below).
Leishmania is transmitted by sandflies, and small rodents serve as
reservoirs. Control measures are vector and rodent control. Please
refer to the WHO statement concerning visceral leishmaniasis in Iraq,
published in ProMED-mail (Leishmaniasis - Iraq: comments 20030602.1348).
