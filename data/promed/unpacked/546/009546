[Dr. Arnon Shimshony was kind enough to bring this official report to our
attention. - Mod.CHC]
"Emergency report" by the Director General of the Malaysian Veterinary
Services, Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor, to the OIE, published in their weekly
DISEASE INFORMATION of 28 May 1999, Vol. 12 - No. 20.
Text of a report received on 17 May 1999 from Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor,
Director General of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Kuala
Lumpur; Report date: 15 May 1999.
1. History of human cases
The outbreak of Nipah disease in Malaysia, which has caused human
fatalities, has been attributed to a viral infection in pigs. The outbreak
in 1998/99 has been investigated and traced back to earlier incidences
which were provisionally diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis (JE).
In 1997, the illness was reported in a number of pig-farm workers, one of
whom died. Most of them received treatment at private hospitals.
In 1998, more cases of viral encephalitis were reported and two more
villages were affected. A special Task Force comprising officers from the
medical and veterinary departments was formed. By the end of 1998, ten
workers from Tambun, Ulu Piah and Ampang had died from the disease after
being in a coma for periods ranging from four days to a few weeks. Among
the viral encephalitis cases, only about 15% were confirmed as JE, leaving
the remaining 85% undetermined.
By mid-December 1998, the disease had spread to Sikamat, about 60 km south
of Kuala Lumpur, through movement of infected pigs. Seven of the 20 workers
developed the disease and five died in January 1999.
By March 1999 the disease had spread to the major pig producing area of
Bukit Pelandok in the State of Negeri Sembilan.

The Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Malaya, successfully
isolated an unknown virus. The virus was sent to the Arbovirus Research
Center, Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado, United
States of America. There, the Malaysian and United States scientists worked
together to study the characteristics of the virus. On 18 March 1999, the
CDC announced that the isolate was of a genus closely related to the Hendra
virus, a paramyxovirus first isolated in Brisbane, Australia, in 1994. On
10 April 1999, the isolate was officially called the Nipah virus, named
after the village Sungai Nipah in Negeri Sembilan, where the worker from
whom the virus was isolated had died.
The disease spread to more farms and, from 1 March to 10 May 1999, a total
of 224 suspected cases of viral encephalitis occurred in Negeri Sembilan
with 80 fatalities.
Out of a total of 258 persons suspected of being infected with the Nipah
virus, 100 have died.
As a measure to control the spread of the new virus, farmers and their
families have been instructed to leave their villages and settle
temporarily in schools and community halls outside the affected district.
Assistance has been sought from experts in the CDC and Australia to help
with the diagnosis and control of Nipah disease.
2. Clinical picture in humans
- Mild to severe clinical signs.
- Fever and headaches of varying severity.
- A few patients present drowsiness and disorientation, later falling into
a coma and requiring artificial respiration.
- A majority of the patients in a coma subsequently die
- The full course of the disease is still unknown.
- The incubation period is postulated to be from one to three weeks.
Some patients have shown serological reactivity without clinical signs.
3. Disease in pigs
- Generally, mortality is low but morbidity is high.
- Spread of the disease between and within pig farms has not been established.
3.1 Clinical signs
a) Weaners and porkers
- Mild to severe coughing, with varying reports of mortality and morbidity.
b) Sows and boars
- Disease more pronounced, including moderate to severe respiratory
disorder characterised by dyspnoea, convulsions and death.
- In boars, disease may be acute, death occurring within several hours.
Thick mucopurulent discharge and pneumonia in less severe forms.
c) Piglets, gilts and sows
- Convulsions and other neurological signs.
3.2 Necropsy
- Varying degrees of consolidation of the lungs, primarily the
diaphragmatic lobes (prominently thickened interlobular septa).
- Cut surface showed exudate of varying consistency in the bronchi.
- Kidneys showed congestion both on the surface and in the cortex.

- Brain appeared normal except in a case with petechial haemorrhage.
- Other visceral organs appeared normal.
4. Disease in other animals
Serologically positive dogs, cats, horses and goats were found in the
infected areas.
Dogs: lesions observed at necropsy of dogs presenting clinical signs were
similar to those of affected pigs. Kidneys showed severe haemorrhage and
congestion. Exudates were present in the trachea and bronchi.
5. Mode of transmission
Transmission studies in animals are being carried out at the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), CSIRO (1), Australia.
5.1 Oral inoculation
- Incubation period for clinical signs was 14 to 16 days.
- Clinical signs and gross pathology were mild.
- Virus isolation work is in progress.
5.2 Parenteral inoculation
- Two inoculated pigs developed a more severe disease, one showing a
central nervous system syndrome and the other a respiratory tract syndrome.
Signs developed within 7 to 10 days of challenge.
5.3 In-contact pigs
- Infection occurred quickly, possibly at first contact. Neutralising
antibodies were detected at day 14.
- Virus multiplication in the tonsils and respiratory epithelium, together
with contaminated cellular debris in the lumen of air passages in the lung,
suggests that the virus may at least be transmitted by pharyngeal and
bronchial secretions.
Other results are pending.
6. Diagnosis
6.1 Virus isolation
Tissue samples of lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart and brain were
collected from necropsied animals for virological examination. Samples were
sent to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.
Molecular studies done on the virus isolate showed a 21% difference in the
nucleotide sequence and an 11% difference in the amino acid sequence
compared to the Hendra virus.
6.2 Serological tests
Two laboratories, namely the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Ipoh, and
the Task Force Laboratory at the Department of Medical Microbiology,
University of Malaya, were selected to carry out serological tests on the
veterinary and human sera respectively. Samples were tested using the IgG
and IgM capture ELISA at the above laboratories and virus neutralisation
tests at AAHL, Geelong (Australia).

7. Results of serological surveillance in animals during the outbreak period
7.1 Pigs
In a previously infected farm, more than 95% of sows had Nipah virus
antibodies. More than 90% of the piglets had antibodies assumed to be
maternal antibodies. Antibody prevalence across all ages is currently being
studied in an infected farm.
7.2 Horses
At a farm in an infected area, 2 of the 47 polo horses were found to have
Nipah virus antibodies and were euthanised. All racehorses in the country
have tested negative.
7.3 Dogs
More than 50% of dogs captured in one of the infected areas were positive
to Nipah virus by IgG capture ELISA using Hendra antigen.
Antibodies in dogs in other infected areas are also being studied.
7.4 Cats
Out of 23 cats tested in the affected area, one was seropositive.
7.5 Bats
Out of 99 flying foxes tested, 15 were found to be positive to the virus
neutralisation test for the Nipah virus.
7.6 Rodents
To date, serum samples from rats trapped in infected areas have all been
negative. Further tests are in progress.
7.7 Other animals
Sera have also been collected from cattle, goats, sheep, squirrels, wild
boar, wild birds, poultry and ostriches for later testing.
8. Control and eradication programme
8.1 Control Programme for Nipah Disease Phase I
With the discovery of the aetiology of the disease, a programme was
developed for immediate eradication of the disease by mass culling of pigs.
>From 28 February to 26 April 1999, a total of 901,918 pigs were culled in
four infected areas (one in the State of Perak, one in Selangor and two in
Negeri Sembilan).
8.2 Control Programme for Nipah Disease Phase II
A surveillance programme was developed to detect previously infected farms
by testing for the presence of pigs with antibodies to the Nipah virus.
All farms outside the previously designated high risk areas will be
screened by taking a statistically valid random sample of sows for
detection of Nipah virus antibodies. Farms with two consecutive negative
tests performed within an interval of three weeks will be accorded
"provisionally free" status. However, farms found to be positive during the
first or second tests will be depopulated.
To date, 235 farms have been tested, of which 9 were found to be positive.
A total of 23,736 animals and 11,458 pigs in 4 of the positive farms have
been culled. In this programme a total of 824 farms with a 1.6 million SPP
(standing pig population) will be tested.
9. Actions for the future
Investigations will continue in order to ascertain the natural hosts of the
Nipah virus and the modes of transmission to domestic animals and humans.
The outbreak has given the Government of Malaysia an opportunity to review
the status of the pig industry and the direction for revival of the industry.

[This is the first comprehensive report we have seen and may be the first
comprehensive report. Japanese encephalitis is no longer being reported as
the etiologic agent of Nipah disease and other steps forward obviously have
been taken. The overall mortality rate in humans is 38.8%. Many questions
remain (Are pigs persistently infected? Does Nipah virus react with
antibodies to paramyxoviruses other than Hendra virus? What is the
significance of antibody if "some patients have shown serological
reactivity without clinical signs"? and more). Nonetheless, the picture is
clearing. - Mod.CHC]
