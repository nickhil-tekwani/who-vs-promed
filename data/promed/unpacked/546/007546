Some more information appeared in the press (not necessarily through
official channels) concerning our second nvCJD case :
- a French woman, 36 years old, in the largest hospital in Paris;
- neurologic symptoms began several month ago, looking like psychatric
troubles;
- brain biopsy (not said which part) agreed by family, showed lesions
specific to nvCJD: florida (sic) spots ("plaques" in French);
- no specific known risk factor (= no known surgery or treatment that might
explain an iatrogenic case), and, I guess, we might say she was not
practicing body-building; [i.e. not taking steroids or growth hormone -
Mod.JW
- although done ante-mortem, the diagnosis is considered definite because of
the histological lesions;
- another case suspected of being nvCJD is said to be under investigation.
For those interested in the French position about [prevention, the report
ordered by the Prime Minister is available online in French. It is over 250
pages.

[Unfortunately Vincent did not reveal the site address for this 250pp French
position paper. If one were to assume that there is a fixed ratio between
reported bovine BSE cases and human nvCJD cases, one might deduce that the
French people are more susceptible than the British. - MHJ
