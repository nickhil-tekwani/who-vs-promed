Mumps outbreak at University of Richmond
----------------------------------------
Close to 20 University of Richmond students may be suffering from mumps. The university is warning the campus about the outbreak, which heightened since early March [2013]. Virginia Health Department officials say they have lab-confirmed 5 to 10 cases of mumps. Another 10 patients showed symptoms which may be resulting from the virus. University officials say they wasted no time in warning everyone on and off campus. Emails were mass sent to students, parents, faculty and staff.

Most children in the U.S. are immunized for MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella. Generally, you can't get into schools, including the University of Richmond, without [evidence of] those shots. However, doctors say that doesn't mean a rare outbreak of the virus can't happen. Dr. Parham Jaberi of the Virginia Department of Health says "Mumps is a similar illness] to a cold [with symptoms of) fever, headache, muscle aches. People feel tired. They may have a loss of appetite," said Jaberi. Another common symptom of mumps is swollen cheeks. Patients may also develop other inflammation of other organs, including testicular inflammation in men. Mumps is contagious. It's transferred through droplets of body fluid, mainly saliva. The best way to avoid mumps is to cover your mouth and wash your hands.

Doctors say mumps is usually not serious and can be fended off in a few days. The Virginia Health Department is trying to figure out why this mumps outbreak is happening. Officials say international traveling may be to blame. They also say there are universities in nearby states reporting cases of mumps

[It may be convenient to ascribe this outbreak of mumps on campus to international travel since outbreaks of mumps occur sporadically in universities and similar educational institutions at this time of year. However, genotyping of the outbreak virus strains would help to support such an interpretation. Alternatively, although the current mumps virus vaccine strains included in the MMR vaccine induce sufficient immunity to protect virtually all young children from mumps virus infection, the level of immunity maintained in older children and young adults may be less than adequate to provide protection under all circumstances.

Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The population within the city limits was 208 834 in 2012, with an estimated population of 1 282 509 for the Richmond Metropolitan Area.
