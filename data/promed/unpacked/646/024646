The EU [European Union] has returned to similar numbers of measles cases as seen before the large outbreaks of 2010 and 2011.

The new December [2012] Measles and Rubella Monitoring Report by ECDC shows that the total number of measles cases in the EU is 7016 for 2012 compared with some 30 000 for 2011. Individually, 12 of 29 EU/EEA [European Union/European Economic Area] countries had less than one case of measles per million population in the last 12 months, low enough to meet the WHO elimination target set for 2015. However, 5 countries: France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom accounted for 94 per cent of the reported cases.

Individually, 12 of 29 EU/EEA countries met the WHO elimination target of less than one case of measles per million population in the last 12 months.

The 29 contributing EU/ and EEA countries reported 7016 cases of measles from January to October 2012 and 8795 cases during the last 12-month period from November 2011 to October 2012.

[2] Global measles mortality
Date: Fri 15 Dec 2012
Source: The Lancet, Volume 380, Issue 9859, Pages 2071 - 209 [abbreviated extract, edited]
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61728-0/fulltext


In Measles Update 2012 (45), part 9, Dr Saifullah Jamro was reported as saying that 139 300 deaths from measles were reported in 2010 globally; that came to nearly 380 deaths every day or 15 deaths an hour. He observed that more than 95 per cent of measles-related deaths were reported from countries with weak health infrastructure.

This statement is confirmed in the systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, recently published in The Lancet. The relevant paragraph states that: "In 2010, there were 52-8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24-9 percent of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15-9 million (34-1 percent) of 46-5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2-5 to 1-4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3-4 to 2-8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3-1 to 2-2 million), measles (from 0-63 to 0-13 million), and tetanus (from 0-27 to 0-06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0-30 million in 1990 to 1-5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1-7 million in 2006."

There have been 40 cases of measles in Bolton this year [2012] compared with only one in 2011. These worrying statistics come after an outbreak in a secondary school and a nursery in Bolton last week. Health chiefs are growing concerned as there have also been a number of isolated cases, with no links to the outbreaks at Harper Green School, in Farnworth, or the private nursery in Bromley Cross. Parents in the borough are being urged to get children who have not had the MMR jab or who have not had the 2nd booster injection immunised to stop the spread of the disease The outbreak affected 23 children, mainly in years seven and eight [11-13 years of age. - Mod.SH], at Harper Green School, and about 10 babies at the nursery, who are under the age of 12.5 months old, the age at which they will be immunised. Of the children affected, 2 were hospitalised. In September 2012, 3 children living in the Hall Lane travellers' camp, in Moses Gate, were diagnosed with measles.

There has been a huge rise in measles cases in the UK this year [2012], and in Greater Manchester, there have been 98 confirmed cases this year, compared to 21 in 2011. The majority of cases have been in Bolton and Wigan. Graham Munslow, Health Protection Specialist at NHS [National Health Service] Bolton, has urged parents to make sure their child is vaccinated. He said: "People often think it is a childhood sickness, and they get over it, but there are a significant number of children who are left with significant problems for the rest of their lives. "It is not like chickenpox, measles is much more damaging to children." It can lead to serious conditions including bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, encephalitis, and meningitis.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has sent out warnings to parents regarding the measles outbreak and has urged parents to take care of vaccination in their children. The outbreak has sent 3 students of Park Community School in Barnstaple home. The HPA along with NHS [National Health Service] Devon and the school are now sending letters to parents to make sure they are informed of the disease outbreak.

The HPA is now involved in making people informed about this highly infectious disease and the need for vaccination. Symptoms of measles include cold with runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever, aches, and a dry cough. People mainly vulnerable to the disease are children, pregnant women, infants, people with HIV/AIDS, leukemia and other cancers, and organ transplants.

If any such symptoms are found in your child, don't send him or her to school, and keep your child away from other children. In addition, keep them isolated from persons who are most vulnerable to this disease.

Parents are being told to be on the lookout for signs of measles after outbreaks in neighbouring boroughs. Health chiefs have sent out warnings following confirmed cases in Bolton and other parts of Greater Manchester amid fears an outbreak could hit Wigan just before Christmas. Outbreaks have been confirmed at 2 schools in Bolton, and health chiefs are warning that the same could happen in Wigan at any moment.

Dr Rosemary McCann, interim director of the HPA's Greater Manchester Health Protection Unit, said: "This has been the worst year we've seen for measles for many years. It's a highly infectious disease that spreads easily amongst people who aren't fully immunised against it. Thankfully, MMR uptake rates amongst young children are now high and continuing to improve, but we are seeing cases in older unvaccinated children, teenagers and adults who were not fully vaccinated as children. We're also seeing measles in babies and toddlers who are too young to be vaccinated. These young babies will always be vulnerable when there is measles in a family or in the community generally. Parents of older children who weren't vaccinated as children should speak to the family doctor and arrange for them to be vaccinated now. Teenagers and young adults who missed out on immunisation as toddlers should understand that it is never too late. They should speak to their GPs and ask if it is appropriate for them to be vaccinated now."

The HPA is advising people with symptoms of measles to stay away from school, nursery, or work until 5 days have elapsed after the onset of a rash, and to telephone their GP or NHS walk-in centre before attending so that arrangements can be made for them to be treated in isolation from other patients.

The death of a 6 year old girl in the Pakistani province of Sindh over the weekend has increased the death toll from a measles outbreak to 28 people in the last 2 weeks. A local television station reported hospital sources as saying 7. They said the Upper Sindh region was still reeling from a series of floods that occurred in August and September 2012, according to APA.az [Azerbaijan Press Agency].

District health officer Dr Abdul Fatah Bughio said that he could not confirm the death toll, but he was certain there have been more than 100 measles cases reported in the region since the outbreak began. He said unsanitary conditions, unhygienic food, and general poverty have exacerbated the situation. Families in areas affected by flooding have reported that stagnant rain water is still surrounding their houses and that [they] are concerned because the authorities have yet to offer any help.

Dr Saifullah Jamro, from the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Medical University, said Pakistani health officials have confirmed 2143 measles cases across the country since the beginning of the year [2012, from an APA.az report]. The World Health Organization reported that a June 2012 measles outbreak in Sindh claimed the lives of 27 children under the age of 5.
