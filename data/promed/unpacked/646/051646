Leaf rust found on domestic wheat
---------------------------------
The Conquest milling wheat [variety] was bred 4 years ago by Plant &
Food Research and is showing signs of leaf rust this season on some
crops in Mid-Canterbury.

Plant & Food suspects it is the result of a new strain or pathotype of
the fungal disease, but is also not ruling out weather conditions.

Federated Farmers says it's concerning for the industry as Conquest
has performed very well against imported wheats.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. Different pathovars affect barley and rye. The
disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can
cause serious yield losses of over 40 percent in individual fields.
Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on
heads. As the crop ripens, spores are produced. Infection of the host
can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic
severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode"
suddenly during favourable weather.

The fungus is not soil-borne but spores are spread by wind and
mechanical means. It needs living tissue to survive between seasons
and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal
plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies
mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, and
control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring is important for
early discovery of infection so action can be taken to limit pathogen
spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

Monitoring programmes have been established in many affected areas to
detect emerging new strains. It is difficult to see how the 'weather
conditions' mentioned above as a possible alternative could have been
responsible for the reported resistance breakdown, but molecular data
will be needed to confirm a new strain.
