A strain [isolate?] of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that may unleash the
next global flu pandemic is showing resistance to Tamiflu, the antiviral
drug that countries around the world are now stockpiling to fend off the
looming threat. Experts in Hong Kong said on Friday [30 Sep 2005] that the
human H5N1 strain [isolate?] which surfaced in northern Viet Nam this year
had proved to be resistant to Tamiflu, a powerful antiviral drug.
They urged drug manufacturers to make more effective versions of Relenza,
another antiviral that is also known to be effective in battling the
much-feared H5N1. Relenza is inhaled [whereas Tamiflu is taken orally].
"There are now resistant H5N1 strains [isolates] appearing, and we can't
totally rely on one drug (Tamiflu)," William Chui, honorary associate
professor with the Department of Pharmacology at the Queen Mary Hospital in
Hong Kong, told Reuters. Chui was referring to the Tamiflu-resistant strain
of H5N1 [avian influenza] in Viet Nam. Chui also said general viral
resistance to Tamiflu was growing in Japan, where doctors habitually
prescribe the drug to fight common influenza.
Switzerland's Roche Holdings AG makes Tamiflu, known generically as
oseltamivir, and GalaxoSmithKline makes Relenza, or zanamivir.
"Manufacturers should think about producing an injectable form of Relenza
because resistance to Tamiflu has been seen in Japan and Viet Nam. Also
with injections, high doses can be given where necessary and onset time is
a lot faster," Chui said.
Drugs that are administered intravenously can be better absorbed in
patients who have stomach and acidity problems, another expert said. "We
don't have to worry about absorption, injections take drugs right in. But
if the patient takes them orally, maybe some amounts won't be absorbed or
some may be destroyed by stomach acids," said pharmacist Raymond Mak at
Queen Mary Hospital. Intravenous Relenza would also ensure faster onset,
which would be critical in patients who are seriously ill. "Orally taken
drugs take 3-4 hours to reach maximum blood concentration and 3-4 hours is
very critical in severe cases. But injectable Relenza takes only 30 minutes
to reach maximum blood concentration, this is a huge difference," Chui
said. With an intravenous antiviral, doctors can also vary the doses.
While the H5N1 virus is now mostly passed directly from bird to human,
health experts have warned that it is just a matter of time before it
mutates into a form that is easily transmissible between people. When that
happens, it may result in as many as 150 million human deaths.
2 reports in The Lancet this month said that resistance to anti-influenza
drugs was growing worldwide. In places such as China, drug resistance
exceeded 70 percent, suggesting that drugs like amantadine and rimantadine
will probably no longer be effective for treatment or as a preventive in a
pandemic outbreak of flu, the reports said.

Cause for Concern: Incidence of Adamantane Resistance among Influenza A
(H3N2) Viruses Isolated Worldwide from 1994 to 2005
------------------------------------------------
Adamantanes have been used to treat influenza A virus infections for many
years. Studies have shown a low incidence of resistance to these drugs
among circulating influenza viruses; however, their use is rising worldwide
and drug resistance has been reported among influenza A (H5N1) viruses
isolated from poultry and human beings in Asia. We sought to assess
adamantane resistance among influenza A viruses isolated during the past
decade from countries participating in WHO's global influenza surveillance
network.
We analysed data for influenza field isolates that were obtained worldwide
and submitted to the WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza at the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1 Oct 1994, and 31 Mar
2005. We used pyrosequencing, confirmatory sequence analysis, and
phenotypic testing to detect drug resistance among circulating influenza A
H3N2 (n=6524), H1N1 (n=589), and H1N2 (n=83) viruses.
More than 7000 influenza A field isolates were screened for specific amino
acid substitutions in the M2 gene known to confer drug resistance. During
the decade of surveillance, a significant increase in drug resistance was
noted, from 0.4 percent in 1994-1995 to 12.3 percent in 2003-2004. This
increase in the proportion of resistant viruses was weighted heavily by
those obtained from Asia, with 61 percent of resistant viruses isolated
since 2003 being from people in Asia.
Our data raise concerns about the appropriate use of adamantanes and draw
attention to the importance of tracking the emergence and spread of
drug-resistant influenza A viruses.

[Resistance to amantadine and rimantadine has been recorded previously, but
the high frequency of resistant virus where these drugs have been used
extensively over a considerable period suggests that their future
usefulness will be limited. Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir has generally not been observed. The recent
appearance of a Tamiflu-resistant avian H5N1 influenza virus in Viet Nam is
an alarming development. - Mod.CP]
