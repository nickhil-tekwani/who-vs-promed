Over the weekend [12-13 May 2018], the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 7 more suspected cases of Ebola, raising the totals from 4 Apr through 13 May 2018, to 39 confirmed, suspected, and probable cases, including 19 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 49 percent.

Only 2 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing, and 25 are probable. The remaining 12 cases are suspected.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said today [14 May 2018] that all cases have occurred in 3 health zones in the DRC: Bikoro (2 confirmed, 20 probable, 7 suspected cases), Iboko (3 probable, 5 suspected), and Wangata (2 probable). To date, 393 contacts have been identified and are being followed up.

Wangata health zone is adjacent to the large city of Mbandaka (population, 1.2 million, according to the WHO). Cases near a major city are a concern, as is the outbreak's location.

"The proximity of the affected area to the Congo River, which links to the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, increases the risk of cases occurring in neighboring countries," the WHO said in today's [14 May 2018] outbreak update. "Currently, WHO considers the public health risk to be high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the international level." ...

"In response to the current outbreak, the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC RC) has already mobilized 36 volunteers. At the headquarters level, a WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] specialist and a logistician are to be deployed on 12 May [2018] to be part of the joint assessment mission with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and other partners including MSF and WHO. The IFRC [International Federation of Red Cross] operations manager in DRC is also joining the team in the epicentre. In addition, DRC RC health director and IFRC colleagues have been participating in all crisis meetings on this specific outbreak. The DRC RC is using the available response stock assets from the 2017 Ebola outbreak response operation to kick start support for the ongoing outbreak in Equateur. To note, the Red Cross is amongst the 1st actors to send equipment to the epicentre of the epidemic."

[3] Vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV)
Date: Mon 14 May 2018 1655 GMT (0055 HKT)

The World Health Organization has deployed 4000 doses of vaccine along with emergency teams and equipment to the Democratic Republic of Congo to control an outbreak of Ebola, which is suspected to have infected 39 people, including 19 deaths.

The UN agency is working with the country's Ministry of Health and international nongovernmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières to conduct ring vaccinations across the affected region, where contacts of those infected, followed by contacts of those contacts, would all be vaccinated.

Though 4000 doses have been shipped, more are expected to be sent out, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevik confirmed. ...

"This outbreak is very close to the Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. And we are taking it very seriously because it is close to Mbandaka, a city of 1 million people," Fall said, adding that there are 2 suspected cases in Mbandaka, and the patients are being held in isolation.

The Ebola vaccine being provided, rVSV-ZEBOV, is an experimental vaccine that has been shown to be safe in humans and highly effective against the Ebola virus, according to the WHO. A 2016 study found it to be 100 percent effective in trials in Guinea in coordination with the country's Ministry of Health after the 2014-15 outbreak.

In Congo, vaccines will also be administered to local and international health care workers and front-line workers in both affected areas as well as the regions expected to be at risk should the outbreak continue to spread.

Any other persons with potential exposure to Ebola, such as laboratory workers, surveillance and contact teams, will also be vaccinated.

Anyone receiving the vaccine will then be checked 3, 14, 21, 42, 63, and 84 days later.

"Because it is an experimental vaccine, there are several steps to observe," Jasarevik said. In addition to an importation license, the WHO needs formal agreement on the research protocols with the government and local ethical review board approval for reasons of liability, and legal and insurance issues associated with use of experimental products, he added.

Last week [week of 7 May 2018], Peter Salama, deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response at the WHO, pointed out that use of the vaccine comes with many challenges, as it needs to be stored long-term at temperatures between -60 and -80 deg C (-76 to -112 deg F).

"This is not a simple logistical effort; ... This is a highly complex sophisticated operation in one of the most difficult terrains on Earth," Salama said.

Personal protective equipment, body bags, boxes for transportation, and interagency emergency health kits have been sent to the affected region.

Médecins Sans Frontières has set up 4 5-bed mobile isolation units to increase the hospital bed capacity in Bikoro, which is currently 15 beds. Bikoro hospital has sealed off a ward to diagnose suspected Ebola patients and provide treatment, according to UNICEF.

[This outbreak will provide a good test of the efficacy of the vaccine. One can only hope it will be effective at protecting individuals at high risk of exposure.

[4] Bikoro infrastructure -- 2016

Background information on Bikoro, 2016
--------------------------------------
Generally, Bikoro territory has a serious problem of road infrastructure. ...

The Mbandaka- Bikoro road was recently rehabilitated with European Union funding. Most sections are not maintained and are difficult to pass.

The provincial roads are mostly in poor condition for lack of maintenance.

The waterway through the lake remains the best [means of transportation] because it joins the Congo River to go to other provinces, including to Kinshasa the capital.

[The poor roads may prevent the virus from being easily carried to new locations, but it is a double-edged sword because it also complicates transport of emergency supplies and vaccine to affected areas. The traffic on the river between ports may present the greatest threat to containment of the virus. - Mod.LK]
