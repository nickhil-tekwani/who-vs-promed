US adults who previously had COVID-19 contracted the disease at more than 5 times the rate of those who were fully vaccinated, according to data published today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). [Bozio CH, Grannis SJ, Naleway AL, et al. Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 Among Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19-Like Illness with Infection-Induced or mRNA Vaccine-Induced SARS-CoV-2 Immunity -- Nine States, January-September 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 29 October 2021. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7044e1]

Rolling out vaccines during a pandemic is not easy, and people can get confused by evidence that shows COVID vaccines don't work perfectly, including a study yesterday showing that household spread with the delta (B1617.2) variant still happens after vaccination, albeit not as readily in the unvaccinated and not leading to severe cases (see today's CIDRAP News story https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/covid-vaccines-protect-against-delta-dont-fully-stop-disease-spread).

Yet the body of evidence continues to grow that, despite their imperfections, COVID-19 vaccines continue to work very well, and today's study adds to that. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who led the study, say of the results, "All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."

The researchers looked at data from 9 states on 201 269 hospitalizations for COVID-like illness from [1 Jan-2 Sep 2021]. Of these, 94 264 had molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, and 7348 (7.8%) had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Among that group, 1020 hospitalizations were among previously infected and unvaccinated people, and 6328 cases were among fully vaccinated people who were not previously infected.

Lab-confirmed COVID-19 was found in 324 (5.1%) of the fully vaccinated people and in 89 (8.7%) of the unvaccinated, previously infected people.

In comparing unvaccinated people who were infected 90-179 days after a previous infection compared with those who were vaccinated 90-179 days before their COVID infection, the researchers found the incidence of infection to be 5.49 times higher in the unvaccinated (95% confidence interval, 2.75 to 10.99).

The authors conclude, "These findings suggest that among hospitalized adults with COVID-19-like illness whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, vaccine-induced immunity was more protective than infection-induced immunity against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19."

In what could be an anomaly, the United States reported 99 384 new cases yesterday and 1776 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The day before officials noted 76 957 new COVID-19 cases and 2141 deaths. All told, the country now has had 45 892 544 COVID cases and 744 955 deaths. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 72 569, with 1381 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html]

And the CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 57.8% of Americans are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 66.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 8.7% of fully vaccinated people have received a booster dose. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

Hamstrung by COVID-19 and supply shortages, the US economy slowed sharply to a 2% annual growth rate in July [2021] through September [2021], the lowest quarterly growth since the recovery from the pandemic recession began last year, the Associated Press reported. [https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-10-28/us-economy-slowed-to-a-2-rate-last-quarter-in-face-of-covid]

In other industry news, the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for private-sector employers will allow companies to force workers who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine to pay for required weekly tests and masks, Bloomberg News reports. [https://tinyurl.com/dpxj2dce]

New York City is bracing for a shortage of police and firefighters as its COVID vaccination deadline approaches today, according to the New York Times. And Citigroup says that US-based employees must submit proof of COVID vaccination by [14 Jan 2022] if they want to stay employed, according to CNN.

While COVID-19 vaccines lower the likelihood of infection with the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 delta (B1617.2) variant, the virus can still be transmitted within households -- but less so than among unvaccinated people -- a study today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases finds. [Singanayagam A, Hakki S, Dunning J, et al. Community transmission and viral load kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Published: 29 Oct 2021. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00648-4]

Led by Imperial College London researchers, the study evaluated community COVID-19 transmission and viral loads among 602 vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts of 471 mildly ill coronavirus outpatients ages 5 years and older from [13 Sep 2020-15 Sep 2021]. For up to 20 days, 133 participants contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples, regardless of whether they had symptoms.

Of 205 household contacts of COVID-19 patients infected with delta, 62% had received two vaccine doses, 19% had received one dose, and 19% were unvaccinated.

The secondary attack rate, or the percentage of contacts infected by the index patient, was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-33%) in fully vaccinated participants, compared with 38% (95% CI, 24%-53%) in the unvaccinated.

Among household contacts of fully vaccinated COVID-19 patients, the secondary attack rate was comparable to that of household contacts of unvaccinated index patients (25% [95% CI, 15%-35%] for vaccinated vs 23% [95% CI, 15%-31%] for unvaccinated patients).

Of 31 infections, 12 (39%) in fully vaccinated COVID-19 household contacts arose from epidemiologically connected fully vaccinated index patients; genomic and virologic analysis in 3 pairs of index cases and contacts found a similar percentage.

While vaccinated participants cleared the coronavirus faster than their unvaccinated counterparts, both had similar peak viral loads, which the researchers said could explain its ease in spreading among household members, regardless of vaccination status. Nor did peak viral load differ by variant type, but it increased some with age (difference in peak log10 viral load per milliliter [mL] between those aged 10 and 50 years, 0.39 [95% credible interval, -0.03-0.79]).

Average viral load also declined faster in fully vaccinated participants infected with the delta variant than among unvaccinated participants infected with pre-alpha (B117), alpha, or delta variants. Median time between receipt of a 2nd vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected versus uninfected participants (101 vs 64 days), which the study authors said could be attributed to waning vaccine-induced immunity.

Co-senior author Ajit Lalvani, MD, of Imperial College London, said in a Lancet news release that the findings demonstrate that vaccine alone is not enough to prevent infection with and transmission of the delta variant. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933075]

"The ongoing transmission we are seeing between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe COVID-19," he said. "We found that susceptibility to infection increased already within a few months after the 2nd vaccine dose -- so those eligible for COVID-19 booster shots should get them promptly."

In a commentary in the same journal, Annelies Wilder-Smith, MD, PhD, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the study underscores the importance of vaccination, because vaccinated contacts were better protected against delta infection than the unvaccinated. "All breakthrough infections were mild, and no hospitalisations and deaths were observed," she wrote. "But these results also highlight that breakthrough infections continue to occur in the vaccinated."

Wilder-Smith noted that the study showed that vaccine-related reduction of delta variant transmission among household contacts is minimal and said the findings have urgent public health implications in terms of achieving higher COVID-19 vaccination rates and studying whether booster doses will lower viral transmission.

"Research efforts should be directed towards enhancing existing vaccines or developing new vaccines that also protect against asymptomatic infections and onward transmission," she concluded. "Until we have such vaccines, public health and social measures will still need to be tailored towards mitigating community and household transmission in order to keep the pandemic at bay."

[3] Inner ear infection
Date: Fri 29 Oct 2021

Many COVID-19 patients have reported symptoms affecting the ears, including hearing loss and tinnitus. Dizziness and balance problems can also occur, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be able to infect the inner ear.

A new study from MIT and Massachusetts Eye and Ear provides evidence that the virus can indeed infect cells of the inner ear, including hair cells, which are critical for both hearing and balance. The researchers also found that the pattern of infection seen in human inner ear tissue is consistent with the symptoms seen in a study of 10 COVID-19 patients who reported a variety of ear-related symptoms.

The researchers used novel cellular models of the human inner ear that they developed, as well as hard-to-obtain adult human inner ear tissue, for their studies. The limited availability of such tissue has hindered previous studies of COVID-19 and other viruses that can cause hearing loss.

Konstantina Stankovic, a former associate professor at Harvard Medical School and former chief of otology and neurotology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, who is now the Bertarelli Foundation Professor and chair of the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine, co-led the study. Minjin Jeong, a former postdoc in Stankovic's laboratory at Harvard Medical School, who is now at Stanford Medical School, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today [29 Oct 2021] in Communications Medicine.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, Gehrke and Stankovic began working together on a project to develop cellular models to study infections of the human inner ear. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus, mumps virus, and hepatitis viruses can all cause deafness, but exactly how they do so is not well-understood.

In early 2020, after the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged, the researchers altered their plans. At Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Stankovic started to see patients who were experiencing hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness, who had tested positive for COVID-19. "It was very unclear at the time whether this was causally related or coincidental, because hearing loss and tinnitus are so common," she recalls.

She and Gehrke [Lee Gehrke, the Hermann L.F. von Helmholtz Professor in MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science] decided to use the model system they were working on to study infection of SARS-CoV-2. They created their cellular models by taking human skin cells and transforming them into induced pluripotent stem cells. Then, they were able to stimulate those cells to differentiate into several types of cells found in the inner ear: hair cells, supporting cells, nerve fibers, and Schwann cells, which insulate neurons.

These cells could be grown in a flat, 2-dimensional layer or organized into 3-dimensional organoids. In addition, the researchers were able to obtain samples of hard-to-obtain inner ear tissue from patients who were undergoing surgery for a disorder that causes severe attacks of vertigo or for a tumor that causes hearing loss and dizziness.

In both the human inner ear samples and the stem-cell-derived cellular models, the researchers found that certain types of cells -- hair cells and Schwann cells -- express the proteins that are needed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the cells. These proteins include the ACE2 receptor, which is found on cell surfaces, and 2 enzymes called furin and transmembrane protease serine 2, which help the virus to fuse with the host cell.

The researchers then showed that the virus can actually infect the inner ear, specifically the hair cells and, to a lesser degree, Schwann cells. They found that the other cell types in their models were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The human hair cells that the researchers studied were vestibular hair cells, which are involved in sensing head motion and maintaining balance. Cochlear hair cells, which are involved in hearing, are much harder to obtain or generate in a cellular model. However, the researchers showed that cochlear hair cells from mice also have proteins that allow SARS-CoV-2 entry.

The pattern of infection that the researchers found in their tissue samples appears to correspond to the symptoms observed in a group of 10 COVID-19 patients who reported ear-related symptoms following their infection. Nine of these patients suffered from tinnitus, 6 experienced vertigo, and all experienced mild to profound hearing loss. Damage to cochlear hair cells, which can cause hearing loss, is usually evaluated by measuring otoacoustic emissions -- sounds given off by sensory hair cells as they respond to auditory stimulation. Among the 6 COVID-19 patients in the study who underwent this testing, all had reduced or absent otoacoustic emissions.

While this study strongly suggests that COVID-19 can cause auditory and balance problems, the overall percentage of COVID-19 patients who have experienced ear-related issues is not known.

"Initially this was because routine testing was not readily available for patients who were diagnosed with Covid, and also, when patients were having more life-threatening complications, they weren't paying much attention to whether their hearing was reduced or whether they had tinnitus," Stankovic says. "We still don't know what the incidence is, but our findings really call for increased attention to audio-vestibular symptoms in people with Covid exposure."

Possible routes for the virus to enter the ears include the Eustachian tube, which connects the nose to the middle ear. The virus may also be able to escape from the nose through small openings surrounding the olfactory nerves, Stankovic says. That would allow it to enter the brain space and infect cranial nerves, including the one that connects to the inner ear.

The researchers now hope to use their human cellular models to test possible treatments for the inner ear infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.

Abstract
The symptomatology of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 infection runs the entire gamut of mild to moderate and serious illness among the affected individuals. As listed in recent literature, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, olfactory and gustatory systems are commonly involved. With the growing knowledge about the disease, varied manifestations have been identified and lately, otorhinolaryngology dysfunctions in COVID 19 have been described. Hearing loss in the COVID era is one of the emerging areas of concern and calls for further research in the field for a better understanding and treatment of this entity.

This study was designed to assess the audiological profile among 100 mild to moderately affected COVID-19 individuals, so as to make a contribution to the emerging literature on otologic manifestations in COVID 19. In our case series, high-frequency hearing loss and referred OAE (otoacoustic emissions [sounds given off by sensory hair cells as they respond to auditory stimulation]) was noted among a significant number of COVID-19 positive patients. This was even observed in patients without any otologic symptoms. Hence, early identification and intervention if required help to give a better quality of life to the patient. - Mod.LK]
