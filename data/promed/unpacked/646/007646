2000/050 Weed hosts of _Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B in Italy
-----------------------------------------------------------
In Central Italy, laboratory studies were carried out on the host
preference and performance of _Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B (also referred to
as _B. argentifolii_ - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) on weeds found around
cultivated greenhouses. 18 weed species were proposed to whiteflies in a
choice test, and several parameters of the insect life cycle were measured
to assess the effects of the different host plants on the developmental
rate. Out of the 18 weed species, 10 were accepted by _B. tabaci_ biotype B
populations. After 72 h, whiteflies showed a marked preference for _Sonchus
oleraceus_ and _Solanum nigrum_ (53 % of the total insect population). A
large part of the remaining population preferred: _Conyza canadensis_,
_Euphorbia helioscopia_, _E. peplus_, _Trifolium repens_, and a very low
number of insects were found on _Ricinus communis_, _Euphorbia characias_,
_E. maculata_ and _E. dendroides_. The life table statistics coincided with
the ranking of host preference. The authors noted that even in the absence
of cultivated host plants such as tomato, courgette etc., _B. tabaci_
biotype B can find weed hosts on which it can complete its development.
However, they stressed that these laboratory studies still need to be
confirmed in field experiments.
Note: the EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of _B.
tabaci_ biotype B in Italy.
