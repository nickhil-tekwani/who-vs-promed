Rabies killed 201 people in China last month [May 2007], staying at
the top of the list of the most deadly infectious diseases in the
country, state media said on Tuesday [12 Jun 2007]. Rabies has topped
the list for the last 13 months, except in March when tuberculosis
came first, the China Daily said, blaming dogs for spreading the
disease.
Beijing has introduced a "one family, one dog" policy and last year
launched a campaign against unregistered dogs. The State Food and
Drug Administration also said last year it would severely punish
companies that produce fake and poor quality rabies vaccines, after
several people reportedly died from substandard vaccines.
Last year, Shanghai implanted digital chips in the ears of 65 000
dogs to improve "canine management" and prevent the spread of rabies.
Pet dogs were shunned in the days of Mao Zedong as a symbol of
bourgeois decadence but have become increasingly popular in the past
decade with improved living standards.

[It would be of interest to know in which provinces and cities these
human rabies fatalities occurred, and what proportion of human
exposures are due to pet (owned) animals versus which to unowned
street or stray dogs. It is not clear from this article if vaccines
used for human post-exposure treatment or for dog vaccinations are
of suspect quality.
In either case, the safe, potent rabies vaccines are a key element in
rabies control for both humans and for animals. - Mod.TY]
