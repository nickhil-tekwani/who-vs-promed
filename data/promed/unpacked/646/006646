[The recent epidemic of diarrheal diseases in South Korea is not amebic
dysentery. Most of the reported cases are culture positive for _Shigella
sonnei_.

[Dr. Oh has indicated in a response to my inquiry that the error was caused
by a journalist's mis-interpretation of the Ministry of Health reports. A
single sporadic case of amebic dysentery was identified at the same time
that shigellosis was found to be responsible for the larger outbreak of
dysentery. We appreciate the correction. - Mod.ES
