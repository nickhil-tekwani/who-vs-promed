Serious threat to the citrus industry
-------------------------------------
The most devastating disease of citrus, tristeza, is present in
Morocco. Strains of the virus were detected in Larache
[Tangier-Tetouan Region]. Administration and affected professional
groups prepare for the fight. Is Morocco going to be faced with a
catastrophe, at least for its citrus exports whose volume is expected
to double by 2020? The citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the cause of
the disappearance of millions of trees in Argentina, Brazil, USA,
Spain, and Venezuela.

A meeting was scheduled yesterday [19 Feb 2009] between professional
groups and officials of the Directorate of Plant Protection,
Technical Control and Fraud Prevention. According to its director,
Abderrahmane Hilali, "The objective is to raise awareness of the
urgency for action, but also to mobilise everyone to fight the
scourge."

Control measures will start with the uprooting of old plantations.
"Especially where the strains were found in trees derived from
non-controlled grafts from the 1930s," says Mustapha Zemzami, head of
the Directorate for Agricultural Development. For Zemzami, whose
doctoral thesis addresses precisely this disease, emergency action
must be geared towards the detection and eradication of outbreaks,
without losing sight of tightening border controls because the
long-distance spread is through contaminated plant material.

Tristeza is also spread by aphids. "These insects are the natural
vectors, and 3 species exist in Morocco. But the most threatening is
_Toxoptera citricida_ [brown citrus aphid]," says Zemzami. This aphid
has not yet been identified in Morocco, but is present in the north
of the Iberian peninsula. Vigilance must be rigorous and controls
should include plant material as well as humans and means of
transport.

For the moment, measures to limit the damage are put into place. "In
Spain, over 60 percent of citrus plantations are living with the
disease," said Zemzami, "through the use of plants tolerant to the
virus. But we must control the spread of the disease."

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered
to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses. Besides citrus
species (family of _Rutacea_), it affects hosts in only few other
families, and it appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown.
Different strains of CTV may vary in severity, and symptoms also
depend on the citrus variety and the scion- rootstock combination.
The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of
_Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and can also be
transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. CTV has been included
on the alert lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation
(EPPO).

Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline,
stem pitting, and a mild type, and may occur singly or in
combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk
even in CTV-affected areas. It is not stated above to which group(s)
the strains recently identified in Morocco belong. Disease management
for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of
inoculum, and vector control. For more information on CTV please see
