A Massachusetts resident who first tested positive for brucellosis has now been confirmed to not have the infection, according to an email from the assistant commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR).

"While initial test results did show up positive, further, more specific and accurate testing by the CDC confirmed that the person does not have brucellosis," Nathan L'Etoile wrote in the message forwarded by the NOFA/Massachusetts Raw Milk Network.
As a result, the MDAR "will be rescinding the Cease and Desist from the sale of Raw Milk" order that had been issued in the state last week, the email stated.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), in an email, also confirmed that "the patient did test negative for brucellosis. The milk and the cows also tested negative for any brucellosis bacteria. Neither DPH or DAR have any health concerns at this time."

On 20 Jan 2012, the MDAR and the DPH issued a consumer alert for raw milk from Twin Rivers Farm in Ashley Falls, MA "due to the possibility of raw milk being contaminated with Brucella." That earlier news release stated, in part: "This investigation is being conducted in response to a suspected human case, following an individual's contact with this farm. The presence of Brucella in raw milk represents a significant danger to public health."

[It is now apparent that the diagnosis of brucellosis in this case is incorrect due to a false positive result. It was not stated in the initial report how the diagnosis was initially made, either by serological and microbiological means. It is most likely that a commercial laboratory antibody test for brucellosis was the culprit rather than a culture report for 2 reasons. The main reason relates to the fact that every assay has some degree of false positive tests and if the assay is done in a low prevalence population, many of the positives will be false positives. Additionally, culture of brucellae usually takes, especially on primary isolation, more time than it took to become positive here.

It still may be the case that the individual's illness was related to the ingestion of the raw milk but the diagnosis is not brucellosis. - Mod. LL]

[Any time there is a suspected human case of brucellosis there is traceback to the dairy that may have produced the milk or been involved in the disease. In this case the dairy is known so the animals in question would have undergone a series of testing. There are many tests used before an animal is deemed to be positive. Each test has a certain level of sensitivity and specificity associated with it. Ultimately it means that no test is perfect. When there are cases where a test appears to be positive, then one has to examine what makes a test appear to be positive. Some of the animal tests cross react with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ which the animals can harbor. This bacterium can also be transferred by dirty milking equipment or by operators with dirty hands.

Each animal at the dairy will be subject to blood tests and may also be subject to milk test.

Microscopic examination of smears stained with the Stamp's modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen method can be useful for a presumptive diagnosis, particularly if the direct examination is supported by serology. Brucella species are not truly acid-fast, but they are resistant to decolorization by weak acids, and stain red against a blue background. Brucellae are coccobacilli or short rods, usually arranged singly but sometimes in pairs or small groups. This test is not definitive. Other organisms such as _Chlamydophila abortus_ and _Coxiella burnetii_ can resemble Brucella. Immunostaining is sometimes used to identify Brucella in smears.

Serology can be used for a presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis, or to screen herds. Serological tests used to test individual cattle and herds include the buffered Brucella antigen tests (rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test), complement fixation, indirect or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or the fluorescence polarization assay. Other serological tests include rivanol precipitation, acidified antigen procedures and the serum agglutination test (tube or microtiter test). Supplemental tests such as complement fixation or rivanol precipitation are often used to clarify the results from plate or card agglutination tests. ELISAs or the Brucella milk ring test (BRT) can be used to screen herds by detecting antibodies in milk. In vaccinated cattle, the native hapten-based gel precipitation tests (gel diffusion or radial immunodiffusion tests) are sometimes used to distinguish vaccination from infection.

A brucellin allergic skin test can be used to test unvaccinated cattle for B. abortus. This test is performed by injecting the allergen intradermally into the caudal fold, the skin of the flank, or the side of the neck.

A definitive diagnosis can be made if B. abortus is cultured from an animal. Brucella spp. can be isolated on a variety of plain media, or selective media such as Farrell's medium or Thayer-Martin’s modified medium. Enrichment techniques can also be used. Brucella colonies usually become visible after two days growth. After four days of incubation, the colonies are round and approximately 1-2 mm in diameter with smooth margins. When the plates are viewed in daylight through a transparent medium, the colonies are translucent and a pale honey color. From above, they are convex and pearly white. Smooth (S) Brucella cultures can dissociate to rough (R) forms. These colonies are much less transparent and become more granular and dull. In crystal violet staining, rough colonies stain red and smooth colonies stain pale yellow. B. abortus can be identified to the species and biovar level by phage typing and cultural, biochemical and serological characteristics. Genetic techniques can also be used for biotyping. The vaccine strains (B. abortus strains S19 and RB51) can be distinguished from field strains by their growth characteristics and sensitivity to antibiotics and other additives.

In cattle, B. abortus causes abortions and stillbirths; abortions usually occur during the second half of gestation. Some calves are born alive but weak, and may die soon after birth. The placenta may be retained and secondary metritis can occur. Lactation may be decreased. After the first abortion, subsequent pregnancies are generally normal; however, cows may shed the organism in milk and uterine discharges. Epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis or testicular abscesses are sometimes seen in bulls. Infertility occurs occasionally in both sexes, due to metritis or orchitis/epididymitis. Hygromas, particularly on the leg joints, are a common signs in some tropical countries. Arthritis can develop in some long-term infections. Systemic signs do not usually occur in uncomplicated infections, and deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn. Infections in nonpregnant females are usually asymptomatic. This fact may cause an infection to be unnoticed and/or undiagnosed.

Likewise, there are reasons other than infections which may cause cows to abort their calves, such as genetic defects in the calves or severe mineral imbalances. While dairies will notice them, not every abortion has a definitive diagnosis attached to it. Other diseases causing abortion or epididymitis and orchitis should be considered. In cattle, the differential diagnosis includes trichomoniasis, vibriosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and various mycoses.

Animal inoculation is rarely used to isolate B. abortus, but may be necessary if other techniques fail. Guinea pigs or mice can be used.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and other genetic techniques (restriction fragment length polymorphism or Southern blotting) are available in some laboratories. Similar tests are used to diagnose B. abortus infections in species other than cattle, but each test must be validated in that species.

One might also ask if the diary workers had any illnesses. There are times when the dairy workers may be the first to have acquired brucellosis, or conversely have passed an infection to the animal.

Raw milk has come under fire from people concerned about diseases, as well as those who believe it to be the most healthy. The first case of bovine tuberculosis that is transmitted to a person consuming raw will may well be undoing of the raw milk industry. While cattle are tested, a disease such as tuberculosis that develops slowly and over time may not test positive for some time. But it could have devastating consequences to the individual(s) involved.

There are numerous state and federal regulations covering milk production. However, dairy inspections are done by people. Mistakes can and do happen. Political clout can cause some inspectors or their supervisors to ‘overlook’ some infractions of regulations listed in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO). Furthermore, every dairy wants to remain in business, and will complain to authorities including the state veterinarian, who in many cases are pseudo-politicians themselves. These authorities are often interested in keeping dairies open,  and commerce flowing, thus downgrading the importance of public health protection by overlooking regulations within the PMO.

Therefore, the ultimate questions remain: how safe is raw milk? How well are regulations about public health enforced? And for those who choose commerce over public health, will they be able to live with the issue of human death on their hands when it happens on their watch? – Mod.TG
