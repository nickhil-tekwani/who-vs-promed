Testing coordinated by the Colorado Department of Health and
Environment has confirmed that a Kiowa County man who died in late
February [2008] had contracted a hantavirus, [the viral cause of] a
serious respiratory disease carried by deer mice. The virus is
carried in their saliva, urine, and droppings. Infection occurs when
the virus becomes airborne and is inhaled, or by direct contact with
rodents, their droppings, or nests. There are no known cases of the
illness being passed from person to person.

"In an area where deer mice are common, and with spring approaching,
we need to be aware of areas where hantaviruses may be present," said
Renay Crain, Kiowa County Public Health Nurse. "A few steps will help
reduce the risk of contracting this illness. Preventing infection is
key," she concluded.

Hantavirus infection can be avoided by getting rid of mice in and
around the home, storage buildings, and other structures by using 4
basic steps:

- Rodent-proof your home and other buildings
- Eliminate food sources and hiding places
- Conduct year-round mouse control with traps or other systems
- Use precautions when entering or cleaning mouse infested buildings.

Before cleaning up a building that has had a mouse infestation, air
out the building thoroughly, then spray a mixture of water and bleach
on any accumulation of dust, dirt, and mouse droppings before
cleaning begins.

Deer mice are brown on top and white underneath, with a very distinct
separation of these colors [see link to image below]. They have large
ears relative to their head size. House mice on the other hand are
all gray and have small ears. The small, gray house mice commonly
found in urban areas do not carry the [virus that causes the] disease.

[Tony says that it is unusually early in the season to be finding
human cases of hantavirus infection in eastern Colorado. The number
of cases and deaths recorded in the USA (and other countries in the
Americas) from 1993 - April 2004 can be found on the PAHO website at
<http://www.paho.org/english/ad/dpc/cd/hantavirus-1993-2004.htm>
The case fatality rate overall in the USA has been 36 percent.
