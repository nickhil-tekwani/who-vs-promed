Revision of the International Health Regulations Progress Report, January
1998.
The International Health Regulations (IHR) are being revised in accordance
with a resolution adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1995 (WHA48.7),
as reported in August 1996, December 1996 and July 1997. The purpose of the
revision is to develop IHR which are adapted to the present volume of
international traffic and trade and take account of current trends in the
epidemiology of communicable diseases, including emerging disease threats.
The revised IHR will provide a mechanism for immediate notification of all
disease outbreaks of urgent international importance. The disease outbreaks
will be characterized initially by clinical syndrome rather than specific
diagnosis, in order to expedite notification. An outbreak will be
notifiable under the IHR only if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) it corresponds to the case definition of one of the specified
syndromes, and (2) it represents an event of urgent international
importance. Following notification to WHO, a decision to report the
outbreak publicly will be taken on the basis of consultation between WHO
and the Member State concerned. If further investigation indicates that an
outbreak is not after all of international significance, a statement to
this effect will also be published.
Routine occurrence of endemic diseases will not be notifiable under the
revised IHR. Consequently, cholera would no longer be notifiable unless an
outbreak were of urgent international importance, for instance if it
occurred in an area where the disease is not endemic, or involved a new
strain, unusual severity, or if trade and travel restrictions were applied
by other Member States.
The case definitions for the syndromes are intended to ensure that all
outbreaks of communicable diseases representing an international threat
will be notifiable under the revised IHR. The IHR will refer to the
specific syndromes which will be listed in the text, while the full case
definitions will be detailed in an annex to the IHR. This will allow for
modification of the detailed definitions in the future if necessary. The
syndromes proposed for notification are: acute haemorrhagic fever, acute
respiratory, acute diarrhoeal, acute jaundice, and acute neurological
syndromes, as well as a category covering other notifiable syndromes of
presumed infectious origin. Notification of a syndrome will normally be
followed by a report on the specific disease once the diagnosis has been
established. If the diagnosis is already known, the disease can be notified
rather than the corresponding syndrome.
The urgent international importance of an outbreak will determine whether
it should be notified. Criteria to assist national health authorities in
the assessment of urgent international importance will include the
following medical, epidemiological and operational issues: high risk of
international spread; unexpectedly high case-fatality rate; unusual
occurrence; newly recognized syndrome; high degree of interest by the
media; potential for imposition of trade or travel restrictions.
The IHR will address only the issues concerning outbreaks of urgent
international importance. Regular disease surveillance and reporting
activities will continue, including regular reporting to WHO. The revised
IHR will not supersede or interfere with any national or international
surveillance efforts.
The last progress report in July 1997 described the proposed changes in
notification requirements and the new structure for the IHR. Since then,
activities have focused on the following areas:
(1) Evaluation of the proposed notification by syndrome
A pilot study has been organized in selected countries to evaluate the
proposed new approach to notification. The objective of the study is to
test syndromic notification within existing national disease surveillance
systems. At central level, the national health authority will assess
incoming reports of disease outbreaks within the country against the IHR
case definitions and criteria indicating urgent international importance.
The pilot study will demonstrate whether the proposed new approach to
notification will facilitate the identification of, and response to,
disease outbreaks. It will also test the specificity and sensitivity of the
case definitions which will be refined if necessary on the basis of the
findings of the study. Draft operational guidelines to accompany the
revised IHR will be finalized in the light of experience gained. WHO will
work in partnership with the participating countries throughout the pilot
study, which will also test WHO's capacity to manage and respond to the
incoming information.
A final selection of the 20 countries invited to participate in the study
was made in consultation with the WHO Regional Offices. Seminars were
organized in each Region for the participating countries during
October-November 1997 to provide briefing on the revision of the IHR and
the pilot study to evaluate syndromic notification. These briefing seminars
will be completed for French- and Spanish-speaking countries in January
1998.
In addition to the prospective pilot study in the selected countries, a
retrospective study will also be carried out using outbreak reports
received by WHO during the past year. This will provide further information
for the evaluation of the proposed case definitions and the assessment of
whether syndromic notification would facilitate a more rapid response to
outbreaks.
(2) Provisional draft text of the revised IHR
The provisional draft text of the revised IHR has been prepared by a small
drafting group convened in September 1997 after wide-ranging international
consultations. The drafting group included legal and public health experts.
Preparation of this provisional draft text is now being completed, together
with 2 new annexes to the IHR. It is planned to send the text to all Member
States early this year as noted in the Weekly Epidemiological Record No. 50
of 12 December 1997. This text will be sent to Members of the Committee on
International Surveillance of Communicable Diseases for review. It will
also be sent to other intergovernmental and non governmental organizations
which have an interest in the IHR.
A progress report on the revision of the IHR was provided to the WHO
Executive Board in January 1998. The next steps in the revision process
will include:
- progress report to the World Health Assembly, May 1998;
- continuation of pilot studies to evaluate syndromic notification;
- refinement of IHR case definitions if necessary;
- completion of operational guidelines to accompany the revised IHR;
- modification of the provisional draft text of the revised IHR, based on
experience from the pilot study in 20 countries and comments received;
- meeting of the Committee on International Surveillance of Communicable
Diseases to finalize the text of the revised IHR; submission of the revised
IHR to the WHO Executive Board and World Health Assembly, planned for 1999.
Governments of 86 Member States have now designated focal points for the
revision of the IHR. Other governments are still welcome to designate a
representative for this purpose.
The next progress report will be published in July 1998.
