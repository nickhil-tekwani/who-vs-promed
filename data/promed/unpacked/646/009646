Hemorrhagic fever breaks out in southeastern European Russia
---------------------------------------------------------------
The sanitary and epidemiologic inspection of the Orenburg region in
southeastern European Russia has registered 115 cases of hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome this year, an inspection spokesman said on Wednesday.
The epidemic is only beginning in the region, the spokesman said. According
to specialists, the disease will break out seriously in late spring or
early summer.
Epidemiologists registered only one case of hemorrhagic fever in the region
in the first quarter of 1999. They explain this year's outbreak by the
growing number of [a species of wild rodent which is the main carrier of
this disease.
The population of [these wild rodents increases sharply every 4 years,
thus triggering spread of hemorrhagic fever. The last outbreak was
registered in 1997, so the next one is expected this year, the spokesman said.
