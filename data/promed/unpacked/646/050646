On 3 Jul 2006, public health authorities in northern Austria were informed
by a local hospital of a possible botulism outbreak affecting 4 people who
had been admitted 2 days earlier. A 5th patient had been admitted to
another hospital in the same province on 2 Jul 2006. An outbreak
investigation was started on 4 Jul 2006. The investigation linked the
disease to a private barbecue party which took place on 25 Jun 2006.
The barbecue party was organized by a local farmer and was attended by
about 20 people. The menu included home-slaughtered pork and bacon (both
homemade) and a homemade cold dessert (a pastry served with cream called
"Schaumrolle") and several salads containing commercially canned kidney
beans, boiled potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions with a dressing of
oil, vinegar and sour cream. Other commercially prepared items available
included bratwurst (veal and pork sausages), tomato ketchup, two different
dip sauces, bread, and various cold sausages. Fresh strawberries soaked
overnight in white wine at room temperature in a tightly closed plastic bag
were served as another dessert.
The patients ranged in age from 24 to 55 years (median age 29 years), and 4
were men. All 5 affected patients developed symptoms on 28 Jun 2006, 3 days
after the party. The main clinical symptoms were a dry mouth, blurry vision
and difficult swallowing. Two patients reported constipation and decreased
sweating. Four patients were admitted to hospital on 1 Jun, and the 5th on
2 Jun 2006.
The 5 patients lived in 3 households in three different villages but all
attended the barbecue and had consumed various dishes there. Detailed food
histories were only collected from the patients, not from the other
attendees at the barbecue. All 5 had consumed barbecued pork. This product
originated from a pig that had been home slaughtered 4 weeks earlier. The
carcass had been aired at ambient temperature for approximately 24 hours
before being cut up and put into airtight freezer bags (up to 5 cuts of
meat per bag), and frozen.
The meat was defrosted at room temperature the evening before the barbecue.
None of the 5 patients had consumed bratwurst.
Routine laboratory tests from sera drawn on day of admission revealed an
abnormal increase of aspartate aminotransferase in 3 of the 5 patients as
the sole abnormality. None of the patients required mechanical ventilation
and none was given antitoxin. One patient stayed in hospital for 4 days,
and the remaining 4 stayed for 3 days.
There was no illness reported among the other barbecue guests.
Although botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,
differentiating it from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct
and effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism in the
laboratory is to demonstrate the presence of toxin in serum or feces, or in
samples of food consumed by the patient. Isolation of _Clostridium
botulinum_ (as well as the detection of toxin) from feces of the patients
gained 4 to 5 days after admission was attempted unsuccessfully. Currently,
the most sensitive, simple and widely used method for detecting toxin is
the mouse neutralization assay (1). Sera drawn from the patients on the day
of admission were diluted 2-fold with saline (test group) and polyvalent
antitoxin against toxin types A, B, E (Chiron-Behring, Marburg, Germany)
(control group), respectively. Two Balb/c mice each were injected
intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of these dilutions. The 2 mice challenged
with sera from 4 patients, and 1 of 2 mice challenged with serum from the
5th patient all developed a typical waspwaist and palsy after 18-24 hours
and died from respiratory paralysis within 30-48 hours. All control mice
survived without any symptoms of paralysis. Attempts to isolate _C.
botulinum_ from fecal samples of the patients were unsuccessful.
Discussion
----------
If food is contaminated with _C. botulinum_, oxygen levels and other
conditions can allow the _C. botulinum_ spores to grow and to produce
toxin. Foodborne botulism has often been caused by home-canned foods with a
near-neutral pH, such as asparagus, green beans, beetroot and sweetcorn
(2). However, outbreaks of botulism from more unusual sources, such as
chopped garlic in oil, chili peppers, tomatoes, improperly handled baked
potatoes wrapped in aluminium foil, and home-canned or home-fermented fish
have also been reported. The last documented laboratory confirmed case of
botulism in Austria was due to home-canned vegetables (3).
Botulinum toxin is heat-labile and can be destroyed if heated at 80 degrees
C for 10 minutes or longer, which may not be the case in barbecuing (2).
Although samples of the frozen pork from remaining bags tested negative for
_C. botulinum_ and botulinum toxin, we hypothesize that one of the bags was
contaminated and 5 cuts of meat (accounting for 5 cases), despite heating,
still contained enough botulinum toxin to cause illness. The mild clinical
symptoms experienced by these patients can be linked to the relatively long
incubation period of about 36 hours: the longer the incubation period, the
less severe the disease. It is also thought that storage of contaminated
pork in airtight bags (before freezing) can provide the anaerobic
environment required for _C. botulinum_ to produce toxin. Hygiene
conditions during home slaughtering are often worse than conditions in
authorized slaughterhouses. In 2003, a case of botulism connected to home
slaughtering was described in Germany (4).
The symptoms shown by all patients are consistent with, but not diagnostic
for, mild cases of foodborne botulism, and could be due to other causes.
However, toxin was detected in the sera from all patients, and was
neutralized by addition of commercial polyvalent antiserum in the mouse
bioassay. For mild cases of botulism it is unusual for toxin to be detected
in the sera of all the patients. The absence of a European reference
laboratory accepting such specimens for confirmation and for toxin typing
limits further laboratory insights. The actual source of the outbreak
presented here remains unclear. To our knowledge, barbecuing has not
previously been associated with botulism.
Although the local health authority considered the barbecued pork served at
the barbecue to be the most likely source of intoxication, the food source
was not confirmed. As further epidemiologial investigation (such as by a
case control or cohort study) with detailed food histories was not
conducted, it was not possible to rule out other food, such as
strawberries, as the source of the intoxication.
