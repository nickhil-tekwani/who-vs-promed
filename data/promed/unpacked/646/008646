Kenya: 30 anthrax cases reported in Nakuru County
-------------------------------------------------
Officials in Nakuru County in eastern Kenya are reporting that up to 3 dozen people are being treated for the bacterial disease, anthrax, according to a local media report. Rongai Sub County Veterinary Officer, Martin Karate says the patients are being treated at Lengenet Health Centre. He also confirmed the anthrax-related deaths of 10 cattle.

The infected contracted the potentially lethal disease from the carcasses of the infected animals.

People can get anthrax by handling contaminated animal or animal products, consuming undercooked meat of infected animals and more recently, intentional release of spores.

It seems to be the season for human foolishness in butchering sick stock, and procrastinating over livestock vaccination. Surely there have been enough alerts to mobilise the veterinary service to get out and vaccinate the livestock in these affected areas. - Mod.MHJ
