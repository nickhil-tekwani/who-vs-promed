The World Health Organization on Wednesday [11 Jan 2023] declared the latest Ebola epidemic in Uganda over, closing the chapter on a deadly outbreak that lasted nearly 4 months and killed dozens of people.

The outbreak had spread to 9 districts, including the capital, Kampala, raising fears of its snowballing across the East African region. It was the worst Ebola outbreak in Uganda in more than 2 decades, and the 2nd-deadliest in the country's history, with 142 confirmed cases and 55 deaths, and an additional 22 deaths also linked to the outbreak, according to the WHO. Seven of those who died were health workers.

The WHO considers an epidemic over when no confirmed or probable cases are reported for 42 days, twice the incubation period for Ebola infections.

The response to the outbreak was hampered by delays in identifying and tracing the 1st case, along with widespread misinformation among the public about the perils and even the existence of the virus.

The authorities also initially hesitated to impose a lockdown in the epicenter of the outbreak, in central Uganda, fearing that any restrictions would adversely affect the economy and estrange a population already angry about previous strict COVID shutdowns.

The outbreak was caused by the Sudan strain of the virus, which has no approved vaccine or therapeutics. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said that the lack of treatment made it challenging to tackle the virus.

"Two months ago, it looked as if Ebola would cast a dark shadow over the country well into 2023," Dr Moeti said in a statement. "But this win starts off the year on a note of great hope for Africa."

Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted through body contact with sick or dead people or animals. Its symptoms include fever, fatigue, and headaches, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, and internal and external bleeding.

The virus kills half of those it infects. The worst outbreak recorded spread across West Africa between 2014-16, followed by one in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018. While there are existing Ebola vaccines -- like the injectable Ervebo vaccine that was crucial to ending the outbreak in Congo -- they do not protect against the Sudan strain.

Uganda has suffered multiple Ebola outbreaks in the past. The worst was in 2000, killing 224 people, according to the WHO.

The latest outbreak was first reported on 20 Sep 2022 when a case was confirmed at a hospital in the Mubende district, about 90 miles [about 145 km] west of Kampala.

The patient, a 24-year-old male, had developed symptoms including high fever, chest pain, and convulsions, along with bleeding in the eyes. He had visited multiple health facilities before he was finally isolated and tested for the virus. He died on 19 Sep 2022.

For weeks, Ugandan officials dismissed calls to issue restrictions in and beyond the epicenter of the outbreak in the central part of the country. Health experts worried about population movement and the fact that the districts where cases had been reported abutted a major highway connecting them to the capital and to the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.

It was not until mid-October 2022 that President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda imposed an overnight curfew, and stopped movement in and out of Mubende and Kassanda, the 2 districts identified as the epicenter of the outbreak.

But by then, the virus had spread nationwide, including to the capital, and to Jinja, a city on the shores of Lake Victoria. Contacts of Ebola patients were also eluding quarantine, putting more people at risk. The United States, fearing the risk of international spread, began screening air travelers who had visited Uganda.

The epidemic was deemed to be under control in late November 2022, when the last patient was discharged from hospital. In mid-December 2022, Mr Museveni lifted the lockdown on Mubende and Kassanda, saying that his country had succeeded in keeping the virus under control.

Uganda also received 3 vaccines from the WHO in December 2022, which were to be deployed in a clinical trial to test their effectiveness against the Sudan strain of the virus. But with no new cases or contacts, the vaccine candidates had come too late.

Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Ugandan minister of health, said that communities should continue to be alert and report anyone who showed symptoms.

"Uganda is now free of active Ebola transmission," she said. "But let's remain vigilant."

["The Biden administration said on [11 Jan 2023] it has lifted restrictions imposed in October 2022 that redirected US-bound travelers who had been to Uganda within the previous 21 days to 5 major American airports to be screened for Ebola.

"The Department of Homeland Security said as of late November 2022 there have been no new confirmed Ebola disease cases reported in Uganda and 2 21-day incubation periods have passed and the restrictions were no longer necessary."

[2] Response not over
Date: Wed 11 Jan 2023 4:40 AM PST

https://keyt.com/news/2023/01/11/ugandas-ebola-outbreak-ends-leaving-relief-and-unanswered-questions/


No new Ebola infections have been detected in Uganda for 42 days, and so on Wednesday [11 Jan 2023], the World Health Organization and the Ugandan Ministry of Health officially declared that the country's most recent outbreak of the deadly virus is at an end.

The United States will also end screening and monitoring requirements for travelers from Uganda on Wednesday [11 Jan 2023].

The work of the response is far from over, however.

Since the outbreak was officially recognized on 20 Sep 2022, 164 people have had confirmed or probable Ebola infections; there were 55 deaths confirmed by lab testing, with another 22 deaths suspected of being caused by the virus.

The last victim was a baby who was stillborn at 28 weeks gestation that tested positive for the virus. The baby's mother had been infected but had recovered and was reportedly in good health. Scientists are investigating those 2 cases to understand whether the virus could have crossed the placenta to infect the baby, which is called vertical transmission. Vertical transmission isn't something that's been known to be a risk with Ebola before.

The effects of Ebola infections can last years, including fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and eye problems. Those 87 survivors will continue to need ongoing care.

They will also be followed because even though they have recovered, they may be carrying active virus in certain parts of their bodies that, under the right circumstances, could spark a new outbreak.

Still, this moment is a huge relief.

"Uganda put a swift end to the Ebola outbreak by ramping up key control measures such as surveillance, contact tracing, and infection, prevention, and control. While we expanded our efforts to put a strong response in place across the 9 affected districts, the magic bullet has been our communities who understood the importance of doing what was needed to end the outbreak, and took action," Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Acero, Uganda's Minister of Health, said in a statement.

Just 2 months ago, "it looked as if Ebola would cast a dark shadow over the country well into 2023, as the outbreak reached major cities such as Kampala and Jinja, but this win starts off the year on a note of great hope for Africa," Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement.

"I commend the Government of Uganda, local health workers, and global public health partners who worked to end the country's Ebola outbreak," said CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky, in a statement. "I also want to thank the CDC staff on the front lines in Uganda and around the world who worked countless hours to accelerate an end to the outbreak."

The relief is real, too, for health officials who have been working closely with the Ugandan government to get the outbreak under control.

"It feels like you won a sports game, right?" said Amy Boore, program director for the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection in Uganda. "I feel like one of those football guys that goes and throws their helmet on the ground," she said. "We pulled it together in the end."

A strain without vaccines or treatments
---------------------------------------
This Ebola outbreak wasn't the largest or the longest Uganda or Africa has seen, but experts who were involved in the response say it was challenging on a number of fronts. For one thing, it happened in the midst of another outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic -- and the flood of misinformation that followed -- eroded public trust in health officials in Uganda in much the same way it did in other countries, Boore said, making it harder to persuade Ebola patients to come to hospitals for care.

Another challenge was the lesser-known type of Ebola virus causing the outbreak: the Sudan strain. Although there are therapeutics and a vaccine against another type of Ebola virus, Ebola Zaire, there are no such treatments or protections against Ebola Sudan.

This was the 1st outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda in a decade.

At the beginning of the outbreak, a team of scientists from Oxford University, South Africa, and Uganda set out to gather all known scientific studies on the Sudan strain. They found only 20, highlighting a dearth of research and an "urgent need" for more investment to find an effective vaccine and therapeutics, as well as the best approaches to support patients through their infections.

In the end, disease detectives said, they had to go back to basics to break transmission chains of new infections.

"The Ugandans, they've been dealing with Ebola responses for going on decades now. And they've always managed to control them and prevent them from spilling outside their borders. But they managed to do that through just very basic control measures," said Joel Montgomery, chief of the CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch.

"That's eventually how this outbreak ended. We had really good contact tracing, really good Ebola treatment units that had been set up, and then really, really good laboratory diagnostics," he said.

But first, says Boore, they had to persuade people to seek treatment in the 1st place. Ugandans have a history of following health advice, she says, but when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the long wait for vaccines shattered public trust.

Officials flew into the country to tout the benefits of COVID vaccination, but it was months until there were actually any shots to give. In the meantime, as Ugandans waited for vaccines that were being given in other countries, the delta variant caused a devastating wave of illness and death, she says. "It was like a slap in the face," Boore said.

"Tons of suffering happened during COVID. But even though a lot of people died here from COVID, it wasn't as bad as people thought it would be. It wasn't as bad in Africa as it was in other places. You know, it's mostly elderly, and some places were really hard hit and others not so much. There's also this weird collective amnesia that happened.

"Then Ebola comes back and they're like, 'now we've seen the big bad virus, and it wasn't that bad. We're not scared anymore,' " she said. "It was really hard."

Boore says epidemiologists believe that this Ebola outbreak probably started in neighboring villages at the end of July 2022. Ordinarily, she says, there's a strong early alert system through village health teams who notify health officials about unusual illnesses. But none of that worked this time because people stopped their usual health-seeking behaviors.

It wasn't until mid-September 2022, when a 24-year-old man finally went to a health clinic for care, that health officials detected Ebola in a lab test and began to respond.

"There's so much public trust damage that was done globally during COVID that it was a very different outbreak," Boore said. "So this one, to be honest, was scary."

Public health officials, including Boore and her team, were also exhausted. They had already spent years -- without weekends, without holidays -- responding to the pandemic.

"It was really demoralizing. Everybody was tired. To see how the public trust was not there, we were very worried that we wouldn't get it back," she said.

A focus on transparency
-----------------------
Their efforts clearly paid off, says Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University who recently returned from a visit to a clinic he helps support in Uganda.

Griffin says public health officials have learned important lessons from previous Ebola outbreaks, including a large outbreak in West Africa that sickened nearly 29 000 people between 2014 and 2016, when mistrust of public health workers crippled their ability to respond.

"I thought the approach this time was so much better," he said. This time, the focus was on transparency.

"And the transparency, even taken to a literal level, where when someone would have Ebola, they actually would not just put them in these closed concrete facilities. They made sure that the mother could see the child that was being treated, that community leaders could come to these safe zone areas and see what was going on," Griffin said, "So there was a great effort to be transparent about what was happening, what the medical professionals were doing."

Unanswered questions
--------------------
The outbreak ended so quickly that it may hamper plans to test recently developed vaccines against the Sudan Ebola virus.

WHO had rushed to start a phase 3 vaccine trial in Uganda, but because there are no new cases, officials are talking about how to continue to study the vaccines "in a way that we conduct research that advances our understanding of these vaccines," said Dr Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, co-lead of the WHO's research and development blueprint for epidemics, in a recent news briefing.

Survivors are also being monitored for the persistence of the virus in their bodies.

After outbreaks of Ebola Zaire, studies showed that infectious Ebola virus can hide out in areas where foreign invaders don't seem to trigger immune responses. These so-called immune-privileged sites include the brain, the eyes, and the testes.

Genetic analysis of a 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea determined that the likely cause was a person who had been infected during the West African outbreak between 2014 and 2016, 5 years earlier. That suggests that Ebola Zaire infection may smolder for years in some survivors. It's not clear whether Ebola Sudan may do the same.

"These individuals that have recovered could actually have a persistent viral infection. So it's important to continue to follow these individuals and provide them psychosocial support, but also there is an important aspect of research here too, and understanding the science to see if these individuals are shedding virus," Montgomery said.

Boore says officials will be watching for and ready to tamp down on cases of "survivor pop-up." The Ugandan government has also set a goal of finally identifying the animal reservoir for Ebola.

Scientists believe it's likely to be a bat, but it's never been proved.

Boore says that if they can identify the species, they can map its range and be better prepared for where human cases might emerge.

"I hope that Uganda will be able to do some of that and answer a lot of these questions for us," she said.

[One hopes the public health infrastructure will be maintained in Uganda in order to respond to a potential future Ebola outbreak, as well as other medical problems the country has to address.

According to WHO, "plans to test 3 potential vaccines for the Sudan strain -- from the Sabin Vaccine Institute, the University of Oxford, and Merck -- will go ahead in Uganda. The [WHO representative to Uganda, Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam], said global health experts will meet Thursday [12 Jan 2023] to decide on when and how the trials should begin."
