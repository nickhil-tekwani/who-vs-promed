Is the COVID pandemic finally nearing its end?
----------------------------------------------
More than 2 years on from the realisation that we are dealing with a novel pandemic, we are still nervously wondering what comes next. In the UK, COVID infection rates appear to have fallen to their lowest level since the summer of 2021, as has the number of deaths the virus is causing, but we know that new variants are still likely to emerge. So when will the end of this pandemic come, and what might it look like?

This is a very difficult question, because we won't know we have passed the end of the pandemic until some time has elapsed. The expectation is that eventually the disease will reach endemic levels, meaning immunity in the population will balance out the reproduction of the virus, resulting in a stable level of infection year on year. That stability could include regular, repeatable fluctuations such as seasonality, but we won't know that stability has been achieved unless the same pattern of infections is observed for more than one consecutive year.

There are 2 big unknowns in attempting to determine how soon the end of the pandemic may arrive and what it might look like. The 1st is: how durable will our immunity be, particularly against severe disease but also against infection? And the 2nd is: how fast will the Sars-CoV-2 virus evolve, in particular with respect to overcoming our immune defences? To answer these questions, we need to look at the lessons the pandemic has taught us so far.

The year of the Sars-CoV-2 virus was very much 2020, when it caused high levels of mortality and disease, and changed lives around the world. We saw a virus transmit into humans and began to observe some evolution, but thanks to the relatively slow rate of evolution of Sars-CoV-2 compared with other RNA viruses, we did not observe much change beyond the immediate public health impact until the very end of the year [2020], with the emergence initially of the alpha, beta and gamma variants.

Looking back, 2021 appears to have been the year of the variant. The alpha variant rapidly displaced the initial strain of the virus: it was more transmissible and more likely to cause severe disease and death, necessitating far more robust public health responses including the reimposition of restrictions in the UK and elsewhere. The degree of adaptation was staggering; the alpha variant was more than 50% more transmissible in humans compared with the original virus, a leap of adaptation that has never previously been observed in real time. The beta and gamma variants also displayed a degree of immune escape, a brief glimpse into the possibility that these viruses might be able to, at least in part, evade defences we had built against previous forms of the virus, whether by infection or vaccination. And of course, these variants were succeeded by the delta variant, which was about 50% more transmissible than the alpha variant, and also more severe, bringing another wave of disease and devastation.

Towards the end of 2021 we were hit by another variant, omicron, which brought its own unique challenges and lessons in viral evolution. Omicron is highly evasive of the antibodies that vaccination and prior infection confer, and thereby can breach our immune defences. Fortunately, protection against hospitalisation and death is not eroded to the same extent, though protection against severe disease has declined. And of course, omicron is capable of reinfecting individuals who have previously been exposed to other forms of the virus. The idea that viral infection is a "one and done" risk -- that you can get it over with by being infected -- has well and truly been dispelled by omicron. Thus, if 2021 was the year of the variant and the vaccine, 2022 so far appears to be the year of reinfection.

We don't yet know how severe reinfections will be going forward -- presumably there will be some decline on average between primary infections and reinfections. However, as immunity wanes and the virus keeps evolving and changing, will the gap in severity between secondary and primary infections be eroded, increasing levels of mortality? We also don't know to what extent secondary infections bring reduced risks of morbidity, such as long COVID. And we don't know how the importance of reinfections varies across risk groups. We will almost certainly see the further erosion of immune protection as the virus continues to evolve, and the need to redouble vaccination campaigns as well as research and development is as pressing as it ever has been -- we cannot take the earlier success of vaccines for granted.

We may know how the end of the pandemic might occur in theory, and the patterns to look out for to determine whether we are approaching endemicity. What is a lot less clear is what our future with this virus will look like when COVID is no longer at pandemic levels. For now, we are experiencing multiple waves per year, each with a substantial burden of disease and death. Will endemicity continue to involve multiple waves of infection, with potentially high severity each year? How frequently will variants like omicron, capable of partially breaching our immune defences, arise, and will this eventually include variants that can escape the protection that vaccines induce, at least in part, against hospitalisation and death?

The pandemic will not end this year [2022], but the behaviour of this virus in highly vaccinated countries across the world may offer a glimpse of what the endpoint may look like: low risk of severe disease from any given infection, a better understanding of the cumulative disease toll of reinfections, an idea of the likelihood of further omicron-like immune escape events and whether disease severity is further restored, and data available to guide further vaccination strategies.

[2] Shanghai
[A] Reopening
Date: Wed 1 Jun 2022
Source: New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/briefing/shanghai-reopens.html


Shanghai today [1 Jun 2022] began easing one of the world's longest, toughest lockdowns since the pandemic began. Many of its 25 million residents basked in their newfound ability to move around freely.

As the rules took effect overnight, residents honked horns and set off fireworks. As the sun rose, they strolled and cycled through their city like dazed tourists. During the day, people -- all wearing masks -- reveled in the novelty of previously mundane pleasures like meeting friends and relatives, walking in parks, and driving through streets that had been largely empty for weeks.

The stringent 2-month lockdown sparked public anger over shortages of food and medicine. Some residents with chronic illnesses were denied entry to hospitals, sometimes with deadly consequences.

"But those problems came to be resolved, and now everyone is feeling good that the restrictions are lifting," said Tang Xianchun, a Shanghai resident. "I'm more eager to catch up with family and friends, chat and meet face to face. That's what I missed most."

A mental shift
--------------
In early April [2022], Shanghai ordered residents to stay home and businesses to shut to try to stifle the spread of the omicron variant. City leaders had initially said they could contain the outbreak with limited restrictions, but China's leader, Xi Jinping, ordered tougher measures as infections climbed to more than 20 000 each day. New daily infections have now fallen to low double digits. ...

The road ahead
--------------
Even as the broader lockdown eases, some major restrictions remain, such as checkpoints for entering housing compounds. Hundreds of thousands of residents are also still locked in their housing compounds because of recent infections in their areas. Under China's stringent rules, being in the vicinity of a confirmed infection is enough to land someone in a quarantine facility.

And it is not yet clear whether the government's harsh response was a success.

"I'm sure the government believes that it was necessary and painful, but ultimately successful," Chris said. "I'm also sure that a good number of Chinese people, especially people outside of Shanghai, believe that as well."

That said, there are now 25 million people in Shanghai -- China's wealthiest city -- who have seen firsthand the drawbacks of the country's harsh COVID strategy. "So there are now Chinese business executives, economists, lawyers, generally well-placed people, becoming more vocal about what they see as the downsides of the policy," Chris said.

China's economy also slowed sharply in [April and May 2022], in large part because of Shanghai's lockdown.

There's a general desire in the government to avoid anything like this happening again, Chris said. But despite the economic and social pain, the authorities have reiterated time and again that they are sticking to a strategy of trying to eliminate virtually all COVID cases.

"With the omicron variant, it has become very difficult for these lockdowns to snap into place quick enough for cities to avoid painful lockdowns that last weeks, or even as we saw in Shanghai, for months," Chris said. "And the question facing Beijing is, what are the options? Going forward those options will depend on how effectively the government can roll out more vaccines -- along with more effective vaccines -- and boosters as well."

[B] Cases

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-31/shanghai-covid-cases-continue-to-fall-as-locals-cheer-reopening


China's financial capital reported its fewest COVID-19 cases in 3 months as residents celebrated an end to mandatory home isolation for most of the city, while some companies continued factory restrictions out of caution. Shanghai saw 15 new infections on Tuesday [31 May 2022], the lowest caseload since [2 Mar 2022] and a dramatic drop from the peak of more than 27 000 a day in April [2022]. While most of the city's 25 million residents were released from one of the world's most restrictive pandemic lockdowns after 2 months, about 10% still aren't allowed to move about the city.

Containment of the highly contagious omicron variant in Shanghai will be seen as vindication for China's intensive COVID Zero strategy, which allows no tolerance even as other countries live with the pathogen that triggered the most significant global health crisis in generations. The victory exacted a hefty toll on the economy, with factories shuttered for weeks and supply chains upended as China deployed the playbook of movement restrictions, mass testing and mandatory isolation of all COVID cases and their close contacts.

Chinese capital Beijing averted a lockdown by aggressively mounting curbs such as asking its 22 million resident to work from home and get tested for COVID every day. The outbreak is effectively controlled, municipal officials said at a Wednesday [1 Jun 2022] briefing, though the risk of a flareup remains. They are mulling measures to stimulate consumption after shopping malls and other entertainment venues were shut last month [May 2022] and only recently started to reopen with capacity limits.

Regular testing is also set to become a standard feature of life. A network of tens of thousands of testing booths is being set up across the country's largest and most economically vital cities, with the goal of having residents always just a 15 minute walk away from a swabbing point. The infrastructure will allow cities like Beijing, Shanghai, tech hub Shenzhen and e-commerce heartland Hangzhou to require tests as often as every 48 hours, with negative results needed to get on the subway or enter a store.

[3] Masks
Date: Tue 31 May 2022
Source: PNAS [edited]
https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2119266119


Citation: Gavin Leech, Charlie Rogers-Smith, Joshua Teperowski Monrad, et al. Mask wearing in community settings reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission. PNAS 31 May 2022. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2119266119
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significance
------------
We resolve conflicting results regarding mask wearing against COVID-19. Most previous work focused on mask mandates; we study the effect of mask wearing directly. We find that population mask wearing notably reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission (mean mask-wearing levels corresponding to a 19% decrease in R). We use the largest wearing survey (n = 20 million) and obtain our estimates from regions across 6 continents. We account for nonpharmaceutical interventions and time spent in public, and quantify our uncertainty. Factors additional to mask mandates influenced the worldwide early uptake of mask wearing. Our analysis goes further than past work in the quality of wearing data -- 100 times the size with random sampling -- geographical scope, a semimechanistic infection model, and the validation of our results.

Abstract
--------
The effectiveness of mask wearing at controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission has been unclear. While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings [D. K. Chu et al., Lancet 395, 1973-1987 (2020); J. Howard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2014564118 (2021); Y. Cheng et al., Science eabg6296 (2021)], studies in community settings report inconsistent results [H. M. Ollila et al., medRxiv (2020); J. Brainard et al., Eurosurveillance 25, 2000725 (2020); T. Jefferson et al., Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 11, CD006207 (2020)]. Most such studies focus on how masks impact transmission, by analyzing how effective government mask mandates are. However, we find that widespread voluntary mask wearing, and other data limitations, make mandate effectiveness a poor proxy for mask-wearing effectiveness. We directly analyze the effect of mask wearing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on 6 continents, including the largest survey of wearing behavior (n= 20 million) [F. Kreuter et al., https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation (2020)]. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimate the effect of mask wearing on transmission, by linking reported wearing levels to reported cases in each region, while adjusting for mobility and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as bans on large gatherings. Our estimates imply that the mean observed level of mask wearing corresponds to a 19% decrease in the reproduction number R. We also assess the robustness of our results in 60 tests spanning 20 sensitivity analyses. In light of these results, policy makers can effectively reduce transmission by intervening to increase mask wearing.

Conclusions
-----------
We find that mask wearing is associated with a notable reduction in transmission. Our evidence shows that factors other than mandates must have contributed to the worldwide uptake of mask wearing in 2020. In situations where mandates are unlikely to have a large effect on uptake -- for example, because voluntary wearing is already high -- policy makers may be able to use other levers to increase wearing quantity and quality. For example, if masks are widely used but are often of poor quality, or worn incorrectly, or are not worn in the most important venues, then policy makers can respond with education about correct mask fitting and quality, as well as mandates that focus on venues with the greatest risk of transmission.

[The coronavirus is so contagious that it can spread during brief times when people take off their masks, even when a mandate is in place. Airplane passengers remove their masks to have a drink. Restaurant patrons go maskless as soon as they walk in the door. Schoolchildren let their masks slide down their faces. So do adults: Research by the University of Minnesota suggests that between 25-30% of Americans consistently wear their masks below their nose.

"Even though masks work, getting millions of people to wear them, and wear them consistently and properly, is a far greater challenge," Steven Salzberg, a biostatistician at Johns Hopkins University, has written. Part of the problem, Salzberg said, is that the most effective masks also tend to be less comfortable. They cover a larger part of a person's face, fit more snugly and restrict the flow of more air particles.

During an acute crisis -- such as the early months of the pandemic, when masks were one of the few available forms of protection -- strict guidelines can nonetheless make sense. Public health officials can urge people to wear tight-fitting, high-quality masks and almost never take them off in public. If the mandate has even a modest benefit, it can be worth it.

But this approach is not sustainable for years on end. Masks hinder communication, fog glasses and can be uncomfortable. There is a reason that children and airline passengers have broken out in applause when told they can take off their masks.

In the current stage of the pandemic, there are less divisive measures that are more effective than mask mandates. Booster shots are widely available. A drug that can further protect the immunocompromised, known as Evusheld, is increasingly available. So are post-infection treatments, like Paxlovid, that make COVID cases less severe.

Continuing to expand access to these treatments can do more to reduce hospitalizations and deaths than any mask rule probably would.

"People have the wherewithal to protect themselves," Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the medicine department at the University of California, San Francisco, said. Absent a much larger surge in COVID hospitalizations, he added, the case for mandates is weaker than it used to be.

Dr. Aaron Carroll, chief health officer of Indiana University, recently wrote for The New York Times Opinion section: "Instead of continuing to bicker about things that have become hopelessly politicized like mask mandates, those in public health could focus on efforts that might make much more of a difference." (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/briefing/masks-mandates-us-covid.html)

While initially there was public pressure to wear masks, and mask mandates were in place, there now seems to be a reversal with lifting of mask mandates; mask wearers who are now often in the minority are in some situations being scoffed at in the US and other countries. This is occurring at the same time as new highly infectious variants are spreading, and even in light of all we have learned about long COVID. The challenge is how to change this lax attitude. - Mod.LK]
