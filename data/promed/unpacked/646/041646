Hatcher SM, Shih D, Holderman J, Cossaboom C, Leman R, DeBess E. Notes from the field: Adverse event associated with unintentional exposure to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine - Oregon, December 2017. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6726a4

On 7 Dec 2017, a previously healthy, middle-aged male veterinarian was evaluated at an Oregon emergency department (ED) for cough, malaise, myalgia, fever, and arthralgia of 4 days' duration. The patient reported having sustained a needle stick while administering the _Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine (RB51) to cattle 3 weeks before symptom onset. While the patient was in the ED, a probable diagnosis of brucellosis was considered, but _Brucella_ testing was not performed. After a chest radiograph, the patient was discharged with a doxycycline prescription for right upper lobe pneumonia. On 11 Dec 2017, the patient returned to the ED with worsening pneumonia. At that time, the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division (OPHD) was notified of the probable brucellosis case. The patient was hospitalized and began oral rifampin and intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and continued oral doxycycline treatments. OPHD and the local health jurisdiction provided RB51-specific treatment and testing recommendations to clinicians and provided guidance for laboratory biosafety precautions through coordination with the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory. As a result, the hospitalist discontinued rifampin, continued doxycycline, and started trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). By 3 days after admission, the patient's symptoms had improved, and he was discharged and prescribed doxycycline and TMP/SMX for 60 days, which is the recommended treatment for human RB51 infections (1). Blood and sputum cultures collected at admission were later negative for _Brucella_ spp. During reinterview, the patient confirmed that his only known RB51 exposure was the needle stick. Although he administered the vaccine regularly and was aware of its potential for pathogenicity in humans, he had not sought the recommended postexposure prophylaxis of doxycycline and TMX/SMX for 21 days (1).

Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease of humans and many animal species, with a low infectious dose in humans (1). Occupational _Brucella_ spp. exposures most commonly affect veterinarians, health-care workers, and laboratorians. RB51 is a live-attenuated vaccine, approved for use as part of the Brucellosis Eradication Program in the mid-1990s (2). It is resistant to rifampin, a first-line treatment choice for human brucellosis, and does not induce an antibody response detectable by commercially available serologic assays, requiring culture for confirmation (1). Human infections with RB51 most commonly result from needle-stick injuries, which are relatively common and underreported among veterinarians (3). In a summary of RB51 exposures reported to CDC during 1998-1999, 7 of 26 (27 percent) persons reported persistent illnesses with symptoms similar to those reported by this patient (2). Although killed by pasteurization and not commonly shed in milk, RB51 recently gained attention nationwide during investigation of cases and exposures after raw (unpasteurized) milk consumption in Texas and New Jersey (4,5). These cases highlighted the lack of awareness of the unique challenges in diagnosing and treating RB51 infections in humans.

This report serves as a reminder that occupational RB51 exposure is a risk among veterinary personnel. Clinicians, laboratory staff members, and public-health officials should be aware of RB51 diagnosis and treatment challenges and be prepared to manage RB51 cases and exposures. State and local health jurisdictions should consider regular communication with veterinary and laboratory communities regarding occupational RB51 exposures and can serve as a resource to clinicians unfamiliar with management of human RB51 Brucella infections and exposures.

Abstract
--------
"_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live _Brucella_ vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle-stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse events associated with accidental exposure. As many as 9 cases reported previous exposure to _Brucella_ vaccines, including one case that also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle-stick injuries and conjunctival or open-wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens." - Mod.LL
