Bacterium infected 3 at BU biolab
-----------------------------------
3 Boston University researchers became ill in 2004 after being exposed in a
laboratory to a potentially lethal disease called tularemia, university and
public health authorities said on Tue 18 Jan 2005. It was the 1st known
instance of researchers in a Boston lab becoming infected with a biological
agent they were studying, according to a city public health official. And
it came at an awkward time for BU, as it was seeking local and federal
approval for a high-security lab to study the most feared infectious
diseases in the world.
How the workers became infected remains unclear, although BU officials said
that researchers had violated procedures intended to protect them from
exposure. 2 researchers became ill in May 2004, and a 3rd in September
2004, apparently after separate exposures. But their illnesses were not
linked to tularemia until October 2004.
BU reported the cases to city, state, and federal health authorities in
November 2004, about the time public hearings on the high-security lab were
being held. But neither the university nor the government agencies
disclosed the cases to the public at the time, saying there was no risk to
public health, because tularemia is not transmitted from person to person.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who learned of the cases from BU and city
public health officials, also decided against telling city residents.
"Right from the moment that he was made aware of the situation, the Public
Health Commission assured him there was no public threat whatsoever, and
he's made it clear that if there was any public threat whatsoever, the
public would have been advised immediately," said Seth Gitell, the mayor's
spokesman.
With Menino's enthusiastic backing, the city Zoning Commission gave its
final approval to the high-security biolaboratory last week [2nd week of
January 2005]. The lab still must be approved by the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is considered likely, because it's
the same agency that, in 2003, selected BU as one of 2 sites nationally for
sophisticated new labs able to study anthrax, plague, and other deadly
pathogens.
BU and public health officials discussed the cases publicly for the 1st
time yesterday, 18 Jan 2005, after media inquiries. The 1st exposures
happened last spring [2004], with 2 researchers falling ill in late May
2004. They complained of flu-like symptoms, and one was hospitalized
overnight. The 3rd infected researcher fell ill in September 2004 and
required hospitalization for several days, Moore said. All 3 recovered
fully after receiving antimicrobial agents.
They worked in a lab that, in 2003, received a 5-year grant from the
federal government to develop a vaccine against tularemia, an illness
spread by insects and animals, including rabbits. Often called "rabbit
fever," it is also viewed as a potential agent of bioterrorism. [Tularemia,
a disease caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, is indeed a
Category A bioterrorism disease - Mod. LL]. In 2000, an outbreak of
tularemia on Martha's Vineyard ignited panic, after a laborer died and
about a dozen other people became infected. [Cases still occur on Martha's
Vineyard - Mod.LL].
The scientists at BU believed that they were working with a strain of the
germ that had been altered specifically for vaccine research so as not to
cause illness. But a highly infectious strain of tularemia was mixed with
the harmless variety. The source of the contamination is being investigated
by federal health officials.
The tularemia linked with the illnesses was supplied by a laboratory in
Nebraska that federal authorities, citing security concerns, declined
yesterday [18 Jan 2005] to identify.
Because the researchers assumed that they were working with a form of
tularemia not known to cause illness, they did not immediately link their
symptoms to their research. It was after the 3rd researcher became ill that
faculty members began to suspect that something could be seriously wrong in
the laboratory inside the university's Evans Biomedical Research building
on Albany Street in the South End.
Subsequent DNA tests on the tularemia being studied in the BU lab showed
that the bacteria identified as coming from Nebraska contained the harmless
strain and a highly infectious type.
"The deck was stacked against [the researchers], because they were working
with something they had no idea they were working with," Moore said. But
Moore acknowledged that researchers in the lab had violated policies
requiring them to work with tularemia inside an enclosed box, called a
hood, that sends air through sophisticated filters. Instead, the tularemia
samples were sometimes worked with in the open, in part because the
enclosed research boxes were sometimes filled with material that should not
have been kept there, Moore said.
Blood tests were performed on about 60 university researchers, and those
tests showed that only the 3 workers who had become ill tested positive for
tularemia. After the exposure was determined, BU, in November 2004,
shuttered the lab for decontamination. The part of the lab where the
tularemia research was conducted remains closed.
The investigation into how the exposure happened continues. Samples of _F.
tularensis_ were sent directly from the Nebraska lab for CDC analysis, and
those tests showed no presence of the dangerous strain, deepening the
mystery around the episode.
"At this time, it seems to me there's no evidence conclusively to link the
contamination to Boston or to Nebraska," said Jennifer Morcone, a CDC
spokeswoman. "Certainly, everyone would like to determine the source of the
contamination to make certain nothing like this could happen again."
As a result of the exposures, BU, as well as the Boston Public Health
Commission, are moving to tighten oversight of research. To improve safety
in the dozens of public and private research labs in Boston, the Public
Health Commission intends by this spring [2005] to start a mandatory
training program for lab workers, emphasizing the reporting of illnesses in
researchers. The commission also plans to hire a lab safety inspector who
will make unannounced visits to research sites to make certain they are
following safety protocols, said John Auerbach, Public Health Commission
executive director.

[These accidents underscore the importance of confirming the identities of
attenuated microbial strains before they are used in the laboratory
setting. Since bacterial strains are not easily distinguishable, molecular
identification must be used to confirm the identity of strains before they
are employed in anything less than the highest levels of containment.
ProMED has previously posted a thread regarding laboratory safety and
disease dissemination (see below). While it is the case that tularemia does
not spread from person-to-person, the infectious dose to infect 50 percent
of individuals is quite low (less than 100 bacilli), so environmental
contamination from a laboratory is of concern. Just as important an issue
is where and how the attenuated strain became contaminated with virulent
tularemia bacilli. - Mod.LL]
