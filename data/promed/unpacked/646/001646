The Illinois Department of Public Health is again warning consumers
to throw out frozen pot pies that could be linked to a multistate
salmonellosis outbreak. ConAgra Foods voluntarily recalled all
varieties of frozen pot pie products in October 2007, produced under
multiple brand names.

Consumers still should discard all pot pies with the following brand
names: Kroger, Banquet, Albertson's, Food Lion, Great Value, Hill
Country Fare, Kirkwood, Meijer and Western Family. "If you currently
have pot pies in the freezer, even if you bought them a couple months
ago, you need to pay attention to this recall," Damon Arnold, state
public health director, said in a news release issued Fri 16 Nov
2007. These frozen pot pies include all varieties in 7-oz.
single-serving packages with an establishment number "P-9" or "Est.
1059" printed on the side of the package.

The department continues to receive reports of those sickened by
eating the recalled food during the past month. To date, Illinois has
seen 15 cases of salmonellosis believed to be associated with eating
the recalled pot pies, compared to 6 cases as of 12 Oct 2007, when
the 1st warning was issued.

[In the last CDC posting regarding this outbreak, between 1 Jan 2007
and 29 Oct 2007, at least 272 isolates of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-
with an indistinguishable genetic fingerprint have been collected
from ill persons in 35 states. Seven ill persons whose strain has
this genetic fingerprint were reported from Illinois, 8 fewer than present.

Although no further reports from CDC have been released, if Illinois'
increase is representative of the nation as a whole, more than 500
cases have occurred, which is apparently not the case. The
continuance of cases, some of which likely were acquired from
recalled food after the recall was announced, underscores the many
problems with food recalls, especially those related to foods that
are or can be frozen for longer periods of time.

A discussion on salmonella nomenclature can be found in the previous
ProMED-mail posting "Salmonellosis, frozen poultry pie - USA
(multistate) (04): recall 20071013.3355." - Mod.LL]
