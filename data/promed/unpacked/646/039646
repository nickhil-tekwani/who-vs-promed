Capital Regional District (Victoria) and British ColumbiaCentre for
Disease Control [BCCDC responded today to an anthrax bioterrorist
threat in Victoria.
It appears that 25 or more similar incidents have been reported to
police authorities across the US over the past few days.
Although Victoria is the only known Canadian target to date, other
points in Canada may be targeted. The following summarizes the
Victoria incident and public health response.
A Wal-Mart store in Victoria BC received a letter post-marked from
Florida today [29 Jan 2001. The envelope was opened by a clerk in the
store office. There were 2 others in the room, which is separately
ventilated from the rest of the store (vented to exterior). The envelope
contained a letter that may have had some oily material on it and
indicated in the letter that the letter was contaminated with anthrax.
There was no powder or other substance apparent in the letter and no
apparent dispersion of substance when the letter was opened. Local
police and public health were called in. The Assoc. MHO [Medical
Health Officer?, an EHO [environmental health officer? and local
communicable disease consultant responded on behalf of public health.
BCCDC was consulted and activated its Bioterrorist Threat Response
Plan.
The office area in Wal-Mart was cordoned off and secured initially.
Local public health officials provided on-site advice and consultation.
They packaged the letter in several sealed plastic pouches, wiping each
pouch down with bleach. The public health official handling the letter
to seal it wore rubber gloves only, based on assessment on-site of no
risk of airborne or liquid exposure. The package is being packaged and
shipped as per TDG [Transport Canada's Transport Dangerous Goods
regulations, to Kathy Bernard in the national micro lab in Winnipeg.
This incident was assess ed by on-site staff and BCCDC as very low
risk for (inhalation) anthrax exposure, given description of the letter
vehicle and absence of apparent method of aerosol dispersion. BCCDC
is advised that investigation by US authorities of similar recent
incidents has not recovered any lab evidence of anthrax and all similar
episodes have been hoaxes to date.
Environmental decontamination was undertaken with regular 5%
bleach on those surfaces in direct contact with the letter. The individual
who handled the letter washed hands with soap and water.
Subsequently she was to be asked to wash hands with 0.5% bleach and
then rinse with water. She was sent home for shower and clothes to be
washed.
Local public health and BCCDC staff conferred about the need for
chemoprophylaxis and, despite low assessed risk, recommended
ciproprophylaxis for the person who opened letter, at least until the
Winnipeg lab could rule out the presence of anthrax. Cipro was
optional for the other persons in the room who didn't directly handle
the letter. It was acknowledged that there was no clear-cut medical
indication for offering prophylaxis, but that it was prudent for the
person in direct contact, as a precautionary measure.
Local Public Health will be following up with Wal-Mart and local
media. There will be a post-action report.

[ProMED-mail does not normally circulate reports of these events.
However, others should use this excellent measured response by
Canada as a guide when in receipt of these letters, which seem to be
circulating widely at present. - MHJ
