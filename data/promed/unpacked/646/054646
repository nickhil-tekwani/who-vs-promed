Namibia: Anthrax Not Ruled Out in Omaheke
-----------------------------------------
Only one of the five recent 'mysterious' deaths in the Omaheke Region appears to have been related to anthrax. However, by yesterday - about two months after a young woman died - no conclusive results were available.

Dr Jack Vries, chairperson of the national health emergency management committee in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, yesterday said: "One person's blood showed that the person had recently been exposed to anthrax."

This woman was one of two from the farm Kroonster who died in February. Her autopsy report showed liver failure. It still needs to be determined what caused this condition and to what extent it relates to the anthrax exposure. Vries emphasised that no animal deaths on the farm could be linked to anthrax.

The three people who died at Wonderboom in February probably died as a result of poisoning. "There is a history of tombo (home brew) ingestion," Dr Vries said. [Too often it involves methyl alcohol. MHJ]

The Directorate of Veterinary Services initially placed Kroonster - a dairy farm - under quarantine but that has been lifted in the meantime. Earlier, it was reported that the Kroonster people died after eating a cow that had died. Kroonster owner Japie Engelbrecht said his business suffered because of the quarantine.

[So far we have one probable human anthrax case, seemingly based on a positive blood culture. But this is a good example that not every death in such an event has to be "anthrax."
