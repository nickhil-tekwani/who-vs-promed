Murine typhus or endemic typhus is an infectious disease, clinically very
similar to epidemic typhus, and caused by _Rickettsia typhi_ (sometimes
referred to as _R. mooseri_). Murine typhus disease is usually acute and
mild, with a skin rash and fever. It is rarely fatal, but 1 case which
resulted in death was described recently in England, a patient who was
infected in Spain. Murine typhus has been associated with the presence of
rats (_Rattus rattus_ and _Rattus norvegicus_) and with rat fleas
(_Xenopsylla cheopis_) and is detected mainly in harbour areas around the
world. Nowadays, due to the systematic control measures of rodents and
their ectoparasites, murine typhus is rarely notified in western countries.
Murine typhus was fairly common in Portugal until the 1940s. After 1955,
this disease was included in the list of notifiable diseases as a
rickettsiosis along with epidemic typhus and boutonneuse fever.
Since 1993, the Centre for Vectors and Infectious Disease Research (Centro
de Estudos de Vectores e Doenças Infecciosas - CEVDI) of the National
Institute of Health in Águas de Moura has examined all serum specimens
received for rickettsiosis diagnosis for antibodies against _R. conorii_,
_R. typhi_, and _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_. In 1993, antibodies against _R.
typhi_ were detected for the first time in serum from a patient in the
Madeira autonomous region, an archipelago with 2 major islands: Madeira and
Porto Santo. The patient was an HIV-positive woman with no clinical
features of murine typhus.
In November and December 1996, antibody titres against _R. typhi_ exceeding
1:128 were detected in serum from several patients at Madeira central
hospital. A research team from CEVDI collected the available information
and studied the focus of the disease. The preliminary results of their
investigation are presented here...
Discussion
The results suggest that, as has already been seen in many other parts of
the world, endemic transmission of _R. typhi_ occurs on Porto Santo island
between rodents and humans.
The outbreak of 1996 was probably facilitated by ecological conditions
favourable to an increase of the rat population. Several rat extermination
actions were carried out, but ectoparasites were not systematically
controlled. The possible existence of contaminated rat-flea faeces in
several closed areas (animal houses, cellars) also increased the
opportunity for humans to become infected with _R. typhi_.
One of the reasons why cases may not be diagnosed clinically is that the
rickettsial agent responsible for the cases in Porto Santo island may be
less virulent than usual, and another may be a lack of awareness of this
disease among physicians. After the collection of blood specimens and
rodents on the island the regional health directorate proceeded to control
the number of rats and disinfect urban areas. A serosurvey is being carried
out in 1997-1998 on the 2 islands to detect new cases and determine the
prevalence of murine typhus in the Madeira archipelago.

report were for 1996. We look forward to seeing the results of this latest
