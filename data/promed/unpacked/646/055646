KENDRAPARA, (Orissa): Sources in the Health Department said on Tue 19 Dec
2000 that 2 5-year old children in Orissa's Kendrapara district are
suspected of carrying poliovirus after having received a pulse polio dose
in March. The children, resident in Kharidasahi village and Pabitrapada
village, both fell ill after being administered the [vaccine dose on 26
Mar 2000 and are now under care.
Experts from UNICEF and WHO are monitoring the condition of the 2
children. District Medical Officer D.P. Panigrahi [could neither confirm
nor deny that the children were afflicted with polio. He said the cases
are either of polio or flaccid paralysis. Medical tests like
electro-myography and nerve conduction had been done on [both patients and
the final report of experts at the S.C.B. Medical College Hospital,
Cuttack, is awaited. Further tests are being done at the Central [Virus
Laboratory in Calcutta to confirm [presence of poliovirus.
