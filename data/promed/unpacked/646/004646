re: Tuberculosis - USA (02): (WA) zoo elephant, latent TB in elephant handlers 20191116.6781099

Some basic elephant facts:

1. Elephants in the wild live into their 70s. These 2 elephants are stated to be above the median life expectancy for female Asian elephants in human care, which is 47 years. The operative phrase is "in human care". Elephants in zoos and circuses suffer from life-shortening diseases of captivity which include dental diseases, zoochosis or stereotypical behavior, and foot disease/osteoarthritis - the number one cause for euthanasia in zoo elephants. A 51 year old elephant at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee just completed a course of treatment for TB and is now TB free.

2. Zoos are businesses (like circuses) - they make money by displaying animals for public entertainment. Public health authorities are not elephant experts, and some public health departments are very small. They rely on the zoos to inform them about TB (or other zoonotic diseases) in elephants. As such, the fox is guarding the hen house - zoos have a financial interest in how the public perceives the news of elephant keepers or elephants having positive TB tests, and in the messaging around the risks to zoo patrons.

3. TB can be latent or active in elephants (just like in people.). Those with latent TB have had a previous exposure to TB and have TB antibodies, but they cannot transmit it to other elephants or people unless/until the individual sero-converts to active TB.

The trunk wash test is considered the "gold standard" for TB diagnosis because it involves isolation of the organism. However, failure to isolate the organism does not rule out infection because intermittent shedding is characteristic of TB, and consequently there is the potential for false-negative results. (A trunk wash test involves an elephant blowing fluid through its trunk into a zip-lock bag on 3 consecutive days.)

The newer serological blood tests that are available are very accurate for detecting TB antibodies, providing this information often 3-4 years before an individual elephant might actually test positive using the trunk wash test. In addition, active TB has been diagnosed postmortem in a significant number of elephants that never tested positive on a trunk wash test. This means that exposure to TB in a group of elephants can remain undetected for years when facilities use only the trunk wash test for their TB monitoring.

Captive elephants as a group originally got their TB from infected persons - that is, they were not captured from the wild with TB and then brought it with them into captivity. The Index Herd for the increased emergence in the US was the Hawthorne Corporation in Illinois (a circus elephant contractor and a deplorable facility - the United States Department of Agriculture eventually confiscated all their elephants,) and 1996 is considered the year that elephants with TB started to become a widespread problem. Initially there was unprecedented collaboration between elephant owning facilities, organizations and researchers searching for control of the problem and ways to eliminate and prevent the spread of TB. Today, many have dissolved, and TB as a disease in captive elephants is the best kept secret by the industries that own them.

As to testing for TB, USDA guidelines rely on voluntary compliance and only call for once-a-year trunk wash testing, even though the number of captive elephants with TB continues to increase and again, a negative trunk wash test does not rule out disease. In 2012 the USDA proposed incorporating the TB guidelines into their enforcement efforts, and that travel restrictions be put in place for some elephants based on serological tests.

But the zoo/circus industries came out in force against this proposal, and submitted public comment to the USDA opposing any guidelines that would require this type of testing - testing that had the potential to reveal the true extent of TB exposure in all elephants nationwide. Rather than embrace the latest testing technology in order to better care for their elephants and to better protect their employees, the zoo/circus industries cited failure "to demonstrate risks [of TB] to animal health, public health, or public and occupational health". They also cited "unfair restrictions on the movement of animals in interstate commerce" which would interfere with their business model. In 2015 the USDA sided with the zoo/circus industries, withdrew the proposed changes, and just continued with their original voluntary TB guidelines.

On [28 Jun 2019] CHENDRA at the Oregon Zoo in Portland OR was diagnosed with active TB when the results of 1 of 3 sequential trunk washes came up positive for active TB. The positive trunk wash sample was collected on [12 Jun 2019]. Serological samples that had been collected and stored were then tested, and it was found that she had had latent TB, and that she appeared to have sero-converted to active TB 6 months prior in December 2018. This is a perfect example of why trunk washes are hit and miss when it comes to making the earliest possible diagnosis, and have limited value as the primary diagnostic test, especially when performed only once a year. Regular monitoring with serological antibody tests to provide early detection is the only way to avoid risk to other elephants and to people (the public and the keepers). The only problem is that the zoo industry promotes a no "risks to animal health, public health, or public and occupational health" philosophy.

One has to wonder, knowing the potential for TB in zoo/circus elephants and the potential for it to move between people and elephants, just why in 2019 the zoo does not already have better biosecurity protocols in place with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment mandatory for all elephant keepers and barn staff. Contracting TB from an elephant during casual exposure is not likely in healthy humans with functioning immune systems, but for the immunocompromised or otherwise more susceptible person (who might visit the zoo) it certainly IS possible. One also has to wonder if it is appropriate or humane or ethical to not treat 2 elephants that are actively shedding TB organisms, but instead keep them on display for the unsuspecting public.

[Tuberculosis (TB) caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or _Mycobacterium bovis_ has recently re-emerged as an important infectious disease in zoo animals, particularly captive elephants. While TB has been recognized as a disease of elephants for over 20 centuries, increasing numbers of elephant TB cases have been reported in the past 2 decades. It has been reported that about 3% of captive elephants in the United States are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.
