[In the interest of clarity, the following information from the Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Council may be helpful. It may also be helpful to
recall that PrP is the non-infectious prion protein and that LRS tissues
are those in the lymphoreticular system, such as the spleen, lymph nodes,
and tonsils. NPU is the Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh, Scotland. One
of the major UK centres of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE)
research, both scrapie and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). - Mod.TG
The SEAC public report of July 1998 contained the following section:
D. The survey of sheep scrapie strains since 1986.
To date nine UK isolates of scrapie contemporary with the outbreak of BSE
have been strain typed. None has proved to be BSE-like and all seven that
have been transmitted to mice have strain typing characteristics within the
range expected of classical scrapie. In project SE 1919 at the Central
Veterinary Laboratory, brains from sheep with scrapie born after January
1991 in flocks already known to have confirmed scrapie are being collected.
Payment is offered to owners as an incentive to notify cases. Brains will
be pooled according to sheep genotype at codons 136 and 171 to increase the
opportunity of isolating a BSE-like strain. The project is still in the
collection phase. A later collection phase is planned to include pools of
LRS tissues as well as of brains.
A similar project (SE 1423) at NPU will attempt isolation from single sheep
again selected according to genotype. The avoidance of pooling should
increase the sensitivity of isolation but the extent of the project will
not provide a nationwide screen. At a meeting on 1 February 1996, SEAC
recommended that high priority should be given to a study to infect, by the
oral route, scrapie-free sheep (preferably from New Zealand) of a PrP
genotype known to be susceptible to BSE, and then investigate whether or
not BSE was transmitted naturally to subsequent generations.
>From the above date we conclude that results of a sufficiently
representative survey of the strain characteristics of the infectious agent
of scrapie in the national flock since the start of the BSE epidemic are
not yet available.

I previously wrote:
In July 1998, SEAC [Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee again
called for work to investigate the possibility that BSE [Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy might be present in sheep but masked by scrapie. This need
was stressed again in September by Prof Jeff Almond chairman of the SEAC
sub-group on sheep.
The verbatim speeches in the conference on the lessons of the BSE crisis,
organized by the European Parliament and Commission on 30 November-1
December 1998 are now accessible from two links on
http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/bse/bse08_en.html These are to two
large Acrobat .pdf files. The speeches and discussions are in the native
languages of the speakers with no translations.
In the discussion at the end of the first day (30 November), there was some
information that I have not seen reported elsewhere, from Prof Roy Anderson
who stated "a survey of brains from sheep randomly collected from abattoirs
has just been completed in the United Kingdom. Very encouragingly, of the
three thousand examined there was no evidence of BSE. That is a very
encouraging result but a lot more needs to be done in Europe more broadly."
I downloaded the Acrobat verbatim file for 30 November session, and found
near the end of the file the verbatim discussion contribution of Roy
Anderson that I quoted in my previous posted message [see above.-Mod. TG.
However, prompted by my own curiosity as to why this had not been mentioned
elsewhere, and by questions subsequently posed, I enquired today of the
Veterinary Laboratory Agency [VLA (formerly known as the Central
Veterinary Laboratory) where I guessed that the work had been done, and
asked John Wilesmith.
Yes, the work had been done at VLA, but, as I now understand it, Roy
Anderson seems to have produced at the Brussels conference a "Chinese
whispers" garbled version, wrong in the most important respect. (No wonder
I had not seen the information mentioned elsewhere!). The work to which he
was referring was _not_ a search for BSE, but for scrapie strains. It was
carried out on the brains of 3000 sheep, in two groups of 1500, one of
sheep under 15 months, the other of sheep over 15 months. (They also have
the tonsils of those sheep). The work was carried out by "classical"
histopathology, by electron microscopy and by immunocytochemistry, plus
some immunoblotting. All of the sheep were negative for TSEs [Transmissible
Spongiform Encephalopathies. Thus the results were inconclusive.The report
is in the hands of SEAC and will presumably be referred to in the next SEAC
Report (the last one was in early November). John said it is hoped to
publish the paper in the fairly near future.
This is quite separate from the two projects SE1919 at VLA and SE1423 at
NPU, referred to in the SEAC report of July 1998 and quoted in the above
response.
