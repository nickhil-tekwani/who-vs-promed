["Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of pigs, including wild boar. The causative virus is a member of the genus _Pestivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_, and is closely related to the viruses of bovine viral diarrhoea and border disease. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV).

"The disease may run an acute, subacute, chronic, late onset, or inapparent course, depending on a variety of viral and host factors of which the age of the animals, the virulence of the virus and the time of infection (pre- or post-natal) are of greatest importance. Adult pigs usually display less severe signs of disease than young animals and stand a better chance of survival. In pregnant sows, the virus may cross the placental barrier and reach the fetuses. In-utero infection with strains of the virus of moderate or low virulence can result in what is referred to as the 'carrier sow' syndrome followed by prenatal or early post-natal death, the birth of diseased piglets or an apparently healthy but persistently infected litter. An outbreak of CSF in domestic pigs has serious consequences for trade in pigs and pig products.

"The highly variable clinical picture of CSF precludes a diagnosis on clinical and pathological grounds alone. Laboratory methods are therefore essential for an unambiguous diagnosis. Detection of virus or viral nucleic acid in anticoagulated whole blood and of antibodies in serum are the methods of choice for diagnosing CSF in live pigs, whereas detection of virus, viral nucleic acid or antigen in organ samples is most suitable when the pig is dead." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.03_CSF.pdf

In 2017, classical swine fever (CSF) was reported in domestic swine and wild boar in the province of Primorsky Krai. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=24924. The event was resolved on 2 Feb 2018. - Mod.CRD
