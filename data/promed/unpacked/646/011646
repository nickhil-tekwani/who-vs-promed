A 4 million bps vaccination programme to eliminate salmonellae from eggs
was launched yesterday, ten years after the problem was highlighted by
Edwina Currie, the former Tory Health Minister.
The British Egg Industry Council announced that vaccination would be
compulsory for all poultry flocks producing eggs for sale with the red lion
symbol. Andrew Parker, the chairman of the council, said: "This is a
breakthrough in the battle to get rid of salmonellae from eggs." The red
lion logo is carried by 70 per cent of the 27 million eggs consumed each
day in Britain, according to the council. Red lion eggs are now all to have
a "best before" date stamped both on the shell and on the pack, which
should be within 21 days of the eggs being laid. The new code of practice
will also require eggs to be stored on farms and by packers at a
temperature of no more than 20C (68F).
Vaccination of chicks began in August and by next summer, all eggs showing
the symbol should have been laid by vaccinated hens. The vaccine, developed
by the Central Veterinary Laboratory, gives hens immunity to _Salmonella
enteritidis_, the strain of the bacterium most often associated with
poultry and eggs. Last year there were 14,536 cases of human food poisoning
caused by that type of _Salmonella_.
It is estimated that about one in every 600 to 700 eggs carries
_Salmonella_ contamination on the outer surface of its shell and that one
in 7,000 has infected yolks.
The level of salmonellae in eggs has remained virtually unchanged over the
past ten years, despite the slaughter by the Government of nearly four
million birds in infected flocks at a cost to the taxpayer of 8.5 million
bps in compensation to farmers. Advice from the Chief Medical Officer is
still to avoid eating foods made with undercooked or raw eggs.
