The Department of Health confirmed 1 person had died from listeria poisoning [actually an infection called listeriosis] but were unable to provide further details to protect their privacy. The tragedy is 1 of 7 cases of listeriosis reported in the last 3 weeks. Victoria typically only deals with a single case of listeria every 2 to 3 weeks. All of the other patients have either already left hospital or their conditions are regarded as improving.

A Health Department investigation found no links between any of the 7 cases and a different strain of the listeriosis bacteria was responsible for each, raising concerns of wider problems over the coming weeks.

"Although it's hard to piece together exactly the pattern over summer for listeriosis, all the kind of things that create risk are present -- higher temperatures, food is left out longer, soft foods, rich foods, foods left where it's not safe -- so it seems like this is a time to be mindful of the food safety messages," Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer Dr Finn Romanes said.

"Pregnant women and their foetuses, newborn babies, the elderly and those who are immune compromised ... those groups are particularly at risk, they have a 30 percent fatality rate and these bacteria can end up in their blood, in joints and in meningitis and a serious brain infection."

Health Minister Jill Hennessy reiterated the warning for all Victorians follow simple safety measures. "Preventing food poisoning can be as simple as washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water and making sure food is prepared and stored safely -- if you're sick, avoid parties and preparing food for at least 24 hours afterwards," she said.

Those in high-risk groups are warned to avoid soft cheeses, ready-to-eat seafood such as cooked chilled prawns, smoked fish, oysters or raw seafood, pre-prepared salads and sandwiches, drinks made from fresh fruit and vegetables and unpasteurised dairy products or soft-serve ice cream.

A Chief Health Officer Advisory sent to doctors today called for all health professionals to take extra precautions when dealing with pregnant women presenting with fever, fatigue and muscle aches, and consider the possibility of [listeriosis] being the cause.

Doctors have been requested to take a clinical sample [blood sample for culture?] of patients fitting the profile to test for listeriosis.

Department of Health's top 10 food safety tips
----------------------------------------------
1. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling food
2. Keep your utensils, cutting boards, dishes and containers clean and dry
3. Store food at the correct temperatures. Cold food should be stored at less than 5 deg.C [41 deg.F]
4. Cook food thoroughly
5. If in doubt throw it out
6. Separate raw and cooked foods
7. Use different utensils, cutting boards and containers for raw and ready-to- eat food
8. Check your fridge and freezer temperatures
9. Keep salads, spreads, dips and other perishable products in the fridge or a cooler until needed

[Listeriosis is an illness caused by eating food contaminated by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus. _Listeria_ can be found in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and food made from unpasteurized milk. Cooking will usually kill the organism; but food can be contaminated after cooking and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 deg.F (2-3 deg.C). If previously refrigerated contaminated food is reheated sufficiently before serving, _Listeria_ again should be killed, but can cause listeriosis if served without further cooking, for example, in "ready-to-eat" food.

In the U.S., _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

The news report above says that "a different strain of the listeriosis bacteria was responsible for each" [case] and there were "no links between any of the 7 cases", suggesting that each isolate had a different genotype and a food history failed to find a common food exposure.
