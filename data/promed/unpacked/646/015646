Even for Madagascar, this is no ordinary bubonic plague outbreak. The African nation has the world's highest incidence of the bacterial infection that earned the grim name "The Black Death" after it killed an estimated 50 million people in the 14th century. The rat- and flea-borne illness hits the island nation every year from about December to April.

But 2017 is different, says the WHO's Dr. Eric Bertherat. This latest outbreak has popped up in a completely new area. The mountainous area of Befotaka in southeastern Madagascar has seen 68 cases -- of which 27 have died -- since the end of 2016, according to WHO estimates.

Bertherat said there also are unconfirmed reports of a nearby 2nd cluster of some 30 cases. "This outbreak occurred in a place where they had no plague case reported since 1950," he told VOA from Geneva, after returning from a recent visit to Madagascar to assess the situation.

Even more alarming, he says, is the fact that "it occurred in a very remote and insecure place where it's very difficult to go. And that's the main problem, for the time being. There is no one to control the outbreak, because we are still trying to organize a kind of rescue operation to go there."

Bertherat says plague is impossible to entirely eradicate. To do so, he said, would mean killing every plague-carrying wild animal, which is an impossible task, and very likely would disrupt a delicate ecological balance. Some developed nations like the USA experience plague. The CDC reported 16 cases in 2015. Four of those cases ended in death.

Bertherat says Madagascar is exceptionally susceptible, however, because of its persistent poverty. The spread of plague is often aided by poor sanitation and a lack of health care. But why, with modern medicine and new rapid tests available in Madagascar, does this 14th century affliction appear to be growing? The answer, Bertherat says, may lie in a very modern trend: deforestation. Madagascar has seen massive deforestation because of illegal logging and as subsistence farmers continue to push into wild habitats.

"Our hypothesis," he said, "is that this re-emergence in fact is due to the further extension of the natural focus of the migration of the rats, and also the fact that there is more and more contact between the local population and the forest area."

[The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403 (available at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm):

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However, since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread.
