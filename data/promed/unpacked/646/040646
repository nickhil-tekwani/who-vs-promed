[2] Outbreak summaries

Another 4 Ebola cases reported in DRC, 3268 total
-------------------------------------------------
In a continuation of the steady stream of Ebola cases recorded in recent days in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the WHO Ebola dashboard shows 4 new cases today, raising the outbreak total to 3268, a number that includes 117 probable cases. Another 400 suspected cases are still under investigation. No new deaths were recorded, so the fatality total stands at 2181.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said in an update today [29 Oct 2019] that yesterday's single case originated from Mabalako. The CMRE also said that the DRC government is organizing an operational review of the outbreak today through 31 Oct 2019, including addressing any bottlenecks in implementing response activities. It involves both national and international leaders.

Today, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reaffirmed its commitment to ending the 14-month-long outbreak in the DRC, saying it would "double down on our efforts to reach zero cases." [see [3] below]

"We are walking on a tightrope. We know that it does not take much for cases in a new area to escalate quickly, as we have seen following previous lulls in cases in this outbreak," said Dalia al-Awqati, the Ebola response director for the IRC in DRC, in a press release. "It only takes one infected person to travel to a new area to start a new transmission chain. Given the 21 day incubation period, the chances of this are relatively high."

The IRC said the rural hot spots of the viral disease already face significant challenges, including limited access to drinking water and inaccessible roads.

- Mon 28 Oct 2019. Slow rise in case numbers

Ebola cases continue slow rise in DRC outbreak
----------------------------------------------
The slow rise in new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continued over the weekend [26-27 Oct 2019] and through today [28 Oct 2019], with 4 new cases -- and with outbreak responders tracking the movements of a patient who fled into the community, potentially exposing others to the virus.

Daily updates from the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) show that the latest cases are all from the current main hot spots, which are rural and pose a host of access and security problems.

Of the 4 new cases, one was reported today, according to the WHO online Ebola dashboard. The new cases push the outbreak's overall total to 3264, a number that includes 117 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 357 suspected cases.

Patient flees into community
----------------------------
In its last 3 daily updates, the CMRE said the latest new cases are in Mabalako in North Kivu province and Mandima in Ituri province. The main epicenter in Mandima has been the Biakato Mines area, the source of about half of the recently reported cases.

WHO said in one of its most recent updates that health officials are concerned about people exposed to Ebola in Biakato Mines who travel to other areas, increasing the risk of spread to new areas or reigniting transmission in earlier affected locations.

On 26 Oct 2019, the CMRE noted that of 4 new cases reported on 25 Oct 2019, 3 were in Mabalako and one in Mandima. In updates on 27 Oct 2019 and today [28 Oct 2019], the CMRE reports covered 3 new cases: 2 in Mandima and 1 in Mabalako.

In its report yesterday, the CMRE said an investigation is still under way into a patient whose illness was confirmed on 23 Oct 2019 in Mandima and who fled into the community. Another 3 people died from their infections, raising the fatality count to 2181. The latest CMRE reports have a few details on 3 deaths, 2 of which occurred in the community in Mandima and another reported in a patient at Mabalako's Ebola treatment center. Deaths that happen in the community raise the risk of disease spread.

[3] Response
Date: Tue 29 Oct 2019

Any let-up in Ebola response could risk escalation of outbreak in DRC, warns IRC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the daily number of reported Ebola cases continues to be in single digits, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reaffirms that we must double down on our efforts to reach zero cases. Any let up in the response could risk a flare up of cases, and in turn prolong the outbreak.

Many of the areas in which the disease is now present represent a significant challenge to the response due to their remoteness and poor infrastructure, meaning curbing transmission continues to require significant effort. Increasingly we are working with small communities with pre-existing challenges such as lack of access to water and poor access to basic services.

For example, to travel the 36 km [22 mi] to Mayuwano from the small town of Mambasa in southwest Ituri province takes 2 hours on a good day. On a bad day the road is simply impassable. Once in Mayuwano, there is little infrastructure meaning that all materials for triages need to be brought along the increasingly damaged road, which the community also relies on. This example also brings to light the challenges that many people in North Kivu and south west Ituri face every day, with or without an Ebola outbreak.

The risk of spread from the DRC to neighboring countries remains high. This means maintaining high levels of preparedness in these countries until the very end of the outbreak in DRC. This includes both monitoring for and responding to Ebola cases, as well as working to ensure that existing humanitarian programming is resilient to a potential outbreak.

The IRC has been responding to the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri since its declaration in August last year [2018] working in more than 90 health facilities in Beni, Mabalako, Butembo, Goma, and in south west Ituri, leading on infection prevention and control (IPC). The IRC is also working in women's and children's protection and community engagement, and integrating Ebola-related protection concerns in areas where the IRC supports primary health care services. The IRC has a long-standing presence in this area of North Kivu and continues to equally address pre-existing and persistent health and protection needs related to displacement and insecurity in this area now impacted by Ebola.

The IRC has been working in the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1996 responding to the humanitarian crisis in the east. It has since evolved into one of the largest providers of humanitarian assistance and post-conflict development, with life-saving programming in health, economic recovery, women's and children's protection, and livelihoods.
