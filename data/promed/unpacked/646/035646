Koubia: Anthrax re-surfaced with several cases
----------------------------------------------
A new outbreak of anthrax has been reported in Middle Guinea in a town in the prefecture of Koubia -- just when Guinea is still struggling to overcome the epidemic of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

Several members of the same family, who ate meat from an infected animal, have been contaminated. "They are 11 people, of which 2 developed the disease, with a death in the community. A woman died of the disease, and a 2nd patient is showing signs [of the disease]: a man who is about 25 is currently hospitalized in the prefecture of Koubia, where he is being supported," said Dr. Thierno Ibrahima Kourouma, the prefectural director of health [DPS] in Koubia.

"When we were informed, an investigative mission visited the premises; the head of the center who went to carry out the investigation made a strong case for awareness [of the disease], and reminded people about the symptoms and dangers of the disease if the meat from animals infected with anthrax is eaten. In fact, those who consume the meat of the sick animal are at risk of developing the disease. Whether cattle or goats, all these animals can be contaminated," continued the DPS of Koubia.

Note that last year [2014] in the same period, an anthrax outbreak was declared in Koubia where 12 people died.

[Koubia, in northern Guinea, can be found on the map at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/guinea_pol02.jpg. According to Wikipedia, Koubia is a prefecture located in the Labe Region of Guinea in the Fouta Djallon mountains. Fulas are the majority ethnic group in the region with Fula (Pular) as the primary language. The capital is Koubia. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koubia_Prefecture or http://www.fallingrain.com/world/GV/44/Koubia3.html.

Checking my records for Guinea, Koubia Prefecture is reported as having anthrax, though not at the high levels more typical of other prefectures. Previous to last year's (2014) outbreak [see link below], it was reported in cattle in 2005 (4 outbreaks, 52 cases), in 2006 (1 outbreak, 3 cases), and in 2012 (3 outbreaks, 15 cases), but it is a small prefecture. Obviously, any local advice given last year in the follow-up on those multiple deaths had been forgotten this year. - Mod.MHJ
