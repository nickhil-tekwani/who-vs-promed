In what is reported to be an isolated outbreak of anthrax in the
country, 5 persons were diagnosed with it in Prakasam district
today [30 Mar 2009]. They were taken ill after consuming meat [from]
affected sheep reared at Kalluru village in Kurichedu mandal of
Prakasam district.

Experts from the Animal Husbandry Department confirmed reports that
200 of the sheep reared in Kalluru village were affected with anthrax,
while there are chances of many more such cases. Following reports
[that] 200 sheep died due to a mysterious disease, the veterinary
doctor at Kurichedu mandal rushed to the village and alerted deputy
director of Animal Husbandry K Niranjan. Niranjan immediately rushed a
medical team to the village, which took samples of the dead sheep,
conducted tests, and confirmed that death was due to anthrax.

The Animal Husbandry Department has set up a medical camp at the
village and also conducted tests on people to check if they have
been affected by the disease. "We have quarantined the 10 persons,
who reportedly ate the meat of the affected sheep. We are also
conducting a door-to-door survey to know, if anybody else consumed
the contaminated meat" Niranjan said. The 10 persons were
administered anti-anthrax vaccine.

Speaking to Express, Niranjan said that they had identified that
around 8000 more sheep were being reared within 5 km (3 mi) radius of
Kalluru village and added that the Animal Husbandry Department had
formed special teams and will visit all the villages and vaccinate the
sheep as a precautionary measure.

Prakasam District Collector K Devanand told 'Express' that he had
asked the police and revenue officials to take precautionary measures
to check spread of the disease.

Niranjan said that the Animal Husbandry Department had 3000
anti-anthrax vaccines [for livestock] at hand and had ordered more
from Hyderabad. He said that experts would be called to dispose of the
carcasses as anthrax spores had the capability of surviving extreme
conditions for many years, sometimes for over a century.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The reason that anthrax outbreaks in sheep can involve large numbers
of animals is that they are not valued individually as highly as
cattle, and in some cultures they are also the responsibility of
women. So deaths are ignored until it is patently obvious that
something has gone wrong, as in this instance. It is also why the
disease is under-reported in sheep and goats. - Mod.MHJ]
