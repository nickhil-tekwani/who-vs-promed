NORWALK-LIKE VIRUSES, CONTROL GUIDELINES

Control of Norwalk-like Viruses in the Tourist Industry - Guidelines
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Norwalk-like virus (NLV) outbreaks in both hotels and cruise ships are
increasingly recognised within the package tourist industry. Control is
often very difficult as hoteliers, local public health officials, and tour
operators all have different approaches and priorities. The closure of a
hotel even for a short time can have major economic consequences and
although often recommended will not necessarily result in the cessation of
an outbreak. Hotels present an interesting scenario in that new susceptible
hosts are introduced at regular intervals encouraging the continuance of an
outbreak in which person to person spread appears to be a major factor.
The Health and Safety Committee of the Federation of Tour Operators
representing the major U.K. tour operators, who between them sell over 13
million holidays each year, have produced some pilot guidelines for dealing
with NLV outbreaks in hotels. (We have referred to the illness caused as
gastric flu as this is more meaningful to lay persons.) Input has been
provided by a number of national health authorities.
They will be used this summer and modified later in the year in the light
of experience. I will be happy to send a copy to anyone who is prepared to
provide a feedback from practical experience of dealing with hotel
outbreaks. At the end of the day these guidelines must be of practical use
and not a series of theoretical-based proposals. I believe we still have a
lot to learn in the management of NLV outbreaks.

[The pilot guidelines copied to ProMED-mail by Professor Cartwright are a
useful document dealing with the theoretical and practical aspects of the
control of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in hotels, cruise ships, and
similar situations in the tourist industry. These guidelines are too
detailed and comprehensive to summarize here. ProMED-mail subscribers
wishing to obtain copies of the manual and interested in the field testing
of these guidelines should contact Professor Cartwright directly.
ProMED-mail will be interested to learn the outcome of the evaluation of
these guidelines and their modification in the light of practical
experience. - Mod.CP]
