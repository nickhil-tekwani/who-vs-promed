Rabies events Nos. 21, 24, 25
-----------------------------
Event 1.
On Sun 25 Aug 2013, a jackal entered the premises of Kibbutz Ortal, an agricultural village on the Golan heights (map at http://tinyurl.com/naj4maw). The animal tried to attack a person, and was driven away without biting; a few hours later, the jackal attacked and bit a person in the orchard near the Kibbutz and was shot and sent to the national rabies laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. On 26 Aug 2013, the lab diagnosed rabies by fluorescent antibody test (FAT), and the relevant public and animal health authorities were duly notified for prescribed measures to be taken. This event has become Israel's rabies case No. 21 for 2013.

Event 2.
On Sun 29 Sep 2013, an 11-week-old male calf died on a cattle holding in Beit Zaid (western part of Yezreel valley, map at http://tinyurl.com/p297f4q) after showing clinical neurological signs suspected to be rabies. This happened about 17 days after the animal's transportation to the farm from Ortal (event 1). The brain was recovered and sent to the KVI on 30 Sep 2013 and was found on the same date to be rabies positive. Reportedly, the calf was not vaccinated against rabies. This has become Israel's rabies case No. 24 for 2013 (see dynamic and static maps as above; cattle = blue square).

Event 3.
On Sun 29 Sep 2013, a male calf, 12 weeks old, on a cattle fattening unit in Kfar Yehoshua (3 km southeast of event case 2, map at http://tinyurl.com/q8d7apv) reportedly showed neurological signs suspected to be rabies. This happened about 12 days after the animal was brought from the farm of event 2, most probably belonging to the same transport from Ortal (event 1). The animal was euthanised; the brain was recovered and sent to the KVI on 30 Sep 2013 and was found on the same date to be rabies positive. Reportedly, the calf was not vaccinated against rabies. This has become Israel's rabies case No. 25 for 2013 (see dynamic and static maps as above; cattle = blue square).

The dates of the calves' transports from the Ortal dairy operation during August and September 2013, their numbers, their destinations in Israel, and the current health status of all transported calves at the destined farms in several locations are under investigation.

[The Ortal dairy operation is one of Israel's largest and most modern ones. Male calves leave the operation at the age of a few weeks to be fattened in other locations throughout Israel. It may be assumed that during the incident of 25 Aug 2013 (No 21), when a rabid jackal entered Kibbutz Ortal's premises, its entrance into the cattle barn/yards was probably not noticed and/or possibly not suspected. Similarly, bites or abrasions in cattle may have remained unnoticed. However, this issue has yet to be cleared up.

Golan, bordering Syria, has been rabies stricken since 2009; see detailed commentary in posting 20130909.1933192. The number and species of rabid animals on the Golan during 2013 can be seen in the dynamic and static maps (URLs in the posting above).

Generally, all cattle, other food animals and domestic animals on the Golan heights are included in a comprehensive rabies vaccination scheme. It will be interesting to note why the rabid calves were not vaccinated; the age of initial offspring vaccination probably depends upon the duration and rate of maternal (colostrum-derived) immunity.

Public-health-related aspects of this event are also to be addressed, particularly the potential exposure and treatment possibly undertaken (vaccination) of cattlemen, veterinary practitioners and other professionals who may have handled the calves. Similarly, information on precautionary measures in those handling other animals from the Golan, anywhere, will be helpful.

According to updated Israeli Animal health directives, food animals are not allowed to be moved from rabies-exposed premises for 90 days if they are unvaccinated and for 45 days if vaccinated.

Results of the epidemiological investigation are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
