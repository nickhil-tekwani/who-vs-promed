Dead pigeon panic: bird flu kills hundreds of birds at 2 Thai village schools
---------------------------------------------------
Panic has gripped a central Thailand village after hundreds of pigeons
found dead at 2 local schools were found to have died of bird flu. Disease
experts have been rushed to the district in a bid to reassure villagers
that they are not in danger, said Dr Thawat Suntaracharn, the
director-general of disease control for Thailand's Public Health Ministry.
Hundreds of pigeon carcasses were found at Sri Saliam primary school and
nearby Thung Saliam kindergarten in Sukhothai's Thung Saliam district on 5
Nov 2004. But panic broke out only after the cause of death was confirmed
by a provincial science centre on Wednesday [17 Nov 2004]. The affected
schools, with a total of 500 students, were immediately closed, and both
teachers and students told to leave the area, reported the Bangkok Post.
It is the 1st time bird flu has been recorded in the district. However, an
outbreak swept through one nearby district earlier in 2004 and a woman in
another died of bird flu during October 2004. Even so, Dr Thawat said the
school closure was an "over-reaction" that sparked unnecessary concern.
The students will be closely watched for bird flu symptoms, which has a
2-week incubation period. So far, none has shown symptoms. The province's
public health chief, Dr Somchai Rojanarattanangkul, said health volunteers
were already travelling around the district teaching the locals how to
contain the outbreak and monitor for symptoms. Villagers should not touch
the dead birds with bare hands or go into the affected area without a mask
and other protection, he said.
The director of Thailand's anti-bird flu operation centre, Mr Charal
Trinvuthipong, said agricultural officials were investigating how
widespread the outbreak was. He believed the birds had contracted the virus
elsewhere before flying as a flock into the area.
Meanwhile, an outbreak of bird flu that killed 83 tigers at Chon Buri
during October 2004 has been declared under control. More than 5000 Thai
and foreign tourists flocked to Si Racha Tiger Zoo when it unofficially
reopened yesterday after a month-long quarantine.
