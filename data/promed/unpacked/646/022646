Cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] is not endemic in Nepal, but saying extremely rare might be an understatement. Sporadic cases of CL have been reported from hospitals of Nepal from the eastern and central regions using staining, culture, and PCR analysis.

Among the 4 cases I treated; one female was from Tanahu District, Nepal with travel history to Chitawan District, Nepal; 2 cases were from Dolpa District, Nepal (one female resident of Dolpa without travel history and another from the Kathmandu with history of visit and stay longer to Dolpa Nepal); and one female from Makawanpur District, Nepal without travel history. 8 cases were reported from the western region of Nepal and 2 cases from eastern Nepal.

[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members who submitted responses to our request for further information. They indeed confirm that cutaneous leishmaniasis is rare in Nepal, but most probably increasing. - Mod.EP
