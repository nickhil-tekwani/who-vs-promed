Japan confirms H5N1 bird flu strain in swans
--------------------------------------------
Japan on Tuesday [29 Apr 2008] confirmed 4 swans found last week were
infected with the H5N1 strain of bird flu.

It was the 1st case of bird flu in Japan since March 2007 when the
highly virulent H5N1 strain was found in a wild bird in Kumamoto
prefecture on Japan's southern Kyushu island.

The swans, 3 of which had died, were found on the shores of Lake
Towada in northern Akita prefecture on 21 Apr 2008, the prefectural
government said.

Inspectors had initially detected the H5 subtype of bird flu in the
dead swans and conducted further tests, the local government said on
Monday [28 Apr 2008].

Japan has been stepping up checks of birds after a series of bird flu
outbreaks in South Korea over the past month.

There are no chicken farms within a 10 km (6 mile) radius of the area
where the swans were found, and no unusual incidents were noted at other farms.

Local authorities plan to conduct on-site inspections on Wednesday
and Thursday [30 Apr - 1 May 2008] at 15 farms within a radius of 30
km (19 miles) of the site where the swans were found, the official said.

Earlier on Tuesday [29 Apr 2008], South Korea reported a suspected
bird flu outbreak at a chicken farm in Ulsan City which, if
confirmed, would be the 1st in the southeast, as the country grapples
with its worst outbreak of avian influenza.

South Korea previously confirmed 20 cases of the H5N1 strain in
poultry in less than a month, despite having killed more than 5
million chickens and ducks, as the virus spreads at its fastest rate
since the country reported its 1st case in 2003.

No human deaths from the disease have been reported in South Korea or Japan.

similarity, in genotype terms, between the Korean H5N1 strain and the

Bird flu knocking at Norway's door
----------------------------------
Some 2000 chickens and ducks had to be slaughtered in Fyn in Denmark
on Tuesday [29 Apr 2008] after a routine test uncovered a strain of
bird influenza, putting Norwegians on high alert.

Norway is keeping close contact with the Danish animal health
authorities and continues to have a ban on fowl being allowed freedom
to go outdoors (except under a roof and surrounded by netting),
writes newspaper Aftenposten.

This is the 1st time in 2 years that the bird flu has been found in
Denmark and the agricultural authorities have put an export ban in
place for the time being.

Although it was dramatic for the farmers affected, the Danish
veterinary authorities tried to keep things calm, pointing out that
the bird flu strain found is not the most dangerous one -- the
so-called H5N1-influensa, writes Aftenposten.

In the end of December [2007], there was an outbreak of the dangerous
strain of bird flu in both Poland and Germany.

Meanwhile, anybody who finds a dead bird in Norway is encouraged to
report it to the state food inspectorate Mattilsynet.

Bird flu virus detected in Denmark
---------------------------------
Bird flu virus has been detected on a farm in Denmark's central Fyn
island, the country's veterinary department announced Monday [28 Apr 2008].

Some 2000 chickens on the farm in Stenstrup on the island will be
culled Tuesday [29 Apr 2008] to contain the spread of the disease,
the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a statement.

Initial checks show that the virus detected is not the deadly H5N1
strain that has ravaged Southeast Asia over the past 2 years.

Denmark was earlier struck by avian influenza in 2006.

[Denmark sent OIE an immediate notification on the outbreak,
including a map, on Tue 29 Apr 2008; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_imm_0000007005_20080429_162857.pdf>.
According to the report, the isolate is of a low pathogenic avian
influenza virus (serotype H7). The epidemiological comment says:
"Geese and ducks were tested in accordance with the Danish
surveillance programme for avian influenza in poultry. The Danish
Veterinary and Food Administration has set up a restricted zone
around the holding and is implementing the necessary measures in
accordance with the European Union Directive 2005/94/EC. - Mod.AS]
