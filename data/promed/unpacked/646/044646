Poland has reported several outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu [avian influenza] at poultry farms with flocks totaling nearly 650 000 birds, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday [8 Nov 2021].

Poland is the European Union's largest poultry producer.

Five outbreaks, of which 4 were at fattening turkey farms and one at a chicken broiler farm, were found in the eastern part of the country while another was discovered at a turkey and geese farm in the western part of the country, the OIE said, citing a report from Polish authorities.

Bird flu, most often carried from one country to the other by migrating wild birds, has been spreading rapidly in Europe, raising concern in the poultry industry after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds and international trade restrictions.

The French government on Friday [4 Nov 2021] put the entire country on high alert for bird flu, extending a requirement to keep all poultry flocks indoors.

This comes after Dutch authorities last month [October 2021] also ordered commercial farms to keep all flocks inside after bird flu was reported on a farm.

Meanwhile, in Britain, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5 bird flu was reported at a small poultry unit in central England on Monday [8 Nov 2021]. Britain last week [week of 1 Nov 2021] declared a nationwide Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, ordering farms and bird keepers to toughen biosecurity measures.

The following information comes from a scientific report (Conclusion section, page 5) providing an avian influenza overview in the EU/EEA and UK published on 29 Sep 2021, which is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-overview-september-2021.pdf:

"The presence of HPAI virus in western Russia and north of the Mongolian border with Russia, linked to key migration areas of wild waterbirds, is of concern due to the possible spread of the virus via wild birds migrating to the EU. Autumn migration from breeding sites to wintering sites is ongoing, and the low temperature of autumn and winter may facilitate the environmental survival of avian influenza virus potentially introduced to Europe. According to data available, the northern and eastern areas of Europe are likely to be the 1st places of new virus introduction. However, despite the increasing number of HPAI A(H5)-affected countries and outbreaks outside Europe, there is considerable uncertainty about the real geographical distribution of these viruses, particularly in wild birds and along the flyways.

"During summer, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations in Europe, primarily in northern areas. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few European countries. Despite this, the observed persistence of HPAI in wild birds in northern Europe into September 2021, in contrast with previous years, may indicate a risk for virus entry into poultry farms not only from wild birds migrating into Europe in the autumn and the winter but also from wild birds that are resident in Europe.

"The occurrence of HPAI A(H5) virus incursions in commercial farms even where birds are kept indoors raises concern about the capacity of applied biosecurity measures in effectively preventing virus exposure. Biosecurity standards should be revised and reinforced, and their implementation regularly checked, primarily in poultry production systems at high risk of avian influenza.

"The 2020-2021 epidemic with a total of 1298 outbreaks in poultry, 22.9 million birds affected, 85 detections in captive birds, and 2394 events in wild birds in 31 European countries appears to be one of the largest HPAI epidemics that has ever occurred in Europe. Note that the number of reported wild bird events is an underestimate of the total number of wild birds that have died from HPAI during this epidemic."

The number of outbreaks and other statistics, presented in the ECDC report above, have increased since its publication.

The locations of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks which have involved poultry, captive, and wild birds across Europe during the period 1 Sep to 2 Nov 2021, are presented in Map 1, on page 3 of DEFRA's updated assessment document, 'Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in the UK and Europe', available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1030888/HPAI-assessment-UK-Europe-2-Nov-2021.pdf (Poland's events yet to be added).

As reported (and indicated in the map above), HPAI H5N1 has been reported also from Israel, located on the central (West Asian) flyway of migrating birds. - Mods.CRD/AS
