[It is fortunate that the laboratory work was done by an OIE
reference laboratory -- ARRIAH (Federal Centre for Animal Health, OIE
Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central
Asia, and Transcaucasia in Vladimir, Russia). In this way, we learn
immediately that this is the same serotype O, Southeast Asia topotype
that has been identified in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mongolia,
Kazakhstan, Taiwan, and Tibet.

The location of the outbreak can be seen appended to the OIE WAHID
report reference above or on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive
map at <http://healthmap.org/r/01JH>. The location is only a few
kilometers from the Chinese border and helps all of us to learn,
again and again, that virulent fast moving strains of FMD have to be
fought vigorously and expeditiously. One key to success in such an
endeavor is transparency concerning where and when the disease occurs
as well as complete laboratory analysis and comparison of genotypes
circulating in any given geographic area. Let us hope this incursion
over the Russian border can be contained because we have seen just
how dangerous this particular serotype of FMD can be in terms of
rapidity of spread. - Mod.PC]
