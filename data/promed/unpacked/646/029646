Testing has confirmed a case of avian influenza on an Arkansas poultry farm in Madison County showing increased mortality over the course of several days. Following an investigation by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture's Livestock and Poultry Division (LPD) in collaboration with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Veterinary Services field operations personnel, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from this farm have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.

There is no public health concern, and avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat.

The Arkansas Department of Agriculture and partner agencies, including the USDA, are working to contain the situation. Actions include sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.

"We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry growers, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread," said Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward. "Arkansas poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food."

"This finding is the 1st case of HPAI in commercial poultry in Arkansas since 2015," said LPD Director Patrick Fisk. "Positive test results were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Service Laboratory in Ames, Iowa."

The detected avian influenza virus is the highly pathogenic H5 type, which is more severe and can cause high mortality in poultry flocks. It is the same strain confirmed in other states and wild birds in the Atlantic flyway.

"The farm is under quarantine to stop the spread of avian influenza to other flocks in the state," said Arkansas State Veterinarian John Nilz. "The birds on the affected farm were depopulated to prevent the spread of disease and will not enter the food system."

All poultry flock owners are encouraged to follow the strictest biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include the following:

- Limit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles, or animals on or off your farm.
- Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source.
- Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm.
- Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items that come into contact with flocks.
- Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl.
- Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian.

Backyard flock owners who have sick or unusual deaths in their flocks should email <info@agriculture.arkansas.gov> or call the office.

Additional background
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants ,quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl and wild birds, such as ducks, geese, raptors, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of two groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

The state Department of Agriculture said the highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a backyard flock in New Haven County.

Officials said the flock consists of turkeys, guinea fowl, and chickens. The animals are pets and aren't commercial property.

The positive avian flu results were detected on 4 Oct [2022]. Dept. of Agriculture officials said they're advising all poultry owners and producers to remain vigilant in protecting their flocks against avian flu.

"Detections in backyard and commercial flocks are increasing around the US and Canada," said State Veterinarian Dr. Jane Lewis. "This comes as wild birds begin their annual migration south. It is imperative anyone involved with poultry production review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds."

The disease is described as highly contagious and often fatal for chickens. Human infections with bird flu are rare and usually accompanied by prolonged exposure to sick or dead birds, according to the CDC, but are mostly fatal when they do happen.

The property has been quarantined and the flock has been depopulated to prevent further spread of the disease, according to officials.

The virus was initially detected in a backyard non-commercial flock in New London County in March [2022]. Officials said there have been multiple other confirmed avian flu cases since then within wild birds, primarily waterfowl and raptors.

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.

Samples from the flock were tested and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in New Mexico on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with these avian influenza detections in birds remains low. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [73.9 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to WOAH standards and minimize trade impacts. WOAH trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. WOAH trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities.

[4] Kentucky (Fayette County): backyard flock
Date: Fri 7 Oct 2022

https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article266974446.html


In an alert Friday [7 Oct 2022], the Kentucky Department of Agriculture [KDA] reported a confirmed case of avian influenza, commonly known as "bird flu," in a backyard flock of "mixed-species birds" in Fayette County. The case is the 3rd of its kind reported in the state this year [2022], after 2 outbreaks were detected at commercial operations in Webster and Fulton counties in February [2022].

The US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, which is contagious and deadly to birds, but poses little risk to humans.

The KDA did not release specific information regarding the location of the confirmed case in Fayette County. The site has been quarantined and is being surveilled to help stop the spread of the bird flu.

"The Kentucky Department of Agriculture and the Office of the State Veterinarian is working alongside animal health officials at both the federal and state government to contain this incident of avian influenza," Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles stated in a release.

The bird flu is not a food safety risk, officials said, but it is a deadly threat to commercial and backyard birds. The agency urged birdkeepers to take steps to protect their flock. "The virus is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. Domestic birds can be infected when a wild bird enters their premise or droppings land in an area near domestic flocks," the release notes. Signs of the virus include decreased water and feed consumption, respiratory signs, and high mortality.

In May [2022], the KDA cleared both the commercial operations in the state with outbreaks found in February [2022].

The bird flu has been confirmed in 507 flocks across 41 states in the US so far in 2022, according to the USDA. Of those, 274 are backyard flocks compared to 233 commercial flocks. The USDA reports 120 birds were affected in the Fayette County flock as of 6 Oct [2022]. Iowa leads the nation in terms of most birds affected by the outbreak, at more than 13.3 million.

Following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard poultry flock from Genesee County. This is the 1st detection in Genesee County. As wild birds complete their fall migration, bird owners still need to prioritize the health of their flocks by taking every preventative measure they can to protect them.

"New detections of HPAI are being seen not only in Michigan but also across the nation. The risk for domestic flocks becoming infected with the virus will remain high as wild birds continue their fall migration," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. "As wild birds travel and spread the virus, it is crucial for bird owners to prevent their birds from interacting with wild birds and being exposed to their germs. Actively taking steps to keep Michigan's domestic birds safe and healthy needs to remain a top priority."

HPAI is a highly contagious virus spreading in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent disease spread. The flock contained approximately 25 chickens.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, the public health risk associated with this avian influenza detection remains low. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the commercial food chain. As a reminder, people should properly handle and cook all poultry and eggs.

Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protect the health and vitality of Michigan's domestic birds:

- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Use well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

MDARD is continuing to work diligently with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of sick or dead domestic birds to best mitigate the spread of HPAI and provide outreach.

Reporting possible cases

For domestic birds:
Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths in the flock, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately or on the after-hours line.

For wild birds:
If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by:
- using the DNR's Eyes in the Field app. Choose the "diseased wildlife" option among the selections for "observation forms."
- calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory.

[6] Florida: multiple bird species

Emmanuel the Emu -- a viral sensation from earlier this year [2022] -- is near death's door after the bird flu has spread throughout his farm, killing off a lot of the owners' other animals.

[TB] shared the sad news Saturday [15 Oct 2022], saying their business has been hit hard by avian influenza -- this after a pack of wild geese has consistently flown onto their property -- leaving behind deadly strains of the flu that has taken its toll.

[TB] says they've lost 99% of their domesticated birds -- including all of their ducks, geese, and chickens -- not to mention some of their emus, including Emily, Eliza, and Elliot.

Now, it sounds like only Emmanuel and another emu named Rico are left alive -- but [TB] says Emmanuel is on the mend right now after unexpectedly going down on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], apparently a result of catching the bird flu that's running rampant on their farm.

[TB] says she's been tending to him around the clock, and Emmanuel is fighting to stay alive. While she's devastated over the loss of their other animals, she says she's grateful to still have Emmanuel, and believes he'll make a full recovery, despite some nerve damage.

She explains: "It seems like I haven't been able to catch a break these past few months, but I am so incredibly blessed. I have so much gratitude in my heart that Emmanuel is still alive. That he is fighting. That my best friend is making a comeback. I am going to be OK; we are going to be OK!"

[TB] says she's working through getting Emmanuel back to 100% with physical therapy [PT] and is asking the public for prayers, as well as help on tips in regards to big bird PT.

One last thing: it sounds like the water dispersed all over Florida as a result of Hurricane Ian may have contributed to the bird flu spreading like crazy. Scary stuff, especially if you have livestock that may be susceptible. Here's hoping Emmanuel can pull through.

[Sadly, this disease is opening up wounds for many people who are experiencing a 2nd time of the death of their birds.

The wild birds migrate, and this highly pathogenic strain of the avian influenza is closely attached to these wild birds making their southern pilgrimage. As they travel, they are leaving a wake of destruction behind them.

Protect your birds! This nightmare has not ended yet. Strengthen biosecurity, be alert to any signs of other birds in the area, move your birds inside so there is no contact with wild birds or their feces, which also can spread the disease.

We express hope that the pet emu will recover. - Mod.TG
