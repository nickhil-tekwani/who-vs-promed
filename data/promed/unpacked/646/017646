Texas: West Nile Virus (WNV) and Encephalitis a Threat to Horses;
Vaccination Can Provide Protection
----------------------------
A few moments with your local veterinary practitioner can help protect
horses, mules and donkeys against mosquito-borne diseases, advises Dr.
Terry Conger, veterinarian and state epidemiologist for the Texas Animal
Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency.
Vaccines are available to protect horses against 3 viral diseases that pose
a risk to Texas horses: West Nile Virus (WNV), and Eastern and Western
Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and (WEE) viruses. The 3 diseases are forms of
"sleeping sickness," that can cause infected horses to develop debilitating
fever, swelling of the brain, muscle tremors, weakness and extreme fatigue,
and in about a third or more of cases, death of the animal.
"As of Tue 24 Jun 2003, 26 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection have
been reported this year by the Texas Department of Health's (TDH) Zoonosis
Control Division, which maintains the state's statistical database for
reporting laboratory-confirmed WNV cases in humans, mosquitoes, birds, and
horses," said Dr. Conger. "According to the TDH, the 26 cases have been
confirmed in one horse each in Angelina, Calhoun and Van Zandt Counties.
WNV also has been detected in 6 birds and 4 mosquito pools in Harris
County; one bird in Orange County; one bird and 2 mosquito pools in Dallas
County; 4 mosquito pools in Tarrant County, 3 mosquito pools in Jefferson
and 2 in Nueces Counties."
"In June 2002, Texas had its first case of WNV infection, and by year's
end, 1699 equine cases had been reported. Denton County was hit hardest,
with 69 equine cases," explained Dr. Terry Conger, TAHC's state
epidemiologist. "More unreported cases undoubtedly occurred across the
state, as owners may have been reluctant to ask their veterinarian or the
TAHC for assistance. Only laboratory-confirmed cases are included in the
state's database. Most private veterinary practitioners send blood or
tissue samples for WNV testing to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory (TVMDL) in College Station or Amarillo."
WNV infection was first detected in the U.S. in New York in l999, and since
then, the virus has swept across the country, spread by infected mosquitoes
that have fed on birds carrying the disease. Only 4 states on the U.S.
mainland have not reported cases: Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Dr.
Conger said it is likely that these states also will eventually have cases
of WNV infection.
"Sporadic outbreaks of WEE and EEE also occur throughout the U.S., and this
year we may have cases in Texas, as South Carolina, Florida and Georgia
have already confirmed EEE in horses. Because Texas has a large mosquito
population and history of infection in past years, it is prudent to have
equine animals vaccinated against WEE and EEE every year," said Dr. Conger.
"It is important to note that the vaccines for WNV, WEE and EEE do not
provide cross-protection. For example, WNV vaccine protects only against
WNV." As of late June, 14 horses in South Carolina have been diagnosed
with EEE. In Florida, more than 110 EEE cases in equine animals have been
confirmed, and in Georgia, a dog, 3 birds and 16 horses have tested
positive for the disease.
"WNV, EEE and WEE are going to be with us always, as these diseases have
become endemic in our country. Even if you try to reduce the mosquito
population in your area, vaccinating against these mosquito-borne diseases
still needs to be part of routine horse health maintenance," said Dr. Conger.
Dr. Conger explained that the WNV vaccine for horses vaccination requires a
series of 2 shots, administered 3 to 6 weeks apart. After the second
injection, several more weeks must pass before full immunity is
developed. Equine animals vaccinated last year should receive a single
WNV booster this year. In areas where mosquitoes are a continual problem
year-round, animals should receive a WNV booster every six months. "Owners
should take action now to get their equine animals vaccinated, before cases
become more widespread," urged Dr. Conger.
"EEE and WEE vaccines are available in a combined product. To develop
disease protection, the animal will need 2 injections, 30 days apart. A
booster shot is then needed annually or biannually," said Dr. Conger. "In
most cases, horses can be vaccinated for WNV, EEE/WEE at the same time." He
said some veterinarians also employ the EEE/WEE vaccine in an off-label use
to protect ratites (emus, rheas and ostriches) against the disease.
"While no vaccine can guarantee 100 percent protection, it's much better
than no protection," commented Dr. Conger. "Last year, Colorado State
University followed more than 500 equine animals infected with WNV in
Colorado and Nebraska. The death rate was greater than 36 percent in
animals that had not received vaccine. The death loss dropped to around 20
percent for animals that had received at least one dose of WNV vaccine. Of
the 13 animals properly vaccinated with 2 doses of vaccine, a dozen survived."
Dr. Conger said equine animals infected with WNV, EEE or WEE, may exhibit
similar signs, including fever, irregular gait, teeth grinding,
drowsiness, an inability to swallow. Affected animals may be paralyzed and
be unable to rise. He said TAHC and public health officials advise owners
to have sick animals tested to diagnose the disease that caused illness or
death, because rabies always must be considered when an animal is
disoriented or staggers. If an owner has been exposed to rabies while
caring for a sick horse, appropriate preventive health measures must be
taken immediately, he said.

Kansas: Presence of West Nile Virus-positive Mosquitoes Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Heath officials have confirmed the presence of West Nile virus in
mosquitoes from Crawford County. "We expected to see West Nile virus in the
state again this year, so this is no surprise, nor is it a reason to
panic," Dr. Gail Hansen, the state public health veterinarian, said
Thursday. "We're looking harder and earlier than we did last year."
Kansas began capturing birds and mosquitoes on 20 May 2003 and testing them
for West Nile virus. The Crawford County sample was taken on 28 May 2002,
and 16 sites are being sampled statewide. Last year, West Nile was first
confirmed in July, Hansen said. Unlike the mosquitoes that carry West Nile
on the East Coast and prefer to bite birds, Hansen said the Midwest
mosquitoes will bite bird, horse or human.
West Nile virus first arrived in Kansas last year, with 22 human cases and
794 cases found in horses and mules. More than 300 birds were tested.
Animal health officials have been encouraging owners to vaccinate horses,
something that can be done with a regular battery of shots.

USGS Surveillance Update, as of Wed 25 Jun 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the USGS reflect information for
the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season that has been submitted and
verified to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) up to Wed
25 Jun 2003.
The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are created
from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance database. The maps
portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive surveillance data reported to
the CDC by cooperating health departments and verified to ArboNET. In
addition, maps for 2 surveillance categories (avians and mosquitoes) will
portray counties that have done "testing" of samples for WNV.
Discrepancies noted between these data and data presented from other
sources reflect local variations in reporting policies and procedures. It
is not unusual for cases to be announced in other media before being
reported and verified in ArboNET.
The following information is a synopsis of the results of West Nile virus
surveillance listed according to state. The original USGS maps further
locate both positive and negative surveillance reports by county. (The data
are provisional and may be subject to revision.)
Birds
-----
29 states are conducting surveillance with 23 states reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Alabama (5), Colorado (1), Florida (5),
Georgia (9), Illinois (2), Indiana (3) Iowa (4), Kentucky (0), Louisiana
(38), Michigan (6), Mississippi (3), Missouri (1), New Hampshire (0),
Nebraska (1) New Jersey (1), New York (1), North Carolina (3), North Dakota
(2), Ohio (4), Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (3), South
Dakota (0), Tennessee (4), Texas (7), Utah (0), Virginia (5), Washington

Mosquitoes
----------
11 states are conducting surveillance with 4 states reporting cumulative
positive results as follows: Colorado (0), Connecticut (0), Georgia (2),
Indiana (2), New Hampshire (0), New Jersey (1), North Carolina (0),
Pennsylvania (0), South Dakota (0), Texas (16), Utah (0).

Sentinel Flocks
---------------
3 states are conducting surveillance, with all 3 reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Florida (37), North Carolina (1), South
Dakota (9).

Veterinary
----------
Ten states are conducting surveillance and all 10 are reporting cumulative
positive test results [presumed to be equines] as follows: Alabama (1),
Arkansas (1), Georgia (1), Kentucky (1), Missouri (1),Minnesota (1), North
Dakota (1), Texas (4), Wisconsin (1), Wyoming (3).

Human
-----
There are no confirmed reports of surveillance activity or positive test
results from any state. [A suspected case of human infection in Washington
state (see: West Nile virus, human - USA (Washington): suspected
20030601.1334) has not been confirmed. Another suspected case was reported
from South Carolina on 15 Jun 2003 and confirmation is still pending (see:
West Nile virus, human - USA (SC) 20030615.1480). - Mod.CP]

[Since the previous report dated 18 Jun 2003 the number of states carrying
out surveillance of wild birds has increased by 3 to 29. West Nile
virus-positive birds have been reported from 23 states, with positive
results reported from Missouri, Texas and Virginia for the first time. The
number of states reporting West Nile virus positive equines has increased
by two (Missouri and Texas). Four of the 11 states conducting surveillance
of mosquitoes have reported West Nile virus positive results (Georgia,
Indiana, New Jersey, and for the first time Texas). The number of states
reporting surveillance of sentinel flocks has increased from two to three,
with all three states reporting positive results. No human cases of West
Nile virus infection have been confirmed anywhere in the United States;
confirmation of a suspected case in South Carolina is still awaited. - Mod.CP]
