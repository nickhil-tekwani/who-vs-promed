An anthrax scare has gripped the adjacent Bano block of Simdega district in Jharkhand [See ProMED posts 20141024.2899028 and 20141028.2909910]. Sources said tribals from Bano village, which has reported 7 [human] deaths due to the disease in 13 days, continue to frequent the border pockets of Sundargarh.

Though the situation is claimed to be under control, fear of the disease spreading to the border villages of Sundargarh looms large after 10 patients undergoing treatment at Sadar Hospital in Bano reportedly escaped.

Reliable sources said that about 16 days back, villagers of Karuchdaga of Bano had processed the carcass of a cow and later consumed it. Two patients died on 15 Oct 2014, and another perished the next day, while local health authorities failed to identify the disease. A medical team led by Civil-Surgeon-cum-Chief-Medical-Officer Dr ADN Prasad took charge of the situation. Between 18-20 Oct 2014, 4 more patients succumbed to the disease. Reportedly, 7 of the 10 quarantined patients fled the hospital on 23 Oct 2014 and the other 3 on Monday [27 Oct 2014?].

After blood samples tested anthrax positive at RIMS, Ranchi, a team of doctors from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) took stock of the situation on Sunday [26 Oct 2014]. Simdega-based District Magistrate and Deputy Commissioner Diprava Lakra said the situation is under control, and teams have started providing preventive medication to vulnerable persons along with vaccination of animals in a radius of 5 km. He said a ban has been imposed in the block on the sale of meat for the next 15 days.

Dr Prasad said that, normally, human to human contact is not risky, but human to animal contact carries the risk of transmission of the disease. He said anthrax is spread by contact with spores, and affected persons with itchy skin or sores could be a potential threat to humans who come into contact with them.

Last month [September 2014], a person died of anthrax at Hathibari area of Nuagaon block in Sundargarh. No monitoring process has been put in place, even though tribal vegetable vendors from Bano visit Rourkela city daily. Many from the affected area also frequent their relatives and friends in Nuagaon. Sundargarh Chief District Medical Officer Dr Basant Nayak said he would ask the authorities of the Public Health wing to take necessary steps in this regard.

[Sundargarh is on the northwest border of Odisha (previously known as Orissa). For a map of India, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg. Orissa/Odisha is in the western corner of India abutting West Bengal. For a description of Sundargarh, go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundergarh.

I am glad to see that the Odisha veterinary authorities have vaccinated the livestock in the affected village and in the 5-km surrounding area. But to be cost effective, livestock vaccination must be proactive, not reactive after an outbreak has occurred. Sterne vaccine is probably the world's cheapest vaccine, so cost should not be a hindrance. Barring regional compulsory annual vaccination -- this has just been initiated in Buenos Aires Province in Argentina because of slack voluntary compliance -- the next best tactic is to vaccinate the livestock in and around any and all villages with a case of anthrax for minimally 5 years, along with a sensitive awareness programme to report new unexpected livestock deaths, or, in this case, human cases.

Rewarding reports of anthrax cases has an extraordinary response. Historically, it converted anthrax from a sometime event in western Canada in the 1960s to a proper awareness of its common incidence; and the disease is now truly sporadic. In Cyprus, it was made a punishable event if an unexpected livestock death occurred and was not reported; the non-reporting owner was sent to prison for 3 weeks, and any snitches were financially rewarded. Eradication soon followed. The positive Canadian response was to generously cover the cost of carcass incineration and herd vaccination. Any such programme must have a locally appropriate carrot and stick. The Indian states should consider following suit. - Mod.MHJ
