Slip-up by the Minnesota DNR allowed fish virus into state
----------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota DNR [Department of Natural Resources] allowed 2000 trout to
be imported from Wisconsin [in 2008] to stock a rural Cloquet man's private
pond. But the source hatchery had a contagious fish virus not found in
Minnesota.

Last May [2008], the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources mistakenly
approved a shipment of 2000 rainbow trout from Wisconsin to a rural Cloquet
man, who legally purchased them and put them into his private pond. The
pond owner, Curt Teberg, paid [USD] 3600 for the trout and never expected
they would cause him months of headache. A mutual fund manager, Teberg said
he stocked the fish into his elaborately designed fishing pond, which he
uses to entertain stockholders and hold charitable fishing events. But soon
after the stocking, DNR officials told Teberg his trout came from a
Wisconsin fish hatchery that had tested positive for a contagious fish
virus called infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) [virus], which had never
been found in Minnesota. The virus isn't dangerous to humans, but it can be
fatal to trout and salmon.

Realizing their mistake, DNR officials told Teberg they would net and kill
every trout in his pond. The agency spent [USD] 11 000 in taxpayer money to
"depopulate" the pond, test the fish, and bury many of them in Teberg's
pasture. Tests showed at least one trout carried the IPN virus, though none
showed signs of illness. DNR officials said they hope they prevented the
virus from escaping into the wild.

The DNR has promised to replace Teberg's trout this spring with state-owned
hatchery trout, including trophy specimens. "It was surreal," Teberg said.
"How could this happen when the government has such tight rules and
regulations?" The answer: Top fisheries managers failed to heed warnings
from the DNR's own fish-disease expert and misunderstood state laws written
to keep fish diseases out of Minnesota, according to records reviewed by
the Pioneer Press.

Protecting state's waters
-------------------------
Fish can get viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases, and the DNR takes
the threat of those diseases seriously. To keep wild and hatchery fish from
getting sick, Minnesota has some of the nation's strictest regulations for
importing bait and commercial fish, said Roy Johannes, the DNR's
aquaculture specialist. Some of the laws go back to the 1960s, but some
were updated in 1992 and 2008.

"From our standpoint, we have to protect a tremendous fishery," Johannes
said. "We probably have among the top 10 walleye lakes in the nation. We
have tremendous trout fishing in the south east and on the North Shore."
Fish viruses can be difficult to prevent because they can spread through
water and fish feces and through fish-feeding animals, Johannes said.

In recent years, a virus called viral hemorrhagic septicemia [VHS] has
caused major fish kills across the Great Lakes. It has been found in
Wisconsin and caused serious concern in Minnesota and other Great Lakes
states. Since 2007, the DNR has spent [USD] 231 000 on a testing and
prevention program to keep VHS out of state waters, and new VHS laws are
clamping down on fish importation. At risk, said Johannes, is a [USD] 2.6
billion Minnesota fishing industry enjoyed by about 1.4 million resident
and nonresident anglers.

An extraordinary trout pond
---------------------------
Curt Teberg is one of those Minnesotans who enjoy fishing -- so much so
that he has spent the past 7 years building a backyard trout pond. Until
last spring [2008], he had never heard of the IPN fish virus.

His fishing pond is an angler's paradise. It is fed by a man-made creek and
has adjoining waterfalls and a fountain. A well and aerator keep water
fresh. The shoreline is extensively landscaped.

A permit request ... and a slip-up
----------------------------------
Teberg's trouble began in late May [2008], when he decided to buy 2000
rainbow trout from Silver Moon Springs Fish Hatchery in Elton, Wisconsin,
for his pond.

Minnesota law requires that the DNR issue a transportation permit for fish
moved across state lines; the permit allows the agency's fish-disease
experts to ensure fish have been tested and are disease-free before
entering the state.

A 1992 state law also requires that trout and salmon come from hatcheries
that are disease-free for at least 3 years. The law also doesn't allow fish
to be imported from hatcheries with IPN or other "emergency" [emerging --
Mod.TG] diseases that have never been found in Minnesota and pose the
greatest risks, Johannes said.

When it came time for Silver Moon Springs to ship its fish to Teberg, the
hatchery manager submitted a transportation permit to Tim Goeman, the DNR's
regional fisheries manager in Grand Rapids. On [27 May 2008], Goeman
forwarded the permit to the agency's disease specialist, Ling Shen, in St
Paul. Shen works in the DNR's 3-person pathology lab, which approves
transportation permits and investigates fish diseases.

The pathology lab is the DNR's primary defense in keeping fish diseases out
of the state, Johannes said. Shen said she looked at the Teberg paperwork
and accompanying health certificate for the 2000 trout. She noticed the
hatchery had tested positive for IPN earlier in the year [2008], and she
telephoned a Wisconsin veterinarian to confirm the test. "When I had
confirmation the hatchery had IPN, I denied the permit," she said.

DNR emails from [27 May to 6 Jun 2008] reviewed by the Pioneer Press show a
string of misunderstandings and failures to heed Shen's warnings. Those
failures would lead DNR officials to allow the fish into the state.

After Shen turned down the permit [27 May 2008], Goeman emailed her again,
saying the hatchery manager was "arguing that only the fish going out of
state needed the disease certification," not all the fish in the hatchery.
In her reply, Shen warned Goeman again that state law requires inspection
and a clean bill of health for all the fish in the hatchery. The same day,
Goeman telephoned his supervisor in St Paul, Linda Erickson-Eastwood, to
ask her opinion.

Erickson-Eastwood is the DNR fisheries program manager. In a recent
interview, she recalled that she misunderstood the disease in question and
advised Goeman that she thought the shipment could occur. "We had a
misunderstanding about what disease we were talking about," she said. The
next day, [28 May 2008], Goeman approved the permit, and Silver Moon
Springs transported the fish to Teberg's pond and stocked it.

Emails show that, more than a week later, Erickson-Eastwood acknowledged
the mistake with staff, and she and others decided to contact Teberg and
make plans to quarantine his pond and fish.

The DNR's biggest fear?
-----------------------
That the virus could escape from the pond into adjoining waters that
connect to Lake Superior, endangering the lake's trout and salmon
population. In June [2008], the DNR drew up plans to kill all the trout and
possibly drain the pond. "I was totally blindsided," Teberg said.

Kill the fish, drain the pond
-----------------------------
Tim Winkel, manager of Silver Moon Springs Hatchery, said his hatchery has
never lost any of its trout to IPN. "We have the disease in our brook
trout, but it has never killed any of our fish," he said.

In fact, Wisconsin authorities said, it is legal for Winkel to sell his
fish within Wisconsin borders, because fish-health authorities there don't
list IPN as a serious disease. "It has been found in private and state
hatcheries," said Myron Kebus, Wisconsin's fish-health veterinarian. "In
the last 10 years, we haven't had any significant fish kills in the wild or
in hatcheries (from IPN)."

But Minnesota DNR officials viewed the introduction of IPN into the state
much differently. "It's a very bad one and on our list of emergency
diseases," Johannes said. But when DNR officials informed Teberg the fish
would be killed and the pond would be drained, "I was ready to go to
court," he said.

The DNR agreed to wait to kill the fish. While Teberg's pond has a
connection to Lake Superior through nearby Grand Lake and the St Louis
River, the pond wasn't flowing last summer [2008], giving both parties time
to agree on an action plan. After negotiations during the summer [2008],
the DNR and Teberg agreed in August that the pond wouldn't be drained, but
the fish would be killed and buried in his horse pasture.

The parties also agreed that Teberg could keep and eat any fish still fresh
enough to consume and that the DNR would replace all the fish it netted.
The DNR spent September [2008] netting the pond and shocking it with
electricity, eventually capturing 374 trout.

While many more trout were stocked in the pond, DNR officials concluded the
rest were either caught by anglers or died in the pond.

About half the fish were buried in a 10 foot (3 m) deep trench and coated
with lime to speed decomposition and keep animals from the fish, said Dan
Dexter, a DNR fisheries specialist who headed the project to eliminate the
trout. Teberg was allowed to keep and eat the rest, which Dexter filleted
for him.

New fish ... and new rules
--------------------------
At the DNR's request, the pond's aerator has been turned off for the
winter, and the pond won't be stocked until spring [2009]. The DNR will
test the pond for the disease for the next 3 years. Shen said the odds were
"very high" the DNR caught the virus before it escaped into the wild.

Although the incident caused him trouble and he missed ice fishing for
trout this winter [2008-09], Teberg said he has been satisfied with his
treatment by DNR field staff, but not by DNR management.

This spring [2009], the DNR will replace Teberg's 374 trout with trout from
a state hatchery, which are valued at [USD] 500 to [USD] 1000 total,
according to John Huber, the DNR's Crystal Springs Hatchery supervisor in
Lanesboro. Giving Teberg the trout "will have no effect on our stocking
goals," Huber said. "These are surplus fish from the trout program. The
important thing is we clear this up with him."

Goeman, the fish manager who mistakenly approved the permit, said he
regrets his decision. "Obviously, the permit shouldn't have been issued,"
he said. "There was at the least confusion or misinterpretation and some
miscommunication between myself and others at the DNR."

When the permit mistake was discovered, Erickson-Eastwood suggested in an
email to staffers that special disease training for managers and new
protocols be instituted to avoid errors. To date, those proposals have not
been implemented, she said. But Erickson-Eastwood said the DNR's response
to its error showed a system of "checks and balances" worked to keep the
virus from spreading. "We should have never brought those fish into the
state based on the information that there was IPN," she said. "I think we
have it (the disease) under control. I think we've learned from the situation."

[Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is the causative agent of
infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) disease in salmonid fish. The virus is
an aquatic birnavirus.

The mortality of the affected fish varies considerably, depending on the
species, age, physical conditions of the fish, but also on the virulence of
viral strain (that is, capability to cause disease). The susceptibility to
the virus generally decreases with age, and virus carrier fish with no
disease symptoms are often found among fish surviving an outbreak. In such
persistently infected fish, the virus can be found associated with
leucocytes in blood and in head kidney and spleen, presumably in macrophages.

The apparent healthy virus carriers represent a potential risk for
uncontrollable spread of the disease, including transmission of virus from
parent to progeny, which still is regarded as uncertain in effect and
importance.

Use of non-lethal diagnostic methods, such as blood sampling, to detect
virus in the carriers has been presented as a potential method to screen
brood fish pre breeding.

There are 4 genera of salmonid fish in the US. There are a number of
different trout species, all members of the salmonid family. Those genera
are _ Oncorhynchus_, _Salmo_, _Salvelinus_, and _Thymallus_.

Many diseases, such as this one, are viewed very differently between the
various state regulatory agencies. Although the states are all united as a
nation, their disease approach is very much like that of independent nations.

It is easy to suggest that these folks should have picked up the telephone,
or convened a teleconference prior to approval of the permit. Regulations
can and often are interpreted differently by different individuals and even
by different state agencies when they look at regulations. Often,
regulations need to be balanced by common sense and real risk vs
theoretical risk. Just because a disease may escape and may cause problems
does not mean that it is the real risk that is portrayed in some
entertainment movie or book.

It seems like mistakes were made and yet both parties came out reasonably
happy and people conducted themselves in a friendly and professional
manner, so this may be considered a success story after all. - Mod.TG
