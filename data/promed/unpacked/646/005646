As of Sunday 1 PM (ET), 24 Sep 2006, 173 persons infected with the
outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from
25 states. Among the ill persons, 92 (53 percent) were hospitalized,
28 (16 percent) developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), and an adult in Wisconsin died. Of the 173
total, 125 (72 percent) were female and 15 (9 percent) were children
under 5 years old. The proportion of persons who developed HUS was 29
percent in children (less than 18 years old), 8 percent in persons 18
to 59 years old, and 16 percent in persons 60 years old or
older. Among ill persons who provided the date when their illnesses
began, 88 percent became ill between 19 Aug and 5 Sep 2006. The peak
time when illnesses began was 30 Aug to 1 Sep 2006 -- 35 percent of
persons with the outbreak strain became ill on one of those 3 days.
Two deaths among suspect cases have been reported. Suspect cases are
not known to have been infected with the outbreak strain, so are not
included in the confirmed case count. Idaho is investigating a
suspect case in a 2-year-old child with HUS who died on 20 Sep 2006
and reportedly had recently consumed fresh spinach. _E. coli_ O157
has not been detected in the child. Maryland is investigating a
suspect case in an elderly woman who died on 13 Sep 2006 and had
recently consumed fresh spinach. _E. coli_ O157 was cultured from
her stool, but "DNA fingerprinting" to determine whether it is the
outbreak strain has not been possible.
Utah Public Health Laboratory (UPHL) has isolated _E. coli_ O157 from
an opened package of spinach. The package came from the refrigerator
of a patient who ate some of the spinach before becoming ill. UPHL
completed DNA tests yesterday and determined that the DNA
'fingerprint' matches that of the outbreak strain. This is the 2nd
laboratory in the country to confirm the presence of the _E. coli_
outbreak strain in spinach.

strain from each state can be seen at the original URL - Mod.LL]
The following is advice for consumers about this outbreak:
- Currently, we are advising consumers to not eat any fresh spinach
or salad blends containing spinach grown in the 3 counties in
California implicated in the current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak --
Monterey County, San Benito County, and Santa Clara County. Fresh
spinach grown outside these counties can be safely eaten. If
consumers cannot verify that fresh spinach was grown in areas other
than the California counties of Monterey, San Benito and Santa Clara,
they are advised not to purchase or consume the fresh spinach. Frozen
and canned spinach can be safely eaten.
-_E. coli_ O157:H7 in spinach can be killed by cooking at 160 degrees
Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. (Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.)
If spinach is cooked in a frying pan, and all parts do not reach 160
degrees Fahrenheit, all bacteria may not be killed. If consumers
choose to cook the spinach, they should not allow the raw spinach to
contaminate other foods and food contact surfaces, and they should
wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and
after handling the spinach.

[Another spinach outbreak isolate has now been found. Two more cases
overall and one more complication of HUS are reported in this CDC
update. ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for submitting the CDC report. - Mod.LL]

A 2nd bag of spinach contaminated with toxic _E. coli_ bacteria has
been found in Utah, and regulators hope it will offer clues about an
outbreak that has now sickened 173 people and killed as many as 3.
A bag of spinach found in New Mexico last week helped experts
pinpoint suspect farms in 3 counties in California's Salinas Valley,
but the FDA said spinach grown outside of those counties is safe to eat.
"The Utah Department of Health and the Salt Lake Valley Health
Department have confirmed that _E. coli_ O157:H7 ... has been found
in a bag of Dole baby spinach purchased in Utah with a use-by date of
30 Aug 2006," the FDA said in a statement on Sun, 24 Sep 2006.
FDA officials said even if everyone stopped eating spinach when
warnings were first issued around 15 Sep 2006, they would expect to
receive reports about illnesses into Oct 2006 because it often takes
2 to 3 weeks to hear of possible cases, perform the needed tests and
get results back.
