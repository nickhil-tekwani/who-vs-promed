Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials will hold a meeting in DeWitt Township Tuesday night [12 Jan 2016] to discuss the latest findings of chronic wasting disease in whitetail deer.

DNR staff expected to attend the meeting include deer management specialist Chad Stewart and wildlife biologist Steve Schmidt. They will provide information on CWD, its impacts on deer and deer populations, and how the DNR has responded to the discovery of the disease to this point.

Residents and hunters from DeWitt and Watertown townships are particularly encouraged to attend, officials said. A deer harvested in Watertown Township in December 2015 tested positive for CWD. Also, a deer harvested in DeWitt Township during the recent firearm deer season was confirmed to have CWD.

"An archery hunter brought his deer from Watertown Township into a DNR check station to have it aged and receive a successful hunter patch. He wasn't going to have it tested," Stewart said. "We suggested that he test just in case. If he hadn't agreed, we may not have found another suspect."

5 deer have been found with CWD in the area. The deer taken in Watertown Twp. was the 1st to be found outside of a 9-township CWD Core Area, which includes Lansing, Delhi, Alaiedon, Meridian, Williamstown and Wheatfield townships in Ingham County, Bath and DeWitt townships in Clinton County, and Woodhull Township in Shiawassee County. 3 deer were found earlier in 2015 in Meridian Township.

Ingham, Clinton and Shiawassee counties compose the CWD Management Area.

Schmidt said the discovery of CWD in Watertown Twp. does not mean that the disease has spread.

"It does mean that the disease has been found in that area. And it means we will need to do more surveillance in that area to determine the extent that the disease is there," Schmidt said.

The 5 CWD-positive deer were among 4187 deer that have been tested by the DNR, including 2553 from the CWD Core Area.

Schmidt said that wildlife officials in Minnesota and New York were able to keep CWD from becoming established in those states due to early detection and response.

"We cannot be certain that the disease has become established in our deer herd. We need to do more surveillance and testing to answer that question," Schmidt said.

DNR officials said the public's cooperation will be important to curtailing the disease.

"We would like to build the same type of support in DeWitt and Watertown townships that we have seen in Meridian," Stewart said. "Township officials, hunters and landowners are critical to our plan."

[Typically deer have a relatively small "home range", which is generally a 1-1.5 mile radius of their home location. This does not always hold true and can help explain how a deer may be in a different area without necessarily spreading the disease. On the other hand, surveillance often follows the adage, "seek and you will find". - Mod.TG
