_Salmonella_ outbreak with unknown food source
----------------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 127
Hospitalizations: 18
Deaths: 0
States: 25
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg infections. The investigation has not yet identified a food linked to illness.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
On 2 Sep 2021, CDC identified an outbreak of 20 _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infections. Since then, the outbreak has grown rapidly. As of 15 Sep 2021, 127 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg have been reported from 25 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Aug 2021 to 1 Sep 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/epi.html).

State / Number of sick people
----------------------------
Arkansas / 2
California / 3
Connecticut / 3
Illinois / 5
Iowa / 1
Kansas / 5
Maryland / 4
Massachusetts / 7
Michigan / 2
Minnesota / 13
Missouri / 2
Nebraska / 2
New Jersey / 2
New Mexico / 3
New York / 1
North Carolina / 1
North Dakota / 1
Oklahoma / 7
Pennsylvania / 2
South Carolina / 1
South Dakota / 1
Texas / 45
Utah / 1
Virginia / 9
Wisconsin / 4

Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 82 years, with a median age of 33, and 59% are female. Of 49 people with information available, 18 have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported, as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. CDC is analyzing the data and has not identified a specific food item as a potential source of this outbreak. Several groups of people ("subclusters") at restaurants in multiple states have been identified. These subclusters are groups of people who do not know one another who ate at the same restaurant and got sick. Investigating these subclusters can sometimes help identify a food item eaten by all of the sick people that could be the source of the outbreak.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

WGS analysis of bacteria from 98 people's samples did not predict resistance to any antibacterials. Standard susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Traceback data
--------------
FDA is analyzing records collected from restaurant locations where sick people ate. This analysis can help identify a common source, like a distributor or supplier, or a potential point of contamination for the outbreak.
