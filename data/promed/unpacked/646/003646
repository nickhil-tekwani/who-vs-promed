A new species of sand fly, dubbed _Psathyromyia elizabethdorvalae_, has been discovered in Brazil and could be a potential vector of leishmaniasis. The new sand fly is described in the Journal of Medical Entomology (1).

The behavior of species in the genus _Psathyromyia_ is just beginning to be discovered, and some species have been found in urban environments near people. However, _P. elizabethdorvalae_ wasn't found in an urban environment, but was instead discovered by Brazilian researchers working in the Amazon. The discovery of a new species didn't come as a surprise to the researchers.

"We expected to find a new species because the state of Acre is part of the Amazon region with high biodiversity, and the sand fly fauna of the investigated area has been understudied," said Eunice Galati, one of the researchers.

This new finding is part of a growing body of research on sand flies being done in South America [see original article for several links for a few examples].

"There are many Brazilian students in post-graduate programs developing their theses related to the bio-ecology of sand flies in areas that have been poorly investigated and therefore have greater chances of containing undescribed species," said Galati. "These studies are largely associated with endemic areas of leishmaniasis, which is an important public health problem. Furthermore, there are students who are motivated in taxonomic studies."

The new species is named after Maria Elizabeth Cavalheiros Dorval, a teacher at Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. The authors named the fly in honor of her because of her contributions to the study of sand flies, leishmaniasis, and other neglected diseases. Of the authors, two have worked with her on several projects.

[_Leishmania_ is an important public health problem in Brazil and the rest of South America and over the last years has been spreading south into Argentina and Uruguay. The discovery of a new sandfly species could be important. There are at least 8 different _Leishmania_ subspecies in Brazil with different animal reservoirs and different vectors. Summarized recently by Alvar et al. (Alvar J, Vélez ID, Bern C, Herrero M, Desjeux P, Cano J, Jannin J, den Boer M; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Supplement S12). It will be interesting to see where _Psathyromyia elizabethdorvalae_ fits into the picture. - Mod.EP
