Melbourne dog owners have been warned of an outbreak of a rare ratborne disease having killed 3 dogs and which is transferable to humans. Agriculture Victoria and vets who treated the dogs having died advised owners to consider vaccination for leptospirosis and to seek treatment at the earliest signs of the disease, which can quickly escalate from vague signs to death.

Early signs include lethargy, fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Dogs typically catch it via direct contact with rats and mice or via water and soil contaminated with rat and mouse urine. Dogs can transmit the disease to humans, typically via their urine.

Dr Vicki Wade, who treated one of the fatal cases at Ringwood Vet Hospital about 2 weeks ago, said the disease could be treated if caught early enough. "But the problem is when they get unwell it's initially really vague so they're perhaps a little bit lethargic, a little bit off their food. And because it's rare in our community it's not one that initially pops into everyone's head," she said. "I haven't seen it before ... it is exceptionally rare in our urban environments. I was very surprised by the result."

The dog, a West Highland terrier, had been brought to the vet "very unwell. He ultimately was euthanised, he went into kidney and liver failure. He was put to sleep within about 48 hours ... his family fought very, very hard for him and they did absolutely everything they possibly could for him but unfortunately there's nothing that could have been done to save him." Dr Wade said there was a vaccination available. "Most vets don't routinely carry it but after this sort of news a lot of vets will be carrying it now. We know Sydney has had a surge [of cases] so we question whether it is a matter of time. We're watching really, really closely."

The other confirmed death was of a 7year old Staffordshire terrier, who was brought to a vet in Bayswater on 14 Oct 2019 and euthanised 2 days later. "None of the vets here have ever seen a case before this," said Dr Sharnee Lehrmayer, who treated the dog, which had severe liver and kidney damage. "We asked the owner about recent travel, and they reported the patient doesn't leave usually Bayswater, though had been in Wantirna South recently. The patient had never been seen catching/eating rats or any other animals. It occasionally drank from puddles." Dr Lehrmayer said a more specific and severe sign of the disease was jaundice -- yellowing of the eyes and gums -- which could indicate severe liver damage.

Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Dr Cameron Bell, said in a statement there had been 3 reports of leptospirosis in eastern Melbourne since August [2019] and Agriculture Victoria was investigating. "Leptospirosis is occasionally reported in a number of different species and dog owners should talk to their vet about vaccinating their pets against the disease," he said. "Vets are asked to consider leptospirosis as a possible diagnosis when dogs are presented with high temperatures, vomiting, renal, or hepatic insufficiency, and importantly to report cases. I'd like to thank the veterinarians who did the right thing and reported this notifiable disease," Dr Bell said.

As with dogs, symptoms of the disease in humans can mimic those of other illnesses. They include high fever, headache, chills, vomiting, jaundice, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and a rash.

[Getting your dog vaccinated is critically important, but the vaccine may not be effective if it does not match the circulating serovar. It does depend on which serovars are in the vaccine and which are the cause of the problem. "Prevention of leptospirosis via vaccination is complicated by the fact that _Leptospira interrogans_ has more than 200 subtypes causing illness in animals and people. The available vaccines protect against only a handful of the most common subtypes infecting dogs, which limits their protective value. Nevertheless, the available vaccines are effective and safe when used as directed, and many veterinarians recommend the vaccination for dogs at risk for exposure." (http://www.vetstreet.com/care/leptospirosis-vaccine-for-dogs).

Leptospirosis is more common in areas with warm climates and high annual rain fall, but it can occur anywhere.

Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. [However, it is known cats can die from this disease, and currently there is no vaccine for cats. - Mod.TG]. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States [and likely anywhere - Mod.TG] include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs. [Other exposure risks would be flood waters. Often in flooded areas, rodents, which frequently carry leptospirosis, are involved, and pets may not have clean sources of water in such disaster situations. - Mod.TG].

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness; some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend several other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the leptospira bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- if your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- wash your hands after handling your pet.

If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV or other conditions), consult your physician for advice."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October).

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The Leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available. - Mod.TG with assistance from Mod.ML
