The data presented in the news report are not correct.

In 2015 there were a total of 495 patients registered in South Fly [Western Province] with TB, of which 39 percent or 194 had extra-pulmonary TB and 301 had pulmonary TB. Of interest, the TB/HIV rate is low, about 3 percent of the cohort are co-infected, with high percentages tested.

[South Fly, with a population of 46 407 at the 2000 census, is a district of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea. Its capital is Daru, with a population of 20 524 (2009), on an island that goes by the same name, which is located near the mouth of the Fly River on the western side of the Gulf of Papua, just north of Torres Strait and Far North Queensland, Australia.

[Immunosuppression, such as in HIV, alters the pathogenesis of TB, greatly increasing the frequency of extrapulmonary involvement. Extrapulmonary (EP) sites include lymph nodes, pleura, bones/joints, kidneys, brain, pericardium, meninges, and abdomen. EPTB occurs in about 10-20 percent of HIV-negative patients with TB, but in HIV-positive, 40 to 80 percent of HIV-infected people with TB have EPTB (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/Supplement_3/S223.long). 39 percent of TB patients in South Fly, Papua New Guinea reportedly have EPTB. However, only 3 percent of TB patients in South Fly are reported to have HIV-coinfection.

_Mycobacterium bovis_ infection is also more frequently associated with EPTB, perhaps reflecting the consumption of _M. bovis_-contaminated animal products, such as milk and cheese (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/3/10-1111_article). Other risk factors for EPTB include female gender and younger age (http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/44/Suppl_58/P1443). It would be interesting to find out why the frequency of EPTB is so high in South Fly. - Mod.ML
