Health Alert: Measles
-------------------------
Summary:
3 cases of measles have been identified in a Boston workplace, with several
additional suspect cases currently under investigation. Health care
providers in Boston are asked to consider a diagnosis of measles in persons
with appropriate symptoms and to report all suspect or confirmed cases
diagnosed in Boston to the Boston Public Health Commission at (617) 534-5611.
Background:
Since 9 May 2006, 3 confirmed cases of measles have been identified in
persons working in an office building in downtown Boston. The cases reside
outside of Boston, but work in the city for a company with approximately
2000 employees. A number of additional suspect cases have been identified
in co-workers or other close contacts and are awaiting laboratory
confirmation. Of note, reports of measles in Boston are unusual. There have
been no confirmed measles in Boston residents since 1999. Since 1995, only
4 cases of measles have been reported in city residents.
Symptoms and Diagnosis:
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by prodromal
fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, and small spots with white or bluish
centers on an erythematous base on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots). A skin
rash usually occurs about 2-4 days after the initial symptoms. The rash
begins on the face and soon spreads to other parts of the body. The rash
usually lasts 4-7 days and then disappears in the same order it appeared
(head to foot). Koplik spots may become visible inside the cheeks of the
mouth 1-2 days before or after skin rash onset. Measles is transmitted from
person to person by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne
spread. Persons are infectious from 4 days before rash onset to 4 days
after the appearance of the rash. The incubation period generally is 8 to
12 days from exposure to onset of symptoms but can range from 7 to 18 days.
Laboratory testing for measles is available at the Massachusetts State
Laboratory Institute.
Prevention:
Immunization with MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine provides the
best protection from measles. The vaccine is normally given to young
children, but adolescents and adults who are not immune should also be
vaccinated. Adults born in or after 1957 and children > 12 months of age
should have documentation of 2 doses of MMR or serologic proof of immunity
to measles. Persons born in the United States prior to 1957 likely have
immunity to measles. However, to increase the likelihood of protection
against measles, mumps, and rubella, they should consider receiving a dose
of MMR vaccine.
Health care facilities should take appropriate precautions when evaluating
a patient with a febrile rash illness. If measles is suspected, airborne
infection isolation precautions should be implemented immediately. All
staff should have appropriate documentation of immunity.
Reporting:
Massachusetts regulations require the reporting of measles cases to the
local board of health where the diagnosis is made. Providers in Boston must
report all confirmed or suspect cases to the Boston Public Health
Commission (BPHC) Communicable Disease Control Division at 617-534-5611.
Reporting forms for health care providers and for laboratories are
available on the web at:

[This unusual report featuring a measles outbreak in a single office
building in Boston, a city free of measles since 1995, suggests both
failure of MMR vaccine coverage and importation of virus from another area.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
