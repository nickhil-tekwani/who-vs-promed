Texas is in the midst of one of the oddest influenza seasons in
memory, with 5 distinct strains circulating in the state. And it's
showing no sign of abating, health officials said Monday.

The worst offender has been a strain known as B-Hong Kong, which has
swept through schools across the state, causing high absentee rates
and forcing some schools and districts to close their doors
temporarily. B-Hong Kong last circulated in the late 1980s and early
1990s, so school-age children have no immunity to the virus. And most
school-age children are not vaccinated against flu, although new
federal guidelines recommend that children ages 6 months to 23 months
get flu shots beginning this year. B-Hong Kong is one of the 3
strains against which this year's vaccine protects.
"This is unprecedented, the number of schools and school districts
that have been closed this year," said Neil Pascoe, who tracks flu
for the Texas Department of Health. "As of last week, 53 school
districts have closed (in Texas sometime during the flu season). How
many last year? None."
Although B-Hong Kong has been the primary strain, Texas also has seen
a second B strain and 3 A strains in smaller numbers. A-type flu
strains tend to be more genetically stable, permitting people to
develop some immunity from year to year. B strains are more sporadic
and vary more, causing more problems among the young.
Texas has been unusual in the severity of the season, and the number
of strains circulating, Pascoe said. At the beginning of February
[2003], only 6 states including Texas were reporting widespread flu
activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Although February is a bit late to get a flu shot, Pascoe
urged people who haven't yet had one to consider getting it.
"If we have a second wave of influenza A, this is going to be a real
nasty season," Pascoe said.
San Antonio has been hard hit. Said Roger Sanchez, an epidemiologist
with the Metropolitan Health District, "Once it gets to a school, it
runs through the whole student body. We've seen close to 20 percent
absentee rates in some instances. Then a week later, it's back down
to normal. Some of my school nurses that have been with me a long
time, it's been so long they can't remember when we've had years like
this before," said Shirley Schreiber, director of health services for
the Northside School District.
The health district still has flu vaccine available through its
clinics. For information or clinic locations, call (210) 207-8750.
The district charges $10 for adults and $5 for each of the 2
pediatric doses required. Seniors over 65 and other at-risk groups
can receive the pneumonia vaccine, a one-time shot, at the same
visit. Medicare, Medicaid, CareLink, Community First, and CHIP card
carriers will not be charged for the flu shot upon proof of coverage.
