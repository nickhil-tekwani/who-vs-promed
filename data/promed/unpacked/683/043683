A municipality kindergarten in Sa Kaeo's Muang district has been closed after a 2-year-old boy died from [hand-foot-mouth disease].

The elder sister of the boy now feels sick and was sent to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok.

Captain Apinan Songkramchai, a provincial commander, said that the Kilosong Tessaban kindergarten was ordered closed on [Tue 20 Jun 2017] and public health officials and staff are now cleaning the premises with disinfectants.

The boy lived in Aranyaprathet district and had been suffering from the foot-and-mouth virus for about 4 days. His death alerted authorities, which led to the closure of the kindergarten, Apinan said.

Meanwhile Kornchai Srikoon, the mayor of Muang Aranyaprathet municipality, said that he was alerted of the death of the pupil on Tuesday afternoon [20 Jun 2017].

At a temple, the boy's father said that he usually took his children to Rongklua border Market and he suspected that his boy caught the disease there.

He revealed that his daughter, aged 4, now feels sick with the same symptoms as her brother, so his wife took their daughter to hospital on Tuesday night [20 Jun 2017].

[Thailand health officials had issued an advisory in February 2017, after reporting increased numbers of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), mostly in children under the age of 5. [See ProMED mail Hand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744.]

Since the beginning of the year through 19 Feb 2017, the Thailand Bureau of Epidemiology reported a total of 7684 cases from all 77 provinces. No deaths were reported. The highest rates of infection were reported from Suratthani, Chanthaburi, Chiengrai, Lampang, and Phuket provinces.

HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions, and rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate, and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers, and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

Enterovirus 71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over the several years. EV71 is a non-polio enterovirus.

Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. [excerpted, edited from 26 Feb 2017 http://outbreaknewstoday.com/thailand-issues-warning-spread-hand-foot-mouth-disease-hfmd-64381/].

Death may occur following HFMD infection as reported in MMWR 1988; 47(30); 629-32 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00054640.htm). Following the death of one 7-year-old child, autopsy findings included acute encephalomyelitis, mild interstitial pneumonitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. No histopathologic evidence of myocarditis was detected. Neurons in areas of inflammation and tissue necrosis were positive for enterovirus 71 (EV71) using immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal anti-EV71 antibody.

This occurred in Taiwan during an outbreak in 1998 where there were approximately 90 000 reports of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) among young children based on passive surveillance from sentinel physicians. Approximately 320 children [were] hospitalized with HFMD associated with suspected meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and at least 55 died.

This was the 3rd known EV71 outbreak resulting in rapid clinical deterioration and death among young children; previous outbreaks primarily among children aged less than 3 years occurred in Bulgaria during May-September 1975 (44 cases) and in Malaysia during April-June 1997 (28 cases).
