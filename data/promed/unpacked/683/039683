Chinese province checking pig deaths
------------------------------------
A northern Chinese province has launched an investigation into the cause
behind the recent deaths of more than 1000 pigs, state media reported on
Monday [9 Feb 2009]. The official Xinhua News Agency said 1056 pigs, most
less than a month old, were found dead in 10 villages in one county in
Shanxi province.

China is especially wary of any unchecked spread of disease in its pig
population. Two years ago, blue ear disease, also known as porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS], killed hundreds of thousands
of pigs before it was brought under control. It caused farmers to stop
raising pigs because of worries they would become infected. The outbreak
sent pork prices sharply higher.

Xinhua said animal disease control officials in Shanxi were carrying out
the investigation. Officials have already started burying or burning the
dead pigs. [Xinhua] said no contaminated pork had been found in stores or
restaurants.

[According to the information available in OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health
Information Database) interface, the Chinese epizootic of PRRS, which was
initially reported in 2006 and renewed in 2007, is "continuing"; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5387>.

In general, PRRS is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and
respiratory distress of piglets and growing pigs. In young piglets, high
mortality rates will occur and at the peak of an outbreak, losses from
death may reach 60-70 per cent.

Results of the current investigations wouled be appreciated. - Mod.AS
