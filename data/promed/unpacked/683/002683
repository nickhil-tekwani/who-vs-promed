A dog in Westbury has died from the deadly disease Alabama rot, it was disclosed today (Wed 16 Oct 2019). It is one of 2 new cases confirmed by veterinary specialist referral centre Anderson Moores, near Winchester. It brings the total number of Alabama rot cases this year [2019] to 16; these are the 1st cases since June [2019].

The latest incidents of the disease, also known as CRGV (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy), have occurred in Westbury and Coleford in Gloucestershire.

Anderson Moores said they were not currently releasing more details about the dogs that died.

In total, the UK has now seen 191 confirmed cases of Alabama rot across 39 counties since 2012.

David Walker of Anderson Moores, the UK's leading expert on the condition, said, "We are sad to announce more cases from 2019, as we start to enter the time of year when cases are most common."

"Further confirmed cases mean it is understandably very worrying for dog owners; however, this disease is still very rare.

"We're advising dog owners to remain calm but vigilant, and to seek advice from their local vet if their dog develops unexplained skin lesions.

"While there is currently no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease, any concerned dog owners should visit <www.vets4pets.com/stop-alabama-rot/> for advice and a map of confirmed cases."

The highest number of confirmed cases have been in Greater Manchester, Dorset, Devon, and the New Forest in Hampshire.

Dr Huw Stacey, vet and director of clinical services at Vets4Pets, has been supporting research on the condition for a number of years. He is advising dog owners to contact their vet if they have any concerns.

"While it is understandable that dog owners will be worried by Alabama rot, it is still a very rare disease, and we'd encourage owners to continue exercising their pet," Dr Stacey said.

"If a dog becomes affected, the best chance of recovery lies with early and intensive veterinary care at a specialist facility such as Anderson Moores.

"Treatment is supportive but is only successful in around 20% of cases, which is why we're encouraging all dog owners to use the online interactive guide to help them understand the clinical signs and confirmed locations of the condition, and to visit a vet if they have any concerns."

[Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) is a rare disease affecting dogs, reported in the UK since 2012. It is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting small vessels of the kidney and skin, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. Dogs affected by CRGV typically present with skin ulcers on their legs or paws, although some dogs have shown ulcers(s) on their head, muzzle, tongue, flank, and belly. The ulcers vary in severity and can look as simple as a small cut or area of redness that could be mistaken for a cut pad, bruise, or sting. It is important to remember that most skin ulcers will not be caused by CRGV.

The underlying etiology remains unknown, although clinicopathological and histological findings resemble features of certain forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in people, for which plasma exchange (PEX) is considered an important component of therapy.

A seasonal distribution is reported with most cases occurring between November and May each year. CRGV in the UK has affected dogs of many different breeds, both large and small, of any sex and with a wide age range. There have been reports of multiple dogs from the same household being affected. Compared to other problems seen in dogs, this is still a very rare condition.

Initially cases appeared to be localised to the New Forest area. However, this is no longer the case, and dogs suspected or confirmed to have CRGV have come from all over the UK. Although an environmental cause for this condition has not been excluded, currently there are no recommendations to avoid walking dogs in particular areas.

Although there have been numerous suggestions about potential causes for CRGV, despite investigations, the cause remains unknown.
