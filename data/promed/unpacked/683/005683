In September 2019, for the 1st time in the Angara river area, maize crops showed symptoms of the dangerous southern leaf blight disease. The infection was detected during a survey in Irkutsk region. This was reported by the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor). Further investigations determined that the infected seeds came to an Irkutsk seed supplier from the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.

The Department of Quarantine and Phytosanitary Control ordered the agricultural producer to take immediate measures to prevent further spread of the disease. For this purpose, the land user is prohibited from cultivating maize and related crops for 3 years. Rosselkhoznadzor will also check the activities of the seed supplier and inform the public about the results.

[Southern leaf blight (SLB) of maize is caused by the fungus _Bipolaris maydis_. Of the 2 races of the pathogen, race O normally attacks only leaves, while race T attacks all above plant parts, including leaves, husks, stalks, and ears. Symptoms include necrotic spots on leaves and any other affected parts, size, and shape of spots may vary with pathogen race and infected crop cultivar. Husk infections extend into the kernels as mould, seedlings from infected kernels are often blighted. Yield losses of over 30 percent have been reported and are more severe the earlier in the plant's growth cycle infection occurs. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures.

The fungus is transmitted with seeds and other plant parts, it survives on crop residues until the next season. Spread also occurs with wind, rain splash, and on crop debris. Disease management may include fungicide sprays, seed treatments (hot water, fungicides) and crop rotation with non-hosts, but mainly relies on the use of clean seed and resistant crop varieties.

Related species in the genus can affect other crops and cause, for example, target spot of sorghum (_B. sorghicola_), coconut leaf blight (_B. incurvata_), eye spot of sugar cane (_B. sacchari_), spot blotch of wheat (_B. sorokiniana_), and brown spot of rice (_B. oryzae_).
