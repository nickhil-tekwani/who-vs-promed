A 70 year old man was admitted to the Nork Infectious Diseases Hospital for
an ulcer on his right arm on 8 Nov 2006. According to the history on this
patient, who was from the village of Tsovazard, in the Gegharkunik region of
Armenia, he slaughtered a sick cow 3 days before, when the blood of the
animal contaminated a wound on his arm. Later, edema developed up to the
shoulder. After the assessment of the patient in the hospital, the skin form
of anthrax was diagnosed. He is receiving appropriate treatment, and his
condition today has been reported as satisfactory.

[Yet again, a classic case of cutaneous anthrax, with the infected blood of
a sick cow gaining entry via a cut. Armenia is listed as enzootic for this
disease, as it has a steady number of human cases reported. Latterly, the
government has not been reporting any livestock vaccination numbers to the
Office International des Epizooties.
