On 2 Aug 2018, 2 cases of rabies in cattle were recorded in Orkhon soum (administrative subdivision) in the northern Darkhan-Uul aimag (province). Samples from the sick animals were submitted to the aimag's Veterinary Hygiene Center laboratory, where rabies was confirmed on 6 Aug 2018.

The Orkhon Soum Emergency Commission was convened to establish a restrictive regime, in prescribed areas, under the auspices of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Mr Gankhuu, deputy director of the provincial police office, said that the animals were killed and disinfected. He warns herders to make sure they refrain from approaching potential rabid animals, such as dogs, wolves, [red] foxes, and corsac foxes.

The Aimag Professional Inspection Agency is responsible for providing herders and citizens with advice, warnings, handouts, and inspections of business entities and individuals who are selling raw materials of animal origin. Within this framework, a team of doctors and specialists from the Zoonoses Disease Research Center of Selenge aimag (province) collected samples from animal products and raw materials from 67 enterprises including food shops and sausage shops. The Aimag's Professional Inspection Agency warns that the origin of animal products must be certified [see comments].

[A different interpretation of the above information was published on 9 Aug 2018 by Xinhuanet News under the title "Mongolia reports two cases of mad cow disease" (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/09/c_137378541.htm). The report says: "Two cases of mad cow disease were found in Mongolia, local media reported on Thursday" [8 Aug 2018]. In view of the significant public health hazard and international trade impact of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the issue that, most probably, reflects a translational error is to be addressed in some detail.

Allegedly citing the country's Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry and local media, the Xinhua report says, "The ministry found the 2 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease in Orkhon soum (administrative subdivision) in the northern Darkhan-Uul Province on Monday [6 Aug 2018].

"Mad cow disease causes a degeneration of the brain and spinal cord in cattle, which can be transmitted to humans through eating beef.

"With more than 66 million livestock animals, Mongolia aims to raise meat exports tenfold in the coming years and to diversify its heavily mining-dependent economy.

"But frequent outbreaks of livestock animal diseases such as mad cow disease and the foot and mouth disease have taken a toll on its meat exports. In mid May [2018], 15 cases of mad cow disease were reported in the Must [Most] soum of Khovd aimag, in the west."

As informed by Mongolia's government agency, the recent 2 cases in cattle were, in fact, caused by rabies, an endemic fatal zoonosis in Mongolia; they were not cases of BSE ("mad cow disease"), a disease hitherto not identified in Mongolia (and it is hoped never will be).

The 15 mentioned cases last May [2018] in the aimag Khovd were probably rabies as well. In 2017, rabies was reported from 15 of Mongolia's aimags, including Khovd. Of the total of 218 rabies cases in animals reported by Mongolia for 2017, 72 were cattle. The other rabid farm animals were 80 small ruminants (sheep and goats), 32 horses, and 5 camels. The disease was obviously recorded also in vector animals: dogs (13) and fauna (16).

According to Mongolia's periodic reports to the OIE, rabies has not been reported in recent years from the Darkhan-Uul aimag. It may be assumed that its recent introduction into this region is behind the special attention paid by the authorities to the described event in cattle there.

It is foot and mouth disease, recently spreading westward in Mongolia, not BSE, that may potentially adversely affect exports, unless it is controlled soon.

The described effort by the Zoonoses Disease Research Center of Selenge aimag to collect samples from animal products and raw materials from 67 enterprises including food shops and sausage shops is obviously commendable; its relation to the rabies event in northern Darkhan-Uul aimag deserves to be explained. - Mod.AS
