[During January 2007, 7 outbreaks of Newcastle disease (NCD) were
recorded -- 6 of them new and one extending from December 2006; out
of 193 100 susceptible fowl, 29 200 were clinically affected, 14 634
died, and 178 466 were culled.
During February 2007, 7 outbreaks were recorded, of which 6 were new
and one continuing from January; out of 84 250 susceptible fowl, 8061
were clinically affected, 1625 died, and 82 625 were culled.
All outbreaks during 2007 have occurred in HaTsafon (also known as
Hazafon, meaning North, and Galilee) region, similarly to the
previous 3 months (last 3 months of 2006 -- see below). Each monthly
report includes a map. February's map also includes January's outbreaks [2007].
ProMED-mail's post 20070310.0855, dated 10 Mar 2007, included
information derived from the Israeli media reporting NCD outbreaks
during the past few months in northern Israel. Since no information
on NCD outbreaks in Israel during 2007 was apparently available in
the OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database)
information system (they will be published within the 6 monthly
report -- see below), the report was followed by a request for information.
Further inquiry reveals that the NCD outbreaks in Israel were duly
reported, included in both 6-monthly reports of 2006 (available in
the WAHID website and in the website of the Israeli Veterinary
Services) as well as in monthly reports for January and February 2007
(available in the Israeli website but not in WAHID which, in line
with the new OIE notification procedures, discontinued the
publication of monthly reports).
The following data on the number of NCD outbreaks for each month
during January-December 2006 are derived from WAHID:
9,11,7,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,4. All 7 outbreaks recorded during the last 3
months of 2006 were restricted to Hazafon (North) district. For full
details, see
