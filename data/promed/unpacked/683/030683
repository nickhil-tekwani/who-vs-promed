What deer are being referred to in this report? As a New Zealand reader I
assume the elk are _Cervus elaphus_; but are the deer white-tailed deer
_Odocoileus virginianus_, or a different species?

1. Does anyone know whether CWD is hereditary or transmissible or both?
2. If transmissible, HOW is it transmitted?
3. Do any of the predators of deer and elk in that area have any sort of
wasting
disease?

Follow-up information as per your request:
Species:
elk = Rocky Mountain elk (_Cervus elaphus nelsoni_)
deer = _Odocoileus_ sp., primarily mule deer (_O. hemionus_), but also some
white-tailed deer (_O. virginianus_)
Transmission: Circumstantial evidence suggests lateral transmission. [The]
role of genetic factors remains under investigation. No TSEs [have been]
diagnosed in local carnivores examined to date.

Is anyone from Health Canada listening? Where's Harvey Artsob when you
need him? If so, what are the rates of CWD in Canadian ungulates? Are we
looking?
The various species of deer, moose, and vast migratory herds of caribou,
represent an important biomass that has no regard for borders. Of
particular interest is the composition of any winter feeding assistance
(e.g. airdrops), and at the other end of the pipeline, are culled animals
examined for TSEs?
