Disease destroys sunflower
--------------------------
About 2000 sunflower farmers in Masindi and Kiryandongo districts are counting losses after a strange disease attacked more than 2800 acres [about 1133 hectares] of the crop. The disease, yet to be identified, causes the crop to wrinkle immediately after germination before the leaves turn yellow and dry up.

A South African firm supplied the seeds. A South African expert claimed the crops were attacked by a primary infection.

However, during a visit to the affected fields, the Masindi production officer said other varieties which have been planted in the same conditions have not been affected, adding that a virus might have been attacking the seeds.

South African experts and Ugandan scientists are working to identify the disease and how it can be controlled.

One of the affected farmers said, "We saw the problem developing. It started with yellowing of leaves as the crop was just germinating but as the sunflower [crop] was maturing, almost the whole field was drying [off]."

[Sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_) is an important seed crop including specific hybrids for either oil production (small, black, thin hulled seeds) or as a food item (large, striped seeds). It can be affected by a range of pathogens, several of which are known to occur in the region.

The symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis. A seed borne virus in one particular variety, as speculated, would be one of the possible explanations for the situation. However, reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
