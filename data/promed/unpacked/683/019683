Uganda's health ministry has spoken out on reports of an Ebola outbreak in Rukungiri district, days after 2 patients succumbed to an Ebola-like-disease.

The Tower Post has seen a [Mon 12 Nov 2018] communication between 2 Rukungiri district leaders indicating the death of patients with signs similar to those of Ebola. According to the communication, a patient, identified as [TW], died at Nyakibale Hospital of what would later be confirmed as [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever.

"On [4 Nov 2018], Nyakibale Hospital received and admitted [the patient], aged 23, from Kikura Village, Bwanda Parish, Buhunga Sub-County, and was suspected to be an Ebola victim on the basis of showing all signs related to the disease, which included bleeding in the nose and ears, vomiting, and a high temperature," read part of the communication. "Blood samples were taken from the victim and sent to Kampala Government Laboratory. Results from Kampala confirmed that the patient died of [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever."

By the time the communication had been exchanged, the results from another patient had not been returned. "On [Sat 10 Nov 2018], another patient, [BS], aged 56, from Rwakaterera Village, Burombe Parish, Ruhinda Sub County, was also admitted in the same hospital, showing signs similar to those of [TW]. However, [the 2nd patient] died the same day," continued the communication. "Blood samples were taken to Kampala. There are no results yet, and the body is still at Nyakibale Hospital waiting for health officials to bury it."

On Tuesday [13 Nov 2018], the junior health minister in charge of healthcare, Joyce Moriku, presented a statement on the Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo and the government's preparedness to handle any outbreaks in the country. "As of today, 13 Nov 2018," said minister Moriku, "there is no confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda." Moriku added that the ministry of health "remains on the highest alert ever and, together with partners, efforts have been put in place to not only screen but also to manage any identified suspect cases in specially established Ebola treatment centres."

"Two walk-through temperature scanners have been installed at Entebbe International Airport; one scanner is going to be installed at Bwera in Kasese and at Kisunga border point in Bundibugyo within 2 weeks," Moriku told parliament. "Another scanner will be installed in Busia in due course. For now, suspected cases continue to be picked, isolated, and treated, with blood samples picked for testing by the Uganda Virus Research Institute."
