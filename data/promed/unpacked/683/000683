Thousands of fish killed by toxic algae in southern India
---------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a destructive algae has killed thousands of fish in southern
India, causing more than 90 children to fall ill because of the stench,
officials said on Saturday [18 Sep 2004].
The waters off Valiyathura village, in southern Kerala state, are crimson
because of the outbreak -- known as red tide -- which occurs naturally when
_Karenia brevis_ algae bloom in higher than normal numbers, authorities
said. The algae affect the central nervous system of fish and seafood and
can be toxic to humans.
Thousands of dead fish have washed ashore, producing a stench that sent at
least 90 children, suffering from nausea, to hospitals, said health
authorities in Valiyathura.
A local school was closed, after scores of children began vomiting and
collapsing, on Friday [17 Sep 2004]. Government scientists were
investigating the fumes and their link with the algae, Dominic
Presentation, the state's fisheries minister, told the Associated Press on
Saturday [18 Sep 2004]. "We have asked the villagers not to worry. The
government is taking all precaution against any health hazards in the
area," he said. Initial reports from health officials had indicated that
the odor could have been caused by "the increased volume of fertilizer,
sewage, and other biological waste pumped into the sea," Presentation said.
Many parts of India, including large cities, do not have modern sewage
disposal or treatment plants, and solid wastes are often dumped in the
sea.Valiyathura is about 210 km (130 miles) south of Cochin, Kerala's
commercial hub.
