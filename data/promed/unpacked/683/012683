Hepatitis C Outbreak Suspect May Have Infected Michigan Patients
--------------------------------------------------------
Michigan health officials triggered a public alert Monday [30 Jul 2012] for patients from 4 area hospitals where David Kwiatkowski had worked before being arrested this month on charges of infecting at least 30 hospital patients in New Hampshire with hepatitis C, the Detroit Free Press is reporting.

Kwiatkowski, 33, a traveling medical technician who worked for employers on a temporary basis, worked in at least 6 Michigan medical facilities between 2003 and 2007, AnnArbor.com is reporting (http://annarbor.com/news/new-hampshire-hospital-worker-charged-with-infecting-patients-with-hepatitis-c-worked-in-ann-arbor/?cmpid=NL_33_block_headline). These include Oakwood Annapolis in Wayne, University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, Sinai Grace Hospital in Detroit and Harper Hospital in Detroit.

Kwiatkowski was arrested 19 Jul 2012 in Massachusetts on charges of causing an outbreak among patients at Exeter Hospital in Exeter, New Hampshire. While an alert was issued Monday [30 Jul 2012] by state officials, no Michigan cases have been tied to Kwiatkowski, according to the Free Press. Investigations are ongoing regarding Kwiatkowski's work at the local medical facilities, according to AnnArbor.com.

According to the Free Press, those who received narcotic injections between 2003-2007 at the hospitals that employed Kwiatkowski are urged to contact: Sinai-Grace and Harper, University of Michigan Hospital, or Oakwood Annapolis.

[The 33-year-old traveling medical technician suspected of putting patients at risk of hepatitis C infection in several hospitals in the United States is reported to be from "Canton." Apart from Canton province in China, there are at least 25 towns bearing the name Canton in the United States, and several elsewhere.

The level of the risk for patients treated at the 4 area hospitals in Michigan is unclear, and perhaps should be specified more precisely to avoid unnecessary alarm.
