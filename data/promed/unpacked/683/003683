Detecting vancomycin-intermediate _Staphylococcus aureus_: increased
vigilance required by European microbiologists
Glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the main, often sole,
antimicrobial agents available to treat serious infections with methicillin
resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA). Loss of their activity would be a
public health disaster, posing major problems for the treatment and
management of the many patients now infected and colonised with MRSA.
Fortunately, such resistance has been slow to evolve. However, 1997 saw the
first report - from Japan - of an MRSA isolate with intermediate resistance
to vancomycin (VISA). This raised great concern. VISA strains have since
been found in the United States (US) and Slovakia, but not yet from
elsewhere in Europe. Unfortunately, it appears that VISA are detected only
by dilution-based susceptibility test methods and E-tests, not in routine
disc tests; consequently they may be under- detected.
The original Japanese VISA strain, Mu50, was isolated from a sternal
abscess in a child, who had received a prolonged course of treatment with
vancomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin was 8
mg/l, compared with 1 mg/l for typical, fully susceptible _S. aureus_
strains. The infection was cured ultimately by debridement, followed by
treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam combined with arbekacin, an
experimental aminoglycoside available only in Japan. Mu50 had homogeneous
insensitivity to vancomycin, expressed by all members of the cell
population, but strains were also found with a heterogeneous form of the
resistance, expressed by only a small fraction of the cell population.
Spread of the high level vancomycin resistance to staphylococci has long
been feared, but has not yet been seen in clinical settings.
The PHLS Antibiotic Reference Unit (ARU) in London examined VISA strains
Mu50 (homogeneous resistance) and Mu3 (heterogeneous resistance), which
were generously provided by Professor Hiramatsu of Juntendo University
Hospital, Tokyo, to see whether routine disc and agar dilution
susceptibility tests could detect their insensitivity.
Based on these results, we recommend that laboratories perform E-tests or
breakpoint dilution tests with 4 mg/l vancomycin whenever MRSA infections
respond poorly to treatment with glycopeptides. Isolates of MRSA found
resistant to vancomycin should be sent to an appropriate national reference
laboratory for confirmation of the resistance and examination of its
mechanism. At present there are no internationally (or, often, nationally)
agreed guidelines for the control of VISA. If isolated, VISA should be
considered a serious threat and addressed urgently by the institution's
infection control committee. Control measures will be influenced by the
nature and the level of resistance, whether other patients are affected,
and whether isolates show resistance to other antimicrobials. Infected
patients and others on the ward should be screened from the nose, perineum,
wounds, and manipulated sites (e.g. around catheters). Isolates should be
tested for resistance by culture on agar with vancomycin 4 mg/l added.
Affected patients should be isolated or cohort-nursed. Staff should be
examined for skin lesions and, if possible, screened by culture, especially
on high risk units.

[For those unfamiliar with clinical laboratory methodology, the E-test is a
modified agar diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing procedure that
utilizes a strip impregnated with a gradient of antibiotic. The strip has
a marked scale proportional to antibiotic concentration. An elliptical
zone of inhibition of bacterial growth is observed around the strip, and
the low concentration end intersects the scale providing a
semi-quantitative estimate of inhibitory concentration (IC). - Mod.ES
