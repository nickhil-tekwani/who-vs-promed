Britain confirmed on [Tue 10 Mar 2015] the 1st finding of disease in a wild bird [in the UK] caused by avian reovirus.

The British government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said the Wildlife Disease Surveillance Partnership confirmed the 1st finding of the disease in a magpie found dead in the garden of a house in southern England.

An autopsy examination and laboratory testing confirmed the presence of the avian reovirus [ARV], which had caused severe necrosis of the liver and spleen, and was identified as the bird's cause of death. 2 further magpies were observed for possible symptoms of the illness at the same site. These birds were presumed to have died, but their carcasses could not be recovered for further investigation.

Richard Irvine, head of scanning surveillance at APHA, said: "Avian reoviruses can cause a range of disease presentations in poultry, captive, and wild bird species, and until now ARV has not been reported as a disease of magpies or other wild birds in Great Britain."

"By raising awareness of this finding, any threats posed to other wild birds or poultry can be managed," he added.

Becki Lawson, a research veterinarian at the Zoological Society of London's Institute of Zoology added: "ARV causes disease and mortality in wild corvid (crow family) species in North America and continental Europe. Due to the vigilance of the British public, this is the 1st identified case in the UK."

The abstract reads:
"Background: Avian reoviruses (ARVs) cause a range of disease presentations in domestic, captive, and free-living bird species. ARVs have been reported as a cause of significant disease and mortality in free-living corvid species in North America and continental Europe. Until this report, there have been no confirmed cases of ARV-associated disease in British wild birds.

Case presentation: Sporadic individual magpie (_Pica pica_) mortality was detected at a single site in Buckinghamshire, England, April-September 2013. An adult female magpie was found moribund and subsequently died. Post-mortem examination identified hepatomegaly and splenomegaly as the most severe macroscopic abnormalities.

Histopathological examination revealed extensive hepatic and splenic necrosis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified virions of a size (circa 78 nm diameter) and morphology consistent with ARV in both the liver and the small intestinal (SI) contents. Nucleic acid extracted from pooled liver and spleen was positive on both a pan-reovirus nested PCR targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and a PCR using primers specific to the ARV sigma C protein gene. Virus isolated from the liver and the SI contents was characterised by a syncytial-type cytopathic effect, a reovirus-like appearance on TEM and sequence identical to that from PCR of tissues. In situ hybridisation confirmed co-localisation of ARV with lesions in the liver and spleen, implicating ARV as the causative agent. Splenic lymphoid atrophy and necrotic stomatitis associated with _Aspergillus fumigatus_ infection were consistent with generalised immunosuppression and resultant opportunistic infection.

Conclusions: The pathology and comprehensive virus investigations in this case indicate ARV as the primary pathogen in this magpie, with concurrent secondary infection subsequent to immunosuppression, as has been observed with reoviral infections in other bird species. ARV should be considered as a differential diagnosis for magpie, and potentially other corvid, disease and mortality incidents. This is the 1st demonstration of ARV-associated mortality in a wild bird in Britain. The prevalence and significance of ARV infection in British wild birds, and its implications for poultry and captive bird health, are currently unknown."

Avian reoviruses (ARVs) comprise a diverse genus of non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome within the family _Reoviridae_. ARVs are associated with a range of disease presentations in birds from various orders.
