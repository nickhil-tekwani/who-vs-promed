[Note horrendous reporting delays by all countries. I do not understand
all this. Either there is an international law requiring reports within 24
hours, or there isn't. I do not suppose the U.N. is planning to send in a
multilateral force to ensure such reporting but something should be done.
Agreeing to certain standards and then not meeting them is not only
hypocritical, it is very dangerous for the populace of neighboring
countries, not to speak of the countries in question. Readers of
ProMED-mail will have noted that the same situation is extant for plague
and cholera around the world.
Among the many possible reasons for such lack of timely reporting are (a)
insensitivity to the importance of the disease, (b) incompetence, (c) fear
of loss of tourist dollars, (d) ass-covering, and (e) overburdened (with
what?) officials. Frankly, I think this is an international scandal. When
someone tells me there is no cholera (or dengue or malaria or plague or
rabies or ...) in Country X, I take it with a grain of salt and my
medication with a glass of bottled soft drink, sans ice. This should not
be the case. - Mod.CHC
