Mountainous provinces in northern Viet Nam warned of anthrax outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine on Sunday [7 Aug
2011] warned the northern mountainous provinces of Lai Chau, Dien
Bien, and Ha Giang of anthrax outbreaks in humans, the Sai Gon Tiep
Thi newspaper reported. The administration said anthrax cases have
been reported in the provinces since June [2011], with Lai Chau having
the highest number at 12, including one death.

It blamed local people's unhygienic eating habits for the transmission
of the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, which passes anthrax from
animals to humans.

In Dien Bien Province, the 1st anthrax case was reported after an
ethnic minority resident slaughtered 2 buffaloes that had died from
diseases, and invited other villagers to eat. The unidentified
resident also sold the meat of 9 sick buffaloes.

Provincial authorities have sent health officers to affected areas to
raise public awareness of anthrax and measures to prevent the
disease.

Information on home remedies is also being provided to ethnic minority
communities in the province.

Anthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals
that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Diseased animals can
spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (such as
inoculation of infected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a
diseased animal's flesh.

[Our last post on this condition in Viet Nam reported "around 40
people" affected. It did not include Ha Giang so these will be
additional numbers.

Lai Chau and Dien Bien provinces are located in the northwest region
of Viet Nam; Ha Giang is in the north. All are provinces bordering (in
turn) Laos and China. Maps of the country can be seen at
