Bull in Marshall County dies from anthrax
-----------------------------------------
A bull in Marshall County, Minnesota, has died from anthrax, marking
the 1st case of the disease in 2007, authorities confirmed. The state
Board of Animal Health said Thursday [5 Jul 2007] that the bull was
found dead on pasture last week. Tests confirmed that the bull had
anthrax.
The herd had not been vaccinated for anthrax this year [2007]. The
herd has since been taken off the pasture where the infection
occurred and has been placed under quarantine for 30 days from the
day the bull died.
"The animal that died was on pasture in northwest Minnesota, an area
that has seen anthrax in recent years, so it is important that other
northwestern Minnesota livestock producers seriously consider anthrax
vaccinations for grazing animals," said Linda Glaser, senior
veterinarian on the Board of Animal Health.
The board said that about 260 farms have had animals diagnosed with
anthrax since it was first reported in the state in 1909.

[That the herd had not yet been vaccinated and it is past midsummer
would indicate that the owner had decided to not vaccinate this year
and was depending on prayer alone to protect his livestock. This
reminds me of the year the sexton of the our village church, St.
Mary's, in north Oxfordshire won the award for the best garden show
of flowers at the annual village flower show. And in truth the path
to the church door was wondrous with roses in full bloom and other
flowers. A well deserved award. The Rector when awarding the silver
cup commented that it was wondrous what the Lord could do. The sexton
was heard to quietly comment, "But you should have seen it when he
had it to himself." In areas in high risk of anthrax the livestock
must be vaccinated each spring. A constant that we are witnessing in
Minnesota and elsewhere, e.g., Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, is
how the immediate non-vaccinating neighbouring farms to those
affected 1-3 years before are the ones at highest probability of
having cases. If the neighbour has had anthrax, you must vaccinate
too. - Mod.MHJ]
