Seven-hundred-fifty and counting. That's the number of suspected cases of
_E. coli_-related illness traced to contaminated water at the Washington
County Fair. Ninety-three cases have been confirmed by health officials.
The death count stands at two.
The family one of the two confirmed fatalities from the outbreak, has
already said it intends to sue the non-profit organization that operates
the Washington County Fair.
A contaminated water well at the Washington County Fair has been isolated
as the source of the _E. coli_ outbreak. State health officials found the
bacteria in Well Number Six on the fairgrounds. Water from that well was
used by seven booths at the fair for drinking and beverage-making. The
water was not chlorinated. Health
officials say water runoff from a nearby cow barn washed manure into the well.
State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello is calling for new rules on
water usage at state fairs and other large gatherings. Novello says she's
consulting with Governor George Pataki and state legislative leaders on the
proper steps to take.
