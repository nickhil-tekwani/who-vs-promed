ProMED-mail recently received an interesting comment from Russia. It
appears as if Nizhniy Novgorod airport confiscates substantial amounts of
milk and meat arriving from Armenia on twice daily flights. When
substantial amounts of meat and other animal products are confiscated,
there is a good possibility equally substantial amounts of meat are also
getting past the border veterinarians. Armenia and many other countries in
the region are currently under quarantine for FMD. We are sure that Nizhniy
Novgorod airport is not the only place that people attempt to bring in meat
and other animal products from FMD infected regions.
Disease spread by tourists carrying meat or other animal products is known
to be a vexing problem in many regions of the world, quite apart from
larger volumes of "informal" undocumented trade by other routes. Given that
ProMED-mail has carried 7 reports of FMD outbreaks in the last 4 months
(Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kuwait, Greece and Kyrgyzia), it
may be time for strengthening airport security and instituting efforts to
educate air travellers in the region concerning the risk of contraband meat
and animal products.
