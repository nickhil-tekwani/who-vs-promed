This report is of no surprise. An old study (published in SEATO MED REPORT
in 1970's) showed that as many as 5-10% of cases clinically considered to
be dengue are indeed [caused by chikungunya virus]. The clinical pictures
[of chikungunya and dengue are] virtually identical, except that many (if
not most) [chikungunya] patients develop a polyarthritis not unlike
rheumatoid arthritis -- after the fever comes down. This may last for
weeks to months and responds very well to NSAIDS [?]. The ultimate
prognosis is good and patients need to be told so. We recently had a UK
tourist who was first thought to have enteric fever, then dengue.
Chikungunya was not considered until he developed the arthritis.
Serological tests for chikungunya are not usually readily available so it
is mostly a clinical diagnosis in people with a typical picture and
negative dengue IgM titers. Other viral infections that often cause
arthritis in this region are: hepatitis A and B (often anicteric), Ross
River virus (anecdotal reports from S. Thailand), parvovirus B19 and viral
illnesses with rash, such as rubella.

[A clinical diagnosis may be a good guess but definitive diagnosis relies
on laboratory confirmation. Whereas there may be no surprise in finding
some chikungunya virus infections among a larger number of infections
caused by dengue viruses, the concurrent presence of both diseases
indicates a problem with _Aedes_ sp. mosquito control. - Mod.CHC]
