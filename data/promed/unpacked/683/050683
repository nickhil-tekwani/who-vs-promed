First Report of a Leaf Spot of Barley Caused by _Drechslera gigantea_ in
Uruguay. F. Gamba, Facultad de Agronomia, Universidad de la Republica
Oriental del Uruguay, Paysandu, Uruguay; and A. Tekauz, Cereal Research
Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Plant
Dis. 87:99, 2003; published on-line as D-2002- 1101-02N, 2002. Accepted for
publication 9 Oct 2002.
Barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), an important crop in Uruguay, is vulnerable to
several foliar diseases. In early November 2001, leaves displaying unusual
lesions were observed in a commercial barley crop and research plots in the
Paysandu District of western Uruguay.
Lesions were small, elliptical, tan-colored to necrotic, approximately 4 x 1
mm, with a narrow, dark brown margin. Older lesions occasionally were
surrounded by a narrow (0.5 mm wide) chlorotic halo and some lesions had a
white dot in the center.
In moist conditions (20 degrees C, 12 h light/dark cycle, 4 days), conidia
(250 to 325 micrometers long) subsequently developed from infected tissue
and were subsequently identified as _Drechslera gigantea_ [Dg] (2).
Koch's postulates were verified by growing the fungus on 10 percent V8 juice
agar, and the aqueous suspension was adjusted to 30 000 conidia per ml.
Lower concentrations were not great enough to prevent disease escape.
Inoculum was sprayed (De Vilbiss atomizer) on 2-week-old barley seedlings
kept in a growth chamber (18 degrees C, 17/7 h light/dark cycle). Inoculated
plants were kept in the dark for 24 h at 100 percent relative humidity and
then returned to the previous conditions.
2 replicates of 20 seedlings of each of 2 Canadian, 1 American, and 8 barley
genotypes from Uruguay were used for the study, including water controls.
Small lesions appeared on all leaves of all inoculated plants on 10
cultivars 4 days after inoculation, and after 9 days they were fully
developed and identical to those on field plants. Control plants did not
display symptoms. Dg was reisolated from lesions on all diseased leaves.
A 0 to 5 disease infection scale, based on lesion size, was developed for
which infection types 0, 1, and 2 were considered as immune, resistant, and
moderately resistant phenotypes, respectively, type 3 as an intermediate
phenotype, and 4 and 5 as moderately susceptible and susceptible phenotypes,
respectively.
The most susceptible infection type was observed on cv. Dayman, the same
cultivar in which the disease was first noted and from which the pathogen
was isolated. Cv. Herta, once grown in western Canada, also as susceptible,
whereas cvs. Bowman (United States) and McGwire (Canada) were moderately
resistant. Only 1 cultivar (Uruguay) was symptomless. Several Uruguayan
experimental barley lines exhibited moderately resistant or intermediate
phenotypes.
Dg has been reported as causing an "eyespot" disease on grasses (2) and rice
(1). Further studies with different inoculation protocols and host
development stages as well as sampling of a broader range of barley germ
plasm is needed to assess the current and potential impact of this fungus.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of Dg as a pathogen of barley in
Uruguay, and possibly the first report of this species as a barley pathogen
globally.
