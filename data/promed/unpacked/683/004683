Zika virus -- incidence and trends
----------------------------------
To date, 46 countries and territories have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease in the Region of the Americas since 2015. In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases. Since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 25 Aug 2016, the British Virgin Islands have confirmed vector-borne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus. [An incidence map for the Americas is presented, and the coverage includes: Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Curaçao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barthélemy; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.]

Highlighted below is a summary of the Zika epidemiological situation by sub-regions of the Americas.

North America
Mexico has been showing a downward trend in the number of confirmed cases for 4 consecutive weeks (EW 30 to EW 33). In the United States of America, the Zika virus transmission continues to expand and, to date, 3 counties in the state of Florida have confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection: Miami Dade, Palm Beach and Pinellas.

Central America
Over the last 4 weeks, a decreasing trend of cases has been observed in all countries in Central America with the exception of Costa Rica, where there has been an increasing trend of cases since the beginning of the outbreak up to EW 31. In Guatemala, following a downward trend that began on EW 23, the reported cases increased again in EW 32; therefore, it will be important to monitor whether the upward trend continues in the coming weeks. In Nicaragua, where the number of reported cases has mostly been on the rise since the beginning of the outbreak, cases have declined for the 3rd consecutive week (EW 32 to 34). The greatest increase in Zika cases in Central America occurred between late 2015 and early 2016.

Caribbean
In the Caribbean, Grenada, Puerto Rico and Saint Barthelemy show a declining trend of Zika cases between EW 32 and EW 33, following the increase in number of cases observed since the beginning of the outbreak. However, in the following weeks, it will be necessary to monitor whether the declining trend continues in these countries/territories. Other countries/territories in the Caribbean also show a declining trend of Zika cases.

South America
In South America, all countries are reporting decreasing numbers of Zika cases.

Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection
To date, 15 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. Additionally, 3 countries have reported suspected and probable cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus: Barbados, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

As of EW 35, Canada reported 2 maternal-fetal transmissions of Zika Virus; one with severe neurological anomalies.

As of 1 Sep [2016], the table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at: http://bit.ly/2cdqIQ2

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders
To date, 12 countries and territories in the Region have reported an increase in the number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and 7 countries and territories have reported laboratory-confirmed GBS cases associated with Zika virus infection.

Table 1. Countries and territories in the Americas with GBS in the context of Zika virus circulation.
Increase in GBS with Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS:
Brazil
Colombia
Dominican Republic
El Salvador
French Guiana
Honduras
Jamaica
Martinique
Suriname
Venezuela

Zika virus laboratory confirmation in at least one case of GBS:
Costa Rica
Grenada
Guadalupe
Guatemala
Haiti
Panama
Puerto Rico

Increase in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases:
Paraguay
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

[This is an interesting summary of the current Zika virus situation in the Americas. It is good to see incidence declining in South America, as is the case with incidence of dengue and chikungunya virus infections at this time of year. If Zika virus has become endemic there, one would expect a resurgence of transmission early in the new year (2017), as has been the case with the onset of warmer weather historically with these other viruses, which are transmitted by the same mosquito vector -- _Aedes aegypti_.
