Rabid bats attack girls in Weber County
-------------------------------------------------
Two young girls visiting northern Utah have begun treatment for
rabies after being attacked in broad daylight by a bat that later
tested positive for the disease. The Weber-Morgan Health Department
reported the attack took place on Saturday [1 Aug 2009] as the girls
were walking near the town of Liberty. One was bitten on the finger
and the other was exposed to the disease while trying to stop the
attack. Officials said relatives were able to safely capture the bat,
which later tested positive for rabies. The girls, who are from out
of state, are receiving a series of shots to prevent them from
contracting the disease.

"Bats are nocturnal, so for this to happen during the daytime is a
sure sign that the bat was ill," says Weber-Morgan Health Director
Gary House. "The safest and best advice is to avoid all physical
contact with bats if possible. While this incident appears to be
unprovoked, it tells us that we have rabies activity in our area," he
said. "Residents need to be cautious of any animals, especially bats,
that are acting aggressively."

Rabies virus affects the neurological system is almost always fatal
if left untreated. The virus is transmitted when infected saliva is
passed on through bites or scratches by infected animals, including
skunks, raccoons, foxes and coyotes.

Residents in southern Utah are also are being reminded to stay away
from sick or dead animals after 2 cats in Kane County tested positive
for a bacterial infection called tularemia [For further information
