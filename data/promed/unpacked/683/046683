The Egyptian government has been exerting more efforts to prevent
further spread of the bird flu virus since the fatal disease caused 4
human deaths in less than a week in late December 2007.
Egypt has culled 1599 domestic poultry suspected of contracting bird
flu in its latest efforts to prevent further spread of the fatal
disease in the populous Middle East and North Africa country, the
official MENA news agency reported Tuesday [1 Jan 2008].
The culling of birds was carried out in 4 governorates, namely Cairo,
Qalyubiya, Minufiya, and Gharbiya, chairman of the General Authority
for Veterinary Services Hamid Samaha was quoted as saying. Under the
supervision of a committee, the dead poultry was buried deep between
2 layers of white lime, said Samaha.
The preventive medicine department has launched a campaign to
vaccinate live poultry against the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in
the country, with the participation of 3000 veterinarians,
assistants, and drivers.
Some 85 million doses of anti-bird flu vaccines were secured, added Samaha.
The anti-bird flu measures were taken as 4 more Egyptian people died
of the fatal disease in less than a week in late December 2007.
On Monday [31 Dec 2007], the Egyptian Health Ministry said a 2nd
woman died of bird flu in the evening, bringing the death toll of the
fatal disease to 19 since the emergence of the lethal H5N1 virus in
early 2006 in the country.
[The woman,] who was admitted to the intensive care unit of Abasiya
Chest Hospital in Cairo on Wednesday [26 Dec 2007], died Monday [31
Dec 2007] evening, the official MENA news agency quoted Health
Ministry sources as saying.
The 50-year-old woman was from Damietta Governorate in the Nile
Delta, some 150 km (93 mi) north of the capital of Cairo. [She]
became the 4th victim of the virus in the most populous Arab nation
in less than a week.
According to media statistics, Egypt has reported a total of 43 human
cases up to now since it detected its 1st H5N1 virus in dead poultry
in February 2006 and the 1st human case in March of the same year.
Earlier on Sunday [30 Dec 2007], Egyptian Minister of Health and
Population Hatem el-Gabali warned against leniency over preventive
measures against bird flu, especially in the winter season.
The ministry has kept on reinforcing measures to curb the disease
through a monitoring strategy carried out by some 27 teams around the
various governorates in the country.
During a meeting discussing means of preventing more cases, el-Gabali
urged chest and fever hospitals in the country to intensify
protective measures, Egypt State Information Service (SIS) reported
on Saturday [29 Dec 2007].
The minister also ordered to speed up a media campaign to keep the
citizens aware of the symptoms and dangers of the disease and, more
importantly, how to deal with it.
According to SIS, Giza Governorate has decided to launch campaigns to
control homebred poultry and close illegal living birds stores.
Work-teams have been set up in Minufiya Governorate to execute
poultry infected with bird flu using safe methods.
Minufiya governor Hassan Hemaida has issued directives to intensify
regular inspection patrols at some 4882 poultry farms in the
governorate, SIS said.

[To assess the background to the continued circulation of the virus
in spite of mass vaccination, additional information is required. In
particular, details on the vaccines used, the vaccination schemes,
data on outbreaks in vaccinated flocks and detailed update on
locations and number of new outbreaks. The vaccinations seem to mask
the real incidence of infection.
The situation in Egypt and Saudi Arabia should be closely followed by
other Middle Eastern countries.

Bangladesh culled more than 2500 chickens after the H5N1 bird flu
virus infected more farms in the northern part of the country,
officials said on Monday [31 Dec 2007].
The latest infection was detected in 2 villages in Gaibandha
district, about 350 km (210 mi) from the capital Dhaka, an official
at the government's livestock department said.
Bird flu was first detected near the capital in March [2007] and has
since spread mainly to northern districts and forced authorities to
cull around 278 000 chickens.
About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated
with poultry farming, but so far there have been no cases of human
infection, government and health officials say.
