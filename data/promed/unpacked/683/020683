On Thu 6 Oct 2011, the Delaware Public Health [DPH] Laboratory
confirmed Delaware's 1st case of tularemia since 2003, in a 45
year-old Kent County man. The man is hospitalized and responding to
treatment. Although Delaware has not reported a case of tularemia in 8
years, each year an estimated 125 to 150 cases are reported
nationwide.

Tularemia is associated with tick bites and is not spread person to
person. Domestic cats are very susceptible to tularemia and have been
known to transmit the bacteria to humans. Humans can become infected
by handling infected animal tissue when hunting or skinning infected
rabbits, muskrats, and other rodents; by inhaling dust or aerosols
contaminated with the bacteria, such as during farming or landscaping
activities, especially when tractors or mowers run over an infected
animal or carcass. The disease can also be transmitted by drinking
untreated water contaminated with the bacteria introduced by animal
contact.

Symptoms of tularemia usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure to the
bacteria, but can take as long as 14 days. Symptoms may include sudden
fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry
cough, and progressive weakness. People can also develop pneumonia
with chest pain, cough, and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of
tularemia depend upon how the person was exposed. These symptoms can
include ulcers on the skin or in the mouth, swollen and painful lymph
glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.

"Preventing tick bites is the best way to protect yourself from
tularemia," said Dr Karyl Rattay, DPH director. "Use insect repellent
containing DEET on your skin, or treat clothing with repellent
containing permethrin, to prevent insect bites." In addition, use care
and wear gloves when handling sick or dead animals. Be sure to cook
food thoroughly and that your water is from a safe source. Note any
change in the behavior of your pets (especially rodents and rabbits)
or livestock, and consult a veterinarian if they develop unusual
symptoms.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals
such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella
tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of
surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or
decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing
vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia
bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology.
Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites
of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling
infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and
inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the
form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures usually
resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of
disease in this case is not stated.

The last reported cases of the infection in the mid-Atlantic state of
Delaware occurred in 2003 and was reported that year (Eppes SC:
Tularemia in Delaware: forgotten but not gone. Del Med J. 2003; 75(4):
137-41). In the period of 10 years from 2001-2010, 5 cases of
tularemia were reported in Delaware with 3 in 2003, and 1 each in 2001
and 2002. In the 10 year period, 1208 cases were reported in the USA
with 585 (48 percent) occurring in only 4 states: Missouri (231),
Arkansas (162), Oklahoma (108), and Massachusetts (84). Except for
Massachusetts, the other 3 states are located in the central USA. Many
of the Massachusetts cases are reported from Martha's Vineyard where
pneumonic tularemia in gardeners and landscapers is not uncommon. -
