A case of a rare, polio-like illness has been confirmed in West Virginia, although health officials haven't confirmed what part of the state it was found in.

The illness is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and is a very serious condition.

It affects the nervous system, specifically the part of the spinal cord that affects a person's movement. It causes muscles in the body to become weak.

The illness can cause paralyzing symptoms, and in some cases, paralysis has been permanent.

"It is something that happens quickly; that's what acute means," said Dr. Mitzi Payne, professor of Pediatric Neurology with Marshall University. "A child or person becomes very weak. It comes from an issue with the spinal cord. What happens is there is gray matter in the spinal cord that are these neurons that control your muscle movements; that is what is affected. Because those are affected, the patient becomes weak."

Health officials don't know what specifically causes AFM or what triggers it; however, they believe viruses likely play a role.

Some of the symptoms of AFM include:
- sudden arm or leg weakness
- Drooping of the eye lid or face
- Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech

Most of the cases of AFM have been reported in children. "Children are sick more than adults anyway typically, so they are more likely to get viruses," Dr. Payne said. "Their immune systems aren't as strong as adults', especially neurologically, so they are more susceptible to this."

So far in 2019, cases have been confirmed in 4 states: Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah and West Virginia. In 2018, 228 cases of AFM were confirmed in the U.S.

There is no specific treatment for AFM, but doctors can develop a plan for patients on a case-by-case basis.

Since doctors have not been able to determine what specifically causes AFM, there is no prevention method. However, to avoid other viruses that may trigger it, they urge everyone to wash their hands and get vaccinated.

"There is no need to panic because it is very, very rare," Payne said. "The viruses that are thought to cause this, the viruses themselves are contagious, but that doesn't mean that everyone with that virus would get AFM."

Researchers are still working to better understand AFM, what causes it, and how to treat it. In most cases, those who developed AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever consistent with a viral infection before they developed AFM.

"For me, the most concerning thing is not really knowing what virus is exactly causing it or predicting what child with that virus will have acute flaccid myelitis," Dr. Payne said. "We know it's a higher risk in younger children; it's more commonly seen in Enterovirus and West Nile, but there are other viruses that cause it. So as a medical provider, the nerve-wracking part is the fact that we don't truly understand why and how it does occur so we can do a better job preventing it."

The last 2 cases of AFM in West Virginia were reported in 2016.

[Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious cause of sudden-onset limb weakness, especially in children, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis and care of patients with AFM includes early collection of specimens, including CSF, for laboratory testing, MRI scans, and consultation with neurology and infectious disease experts. Potential cases should be reported to public health departments in a timely manner. Public health classification of AFM cases involves expert review of clinical and imaging findings; however, it is important that clinical care not be delayed pending case classification.

According to the last CDC update, so far in 2019, there have been 4 confirmed cases (from NE, NC, UT, and WV) out of 25 reports of patients Under Investigation (PUIs). The above case is not included in the above case count. - Mod.UBA]
