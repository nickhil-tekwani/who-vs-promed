Background information on the outbreak of facial tumours in Tasmanian devils
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of progressive and apparently transmissible neoplasia has been
recorded in Tasmanian devils (_Sarcophilus harrissi_) in the wild since
1997 and has been especially apparent in the past 2 to 3 years [see:
Undiagnosed deaths, Tasmanian devils - Australia: RFI 20030803.1901].
The tumours (US: tumors. Mod.SH) typically occur first in the mouth and
facial areas, leading to speculation that the putative viral agent is
spread directly by biting. Devils lead an aggressive lifestyle and fighting
is common and savage, particularly among adult males in whom the disease
incidence is the highest.
Tumours are most commonly lymphomas or anaplastic round cell tumours, but
considerable variation exists, hence the preference for the term "facial
tumours" over more specifically descriptive terms. The disease is not
limited to facial tumours, however, but is genuinely systemic. Draining
lymph nodes and bone marrow are typically infiltrated with a clonal
population of round cells with a high cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio and often a
plasmacytoid appearance. Lymphocytes with a moderate or high mitotic index
are commonly seen infiltrating other organs such as the liver, causing the
appearance of hepatitis. Round cell tumours similar to those on the face
occur later in other parts of the body. Other odd tumours seem to occur in
association with this syndrome also, although there is no direct evidence
that this is more than coincidence. In addition to facial tumours, one
recent case had a functional adrenocortical tumour producing symptoms of
Cushing's disease (overproduction of cortisone), whilst older reports
describe examples of other seemingly unrelated neoplasms occurring in
association with facial tumours in Tasmanian devils.
First observed in the north east of the state, the disease has now been
seen in many districts further south and west. Field studies have confirmed
that it spread southward along the Freycinet Peninsular at a rate of 10--15
km/year, and westward about halfway across the state. In some areas,
mortality rates have been as high as 80 to 90 per cent, with very few
animals left over 12 months old. Animals of all ages and both sexes are
affected with a greater incidence in adult males. Younger animals tend not
to be affected so much, either due to reasons of susceptibility or because
they tend not to fight, or possibly due to a lengthy incubation period for
the disease.
Devils might live up to 5 or 6 months or more following the development of
clinical disease, but death seems to be the inevitable outcome. There is
very little evidence of animals recovering from this disease. Death tends
ultimately to result from starvation, as facial tumours invade and destroy
facial bones and dental arcades, leaving hideously ulcerated and infected
lesions on the face and in the mouth.
Pathologists at the Animal Health Laboratory of the Tasmanian Department of
Primary Industries, Water and Environment (DPIWE) have proposed a
retroviral aetiology for this disease on the basis of a number of
similarities with retroviral disease in other animals. The archetypal virus
of the type-C group of cancer-causing retroviruses is feline leukemia virus
(FeLV) that causes a range of syndromes in cats, including solid tumours of
the lymphoma variety, leukemia of various types, and/or a chronic
immunodeficiency syndrome over the longer term. Transmission is believed to
be direct, mostly via fighting amongst male cats, which gives the disease a
much greater incidence in adult males. Avian type-C retroviruses cause
solid lymphomas or other round cell tumours of birds, and can also cause
leukemic conditions.
But the most interesting is a novel type-C retrovirus recently isolated
from koalas (KoRV), another Australian marsupial, which is also associated
with a syndrome including solid tumours of the lymphoma variety and
leukemia (Hanger, et al. Journal of Virology 2000; :4264-4272). When KoRV
was first isolated it was tempting to speculate that FeLV might have made
the evolutionary jump across the species barrier into koalas, given the
extent of the problem of feral cat proliferation in the Australian bush.
However, the work of Hangar et al at the University of Queensland found no
genetic relationship between KoRV and FeLV.
Other possible aetiologies include a herpesvirus and a non-viral aetiology.
The one glaring flaw with the retrovirus hypothesis is that there is no
precedent for the appearance of tumours at the initial site of infection,
and it is somewhat inconsistent with the biology of retroviruses unless an
acutely-transforming oncogene were involved, which would be extremely
unusual. Cats also transmit FeLV by biting for example, but tumours occur
at unrelated sites after many months following systemic proliferation of
the virus. The only precedent for tumour induction at the site of
"infection" that I am aware of would be the transmissible venereal tumour
of dogs, which seems to have few parallels with the situation in devils.
The veterinary and pathology group at DPIWE have established a minor
research project consisting of a group of scientists and field workers keen
to participate in working up the Tasmanian devil facial tumour syndrome and
its aetiology, but the major limitation is the difficulty of obtaining
research funding. Although still in the early stages of defining the
disease, more extensive research will be required and external funds are
being sought to assist in characterising this apparently devastating
disease of our Tasmanian icon species. At this early stage we are focusing
on attempts to obtain some virus either directly from plasma of infected
animals by ultra-centrifugation, or indirectly from cell culture of
peripheral blood monocytes from infected animals, as achieved by Hanger et
al with respect to the koala retrovirus.
My thanks to Jon Hanger for his assistance with methods and advice on how
to proceed, and for his offer to help out with some limited molecular
analysis. Tissue samples have also been sent to an electron microscopy
expert, Dr Alex Hyatt at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in
Geelong, who has generously offered his services gratis to search the
tissues for virus particles. Additional views and speculation are most
welcome from the ProMed-mail list members in response to this thread, and
be assured that ProMed-mail will be updated in the future with reports of
further progress.

[ProMED-mail appreciates this timely and comprehensive response from Dr
Chadwick to the request for information on the outbreak of facial tumours
in Tasmanian devils. Further comments on the possible aetiology of this
disease would be welcomed. An additional candidate for a viral etiologic
agent might be a polyomavirus. Under certain conditions murine polyomavirus
infection induces a wide variety of tumours in its natural host; however, a
marsupial polyomavirus has yet to be identified. - Mod.CP]
