Avian influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 18
--------------------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Viet Nam
------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has informed WHO that 2 additional cases
of H5N1 infection in humans have been confirmed. Both cases were fatal. The
2 cases were in young women, aged 16 and 17 years, from the southern part
of the country. Both were treated at hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. The
16-year-old woman died on Tue 3 Feb 2004 and the 17-year-old woman died on
Tue 27 Jan 2004. These cases bring the number of laboratory confirmed avian
influenza A (H5N1) infections in Viet Nam to 15. Of these, 11 have died, 2
remain hospitalized, and 2 have recovered.
Situation (human) in Thailand
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country's 5th
human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The case, a
6-year-old boy from Kanchanaburi Province, developed illness on Sat 24 Jan
2004 and died on Tue 2 Feb 2004. All 5 laboratory-confirmed cases in
Thailand have been fatal.
FAO/OIE/WHO Technical Consultation on the Control of Avian Influenza (Rome,
3-4 Feb 2004)
-------------------------------------------------
Several conclusions and recommendations made during this consultation
strengthen WHO recommendations for protecting humans from the consequences
of widespread outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
in poultry in several Asian countries.
Experts at the consultation recognized the need for immediate application
of measures to prevent human infection in groups -- notably poultry workers
and cullers -- at high risk of exposure to the avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus. Personal protective equipment should be available for persons in
these groups, who also need training in the proper use of this equipment.
WHO has issued guidelines for the protection of cullers.
The experts further recognized the need to reduce opportunities for the
simultaneous infection of humans with H5N1 and human strains of influenza
virus. Such dual infections give the avian and human viruses opportunities
to exchange genes, possibly resulting in the emergence of a new influenza
virus subtype. The consultation recommended that poultry workers, who can
experience intensive exposures, be given the existing seasonal influenza
vaccine. (The vaccine protects against infection with currently circulating
human influenza viruses, but does not protect against H5N1 infection). WHO
has issued guidelines for the targeted administration of seasonal vaccines.
WHO priorities for responding to the current situation include rapid
control of the animal reservoir of H5N1, as doing so reduces the risk of
both more cases and deaths in humans and more opportunities for a new
subtype of the influenza virus to emerge. Recommendations from the
consultation also support this priority.
The consultation concluded that culling, or "stamping out," of infected
flocks remains the preferred option for controlling H5N1 outbreaks in
poultry. However, the present outbreaks in poultry are historically
unprecedented in their scale, geographical spread, and devastating economic
consequences for both the poultry industry and rural farmers.
While culling remains the preferred option for infected flocks, targeted
vaccination of healthy poultry can be used as a complementary tool for
achieving the rapid reduction of the risk posed by the H5N1 virus in its
avian host -- an objective which supports both elimination of the disease
in poultry and prevention of further human cases and deaths.
Vaccination alone will not be sufficient to bring the present outbreaks in
poultry under control.
Experts at the consultation stressed that, where vaccination is being
considered as a complementary control tool, it must be used in conjunction
with a comprehensive strategy that includes culling of all diseased or
exposed poultry, strict biosecurity, quarantine, and other measures aimed
at preventing further spread of the disease.

[The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases in Thailand has increased
to 5, all of whom are now deceased. The total number of
laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection in Viet Nam has increased to 15, including 11 deaths. This brings
the total number of human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
in East Asia to 20, and the total number of deaths to 16. Thailand and Viet
Nam remain the only 2 countries in the region to have recorded human cases
of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. - Mod.CP]

More Suspected Human Cases in Thailand and Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------
The human death toll from the avian influenza epidemic sweeping through
Asian poultry flocks rose to 16 on Thu 5 Feb 2004 as China, a major focus
of concern, admitted it faced a tough fight to defeat the disease. "Some
parts of our animal disease prevention system are weak and vulnerable, and
the public has limited knowledge about the disease and ways to prevent it,"
China's Agriculture Ministry said. "It remains an arduous task for China to
prevent and control the disease," it said in a statement before a news
conference.
The confession from China, castigated in 2003 for covering up the SARS
outbreak for several months, came as Viet Nam said a 16-year-old southern
girl had become its 11th bird flu victim. "We have conducted tests in our
hospital, and the results showed the girl from Soc Trang province had died
from avian influenza virus infection," Tran Tinh Hien, deputy director of
the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, told Reuters. The
other 5 died in Thailand, which said it had 2 more suspected cases, a
2-year-old boy from Khon Kaen province, northeast of Bangkok, and a
67-year-old man from the central province of Chainat. Thailand, which also
has another 2 probable avian influenza deaths, now has 19 suspected cases.
Vietnam and Thailand are alone among 10 countries hit by avian influenza to
have reported cases in humans, and almost all of them came from direct
contact with infected chickens. But experts say there is a remote chance
the virulent avian influenza A (H5N1) virus could infect a person
[experiencing a human influenza virus infection] and create a new strain
[by reassortment], which could set off a pandemic in a world population
with no immunity to it. If that were to happen, China, which raised 8
billion chickens in 2003, mostly on small, cramped farms in close contact
with farmers, might well be the place, experts say.
12 of China's 31 provinces have confirmed or suspected outbreaks of avian
influenza, and the government said local officials had strict orders to
report any sign of human contagion promptly, openly, and fully -- echoing
what became Beijing's catch-phrase in its war on SARS after the initial
cover-up in 2003.
The Agriculture Ministry said more than 1.2 million chickens had been
culled in China, a small proportion of the 50 million poultry the U.N.'s
Food and Agriculture Organization estimates have been slaughtered [in the
region up to the present].
Thailand says it has culled 25.9 million poultry in mass slaughters the FAO
says are the most effective means of stamping the disease out.
Chief government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair said it was working. "Our
progress in fighting the disease is satisfactory," he told reporters. "The
situation is improving steadily." He said Thailand's "red zones" -- the
5-km (3-mile) area around a confirmed outbreak within which all poultry
must be slaughtered -- had dropped to 10 in 5 of its 76 provinces. Last
week, the government reported more than 140 red zones in 29 provinces. So
confident is it that the outbreak is under control, the Thai government is
organizing "chicken-eating fairs" across the country Saturday in a bid to
convince Thais that the experts are right to say well-cooked chicken and
eggs pose no danger.

Viet Nam: Human-to-human Transmission Denied
--------------------------------------------
There has been no transmission of avian influenza virus among humans in
Viet Nam, Vietnamese Deputy Minister of Health Tran Chi Liem was quoted by
local media as saying on Thu 5 Feb 2004.
"The most [likely] way of transmission now is from wild birds to chickens
and then to persons," Liem said, adding that 3 deaths within a family in
northern Thai Binh province involve chickens, because all of the victims
directly slaughtered the fowls.
Klaus Stohr, head of the global influenza program of the World Health
Organisation (WHO), recently stated that the family members in Viet Nam
could have contacted directly to sick poultry, and that there has no
evidence of H5N1 being passed from person to person. According to Stohr,
the World Health Organisation is considering 3 possibilities: The avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus gradually mutates and transmits to humans easily;
viruses in poultry combine with human influenza viruses to form a new
strain that can spread globally; or that the avian influenza outbreak is
contained, posing no threat to people.
Vietnam reported a total of [119 confirmed and suspected influenza A virus
infections, including 15 cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection]
as of the afternoon of Wed 4 Feb 2004. However, "WHO has so far confirmed
only 13 cases [now revised to 15 -- see above part (1)] of H5N1 infections
in Viet Nam," Bob Dietz, spokesman of the organization in the country, told
Xinhua on Thu 5 Feb 2004.
