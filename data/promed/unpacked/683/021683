[1] UK: health secretary tests positive
Date: Sat 17 Jul 2021
Source: BBC News [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57874744


Health secretary Sajid Javid has tested positive for COVID-19 and is suffering "very mild" symptoms.

Mr Javid, who has received both vaccine doses, said on Saturday [17 Jul 2021] night a PCR test had confirmed a positive result he received by lateral flow test. He said he would continue to self-isolate and work from home.

It is understood Mr Javid met Boris Johnson on Friday [16 Jul 2021]. It is not clear yet whether the prime minister will have to isolate.

Meanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, has warned of a "bumpy winter" ahead.

It comes as the UK recorded more than 50 000 daily cases for the 2nd day running, days before almost all legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England on Monday [19 Jul 2021].

There were 54 674 cases -- following 51 870 new cases on Friday [16 Jul 2021] -- with 41 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.

The last time cases exceeded 50 000 was in mid-January [2021].

In a video posted earlier on his Twitter feed, Mr Javid said he took the lateral flow test after feeling a "a bit groggy" on Friday [16 Jul 2021] evening.

He said: "I'm grateful that I've had 2 jabs of the vaccine, and so far my symptoms are very mild."

Mr Javid later tweeted that the positive result was confirmed by a PCR test, which is checked in a laboratory. He urged people who had not been vaccinated yet to "get out there and get them as soon as you can."

Mr Javid also said people who feel groggy or come into contact with someone who is positive should take a lateral flow test.

Mr Javid replaced Matt Hancock as health secretary less than 3 weeks ago after CCTV footage emerged showing his predecessor kissing a colleague in his office, in breach of social-distancing rules.

Mr Javid previously tweeted that he had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

A Public Health England study found 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was 60% effective at stopping symptomatic disease from the delta variant, which is now dominant across the UK. Two jabs of the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective.

A separate analysis from PHE found the vaccines were highly effective against preventing hospitalisations from the same variant, with 2 doses of the Pfizer jab 96% effective and the AstraZeneca jab 92%.

England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said vaccines were not 100% effective but were likely to have saved about 30 000 lives in the UK. He told the BBC: "We still need to keep going with these vaccines because they've completely changed the landscape in terms of the numbers of people going into hospital and, very much so, the numbers of people dying. They're still a massive success."

Lateral flow tests provide a quick result, using a device similar to a pregnancy test, and are intended for use in those without symptoms, according to the NHS. PCR tests are mainly used when people have coronavirus symptoms or have already had a positive lateral flow result, and [samples] are sent to laboratories to be checked. The NHS suggests people do a lateral flow test twice a week to check if they have the virus.

The health secretary's announcement comes as the government prepares to go ahead with the final lifting of lockdown restrictions in England on Monday [19 Jul 2021]. Social-distancing rules will end, although government guidelines advise face coverings should still be worn in enclosed spaces such as in shops and on public transport.

Jeremy Hunt, the chairman of the Commons health select committee, warned there was a danger that England may have to go back into lockdown in the autumn if hospitalisation rates continued to increase during the summer.

Mr Hunt, a former health secretary, said the situation facing the NHS was "very serious."

"The warning light on the NHS dashboard is not flashing amber, it is flashing red," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

One scientist advising the government said the country could be facing a "protracted period" of rising cases running into the autumn.

Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said new infections could reach 100 000 a day within weeks.

Prof Van-Tam warned the pandemic would carry on for a while and "there will be further twists and turns."

He added: "This is going to be a bumpy winter at times but, providing people don't tear the pants out of it and they go in a cautious, steady, gradual way, one hopes we'll be OK."

[2] Israel: Pfizer vaccine
Date: Sat 17 Jul 2021 16:37 EDT
Source: Daily Mail [edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9796589/Israel-saus-Pfizers-COVID-19-vaccine-significantly-effective-against-Indian-Delta.html


The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is "weaker" against the Indian "delta" variant than health officials had hoped, a new report from Israel claims.

On Friday [16 Jul 2021], Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held a discussion about the coronavirus with his Cabinet at the Kirya in Tel Aviv.

Israel once led the entire world in the vaccine race, vaccinating 61% of its population with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but is now dealing with a surge in cases.

On Thursday [15 Jul 2021] the test positivity rate was 1.52%, which is the highest number since March [2021].

As of 6 Jun [2021], the vaccine provides 64% protection against infection from the variant, according to the Israeli government

"At the moment, there is an idea that is spreading to the effect that the protective ability of the existing vaccines against the delta mutation is weaker than what we had hoped," Bennett said. "We do not know exactly to what degree the vaccine helps, but it is significantly less. We are all hoping to see a slowdown, but the facts at the moment are that there is no slowdown, not here and not in the world."

The delta variant has been labeled as a "double mutant" by India's Health Ministry because it carries 2 mutations: L452R and E484Q.

L452R is the same mutation seen with the California homegrown variant, and E484Q is similar to the mutation seen in the Brazilian and South African variants.

Both of the mutations occur on key parts of the virus, which allows it to enter and infect human cells.

Bennett also addressed the crises in the UK and the US, both of which are using the Pfizer vaccine and are overrun with the delta variant.

On Thursday [15 Jul 2021], the US recorded 28 412 new cases with a 7-day rolling average of 26 079, a 135% increase from the 11 067 average recorded 2 weeks ago.

Nearly every state and the District of Columbia have seen infections rise in the last week, according to a DailyMail.com analysis of Johns Hopkins data.

What's more, about 40 states have seen their infection rates increase by at least 50% with some of the biggest rises seen in hotspots such as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri.

With cases doubling every 2 weeks, this means the US could see 50 000 cases per day by the end of July [2021] and 100 000 per day [2 weeks later], at [before] the end of the [next] month.

Meanwhile, Britain's daily coronavirus cases hit 50 000 on Friday [16 Jul 2021] for the 1st time since the depths of the 2nd wave in January [2021]. Figures from the Department of Health show that the number of positive tests, which sits at 51 870, has risen by 45% in a week.

Hospitalizations and deaths are now both rising steadily following the ferocious surge in cases, which top experts blamed on the relaxation of restrictions and Euro 2020.

It comes as the delta variant overtakes Israel, making up more than 80% of all new infections

"At the moment, the delta mutation is leaping forward around the world, including in vaccinated countries such as Britain, Israel, and the US," Bennett said. "In Britain, in recent days, we have seen a jump in the number of children who are being hospitalized on a daily basis. This is a development that we are aware of; we are dealing with it rationally and responsibly."

"On the one hand, the vaccines are effective against the virus; therefore, we are seeing to the necessary continuity of vaccinations and inventories.

"Whoever hoped that the vaccines alone would solve the problem, they are not. What is necessary is a strategy that brings as many vaccines as possible on the one hand and, on the other, also understands the limits of the vaccine."

[3] Retraction of mask trial results
Date: Fri 16 Jul 2021

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2782288


Citation: Notice of Retraction. Walach H, et al: Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air with or without Face Masks in Healthy Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA Pediatr. Published online 30 Jun 2021.
Christakis D, Fontanarosa PB. JAMA Pediatr. Published online 16 Jul 2021; doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.3252.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Research Letter, "Experimental Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Content in Inhaled Air with or without Face Masks in Healthy Children: A Randomized Clinical Trial," by Harald Walach, PhD, and colleagues published online in JAMA Pediatrics on 30 Jun 2021 is hereby retracted. Following publication, numerous scientific issues were raised regarding the study methodology, including concerns about the applicability of the device used for assessment of carbon dioxide levels in this study setting, and whether the measurements obtained accurately represented carbon dioxide content in inhaled air, as well as issues related to the validity of the study conclusions.

In their invited responses to these and other concerns, the authors did not provide sufficiently convincing evidence to resolve these issues, as determined by editorial evaluation and additional scientific review. Given fundamental concerns about the study methodology, uncertainty regarding the validity of the findings and conclusions, and the potential public health implications, the editors have retracted this Research Letter.

[Tweet from Megan Ranney MD MPH @meganranney 16 Jul 2021: "Retracted!!!! (But should never have been published. This was poor science, to say the least.) To be super clear: there is zero evidence that masks harm kids (or adults), and in fact, there is good evidence that they do not."

Retweeted by Linsey Marr @linseymarr 16 Jul 2021 with comment: "Not surprising. It's like they were trying to measure times in a 100 m dash using a watch with only a minute hand, not a second hand (let alone one that goes to the milliseconds). There is a ridiculous amount of evidence that masks work and do not cause harm in this way."

This retraction comes on the heels of publication of another of Walach's papers suggesting that COVID vaccinations do more harm than good, which was subsequently retracted as flawed, if not fraudulent (https://edzardernst.com/2021/07/prof-harald-walach-is-really-unlucky/).

If these papers went through a review process before publication, one would expect such poor science would never reach the public realm. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
--------
Introduction. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unparalleled in recent history as are the social distancing interventions that have led to a considerable halt on the economic and social life of so many countries.

Aim. We aimed to generate empirical evidence about which social distancing measures had the most impact in reducing case counts and mortality.

Methods. We report a quasi-experimental (observational) study of the impact of various interventions for control of the outbreak through 24 Apr 2020. Chronological data on case numbers and deaths were taken from the daily published figures by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and dates of initiation of various control strategies from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation website and published sources. Our complementary analyses were modelled in R using Bayesian generalised additive mixed models and in STATA using multilevel mixed-effects regression models.

Results. From both sets of modelling, we found that closure of education facilities, prohibiting mass gatherings, and closure of some non-essential businesses were associated with reduced incidence, whereas stay-at-home orders and closure of additional non-essential businesses was not associated with any independent additional impact.

Conclusions. Our findings are that schools and some non-essential businesses operating as normal as well as allowing mass gatherings were incompatible with suppressing disease spread. Closure of all businesses and stay-at-home orders are less likely to be required to keep disease incidence low. Our results help identify what were the most effective non-pharmaceutical interventions in this period.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------
We analysed 9030 variant-specific RT-PCR tests performed on SARS-CoV-2-positive samples collected in France between 31 May and 21 Jun 2021. This analysis revealed rapid growth of the delta variant in 3 of the 13 metropolitan French regions and estimated a +79% (95% confidence interval: 52-110%) transmission advantage compared with the alpha variant. The next weeks will prove decisive, and the magnitude of the estimated transmission advantages of the delta variant could represent a major challenge for public health authorities.

---------------------------------------------
Abstract
-------
Evidence on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) in preventing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections is needed to guide public health recommendations for vaccinated people. We report interim results of a living systematic review. We identified a total of 30 studies that investigated VE against symptomatic and/or asymptomatic infection. In fully vaccinated individuals, VE against symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was 80-90% in nearly all studies. Fully vaccinated persons are less likely to become infected and contribute to transmission.

Abstract
-------
Adults receiving heterologous COVID-19 immunisation with mRNA (Comirnaty) or adenoviral-vector (Vaxzevria) vaccines had higher reactogenicity rates and sought medical attention more often after 2 doses than homologous schedules. Reactogenicity was higher among less than or equal to 50- than greater than 50-year-olds, women, and those with prior symptomatic/confirmed COVID-19. Adults receiving heterologous schedules on clinical advice after severe 1st-dose reactions had lower reactogenicity after dose 2 following Vaxzevria/Comirnaty (93.4%; 95% confidence interval: 90.5-98.1 vs 48%; 95% CI: 1.0-57.7) but not Comirnaty/Vaxzevria (91.7%; 95% CI: 77.5-98.2 vs 75.0%; 95% CI: 57.8-87.9).
