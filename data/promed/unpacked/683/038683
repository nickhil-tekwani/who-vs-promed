A rare mosquito-transmitted viral infection that can spread to humans has been found in northwestern Mercer County.

Officials from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and the Department of Environmental Protection confirmed to The Meadville Tribune that eastern equine encephalitis has been found near Jamestown.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses causing inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Blood samples were taken 5 Sep [2021] from a single horse in Mercer County's Greene Township near Jamestown, Shannon Powers, press secretary for the Department of Agriculture, told the Tribune late Tuesday [21 Sep 2021] afternoon. Lab results from the Pennsylvania State Veterinary Lab confirmed the samples as containing the virus.

EEE is a virus carried by birds, but when mosquitoes bite an infected bird, the mosquitoes then can transmit the virus when they bite humans, horses, and other birds. Disease transmission does not occur directly from person to person, according to the CDC.

EEE cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall. The last discovery of EEE in northwestern Pennsylvania was in September 2019 in Erie County. Spraying to prevent mosquitos potentially carrying EEE was done in northern Mercer County in September 2019 as well.

In the United States, an average of 11 human cases of EEE are reported annually, according to the CDC. However, EEE is considered one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the US due to its high fatality rate. About 1/3 of patients who develop encephalitis due to EEE infection die, and many of those who survive have mild to severe brain damage, according to the CDC's website.

Most people who become infected with EEE show either no symptoms or mild symptoms such as fever and joint or muscle pain, according to the CDC.

But severe cases of EEE infection include encephalitis, a swelling of the brain, or meningitis, a swelling of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The infection may begin with the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma, according to the CDC.

It takes 4-10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of EEE, according to the CDC.

The Department of Environmental Protection has been monitoring for EEE periodically throughout the season in Crawford, Erie, and Warren counties, said Tom Decker, spokesman for DEP's s Northwest Regional Office in Meadville.

Mosquito traps were deployed in the Greene Township area of Mercer County and collected Tuesday [21 Sep 2021], Decker said.

"Samples are being shipped to a DEP lab in Harrisburg for identification of the mosquitoes and possible testing if the main carriers of EEE are found," Decker said in an email to the Tribune. "The main carrier of EEE is _Culiseta melanura_, an uncommon mosquito that reproduces in acidic forested wetland environments. DEP will continue to monitor the area until the mosquito season ends."

The best way to reduce the chance of getting EEE is to prevent mosquito bites, according to the CDC, as there is no approved vaccine for people or preventive drug.

Both state and federal officials recommend the following to reduce the risk to both humans and animals:

- Use mosquito repellant.
- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.
- Stay inside at dusk and dawn when mosquitos are most active.
- Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flowerpots, buckets, barrels, and other containers.
- Keep horse vaccinations up to date as there is an EEE vaccine for horses.

EEE signs in horses usually start with a fever reaching as high as 106 deg F [41 deg C] for 1-2 days.

Additional signs may include abnormal gait, aimless wandering, circling, difficulty breathing, drooping ears, drowsiness, head pressing, hyperactivity, inability to swallow, paralysis, restlessness, and sensitivity to sound.

The Green Lake County Health Department reports a horse in Green Lake County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which is caused by the EEE virus.

This is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in a horse in Green Lake County this year [2021], and the 7th case in horses in the state this year [2021]. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin thus far in 2021; however, there were 2 human cases in 2020.

EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans.

Documentation of an EEE-positive horse, however, confirms there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can spread the virus to people and other animals.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick. Those who do become ill may develop fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe resulting in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death. There is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE illness available for people.

Signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Since EEE virus is known to be circulating in Green Lake County, and since mosquitoes can remain active until the 1st hard frost (temperatures below 28 deg F [-2 deg C] for at least 4 consecutive hours), residents and visitors should be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites. Follow these tips to protect yourself and your family against mosquito bites:

Avoid mosquito bites
- Apply an insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 to exposed skin and clothing.
- Prior to heading outdoors, treat clothing with permethrin; do not apply permethrin directly to skin.
- Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning hours, when mosquitoes are most active.
- Wear long-sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors to help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home
- Make sure window and door screens are intact and tightly fitted to prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home.
- Prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home by removing stagnant water from items around your property, such as tin cans, plastic containers, flowerpots, discarded tires, roof gutters, and downspouts.
- Turn over wheelbarrows, kiddie pools, buckets, and small boats such as canoes and kayaks when not in use.
- Change the water in bird baths and pet dishes at least every 3 days.
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.
- Trim or mow tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.

The Chippewa County Department of Public Health is reporting that a horse in Chippewa County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which is caused by the EEE virus.

According to a release from the department, this is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in a horse in Chippewa County this year [2021], and the 8th case in horses in the state this year [2021].

No EEE cases in humans have yet been reported in Wisconsin in 2021. There were 2 human cases in 2020.

Three new cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses have been confirmed by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The horses are from Genesee and Shiawassee (2) counties. The state has now reported 8 cases of EEE in horses in 2021, which is down from 41 animal cases and 4 human cases in 2020.

Barry, Crawford, Livingston, Otsego, and Shiawassee counties have also seen cases of EEE. No human cases have been identified this year [2021].

"Michiganders need to continue taking precautions against mosquitoes as they take advantage of our current mild weather conditions and enjoy outdoor activities," said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. "People can also be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus, which can lead to serious health impacts and even death."

Applying insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, maintaining window and door screening, and following other precautions can help Michigan residents avoid mosquito bites and stay healthy.

[While many of us think it should be trending to fall, the mosquito is alive and well, transmitting diseases. A hard freeze, not cool weather, is required to get rid of mosquitoes, at least temporarily until spring.

In other words, it is not too late to vaccinate your equine friends. The EEE immunity wanes fairly fast in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when you gave vaccination last, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG]
