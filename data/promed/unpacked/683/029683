Authorities say a Florida woman who was 9 months pregnant and her family became ill after eating meat tainted with LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide, a semisynthetic hallucinogenic drug].

Tampa police say doctors induced labor and the woman had a healthy baby boy. The entire family was eventually released from the hospital in good condition.

Tampa police say the family of 4 ate the tainted meat Monday [3 Mar 2014]. The Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office reported Friday [7 Mar 2014] that the meat had been contaminated with the hallucinogenic drug.

Police say the bottom round steak was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Tampa. The store has turned over all its meat to police for testing.

Local police, along with county health officials and state and federal agriculture officials, are investigating how the drug got into the meat.

[Just how did the meat become contaminated with this hallucinogenic drug? And who cooked the meal?

The article implies the LSD was the reason for the labor induction of the child. Yet there may have been other reasons associated with the pregnancy.

The article leaves many questions unanswered. I suspect there is more to this story than the short piece above.

A review of surveillance video from a Walmart store where a Tampa family purchased beef later found to be tainted with LSD revealed no evidence of suspicious activity before the purchase, a company spokeswoman said Monday [10 Mar 2014].

Management at the Walmart store at 1501 N Dale Mabry Highway worked with police following the incident last week [3 Mar 2014] that sickened 4 people, including 2 children, to try to pinpoint signs that the store's meat products had been disturbed.

"From what video we've reviewed, we're unaware of any suspicious activity," Dianna Gee, a Walmart spokeswoman, wrote in an email Monday [10 Mar 2014]. "There's no indication that any other products in the store were tampered (with) or the packaging disturbed in any way."

The lack of any obvious wrongdoing within the store leaves open the question of how the package of beef became contaminated with the hallucinogenic and whether any crime was committed.

A Tampa police investigation remained ongoing Monday [10 Mar 2014]. Detectives were receiving assistance with further testing of the store's meat products from the US Department of Agriculture, said police spokeswoman Laura McElroy.

"It's definitely outside the scope of what we usually do," McElroy said. "We've never had a case like this."

Tampa police were called to investigate after officials at St Joseph's Hospital notified them last week about a family of 4 who suddenly fell ill the night of 3 Mar 2014.

A male, 24, was rushed to the hospital that night by his pregnant girlfriend, who is 31. But after she got there, she and her 2 children also started experiencing hallucinations.

Doctors induced labor on in the 31 year old woman, who was 9 months pregnant. They also performed tracheal intubations on the male and the 2 children, ages 7 and 6.

All 4 were later discharged from the hospital. The baby boy, described by police as healthy, was also sent home. [Including the new born, it would be 5 people released from the hospital. - Mod.TG]

The symptoms, authorities found, began after the family consumed a package of thin-cut, bottom round steak they purchased at the Walmart store.

The steak was part of the 1st dinner the family made since moving into the North Tampa rental home 2 days earlier. The family members have not spoken publicly about the incident or answered the door for reporters seeking comment.

Police said they had not been called to respond to any incidents in that home in at least the last year.

Tests on the leftover meat and packaging revealed traces of LSD.

In the ensuing investigation, police took the family's oven for testing as well as the remaining supply of meat from the Walmart store.

They also took blood samples from the family members to determine how much of the substance they consumed.

The meat was prepackaged on sealed trays by Cargill, police said, a company whose meat businesses are have headquarters in Wichita, Kan.

A Cargill spokesman said Monday [10 Mar 2014] that the company had not been contacted by investigators. Neither the FBI nor the Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services are involved.

In a news conference Friday [7 Mar 2014], Tampa police Chief Jane Castor said investigators believe the incident is isolated.

[If the animal was fed, or otherwise consumed this substance, it is not impossible that it would be in the body tissues. However, the reason for feeding the drug to a bovine is odd. And surely an intoxicated, "high" cow would have been recognized by the inspectors.

LSD, abbreviation of lysergic acid diethylamide, also called lysergide, is a potent synthetic hallucinogenic drug that can be derived from the ergot alkaloids (as ergotamine and ergonovine, principal constituents of ergot, the grain deformity and toxic infectant of flour caused by the fungus _Claviceps purpurea_). LSD usually is prepared by chemical synthesis in a laboratory. Its basic chemical structure is similar to that of the ergot alkaloids, and it is structurally related to several other drugs (such as, bufotenine, psilocybin, harmine, and ibogaine), which can all block the action of serotonin (the indole amine transmitter of nerve impulses) in brain tissue.

LSD produces marked deviations from normal behaviour, probably the consequence of its ability to inhibit the action of serotonin, though the mechanism of the drug remains uncertain. LSD was used experimentally in medicine as a psychotomimetic agent to induce mental states that were believed to resemble those of actual psychotic diseases (primarily the schizophrenias). After administration, LSD can be absorbed readily from any mucosal surface -- even the ear -- and acts within 30 to 60 minutes. Its effects usually last for 8 to 10 hours, and occasionally some effects persist for several days. 2 serious side effects are the prolongation and transient reappearance of the psychotic reaction.

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also know as entactogen ("to touch within") is one of the most potent psychoactive compounds known (said to be more than 3000 times more potent than mescaline). An oral dose of as little as 25 microg is capable of producing potential deleterious psychedelic effects.

Although LSD toxicity is diagnosed primarily by way of history and physical examination, LSD can be detected by radioimmunoassay. levels from 1.5-5.5 nanog/mL may be found within 24 hours after the patient has taken a 300-mcg dose of the drug. However, high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography is required for confirmation.

Diagnostic testing should be directed at identification of complications or exclusion of comorbidities. Coagulation, total creatine phosphokinase, or serum electrolyte studies may be indicated in patients with seizures, coma, or a neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like presentation to identify coagulopathy or rhabdomyolysis or to exclude other diagnoses.

Because of its large index of toxicity, an individual must have access to unusually concentrated forms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), if he/she is to overdose. Massive overdoses, however, can lead to respiratory arrest, coma, emesis, hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and bleeding disorders. In some cases, the patient's altered perceptions can result in behavioral toxicity, in which an individual fails to appreciate dangers in the environment and may be injured.

LSD causes changes in thought, mood, and perception, with minimal effects on memory and orientation. The drug primarily produces so-called pseudohallucinations, which are illusions derived from the misinterpretation of actual experiences. These include synesthesias, in which the transposition of certain sensory modes occurs, creating an experience known as sensory crossover. For example, the perception of a sound evoked by a visual image or the impression of hearing colors or feeling sounds would be considered a synesthesia. True hallucinations occur as well; visual hallucinations are the most common.

Exposure to LSD causes pleasant and unpleasant emotions, but the overall effects are unpredictable and vary with the ingested amount, the user's personality and mood, individual expectations, and surroundings. Users are typically aware that visual, auditory, and olfactory perceptions are distorted and unreal; however, acute adverse drug effects can include panic reactions, psychoses, and major depression.

Most illegal laboratories making LSD in the United States are found on the West Coast. The drug is sold under more than 80 street names, including "A", acid, Adams, back breaker, battery acid, beast, blotter, blue chairs, blue cheers, blue mist, brown dot, buttons, California triple dip, cube, dose, dot, Elvis, flat blues, gelatin, green wedge, hawk, looney toons, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, M and Ms, mellow yellow, mescal, microdot, mighty Quinn, mind detergent, Owsley acid, Owsley blue dot, pane, pearly gates, pink wedge, pink Owsley, purple Owsley, Sandoz's, strawberries, sugar cube, sunshine, Superman, uncle, vacation, wedding bells, window pane, and Zen.
