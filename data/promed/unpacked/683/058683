[We found this report on the ITAR/TASS Newswires today. Because the report
is generated from Beijing we suspect the Mongolia referred to in this
report is Inner Mongolia, the autonomous region in China. But it could very
well be referring to cases in the Independent State of Mongolia which
borders both Russia and China. If there is any further information on this
outbreak as well as its location, we would appreciate receiving it. -Mod. MPP
BEIJING -- Cases of bubonic plague have been registered among the
population of marmots in Mongolia. Authorities in the country declared no
cases of infection have been reported among humans. The infectious diseases
research center has warned the inhabitants of the affected areas about the
undesirability of hunting for wild animals in connection with the outburst
of the disease. The population is being vaccinated to forestall the spread
of the infection.

[Bubonic plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague is transmitted
through infected fleas. Hunters are subject to this disease when they kill
an animal and then fleas from the animal bite the human being. - Mod.TG
[Plague has also been transmitted, presumably via aerosol, from infected
cats to humans. It can be transmitted from human-to-human via the
respiratory route when a person has the pneumonic form of plague. - Man.
