United States & Worldwide: Influenza Activity Update - May to September 2003
---------------------------------------------------
During the period May to September 2003, influenza A(H3N2) viruses
circulated worldwide and were associated with mild to moderate levels
of disease activity. Influenza A(H1)* and B viruses were reported
less frequently. [* A(H1) includes both the A(H1N1) and A(H1N2)
influenza virus types. The influenza A(H1N2) strain appears to have
resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the circulating
influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes. Because the hemagglutinin
proteins of the A(H1N2) viruses are similar to those of the
circulating A(H1N1) viruses, and the neuraminidase proteins are
similar to the circulating A(H3N2) viruses, the 2003/04 influenza
vaccine should provide protection against A(H1N2) viruses.] In North
America, isolates of influenza A(H3N2), A(H1), and B were identified
sporadically. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United
States and worldwide during May to September 2003. Influenza activity
in North America typically peaks during December to March, which
underscores the need to begin vaccinating against influenza in
October and to continue vaccination into December and throughout the
influenza season (1).
United States
-------------
In the United States, influenza surveillance is conducted by a
network comprising 4 components, including approximately 900 sentinel
health-care providers who regularly report data on patient visits for
influenza-like illness (ILI) and approximately 120 U.S.-based World
Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus
Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories that report
the number of respiratory specimens tested and the number and type of
influenza viruses identified during October to mid-May (2). In 2003,
approximately 300 sentinel providers and 65 WHO and NREVSS
collaborating laboratories continued to submit weekly reports after
mid-May. During the period 18 May to 13 Sep 2003, the weekly
percentage of patient visits to sentinel providers for ILI ranged
from 0.5-0.9 percent, and WHO and NREVSS collaborating laboratories
tested 9145 respiratory specimens, of which 68 (0.7 percent) were
positive. Of the positive results, 31 (45.6 percent) were influenza
A(H3N2) viruses, 25 (36.8 percent) were influenza type-B viruses, 7
(10.3%) were influenza A(H1) viruses, and 5 (7.0 percent) were
influenza A viruses that were not subtyped. Influenza A viruses were
reported each week during mid-May to mid-August. Influenza B viruses
were reported for 5 consecutive weeks during mid-May to mid-June and
during the week ending 2 Aug 2003. As of 19 Sep 2003, no influenza
viruses have been reported for September.
Worldwide
---------
During the period May to July, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated
in Africa (Madagascar and South Africa). In Asia, influenza A(H3N2)
viruses predominated in Hong Kong and Thailand and were reported in
Bangladesh, China, Guam, Indonesia, Japan, and Singapore. In Oceania
(Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand), A(H3N2) viruses
predominated and were associated with widespread activity in
Australia and New Zealand. In Latin America, influenza A(H3N2)
viruses predominated in Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. Influenza A(H3N2)
viruses also circulated widely in Argentina and were isolated in El
Salvador, French Guiana, Paraguay, and Peru. During May to August,
sporadic cases of influenza A(H3N2) infection were reported in North
America (Canada and Mexico) and Europe (Latvia, Norway, and the
United Kingdom). Influenza A(H1) viruses predominated in Argentina
and also were reported from Brazil, Chile, French Guiana, Iceland,
New Zealand, Peru, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United
Kingdom, and Uruguay. In Africa, influenza B viruses were reported in
May (Morocco) and July (South Africa). A small number of influenza B
viruses were identified in Asia (Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Japan, and
Thailand), South America (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay), and
Australia. During May, influenza B viruses were reported in Canada,
Latvia, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

Characterization of Influenza Virus Isolates
--------------------------------------------
WHO's Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
Control of Influenza located at CDC analyzes influenza virus isolates
received from laboratories worldwide. Of 91 influenza A(H1) viruses
(84 from Latin America, five from the United States, one from Africa,
and one from Oceania) collected during May to September and
characterized antigenically at CDC, all were similar to A/New
Caledonia/20/99, the H1N1 component of the 2003/04 influenza vaccine.
Of the 254 influenza A(H3N2) viruses (172 from Latin America, 49 from
Asia, 28 from North America [including 22 from the United States], 4
from Africa, and one from Oceania) that were characterized
antigenically, 178 (70.1 percent) were similar to A/ Panama/2007/99,
the H3N2 component of the 2003/04 influenza vaccine, and 76 (29.9
percent) had reduced titers to A/Panama/2007/99.
Influenza B viruses circulating worldwide can be divided into 2
antigenically distinct lineages represented by B/Yamagata/16/88 and
B/Victoria/2/87. Before 1991, B/Victoria lineage viruses circulated
worldwide, but from late 1991 to early 2001, no viruses of the
B/Victoria lineage were identified outside Asia. However, since March
2001, B/Victoria-lineage viruses have been identified in many
countries outside Asia, including the United States. Viruses of the
B/Yamagata lineage began circulating worldwide in 1990 and continue
to be identified. The B component of the 2003/04 influenza vaccine
belongs to the B/Victoria lineage. Of the 4 influenza B isolates
collected during May to September and characterized antigenically at
CDC, 2 belonged to the B/Victoria lineage and 2 to the B/Yamagata
lineage. Both B/Victoria-lineage viruses were similar to B/Hong
Kong/330/01, the B component of the 2003/04 influenza vaccine, and
both were from North America (including one from the United States).
Of the 2 B/Yamagata-lineage viruses, one was from the United States,
and one was from Asia.

MMWR Editorial Note
--------------------
During the period May to September 2003, influenza A(H3N2) viruses
were the most frequently reported influenza virus type/subtype
worldwide, but influenza A(H1) and B viruses also circulated. The
influenza virus type/subtype that will predominate and the severity
of influenza-related disease activity for the 2003/04 influenza
season cannot be predicted.
Influenza vaccine is recommended for persons at high risk for
experiencing influenza-related complications (e.g., persons aged >65
years and persons aged 6 months to 64 years with certain medical
conditions), health-care workers, and household contacts of persons
at high risk (1). Influenza vaccine also is recommended for persons
aged 50 to 64 years because they have an elevated prevalence of
certain chronic medical conditions. Because young, healthy children
are at increased risk for influenza-related hospitalization,
vaccination of children aged 6 to 23 months and household contacts
and care-givers of children aged <23 months is encouraged when
feasible. In addition to the groups for whom influenza vaccination is
recommended, influenza vaccine can be administered to anyone who
wants to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza.
Because vaccine supplies for 2003 are expected to be plentiful, no
staggering of vaccination is recommended. The optimal time for
influenza vaccination is during October to November. Influenza
vaccine manufacturers have indicated that production and distribution
of influenza vaccine for the 2003/04 season is proceeding on
schedule, allowing for sufficient supply of influenza vaccine during
October to November (3). Therefore, influenza vaccination can proceed
for all persons, whether healthy or at high risk, either individually
or through mass campaigns, as soon as vaccine is available.
In June 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved live,
attenuated influenza vaccine for use among healthy persons aged 5 to
49 years. This vaccine is administered intranasally rather than by
intramuscular injection and offers another option for the prevention
of influenza among the approved groups, including health-care workers
and close contacts of persons at high risk. The Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices has published supplementary recommendations
for the use of this vaccine (4).
