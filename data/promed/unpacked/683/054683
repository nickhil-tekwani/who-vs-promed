Bluetongue disease was transported to a sheep flock at Peterborough
from a farm in central Norfolk, it emerged last night [18 Oct 2007].

Animal health officials are now checking when the ram became infected
by the midge-borne disease. "We have traced the disease that has
grown in Peterborough and Ashford to movements of livestock rather
than blown-in midges from the continent," said farming minister Lord
(Jeff) Rooker. [An additional possible route of BTV-8 transmission to
be considered is by windborne local, not necessarily "continental"
culicoides. - Mod.AS]

A senior Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural
Affairs) official has also confirmed that livestock on Norfolk farms
are likely to have been infected by the midges over the past 2 months.

Scientists are working on the theory that a plume brought the midges
over the North Sea on or about 4 or 5 Aug 2007, which came up the
Orwell estuary and then effectively came up the A140 towards the
centre of Norfolk. ["Up the A140" may sound like an indication that
BTV-8 is spreading by means of animal transportation. Though this is
not excluded, the spread of the disease in the UK, similarly to its
amazingly rapid spread in NW Europe, should be rather related to the
presence of an efficient insect vector, which is windborne. - Mod.AS]

This explains why virtually the whole of Norfolk was designated
within the extensive control zone once the bluetongue outbreak had
been declared on 28 Sep 2007 -- stretching almost 75 miles [120 km]
from the source of the 1st cases at Baylham, near Ipswich.

Former Norfolk farmers' leader William Brigham, [who] was briefed by
Defra's head of exotic diseases, Sarah Church, said that it seems the
ram was moved legally from Norfolk to Fitzwilliam Farms' Milton Park
sheep flock, near Peterborough [It is not clear if the ram showed
clinical symptoms or was tested for other reasons. Only if the
recently transported ram is the only positive animal in the
Peterborough farm, could it be suspected to be the virus spreader. -
Mod.AS]

Mr Brigham said, "The assumption they're working on is that the whole
of Norfolk has possibly got bluetongue. In other words any animal
moving out of the control zone is potentially a bluetongue carrier."

He said that Defra was determined to contain the spread of the virus,
which can only spread between susceptible species -- cattle, sheep,
goats, and deer -- by an infected midge.

Now, 45 cases of bluetongue have been confirmed including the 1st
outside Suffolk and Essex with the cases at Peterborough and Ashford,
Kent. [The total number has already risen to 47; see 2].

Mr Brigham, of Lyng, near Dereham, who is chairman of the National
Farmers' Union's regional dairy board, said that Defra's main control
strategy was based on development of a vaccine. He said that three
companies including Merial were involved with the aim of starting
vaccination, once clearance has been obtained, by summer 2008.

It might cost between 30p and 40p (USD .62-.82) but cattle might
require a double dose, said Mr Brigham. "The vaccine has been
produced but obviously only in small batches," he added.

He also said that the livestock industry had to recognise that
virtually the entire country was caught up by bluetongue
restrictions. "We are trying within the NFU (National Farmers' Union)
to get the rest of the country to face up to the fact that the whole
of England and Wales needs to become a protection zone."

As far as the zone is concerned, Defra has thrown the ball right into
the NFU's court. "They've said: If you want the whole of England and
Wales as one zone, we'll do it but you've got to ask for it," said Mr
Brigham. He also said that the 20 km (12.4 mi) radius control zone is
likely to be extended to link Peterborough with the existing zones in
Norfolk and Suffolk. [See [2], including commentary. - Mod.AS]

[2] UK - official update
Date: Fri 19 Oct 2007

Affairs), Animal health and welfare, Bluetongue [edited]
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/latest/index.htm>


Since 22 Sep 2007, laboratory tests have detected the presence of
bluetongue in a number of animals on several different premises in
South East England. Initially, infected animals were culled. Defra
confirmed on 28 Sep 2007 the circulation of bluetongue disease
between the local animal and midge population in East Anglia.
Following this confirmation, no further culls have been undertaken
for disease control purposes. The disease has since been confirmed in
other parts of southeast England. Control and Protection Zones have
been established and are extended when necessary.

From midnight on Sun 14 Oct 2007 markets within the Bluetongue
Control and Protection Zones have been permitted. Markets may operate
as usual within these Zones provided the animals stay within the
Zones after sale unless they are going to slaughter at approved
slaughterhouses. Markets will remain closed in those parts of the
Bluetongue Protection Zone that are also in a Foot and Mouth Disease
Zone.

As at 5.00 pm on 19 Oct 2007 there were 47 confirmed premises
affected by bluetongue.

[The BTV-8 virus, initially detected in East Anglia (Control zone A),
has since spread southwards into Kent and East Sussex (Control zone
C, "the Kent-Sussex control zone"), as well as westwards into
Peterborough, leading to the inclusion parts of Cambridgeshire,
Northamptonshire, and Lincolnshire in another control zone (Control
zone B: "the Peterborough control zone"). See map, updated 19 Oct

It was confirmed that Italy has its 1st case of BT virus 8 strain in
the Parma region.

[A confirmation -- or, hopefully, denial -- from Italy will be
appreciated. If confirmed, the route of introduction will deserve
investigation.

Parma, in the north-Italian region Emilia-Romagna, which is separated
from Switzerland by Lombardy on its north (see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg>), is the
seat of EU's Food safety Authority (EFSA) headquarters. Could the
information above be an erroneous media interpretation of an
EFSA-derived publication on bluetongue?!

According to the last (19 Oct 2007) update of the EU map ("Overview
of the restriction zones, per bluetongue serotype, that have been put
in place by the EU Member States"), the entire territory of Italy's
northern neighbour, Switzerland, has been declared a restriction
zone. However, so far no BT disease or infection has been reported
from Switzerland, which maintains active surveillance. Likewise, no
such reports have been forthcoming from other countries/regions
bordering northern Italy (south east France, Austria, Slovenia). For
the above-mentioned map, see
