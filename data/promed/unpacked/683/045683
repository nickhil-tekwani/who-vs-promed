Worcestershire Regulatory Services technicians have written to Wychavon District Council asking for applicant Trustees of the Wimbush Droitwich Settlement to include anthrax in their chemical analysis of the land east of Kidderminster Road in Hampton Lovett.

Anthrax, a severe illness caused by the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium, is most common in farm animals like cows, sheep, and goats. But the bacteria can live for years in soil and several local residents believe diseased livestock was buried on the proposed development site during the 1960s. The animals were believed to be buried between the Doverdale Park Homes site and the Droitwich to Snow Hill railway line and a local resident says she can remember it. She said: "I have a childhood memory of an anthrax burial pit which I always thought was on that land between the railway and the mobile home park. This memory is hazy and possibly incorrect but needs confirming one way or another." Another objector also believes diseased cattle were buried on the field.

In a letter to the district council, Neil Kirby, Worcestershire Regulatory Services technician, said: "Given that the location of the alleged burial is unknown, the sampling regime should cover the whole site and not confined to areas where contamination is suspected. The anthrax spore can lay dormant for years in soil so there are health and safety implications, if animal remains are found the Local Authority should be notified immediately."

The proposals, which should be determined before [7 Nov 2017], have received dozens of objections and a petition against the scheme has raised more than 155 signatures. Many residents as well as Hampton Lovett parish council also fear the plans would increase the population of the village by 60 per cent leading to a strain on local services. They say it would also cause traffic congestion and pose a flood risk near the Kidderminster Road.

[CEE, who conducted a traffic survey during the summer holidays, counted more than 800 vehicles in less than 2 hours. She said: "It's a dangerous road as it is with many cars travelling at speeds well over the limit. With so many more cars coming onto the road, somebody could get hurt."

A spokesman for Wychavon District Council said: "We have received a letter from Worcestershire Regulatory Services with regard to the application for land east of Kidderminster Road in Hampton Lovett, and its recommendations will be taken into consideration as part of the ongoing planning process for this application."

The developer was unavailable for comment.

[This is a recurring concern in the UK though in effect livestock anthrax is all but eradicated. And such concerns are not unusually paired with others of a more urgent perception, in this case traffic congestion.

To find an old and forgotten cattle grave, walk the field looking for an area say 3 m x 2-4 m (about 10 x 6.5-13 ft), more or less, that is sunken by maybe 20 to 30 cms (about 8-12 in). When the carcasses were buried they would have been bloated. When they decompose the earth column above them collapses to produce this slightly sunken place. A good time to search is just after a rain storm when it will have collected rain, making it stand out from the rest of the field. Take soil samples on 2 transects across this place.

The optimum method for recovering _B. anthracis_ from soil is Antonio Fasanella's GABRI method, which I saw used in relation to clay soils we collected in 8 farm compounds in Bangladesh in 2010 from places where cattle had been slaughtered and butchered 3 months before, and that had since been walked over daily by cattle, goats, people, dogs, and chickens. See Fasanella A, Di Taranto P, Garofolo G, et al. 2013. Ground anthrax bacillus refined isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination. BMC Microbiology 2013; 13:167. doi:10.1186/1471-2180-13-167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728113/. Try it. You will not be disappointed.

Before the last English outbreak in 2015 there was an outbreak in 2006 that involved 5 or 6 bovine deaths (accounts vary), 2 laboratory confirmed, on a farm in Rhonnda Cynon Taff, South Wales; 7 cows had died of anthrax on this farm in 1971. OIE Handistatus II reported a single outbreak in the UK in 2002, but with no other details, but subsequently noted as "10/2002," presumably in October 2002. ProMED reported a suspect case in Scotland in December of that year (2002) which was not confirmed. Otherwise the disease essentially stopped in 1997, benefiting from the controls implemented to stop "mad cow" disease.

If the remembered previous outbreak was in the 1960s, at that time, and from personal experience with outbreaks in the UK (granted in 1972 in Hampshire), the carcasses were efficiently and promptly burned using butane torches. Still, no harm in looking and watching for any bones that might get dug up by the developers. - Mod.MHJ
