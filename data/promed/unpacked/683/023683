A virus making horses ill in Colorado has been found in 11 counties; Larimer County is the hardest-hit area, with 70 confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis [VSV].

Other counties are Adams, Archuleta, Boulder, Broomfield, Delta, La Plata, Mesa, Montezuma, Morgan and Weld, according to a Colorado Department of Agriculture news release.

Vesicular stomatitis can make eating and drinking painful for the horses, and they and other affected animals are quarantined. One bovine case in Boulder County has been confirmed.

"We understand that the VSV outbreak and quarantines are impacting the ability for people to bring their horses and livestock to fairs and shows," said Dr. Keith Roehr, Colorado State veterinarian, in the release. "The quarantines and hold orders must be followed, however, for the health and protection of all equine and livestock in Colorado."

Boulder County has logged 40 confirmed cases, and Weld County 29 cases, state officials said. The other counties had lower numbers as of Friday [26 Jul 2019].

The 1st case of vesicular stomatitis in Colorado this year [2019] was reported 3 Jul 2019 in Weld County. There are no USDA-approved vaccines for the virus, which likely is spread by insects.

The viral disease primarily affects horses and cattle, but swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas can become ill as well. Black flies, sand flies and biting midges likely transmit the disease.

Humans may become infected when handling affected animals, but it's rare, the news release said.

[Vesicular stomatitis does not appear every year. This is also the 1st time in many years we have the Indiana strain in circulation. In several previous outbreaks, it has been the New Jersey strain.

Vesicular stomatitis causes a bit of a stir because in addition to horses, it can affect cattle. The vesicles caused by this virus resemble the vesicles of food-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has been successfully eradicated from the USA.

Most articles mention control of biting flies and mosquitoes, but it is worth noting that some research indicates that bats may play a role in this disease as well (see ProMED-mail Vesicular stomatitis: possible vector 20190715.6569128). - Mod.TG
