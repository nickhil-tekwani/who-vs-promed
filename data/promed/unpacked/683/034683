[Kangwon-do province is located in the south east of North Korea. To view the geographic spread of the virus since early 2014, see map at the bottom of OIE's accumulated report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015073_20140403_180529.pdf.

The information "no vaccination" is in need of clarification. According to North Korea's last available periodic report to the OIE, covering the period January to June 2013, FMD vaccination is included among the control measures applied in cattle, swine, sheep and goats (see at http://tinyurl.com/q3fbtkk). Information on the vaccine strain(s) applied would be helpful.

The continuous circulation of the virus, affecting both swine and cattle, underlines the need for early submission of samples to an international FMD reference laboratory for confirmation of the serotyping and for genotyping. - Mod.AS
