Provincial veterinary office records one death due to rabies
------------------------------------------------------------
One death due to rabies was recorded on 12 Mar 2011 at Barangay
Bagawines, Vallehermoso. Provincial rabies coordinator Mardonio Nadela
said the male victim was bitten by a suspected rabid dog, which later
barangay [village] residents slaughtered for a meal with alcoholic
drinks. Thus, the dog's head has not been examined to determine if the
animal really had rabies. However, about 50 people believed
[potentially] to have been exposed to rabies were given anti-rabies
vaccination after the incident.

For the 1st quarter of this year [2011], the provincial veterinarian
office (PVO) has recorded 3 positive animal rabies cases in Barangays
Pandanon and Dahili, Mabinay and Batinguel, Dumaguete City. Of the
total 46 dog heads examined in PVO's rabies laboratory in the last 3
months, 10 tested positive for rabies, including 7 from Cebu province.
Nadela said dog heads from Cebu had been submitted to Negros Oriental
Rabies Lab for examination since [the Cebu] bite center was
out-of-order.

Under its rabies eradication program, PVO has vaccinated 5199 dogs
during January and February of this year. In the region, Cebu has the
highest incidence of animal rabies cases whereas Central Visayas is
one of the top 5 nationwide in the number of animal rabies cases, it
was noted.

[Eating dog meat is common in many Asian countries, but research has
revealed rabies infection as a potentially lethal risk associated with
preparing dog meat. In research published in PLoS Medicine [17 Mar
2009] Dr Heiman Wertheim and colleagues from the National Institute of
Infectious and Tropical Diseases and the National Institute of Hygiene
and Epidemiology in Hanoi, Viet Nam, described 2 patients admitted to
hospital showing signs of rabies infection. Neither patient was
thought to have been bitten by a rabid animal in the preceding months
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656546/.

When the researchers investigated whether the patients had come into
contact with infected animals in the preceding months, they found that
both had been involved in preparing and eating animals that may have
been infected. In the 1st patient's case, he had prepared and eaten a
dog that had been killed in a road traffic accident. The 2nd patient
had butchered and eaten a cat that had been sick for a number of days.
In both cases seen by Dr Wertheim and colleagues, it is thought that
infection occurred during the slaughtering, and not by eating the
meat, as the meal was shared by others who did not become infected.

In Asia, it is believed that eating dog meat enhances health and
longevity. It is eaten throughout the year in the 2nd half of the
lunar month, particularly in the winter months, when it is believed to
increase body heat. In Viet Nam, dogs with rabies have been detected
in dog slaughterhouses and workers at dog slaughterhouses are
vaccinated against rabies as part of the national programme for rabies
control and prevention. However, the private slaughter of dogs is
relatively common in the country.

"We need to alert both the general public and clinicians about the
risks around butchering and handling meat," says Dr Wertheim. "People
should not handle animals that may be infected with rabies."

Hence the Philippine authorities were prudent in providing
post-exposure prophylaxis to all those likely to be involved in
slaughtering the rabid animal and processing the harvested meat.

Negros Oriental. A map and descriptions of the provinces of the
