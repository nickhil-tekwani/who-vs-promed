Cambodia confirms village bird flu outbreak in Cambodia
-----------------------------------------------
Cambodia has confirmed an outbreak of bird flu at a village near the
Vietnamese border.
Authorities say 2 out of 31 poultry samples in Keatha Vong Leu village have
tested positive for the H5N1 virus. So far, 139 chickens and ducks have
been culled.
Meanwhile, an 18-year-old man from the same village suffering bird flu-like
symptoms has tested negative for the virus. The man reportedly killed sick
chickens and ate them.
Health officials are now traveling across 5 villages in Kampot province to
educate villagers about the disease.

[Cambodia's last official report to the OIE (Follow-up report No. 3) on the
occurrence of HPAI was received on 22 Sep 2004. It included data on an
outbreak in a broiler farm in Kean Svay district, Kandal province, where
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was identified (see also 20040922.2616). No
official reports on later outbreaks are available. However, an FAO report
of 16 Feb 2005 included information on an outbreak in a family chicken farm
in Takmao district, Kandal province, about 12 km south of Phnom Penh City.
The H5N1 virus was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh City
(see 20050216.0519).
Another indication on the HPAI situation in Cambodia could be deduced from
Vietnamese-derived information, included in posting 20050322.0832, saying:
"several bird flu outbreaks here have been attributed to human and poultry
smuggling from Cambodia, a country with far less capacity to detect and
fight bird flu."
According to a newswire dated 24 Mar 2005, dealing with the 2nd human case
of avian influenza H5N1 in Cambodia, the Secretary of State at the Ministry
of Agriculture said that "600 chickens had died in 6 villages in Kampot in
the last 20 days, and a further 100 had been culled on Wed 23 Mar 2005,"
and that "results of sampled chickens were expected on 24 Mar 2004"
(20050325.0867). Is the current information related to these outbreaks?
Clearly, there is no room for complacency regarding the HPAI situation in
Cambodia; an official follow-up report is highly in demand. - Mod.AS]
