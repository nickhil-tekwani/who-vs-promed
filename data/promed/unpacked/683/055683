Drug-defying Bug Hits Alaska Natives
----------------------------------------
ANCHORAGE, Alaska: New research from the Alaska Native Medical Center in
Anchorage shows that a bacterium found in many Alaska natives and linked to
stomach cancer and bleeding ulcers is highly resistant to antibiotics.
The bacterium, _Helicobacter pylori_, is prevalent among Alaska natives.
Previous studies found that 30 to 40 percent of adults in the United States
are infected with the bacteria, compared to a rate among Alaska natives
ranging from 60 to 80 percent.
The new research, conducted jointly by the Native Medical Center and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Anchorage, shows that
30 to 50 percent of Alaska natives who are cured of the bug will be
reinfected within 2 years, compared to a 5 percent reinfection rate among
people in the rest of the country.
"We have found that there is quite a bit of resistance to antibiotics,"
said Dr. Frank Sacco, chief of surgery at the Alaska Native Medical Center.
"What we're trying to do is figure out how to treat this."
"It's a problem," said Alan Parkinson, chief of the CDC laboratory in
Anchorage. "The bug is resistant, and we can't use the usual treatments.
So what do you do? We're looking for new antibiotics and trying to develop
strategies to lessen the resistance to the antibiotics."
About 70 to 80 percent of adult natives statewide are infected by the
bacteria, while 60 percent of adult natives in Anchorage harbor the
organism. Not all of those people develop diseases, but about 10 percent
do end up with some sort of problem, Parkinson said.
Studies have linked the bug to bleeding ulcers and scientists suspect it
also contributes to anemia among native youth. Anemia can lead to fatigue,
difficulty concentrating and slower development in children. In a small
percentage of cases, the bacterium is linked to stomach cancer.
While those problems are serious, the new research suggests it may be
better in some cases not to administer antibiotics. The usual treatment is
a combination of common antibiotics. Repeated use of the drugs lessens
their effect within an individual and among the population as a whole,
Parkinson said.
"I think for a long time we thought everyone with the infection should be
treated," Sacco said. "Hopefully, we'll be able to refine that, so maybe
we're just going to treat the patients where we think it can make the
biggest difference; maybe only the patients who develop bleeding ulcers.
We need to get more information."
Sacco and Parkinson stressed that their findings so far are preliminary,
based on clinical studies of 100 Alaska native patients in Anchorage and
laboratory experiments that began in 1995. The next step will be to
compare the rate of infection and reinfection among non-natives in
Anchorage compared to natives.
The Alaska Science and Technology Foundation has awarded a $64 000 grant to
the center to do that work.

[It is not entirely clear whether the term "Alaska native" is used in this
article to refer to indigenous peoples or to persons who have resided in
Alaska for their entire lives. Clarification of this issue would be
helpful, as would more specific information about the pattern of antibiotic
resistance observed. - Mod.ES]
