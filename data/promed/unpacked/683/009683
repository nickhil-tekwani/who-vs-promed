Bird Flu May Infect a Quarter of Indonesia's Domestic Birds
------------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu may have infected a quarter of backyard fowl in some of
Indonesia's most densely populated areas, the country's top
veterinary official said, risking human lives and increasing the
threat of a pandemic. Random tests carried out in areas where the
virus is most prevalent on the island of Java detected the H5N1
influenza strain in as much as 27 percent of fowl and caged birds,
said Director of Animal Health Musny Suatmodjo. He didn't say how
many birds were tested or when the survey was done. Contact with
infected birds risks spreading the disease to humans. The prevalence
of H5N1 among Indonesia's 300 million poultry helps explain why the
country accounts for 1-in-3 human deaths from the disease worldwide
since 2003. The infection creates chances for H5N1 to mutate into a
form that spreads easily among people, touching off a global outbreak
that could kill millions.
"The backyard sector is the weakest link'' in controlling the virus,
Suatmodjo said in a 27 Sep [2006] interview in the capital, Jakarta.
"The survey of hotspots in the backyard sector showed almost every
flock has been previously infected,'' though not all birds show
symptoms of the disease, he said.
The past 3 years, H5N1 is known to have infected 251 people in 10
countries, killing 148 of them, the World Health Organization said
yesterday. Almost all human H5N1 cases have been linked to close
contact with sick or dead birds, such as children playing with them
or adults butchering them or plucking feathers, according to the
United Nations agency. Indonesia has reported 68 H5N1 infections
since July last year [2005], according to the WHO. Forty-nine were
recorded this year.
Poultry are raised in the backyards of 80 percent of the country's 55
million households, according to the UN's Children's Fund. About 62
percent of Indonesian poultry are found on Java, where more than
two-thirds of the country's human H5N1 fatalities have occurred. The
virus has been found in fowl in 30 out of 33 provinces in the
archipelago of 18,000 islands, making it difficult for disease
trackers to detect outbreaks. The latest eruption was reported this
month in the eastern province of North Sulawesi. "Wherever teams are
carrying out active surveillance activities, they find the disease
prevalent in poultry,'' said Christine Jost, chief technical adviser
with the Food and Agriculture Organization's avian flu program in
Indonesia. "The disease is endemic in many large islands of Indonesia
like Java, Bali and Sumatra, where there is high prevalence of the
disease and it is a great concern.''
The H5N1 virus spread to the Southeast Asian nation in late 2003,
affecting mostly commercial poultry farms. Disease control measures
and vaccination programs have lowered the rate of infection among
intensive poultry farms, while the virus is circulating freely in
many backyard flocks. In the first 8 months of this year, 1.3 million
fowl died from H5N1 or were culled to stem its spread. That compares
with 1.2 million in 2005, according to the agriculture ministry.
Outbreaks last year may have been under-reported, it said.
Suatmodjo estimates that 10 percent of backyard poultry are
vaccinated to prevent the disease. The agriculture ministry plans to
introduce regulations next month requiring fowl be kept in coops,
rather than being allowed to roam freely. "They are more exposed to
virus if they aren't cooped,'' Suatmodjo said. "Today they can be
negative, tomorrow they can be positive because
infection in fowl spreads easily.''
Vaccinating and confining backyard poultry will work to stem the
virus, said the FAO's Jost. The UN agency recommends people raising
backyard poultry be encouraged to build night housing for their
poultry. "It is of low cost, easy to maintain and is feasible to
carry out interventions like vaccination when necessary,'' Jost said.
A preventive vaccine campaign would require 1.2 billion doses of
vaccines a year just for backyard chickens in Indonesia, she said.
Given the country's "limited resources,'' the UN agency is
"encouraging stakeholders to target resources'' at areas that would
have the greatest chance of controlling the disease, she said.
"Vaccination would have the highest impact in controlling the disease.''
The agriculture ministry will need 90 million doses of avian flu
vaccine next year to immunize backyard chickens, particularly in
areas where the virus is most prevalent. Government funds may allow
the ministry to buy as many as 60 million of doses for next year,
Suatmodjo said.
