At least 41 people who were exposed to bats at West High School are now undergoing rabies treatment, as of [Wed 27 Sep 2017], according to the Salt Lake County Health Department.

Health officials said anyone potentially exposed to rabies (which is transmitted through the saliva or brain/nervous system tissue of an infected animal) should receive the treatment.

The health department said once a person starts showing signs of rabies, the disease is almost always fatal.

The treatment, rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), consists of a regimen of 5 shots: one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period, the health department said.

Officials said current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm, like a flu or tetanus vaccine.

The Salt Lake County Health Department said rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure.

Additional doses of the rabies vaccine should be given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the 1st vaccination, officials said.

To date, fewer than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported.

The school district said West High School sits along a migratory path for the bats and that sightings are not unusual at the school.

Health officials said, if you've touched a bat, don't be afraid to tell someone.

All species of bats are protected and some species have Federal Protection under the Endangered Species Act.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, and is almost always fatal, unless treated. - Mod.PMB]
