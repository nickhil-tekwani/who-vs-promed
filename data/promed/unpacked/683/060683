[Ref: F Aliaga et al (2018): First report of a '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris' isolate associated with banana elephantiasis disease in Colombia. New Disease Reports 37, 12; DOI: 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2018.037.012]
----------------------------------------------
[In] Colombia, banana is severely affected by elephantiasis disease (BED), first reported in 1911 in Suriname. BED has significantly lowered both yield and commercial value of the cultivars 'Gros Michel' (AAA) and 'Dominico Harton' (AAB). Yield reductions of 9 to 71.6 per cent have been reported in the Department of Valle del Cauca during 2016 and 2017.

BED causes an overgrowth of the pseudostem-rhizome junction generating longitudinal and transverse ruptures that lead to the collapse of the whole plant. The banana suckers exhibit necrotic tips which limit the plant's development, the petioles remain rigid with a bunchy appearance, fruit size is reduced and finally, the rhizome develops conically.

Total DNA from rhizomes of 16 symptom-bearing and four symptomless plants of cv. 'Gros Michel' were [assayed] in conventional and quantitative PCR for phytoplasmas. DNA [of] an isolate of group 16SrIII, '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma pruni' obtained from roots [of] cassava plants infected with the frog skin phytoplasma were used as a positive control. In vitro banana plants were used as negative controls.

Nested and qPCR amplicons were obtained for all the 16 symptom-bearing samples but not from the symptomless plants. Two consensus sequences were produced. The BED phytoplasma 16S rDNA sequences showed 99 per cent identity with phytoplasmas of group 16SrI '_Ca._ P. asteris'. Phylogenetic analysis supported the grouping of the BED phytoplasma within the 16SrI cluster. In silico restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis [also] yielded profiles identical to members of phytoplasma group 16SrI.

'_Ca._ P. asteris' is found in several tree host species in Colombia [e.g. see ProMED-mail post 20131115.2056292] and represents a potential threat to other plant species, in addition to the potential for BED to emerge as an important disease. This is the first report of a '_Ca._ P. asteris' associated with BED in banana in Colombia.

[When elephantiasis (also called giant foot or Suriname disease) of banana and plantain was 1st described in 1911 (see link below), phytoplasmas were not yet known and the disease was suspected to be due to a fungus.

The aster yellows phytoplasma group (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris [_Ca._ P.a.], 16SrI taxonomic group) is one of the most diverse phytoplasma groups known. Members cause or are involved in a large number of serious crop diseases and can infect over 300 host species. Their host range includes a wide variety of dicot crops such as cassava (witches broom), oilseed rape, potato (purple top), grapevine, lucerne and some vegetables, as well as a number of monocot crops, such as maize (bushy stunt); 16SrI coinfections with other phytoplasmas have been reported as causes of both Al-Wijam disease of date palm (ProMED-mail posts 20070514.1536, 20110519.1512) and yellowing diseases of coconut and other palms in Malaysia (see link below).

Ornamentals and weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs. The pathogens can overwinter in the living crowns of perennials and are transmitted by grafting or contaminated tools, but not in soil or by seed. The main vectors appear to be the aster leafhopper (_Macrosteles quadrilineatus_) and related species. Insects remain infectious for life. The pathogens may be present in host species at very low levels; however, the level can increase under favourable conditions resulting in an outbreak with potential crop losses. Disease management in field crops may include vector control and removal of weeds serving as pathogen and/or vector reservoirs. For vegetatively propagated and woody hosts, clean planting and/or grafting material and good plant hygiene practices are most important.

In Colombia, a 16SrI-B phytoplasma was reported earlier to be associated with a lethal wilt of oil palm (ProMED-mail post 20131115.2056292). It is not clear whether the relationship between the oil palm and banana strains has been investigated.

The 16SrIII phytoplasma used as control in the report above has been shown to be associated with frog skin disease of cassava in Colombia and elsewhere in South America (ProMED-mail posts 20071130.3864 & 20011229.3129).

The majority of today's cultivated bananas are related to either _Musa acuminata_ (A) and/or _M. balbisiana_ (B), with the specific genetic background of a banana variety indicated by the letters A or B (see links below).
