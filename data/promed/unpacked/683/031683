India (Uttar Pradesh): 25 new polio cases reported
-----------------------------------------------
25 new cases of polio in a week have been announced from the country's
north, one day ahead of the launch of an emergency vaccination drive for
120 million children. The new numbers take the regional tally to 438 and
were reported from the worst-hit Uttar Pradesh state, which has registered
more than a quarter of the world total. "Health officials will launch an
extensive door-to-door campaign to vaccinate 50 million children below 5
years of age in the state as polio virus has spread to new districts," A.K.
Mishra, the state's top health official, said.
The polio outbreak in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state, has
raised fears that the disease could spread abroad from India if the
outbreak is not rapidly brought under control. The disease is caused by a
virus which affects the nervous system and is transmitted through feces. It
can paralyze a child for life within hours.
In a separate tally, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, spearheaded
by the Geneva-based World Health Organization, put the nationwide number at
490 as of Wednesday [8 Nov 2006], more than 10 times the number of cases in
the same period last year [2005].
Federal health workers, along with the United Nations Children's Fund and
the World Health Organization, were due to vaccinate more than 120 million
children nationwide over 3 days beginning tomorrow [Sun 12 Nov 2006].

India: outbreak on decline at epicenter, campaigns to minimize further spread
-----------------------------------------------
The polio outbreak this year [2006] that spread into polio-free parts of
India appears to have peaked in its original epicenter in western Uttar
Pradesh. The red line in the graph [please go the web link shown above to
see the graph] shows cases rising in Moradabad and JP Nagar districts of
the state, the start of the outbreak. The successive color lines show the
poliovirus moving beyond this epicenter to a gradually expanding area. In
the 1st wave of affected areas (defined by the red, green and blue lines),
cases have started to fall, evidence that the origins of the outbreak are
slowing, while its effects continue to rise in the final wave of affected
areas, delineated in pink.
Supplementary immunization campaigns take place the week of 12 Nov [2006]
and have been expanded to nearly half the country in response to the
outbreak, covering affected districts, neighboring districts and states
considered at high risk. This outbreak has seen India's cases rise 10-fold
over the same period in 2005 and has dealt a serious blow to India's
remarkable progress in 2005. Eradication is within India's grasp: every
district in the country has been polio-free at some point in time. With
sustained immunization campaigns that reach all vulnerable children, India
can achieve this status in all districts at the same time.

Following pre-notification last week, the type 3 case from northern
Cameroon (bordering Borno state in northeastern Nigeria) has now been
officially reported.
The case investigation is ongoing. The child has family both in Cameroon
and Nigeria. It is unclear whether the onset of paralysis occurred in
Nigeria or in Cameroon. The child had recently arrived in Cameroon with his
family from Nigeria.
An emergency immunization response is currently being planned by the
government of Cameroon. While finalized dates are not yet confirmed, the
immunization response will likely be conducted in the next 4 weeks.

[With respect to the ongoing polio activity in India, according to the
Southeast Asian Regional Office (SEARO) of WHO, as of today, 13 Nov 2006,
there were 32 new polio cases reported in India during this past week
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section1226.asp>,
bringing the 2006 case total to 522, as compared with a total of 66 cases
reported for 2005 and 134 cases reported for 2004. The most recent date of
onset of a polio case with a wild polio virus isolated was 7 Oct 2006.
Information on the dates of onset of these 32 new cases reported this past
week was not available, so one is unable to tell whether the dates of onset
were more recent than 7 Oct 2006. Clearly, there has been a significant
outbreak in India this year [2006]. In our last posting on this outbreak
(on 3 Oct 2006), there had been 312 cases reported, so in the intervening 6
weeks, there have been an additional 210 cases reported.
With respect to the reported case of type 3 polio from Cameroon, it is as
yet unclear what is the origin of this virus (Nigeria vs. Cameroon), and we
await the results of genetic testing on the isolate as well as the full
investigation to understand more the epidemiology of this case. According
to the polio eradication website, type 3 poliovirus has been identified in
Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon during 2006, with
dates of onset in Cameroon 22 Aug 2006 and in Nigeria 18 Sep 2006 (most
recent case). One suspects that the case in Cameroon is related to
poliovirus transmission in Nigeria, but until more information is
available, this is a supposition and not confirmed. - Mod.MPP]
