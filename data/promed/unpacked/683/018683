The deaths of more than 700 ring neck pheasants from botulism, at an Ourimbah [Central Coast region of New South Wales] property, have prompted a warning from biosecurity experts to report unusual signs and behaviour in domestic poultry.

Greater Sydney Local Land Services District Veterinarian, Dr Aziz Chowdhury, said botulism was a rare condition caused by a toxin found in the environment, often spread by wild birds, rotting carcasses or other contaminated material. "It is characterised in poultry by paralysis of the neck and limbs, and generally impacts multiple birds very quickly," he said. Dr Chowdhury praised the vigilance of the affected landholders, Dermott and Marion Devlin, who reported the deaths immediately.

"The couple reported the sudden mortalities to us immediately, so we were able to carry out the necessary testing and limit the impact on their flock, as well as the risk to neighbouring properties in the area," he said. Dr Chowdhury encouraged other poultry and stock owners to report unusual signs, and sudden deaths immediately. "Time is of the essence when it comes to reporting stock sickness, and we are here to help landholders when it comes to protecting their stock, and potentially their land, from the impact of the disease," he said.

Mr Devlin said they were committed to running a responsible farming operation. "We don't want to impact on other landholders or our agricultural markets by cutting corners," he said. "Dr Chowdhury and his team have been extremely professional and helped us understand what we needed to do to reduce the risk to our other animals, our land and our neighbours."

Botulism is best prevented by removing dead birds daily, removing the source of the toxin, supplying clean feed and water, and preventing wild bird access to the feeder and water, keeping birds away from stagnant or pooled water, and providing feed in containers and not on the ground. Sick birds should be isolated and provided with food and water.

["Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (such as chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots), feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Host
----
- Type C toxin: waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others
- Type E toxin: gulls, loons, and others

Clinical signs/field signs
--------------------------
Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Lesions
-------
There are no specific lesions associated with this disease. Diagnosis of botulism is based on demonstration of the toxin in serum from sick birds, or tissue samples from dead birds such as clotted heart blood, stomach contents, or liver.

Wildlife management significance
--------------------------------
Outbreaks occur from coast to coast in the United States and Canada, generally from July through September. Thousands of birds may die during a single outbreak. Outbreaks also occur in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand, although the time of year may be different in the Southern hemisphere.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin."
