A 26 year old patient from the El Manantial area, Parita neighborhood, is in hospital in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitre with symptoms compatible with [a] hantavirus [infection]. This was announced by Alcibiades Dominguez, regional health director of Herrera province. Dominguez indicated that this patient was hospitalized on 31 Oct [2015] with respiratory deficiency. However, the test for hantaviruses was done today [3 Nov 2015] and was positive, the physician stated.

Dominguez added that a case study done by the Department of Epidemiology and Vectors indicated that the condition of the house of the patient had risk factors, "but they are taking preventive measures to overcome these conditions," he emphasized.

This case brings to 6 the number of cases of this disease in Herrera, with one fatal victim, reported in the Monagrillo neighborhood of the Chitre district. Dominguez stated that, fortunately, in 2015, the number of cases of hantavirus [infections] has declined, as have dengue cases, but asked the community in Herrera to maintain preventive measures by cleaning their properties in order to avoid breeding sites for the rodent carriers around their houses.

[Herrera and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the report above, limited mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in this and previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
