The number of pertussis cases in Minnesota is surging, approaching 700 cases of the highly-contagious respiratory disease, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.

That's more than double the number of cases reported earlier this month [May 2012] and exceeds the total number of cases reported last year [2011].

Pertussis causes an uncontrollable, violent cough. The disease is often referred to as whooping cough because of the sound that many people make as they gasp for breath.

It's a scary and sometimes fatal disease. Infants are most at risk for severe complications including pneumonia, dehydration and seizures. Even adults can have a hard time recovering from the intense cough.

"Sometimes they can cough so hard that they break ribs or break the blood vessels in their eyes," said nurse practitioner Patsy Stinchfield, director of Infectious Disease Services at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.

"They call it the 100-day cough. And it really is true that you can have these cough spasms for up to 100 days," she said.

People who have pertussis are usually infectious for the 1st 3 weeks of their illness. The disease spreads easily during this time, which is why outbreaks are often seen in clusters at the community level.

Minnesota's outbreak is scattered across several counties including Hennepin and Ramsey Counties. Nearby Wright County, just west of the metro area, is also reporting a higher than usual number of cases, with 77 so far. Pertussis clusters are centered mainly in the eastern part of the county around St. Michael, Rockford, Delano and Monticello.

"All of 2010, we had 97 cases for the entire year, and that was a record for us," said Christine Austin-Roehler, health promotion coordinator for Wright County Public Health. "If you look at the fact that we have 77 cases already and the year's not even half over with, it is a lot of cases."

Most children are vaccinated for pertussis before enrolling in school. But the vaccine starts to wear off by adolescence. A booster vaccine has been available for adolescents and adults since 2005, but many people don't get the booster.

The state has had good vaccination rates among adolescents who are due for the booster shot, said Claudia Miller, the vaccine-preventable disease surveillance supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Health. That's because they tend to see their health care providers regularly. But Miller suspects the vaccination rate could be better among adults.

"We don't have a good way to measure our coverage in the adult population, but we're concerned that we're not seeing the coverage that would be necessary to turn this pertussis incidence around," Miller said. "This is a vaccine-preventable disease, and we really should not be seeing hundreds of cases each year if we have good immunization coverage."

Pertussis is a bacterial infection and can be treated with antibiotics. However, the drugs don't do a lot to cure the symptoms, but mainly help reduce the amount of infectious particles a person can pass on to others.

The number of whooping cough cases in Maine is on the rise, mirroring a nationwide trend that health officials attribute in part to children and adults failing to get booster shots every 10 years. Health officials began noticing an increase in whooping cough -- pertussis -- cases in 2011, mainly in Maine's northern counties. This month, May 2012, an outbreak of 8 cases in children was reported in Skowhegan, and Scarborough school officials notified parents of 4 cases in the elementary and middle schools.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 67 cases in 2012, up 34 percent from the 50 cases reported through 17 May 2011. Only 53 cases were reported for all of 2010.

The 67 cases in Maine so far in 2012 include 13 in Cumberland County, 10 in York County and 12 in Somerset County. In 2011, a total of 205 cases were reported in Maine, far exceeding the 53 reported cases in 2010 and the 10-year average of 82 cases per year.

"People thought this disease was gone, and we know it's not," Sears said. He said the most effective way to protect against whooping cough is vaccination. Most children get the initial vaccination, but only 60 percent to 70 percent receive the booster shot around age 11, he said.

Dr. Ali Kopelman of Saco PrimeCare Pediatrics said that in the past year, she has treated 10 children with pertussis, including 3 in the past 3 months. All of the patients were ages 4 to 10 and were up to date on vaccinations.

The Allegheny County Health Department announced this week that a growing number of pertussis cases are being reported in the county. There have been 46 confirmed or probable pertussis cases since the beginning of 2012, well above the average of 7 reported cases in that period over the past several years.

Flathead County health officials are inundated with the onslaught of whooping cough tests. Six new cases have been confirmed in the county, bringing the total to 36. Four of those newly confirmed are in the same class as a child diagnosed on Tue 15 May 2012.

Currently, whooping cough is in 9 schools in the Flathead. County health officials say the labs are packed with cultures waiting to be tested. School administrators we spoke with had plenty of praise for the health department. "The health department has been great. We spoke back and forth probably about 3 or 4 times yesterday [16 May 2012] with them, and they've been full of all kinds of helpful information," said Dr. Ann Mincklers, superintendent of Helena Flats School. "Their directions have been clear and straightforward. We really depend on them, but we've never been through anything like this before, so we appreciate all the help that they've given us."

There are 4 new Helena-area cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, bringing the total to 23 since the end of March 2012, which is significantly higher than 2011 when 11 cases were reported for the entire year.

Officials with the Lewis and Clark County Health Department say it's likely that additional cases have not been diagnosed and issued a news release asking people who are sick to stay home. The persistence of the outbreak has prompted county health officials to also urge all residents, adults and children, to make sure they're up to date on their pertussis vaccinations.

Pertussis is not uncommon, but there has been a spike in infections in 2012. Montana has seen 155 confirmed cases so far in 2011, compared to 54 at this time in 2011. The disease has been reported in 17 counties, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.

Six confirmed cases of pertussis, or "whooping cough," in Yellowstone County have been reported to county health officials. Among them is a Laurel resident.

The Laurel High School (LHS) issued an Alert Now message to parents mid-morning on Fri 11 May 2012, stating: "We have received confirmation from a high school student's family that there is a confirmed case of pertussis in their home. If you have a child with reduced immunities, we encourage you to take precautionary measures including contacting your medical care provider."

The number of children in New Mexico who were exempt from required vaccinations has tripled, as the number of cases of whooping cough reported in the state spiked in recent years, state health officials said.

A recent state report shows the number of exemptions increased 3-fold since 1999 to nearly 3400. Meanwhile, the state's pertussis cases jumped from 85 in 2009 to 274 in 2011, according to state Department of Health data.

New Mexico law allows parents to exempt their children from required vaccinations by claiming a religious or personal belief that forbids vaccinations. The rate of such exemptions was 5.8 per 1000 children in 2011, up from 2 per 1000 in 1999.

About 112 pertussis cases were reported in 2012 through 5 May 2012, according to the Albuquerque Journal.

State health officials remain uncertain what role vaccine exemptions play in outbreaks of preventable diseases such as pertussis, said David Selvage, a state Department of Health epidemiologist. "When you look at cases of pertussis, if you are in an area where there are increased numbers of vaccine exemptions, there's an increased chance that you're going to be in a pertussis cluster," Selvage said. The vaccine "is the best protection we have against pertussis, but it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-to-85 percent effective," Selvage said.

A 2-month-old baby in San Miguel County died in May 2012, making it the 1st pertussis-related death of a New Mexico infant since 2005. Infants 6 months and younger are most vulnerable to whooping cough because they have not received multiple doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Joan Baumbach, the state's medical epidemiologist. Health officials were uncertain how the infant was exposed to pertussis. The baby had received the 1st in a 4-dose series of childhood pertussis vaccinations, the agency said.

Washington State is battling its biggest pertussis outbreak in more than 3 decades, and cuts in local health department budgets are among the factors reported to be complicating the state's response to the epidemic.

Several states have reported pertussis outbreaks in 2012, but Washington's outbreak appears to be the largest. So far this year [2012], 1284 cases have been reported, a nearly 10-fold increase from 2011, according to the most recent update from the Washington State Department of Health (WSDH). On 3 Apr 2012, the state's health secretary, Mary Selecky, announced that the disease had reached epidemic levels. Fueled by concerns about the risks to babies who are too young to be vaccinated, the WSDH urged state residents to verify their vaccination status and launched public service radio announcements.

On 3 May 2012, Washington Governor Chris Gregoire tapped emergency funds to help curb the pertussis epidemic, urged healthcare professionals to get vaccinated and to vaccinate their patients, and announced that the CDC was allowing the state to redirect some funds to buy 27 000 doses of pertussis vaccine for uninsured and underinsured adults.

Rising numbers of cases in Skagit County have placed a burden on the local medical system, and county health officials have asked doctors to stop testing, which can be costly and delay diagnosis and treatment, and instead to use empiric antibiotic treatment on patients with pertussis symptoms, the New York Times reported on 12 May 2012.

Howard Leibrand, MD, health officer for Skagit County, told the Times that the public health department's staff is half the size it was in 2008, thanks to years of budget cutting. Skagit County officials estimate that only one in 5 cases is being reported, which could mean the number of pertussis cases is much higher than official counts indicate.

In an update on national pertussis activity yesterday [13 May 2012], ProMED-mail, the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, highlighted 10 media reports detailing infant deaths or outbreaks since the end of April 2012 from 8 different states. The infant deaths were reported from Massachusetts, Idaho, and Arizona. In addition, the New Mexico Department of Health on 7 May 2012 reported the pertussis death of a 2-month old baby, the state's 1st from the disease since 2005.

Besides staffing issues, health departments working to slow pertussis outbreaks have 2 other notable challenges: under-immunization and signs that the vaccine may not provide protection for as long as previously thought. For example, a 2011 report from the CDC of vaccination coverage in kindergarteners during the 2009-10 school year found that the level of school vaccine exemptions varied by state, with Washington state having the nation's highest level. As a result, Washington legislators last year [2011] tightened vaccine exemption laws, which now require parents to show they have consulted a physician before opting out of immunizations for their children, the Times reported.

However, Thomas Clark, MD, an epidemiologist with the CDC's meningitis and vaccine-preventable disease branch, told the Times that many people sickened in outbreaks in Washington and other states received their childhood vaccinations, but changes in the vaccine in the early 1990s to reduce side effects may have had an impact on how long immunity lasts.

Pertussis outbreaks, especially a 2010 one in California that sickened more than 9100 people and led to the deaths of 10 babies, have prompted actions from the CDC's vaccine advisors. Earlier in 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) streamlined its pertussis vaccine recommendation for adults, advising that anyone over age 19 receive one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) if they haven't received it already. In late 2010, ACIP also adjusted its pertussis vaccine recommendation to shore up a gap in protection in children ages 7 through 9 who haven't received all their recommended pertussis immunizations or whose status isn't known.

The number whooping cough cases in Wisconsin are at levels not seen since 2004. In La Crosse County alone, there have been 33 confirmed cases, 17 in the past week.

"We are concerned; we are watching," said Traci Lien, a public health nurse for the La Crosse County Health Department. The state has 914 confirmed and 542 probable cases so far this year [2012], nearly matching the 1078 confirmed in 2012. La Crosse County gets about 8 cases in an average year.

While Madison County's "spike" in pertussis cases has slowed, health officials are still concerned about the sudden increase in so-called "whooping cough" cases. Another 5 cases of pertussis have been reported to the Madison County Health Department since the 1st 14 cases appeared almost overnight in late April 2012. That makes 19 cases in Madison County just in April and May of 2012, when there were only 16 in all of 2011.

"We are not finding any common links between the cases," Health Department spokeswoman Amy Yaeger said. "They are not all at the same school, barbecue or birthday party."

[The current substantial increase in pertussis cases probably has multiple etiologies, including parental-signed exemptions to the vaccination, overall under-vaccination, and waning immunity of the vaccine protection. The currently used acellular pertussis vaccine, as compared to the previously used whole cell killed vaccine, is much less reactogenic in children and able to be given to adults. However, research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) has been previously highlighted in ProMED-mail reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_ which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. If so, these changes may result in a need for modifications to the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines, and without these modifications, selection and further spread of clones not as protected for by the vaccine will continue to increase.

The following is a discussion regarding pertussis from the CDC web site: http://www.cdc.gov/Features/Pertussis/):

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a very contagious disease caused by a type of bacterium called _Bordetella pertussis_. Among vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is one of the most commonly occurring ones in the USA.

Pertussis vaccine protection
----------------------------
There is high pertussis vaccine coverage for children nationwide. However, protection from the childhood vaccine decreases over time. Preteens, teens and adults need to be revaccinated, even if they were completely vaccinated as children.

Also, pertussis vaccines are very effective but not 100 percent effective. If pertussis is circulating in the community, there is still a chance that a fully vaccinated person can catch this very contagious disease. When you or your child develops a cold that includes a prolonged or severe cough, it may be pertussis. The best way to know is to contact your doctor.

Pertussis symptoms
------------------
Pertussis can cause serious illness in infants, children and adults. The disease starts like the common cold, with runny nose or congestion, sneezing, and maybe mild cough or fever. But after 1-2 weeks, severe coughing can begin.

Unlike the common cold, pertussis can become a series of coughing fits that continues for weeks. Pertussis can cause violent and rapid coughing, over and over, until the air is gone from the lungs and you are forced to inhale with a loud "whooping" sound. In infants, the cough can be minimal or not even there.

When the source of whooping cough was identified, mothers were responsible for 30-40 percent of infant infections. If you are pregnant and have not been previously vaccinated with Tdap (the whooping cough booster shot), talk with your doctor about getting one dose of Tdap, preferably during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester, or immediately after delivery before leaving the hospital or birthing center with your newborn.

Disease complications
---------------------
Pertussis is most severe for babies; more than half of infants younger than one year of age who get the disease must be hospitalized. About one in 5 infants with pertussis get pneumonia (lung infection), and about one in 100 will have convulsions. In rare cases (one in 100), pertussis can be deadly, especially in infants.

How pertussis spreads
---------------------
People with pertussis usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the pertussis bacteria. Many infants who get pertussis are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease.

Pertussis trends
----------------
Reported cases of pertussis vary from year to year and tend to peak every 3-5 years. In 2010, 27 550 cases of pertussis were reported in the USA, and many more cases go unreported. 27 deaths were reported, 25 of these deaths were in children younger than one year old. Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in the number of cases of pertussis, especially among teens (10-19 years of age) and babies younger than 6 months of age. In 2010, an increase in reported cases among 7-10 year olds was seen. This new trend reinforces the need for a routinely recommended booster dose of Tdap at age 11 or 12 years.

Preventing pertussis
--------------------
The best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated. Parents can also help protect infants by keeping them away as much as possible from anyone who has cold symptoms or is coughing.

Vaccine recommendations
-----------------------
For Infants and Children: In the USA, the recommended pertussis vaccine for children is called DTaP. This is a safe and effective combination vaccine that protects children against 3 diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. For maximum protection against pertussis, children need 5 DTaP shots. The 3 shots are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The 4th shot is given at 15 through 18 months of age, and a 5th shot is given when a child enters school, at 4 through 6 years of age. If a 7-10 year old is not up-to-date with DTaP vaccines, a dose of Tdap should be given before the 11-12 year old check up.

For Preteens and Teens: Vaccine protection for pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria can decrease with time. Preteens going to the doctor for their regular check-up at age 11 or 12 years should get a booster vaccine, called Tdap. Teens and young adults who didn't get a booster of Tdap as a preteen should get one dose when they visit their health care provider.

For Pregnant Women: Pregnant women who have not been previously vaccinated with Tdap should get one dose of Tdap during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester, or immediately postpartum, before leaving the hospital or birthing center. By getting Tdap during pregnancy, maternal pertussis antibodies transfer to the newborn, likely providing protection against pertussis in early life, before the baby starts getting DTaP vaccines. Tdap will also protect the mother at time of delivery, making her less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant.

For Adults: Adults who didn't get Tdap as a preteen or teen should get one dose of Tdap. Getting vaccinated with Tdap at least 2 weeks before coming into close contact with an infant is especially important for families with, and caregivers of, new infants. Adults 65 years and older who have close contact with infants should also get a dose of Tdap if they never have before.

The easiest thing for adults to do is to get Tdap instead of their next regular tetanus booster as the Td shot that is recommended for adults every 10 years. The dose of Tdap can be given earlier than the 10-year mark, so it's a good idea for adults to talk to a health care provider about what's best for their specific situation. - Mod.LL
