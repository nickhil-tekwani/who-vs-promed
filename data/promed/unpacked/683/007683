[In the past 48 hours, there have been 5 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported and 5 new fatalities, bringing the total number of cases reported from Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 1178, including 507 deaths. Three of the 5 newly confirmed cases were from Riyadh, one was from Hail, and one was from Najran. Two of the 3 cases from Riyadh gave a history of contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and the 3rd case had a history of possible contact with other case(s), which was under review. Of note is that the newly reported case from Hail gave a history of contact with other known case(s), but the report does not specify where.

The province of Hail is located to the north of Riyadh (see map of Saudi Arabia at source URL for report on the case). Also noteworthy is that this is the 3rd case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Najran in the past 30 days, with cases reported on 4, 16 and 29 Aug 2015, with the 2 previously reported cases occurring in healthcare workers.

Since the beginning of August 2015, there have been a total of 121 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed by Saudi Arabia, of which all but 7 were reported in Riyadh (114 total).

Cautiously stated, it appears as though transmission in Riyadh may be slowing down, albeit it is too early to declare the outbreak is over.

The locations of the cases can be found on maps at the source URLs.
