Manoj Murhekar, Jeromie Wesley, Vivian Thangaraj, Mahima Mittal, Nivedita Gupta. Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India: Changing Etiological Understanding.

Abstract
Seasonal outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with high case fatality have been occurring in Gorakhpur division in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, for more than 3 decades. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounted for less than 10 percent of AES cases, while the etiology of the remaining cases remained largely unknown. Investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks indicated _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (Haruo Hayashi 1920) (Norio Ogata 1929) Tamura et al. 1995 (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) as the etiology in about 60 percent of AES cases. Hospital-based surveillance studies indicated that about 1/5th of the patients with acute febrile illness [AFI] were due to scrub typhus. Further studies are required to identify the etiology of about 1/3rd of AES cases that test negative for scrub typhus, JEV, or dengue.

Conclusions and way forward
The evidence available since 2014 indicates _O. tustsugamushi_ as the leading etiology of AES cases, accounting for over 60 percent of AES cases. In contrast, during this period, JEV accounted for only about 10 percent AES cases. The key strategies for AES control in the region needs to include 1) reducing incidence by maintaining high coverage of JEV vaccine as well as removing the misconception of vaccinators about simultaneous administration of vaccines, 2) administering doxycycline/Azithromycin to suspected scrub typhus patients attending peripheral health facilities, thereby preventing the progression of AFI to AES, and 3) reducing mortality by administering Azithromycin to all hospitalized AES patients. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has initiated several studies in the region to understand the epidemiology of scrub typhus. These include 1) entomological studies to characterize mite species present on rodents, 2) serological and molecular studies on rodent sera and mite pools for documenting _O. tsutsugamushi_ infection, 3) surveys to estimate the sero-prevalence of antibodies against _O. tsutsugamushi_ in human population, 4) studies to identify risk factors for acquiring scrub typhus, and 5) studies to identify factors associated with the progression of febrile illness to AES.

[Occurrence of encephalitis cases in northeastern India, and especially in Uttar Pradesh state, has been a significant public health problem for many years. A report cited in an earlier ProMED-mail post (Japanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774) stated that in 2017, there were 4759 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases with 595 deaths. JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81 deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June [2017], covering over 9.1 million children in the age group of 1-15 years.

Although Japanese encephalitis virus is endemic in Uttar Pradesh state and other areas in eastern India, it is frequently shown to be responsible for a minor proportion of encephalitis cases in children, the majority being classified as AES of undetermined etiology.

The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. The above retrospective study indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases. The rationale for posting this published report of retrospective studies is that one hopes that these findings may stimulate prospective studies by ICMR and other scientists as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children is now beginning in northeastern India and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year [2018].
