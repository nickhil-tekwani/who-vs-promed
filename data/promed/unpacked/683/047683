A fox tested positive for rabies after attacking 2 people in Nash County, the Nash County Health Department said.

The fox was found in the area of Hurt Court and South 1st Street. Animal control trapped the fox, then euthanized it.

"Even though you may see an animal during the day, it does not necessarily mean the animal is potentially rabid," Matthew Ingram, Nash County Animal Control Supervisor said in a statement.

Nash County Animal Control says signs of rabies include:

Impairment in balance or coordination
Excessive aggression
Foaming in or around the mouth

To report any wildlife displaying abnormal behavior in Nash County, call 252-459-9855.

[2] Colorado: goat

The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed that a domestic goat in Yuma County with neurologic clinical signs, including sudden aggression, was euthanized and tested positive for rabies on 1 Jun 2020.

This is the 2nd Colorado case of rabies in domestic livestock this year [2020]. In April 2020, a bull in Pueblo County was diagnosed with rabies.

"Livestock owners need to be aware that rabies exposure can happen on their property, especially from rabid skunks that gain entry into barns or animal pens," said State Veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr. "Veterinarians are a valuable resource to help producers decide the best course of action to protect their herds from rabies. Additionally, while house pets are often vaccinated, barn cats or outdoor pets are often forgotten."

Rabies can spread from wild animals such as skunks, bats, raccoons and foxes to other mammals, including domestic pets and livestock. Rabies is a deadly disease, and vaccination is the single best method to protect pets and livestock. One of the greatest risks of exposure to rabies virus for people is through contact with rabid domestic pets or livestock.

"Animal owners concerned about rabies exposure should consult with their veterinarian and be aware of clinical signs to watch for, including dramatic behavioral changes. That is typically one of the hallmark signs that the animal may be suffering from rabies," said Roehr.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment provides statewide rabies surveillance data. Please visit their website for current rabies case information.

Four Fort Collins residents are undergoing rabies [post exposure prophylaxis] treatment after being exposed to the fatal disease by a bat.

The exposure happened Tuesday [2 Jun 2020] in the 8400 block of Golden Eagle Road in southeast Fort Collins, according to the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. Positive [rabies] test results were confirmed Friday [5 Jun 2020], and health department spokesperson Katie O'Donnell said the residents are undergoing [post exposure] treatment.

If treated promptly, the disease is nearly 100% curable. Once clinical symptoms appear, the disease is almost always fatal.

O'Donnell said in a news release that the bat is the 10th animal, and 1st bat, to test positive in Larimer County this year [2020].

Seven skunks, a mountain lion, and coyote are the other animals having tested positive for rabies. The health department does not regularly do surveillance testing for animals because the disease is widespread in the county.

"This is the time of year when we start to see rabies in bats and skunks in Larimer County,'' health department medical director Chris-Nevin Woods said in the release. "It's a good time to remind everyone to not touch wildlife and to make sure that your pets are up to-date on their rabies vaccinations.''

Including the 4 Fort Collins residents, there now have been at least 36 people exposed to rabies in the state this year [2020].

Last year [2019], Larimer County accounted for 55 of the 163 reported animal cases of rabies, including 42 skunks, according to the Larimer health department.

Rabies is spread primarily by saliva through the bite of a rabid animal.

Rabies tips
- Do not feed or touch wildlife.
- If you come into contact with a suspected rabid animal, particularly if you've been bitten or scratched, you should immediately talk with a healthcare or public health professional to determine your risk for rabies or other illnesses.
- Teach children to observe wildlife from a distance and to notify an adult if there is a wild animal in the area or if they are bitten or scratched.
- Eliminate food sources for wild animals by not feeding pets outdoors; by closing pet doors, especially at night; and by tightly closing garbage cans and feed bins.
- Ensure that your pets, horses and livestock are up to date on their rabies vaccinations.

[Livestock as well as small animal pets should be vaccinated against rabies. This disease can affect almost all mammals, including humans, as we encounter the wild as well as the domesticated ones. We can help protect ourselves by vaccinating both large and small animals around us.

We need to build a barrier between this disease and ourselves. One way of building the barrier is to vaccine our animals. Most counties have some type of rabies ordinance requiring pets to be vaccinated. The wise owner will make sure pets and livestock are vaccinated.

Large animals in a rabies frenzy, especially horses and bulls, can transmit rabies but can also trample, maim, and kill people and other animals.

Once exposed, unvaccinated animals, companion animals, or our livestock will be euthanized. Exposed individuals are advised to take post exposure prophylaxis.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities; https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html. - Mod.TG]
