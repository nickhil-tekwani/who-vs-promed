Equine virus fells emus
-----------------------
A deadly virus considered rare in this area has devastated the emu
population on a farm near [Brockville, Ontario, Canada.] But the
area's top public health official says the risk of area residents
contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is very low.

Diana Fletcher-deZeeuw and her husband Ian, owners of Noah's Farm on
Pettem Road, discovered on Thanksgiving Day [13 Oct 2008] that one of
their 28 emus was dead, she said Thursday [30 Oct 2008]. It was a sad
twist to what would have been a pleasant day, but the deZeeuws
figured the bird's death could be attributed to old age. But they
were devastated to discover this 1st "casualty" would not be the last.

"Within the next couple of days, the others all started getting
sick," said Diana Fletcher-deZeeuw. "As soon as they start to show
signs, it's pretty quick," she added. "By then, they're all infected,
so there's not much you can do." By the time the virus had run its
terrible course, only 8 emus were left, she said.

Dr. Jeff Kaufmann, their veterinarian, said he was not sure what he
was dealing with when he did the post-mortem examination on the
birds, so he called a pathologist. That pathologist's report came in
last week, confirming a diagnosis of eastern equine encephalitis,
also known as "Triple-E." As implied by the name, the virus affects
horses, but also a number of other animals.

Emus are much more susceptible to this virus," said Kaufmann. "The
morbidity rate is pretty high." Kaufmann is not sure whether the
virus was spread from emu to emu, but he tends to favor the theory
that they were all bitten by infected mosquitoes.

Triple-E can also spread to humans and has been linked to at least
one person's death in Massachusetts this year. Its profile resembles
that of another virus by now well known in these parts, West Nile
virus (WNV).

Like the latter, Triple-E spreads through mosquitoes that get it by
biting birds, said Dr. Anne Carter, medical officer of health at the
Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit. The symptoms in
humans are similar to those of West Nile, including fever, muscle
weakness, a stiff neck and severe headaches. But Carter stressed the
chances Triple-E has spread to humans in the area is extremely low,
adding anyone bitten by an infected mosquito around the time the
Noah's Farm animals were hit would have shown symptoms by now.

The recent cold weather, meanwhile, has done in the mosquitoes that
could still be transmitting it. Triple-E occasionally makes its way
to eastern Ontario, said Carter, and while there were reports of it
in New York State, the Noah's Farm case is the 1st the health unit
has heard of here.

None of the mosquito pools the health unit tested this year proved
positive for the virus, she added. "It's very seldom a worry in this
area." West Nile [virus] is more likely to show up in the area, added
Carter, and the same precautions taken against that virus will
protect people from Triple-E.

Essentially, during mosquito season, people need to minimize their
exposure to the insects and not allow for environments, such as
standing water, where they [mosquitoes] can breed.

Kaufmann suggests people with animals, especially horses, should take
precautions. "We know it's in eastern Ontario, so people with horses
should be vaccinating for the encephalitises."

Signs in horses include high fever and neurological effects such as
dementia and head-pushing, as well as ataxia, or the loss of control
over bodily movements, said Kaufmann. Unfortunately, the virus is
usually fatal if contracted by horses. People who own horses that
have not been vaccinated should make sure to call their veterinarian
before the next mosquito season, said Kaufmann.

Fletcher-deZeeuw, who has other animals on her farm, has already
vaccinated her donkeys and miniature horse. She hopes to start fresh
with new emu chicks and is thinking of having the surviving birds
vaccinated as well. "It's no picnic to vaccinate an emu," she said.
"They get quite panicked."

[Many birds are often regarded as sentinel animals, and emus are in
this category. People in the southern USA knew this very well.

The reservoir for EEE is passerine birds in North America, where it
does not seem to kill more than perhaps a few nestlings. But adult
exotic birds such as pheasants and emus are very susceptible

Emus are also very sensitive to the cantharidin, the toxic agent in
blister beetles, which like are often found in alfalfa hay. Emus like
the alfalfa leaves.

The sensitivities of emus and horses is similar, and often emus are a
bit more sensitive than horses. - Mod.TG]
