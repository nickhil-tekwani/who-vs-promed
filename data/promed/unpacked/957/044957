We had patient zero; now authorities have another. Just a few months after Hong Kong discovered the world's 1st-known case of a strain of hepatitis E passing from rats to humans, a 2nd such infection has been found.

According to <on.cc>, the 2nd case involves an elderly female patient who was living in Choi Hung, in the same area as the 1st patient but not in the same housing estate. She was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment earlier in 2018 where it was initially thought she was suffering from either rheumatism or an immune deficiency. She was later diagnosed with hepatitis E in May 2018, and was discharged from the hospital.

The University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology, who were following up on the 1st case in September 2018, traced serum samples from patients diagnosed with hepatitis E in the past few years, and found that the female patient's sample matched that of the male from September [2018]. Like the 1st case, doctors believe that the strain contracted by the woman also originated in rats.

The September [2018] case -- which involved a 56 year old male liver transplant patient who lived near a rat-infested refuse room on Choi Wan Estate -- was believed to be the 1st of its kind in the world. It was previously thought that hepatitis E could not jump from rats to humans. No longer.

Siddharth Sridhar, Cyril C.Y. Yip, Shusheng Wu, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus as cause of persistent hepatitis after liver transplant. Emerg Infect Dis. Dec 2018; 24(12)

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans worldwide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, deer, camel, or boar meat (2-6). HEV transmission through blood product transfusion also has been described (7).

The diverse _Hepeviridae_ family, which incorporates all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host species are terrestrial mammals (genus _Orthohepevirus_) and fish (genus _Piscihepevirus_) (8). The _Orthohepevirus_ genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have been reported to infect humans belong to _Orthohepevirus_ A (HEV-A). A total of 5 genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1-4 and -7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).

In addition to HEV-A, the _Orthohepevirus_ genus includes 3 other species: _Orthohepevirus B_ circulates in chickens, _Orthohepevirus C_ (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and _Orthohepevirus D_ in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis E virus, shares only 50%-60% nt [nucleotide] identity with HEV-A (8). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clinical infection have not been reported. The substantial phylogenetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical species barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.

Results
-------
Hepatitis E incidence in transplant recipient cohort
Of 518 patients, 52 (10.2%) had persistent hepatitis (table 1 [For Tables and Figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). A total of 5 (9.6%) patients with hepatitis tested positive for HEV IgM; 4 of these were kidney transplant recipients, and 1 was a liver transplant recipient. Together with reactivation of chronic HBV infection, HEV was the 3rd most common cause of viral hepatitis in the local transplant population. Of the 5 patients, plasma HEV-A qRT-PCR of 3 renal transplant recipients was positive; another renal transplant recipient tested negative for HEV RNA. We have previously reported the clinical details of the 3 HEV-A-infected patients (9). Rat-derived HEV-C infection was diagnosed in the liver transplant recipient, which accounted for 1.9% (1/52) of persistent hepatitis in our cohort.

Patient history
A 56 year old man underwent deceased-donor liver transplant on [14 May 2017], because of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating chronic HBV carriage. He received 1000 mg hydrocortisone and 20 mg basiliximab (anti-interleukin-2 receptor mAb) as intraoperative antirejection prophylaxis and 4 units of platelets (derived from 4 separate blood donors) during the operation. His liver function tests (LFTs) reverted to normal, and he was discharged on posttransplant day 11. He was taking mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisolone as antirejection prophylaxis. He was also taking entecavir for HBV suppression; serum HBsAg was negative 6 weeks after the transplant.

Routine phlebotomy on [12 July 2017] (day 59 posttransplant) revealed mild derangement of ALT to 74 U/L (reference 8-58 U/L). Other LFTs were normal. One week later, there was further derangement of parenchymal liver enzymes: ALT was 138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was elevated to 65 U/L (reference 15-38 U/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase was 124 U/L (reference 11-62 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase was within reference limits at 70 U/L (reference 42-110 U/L). Complete blood count showed lymphopenia, although total leukocyte count was within reference levels.

The patient was empirically managed for acute graft rejection with increased immunosuppression using a 3-day course of methylprednisolone. Valganciclovir was prescribed for a low-level whole blood CMV viremia. However, LFTs continued to deteriorate despite clearance of CMV viremia and increased immunosuppression. Liver biopsy showed nonspecific mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes in the portal tracts. There were no viral inclusion bodies, and immunohistochemical staining for CMV and hepatitis B core antigens was negative. Results of testing for HBsAg in serum, HBV DNA in plasma, HCV antibody in serum, HAV IgM in serum, and HAV RNA in plasma and feces were all negative. HEV IgM was detected in serum collected on [22 Aug 2018] (day 100 posttransplant). Because of the serology result and ongoing LFT derangement, persistent HEV infection was suspected. A qRT-PCR targeting HEV-A was performed on patient fecal and plasma specimens; HEV-A RNA was not detected in either specimen. An RT-PCR capable of detecting all species within the _Orthohepevirus_ genus detected amplicons (Technical Appendix Figure 1) in plasma, feces, and liver tissue. Sequencing confirmed that the products clustered with rat HEV-C strains.

Viral RNA kinetics and effect of ribavirin therapy
The patient's archived serum, saliva, urine, feces, and nonfixed liver tissue samples were retrieved for HEV-C RNA load testing using HEV-C qRT-PCR (figure 1, panel A). Two pretransplant serum samples and 1 serum sample collected on day 17 after transplant did not contain HEV-C RNA. The 1st specimen with detectable HEV-C RNA was a serum sample collected 43 days after transplant, which contained an RNA load of 948 copies/mL; this result preceded onset of LFT derangement by 3 weeks. After heightened immunosuppression in July and August, the HEV-C RNA load in blood steadily rose along with ALT (figure 1, panel B). Variation in ALT correlated with the HEV-C RNA viral load by linear regression. HEV-C RNA was also detected in feces, saliva, and liver tissue (figure 1, panel A); feces contained the highest RNA load.

Immunosuppressant dosages were decreased after confirmation of HEV infection. However, ALT and HEV-C RNA loads continued to increase despite reduction of plasma tacrolimus levels by 55% and rebound of lymphocyte count. Therefore, oral ribavirin 400 mg twice daily was started on [7 Sep 2017]. ALT decreased within the 1st week after start of therapy and normalized within 1 month after starting ribavirin (figure 1, panel B). HEV-C RNA loads also decreased to undetectable levels in plasma obtained on [13 Feb 2018]. Ribavirin was stopped in April 2018, and HEV-C RNA in serum remained undetectable as of [21 Aug 2018], confirming sustained virologic response.

Serologic analysis
We retrospectively tested all available patient serum and plasma samples for HEV IgG and IgM ELISA using the Wantai ELISA kit. The patient's serum before transplant was HEV IgG positive and IgM negative. HEV IgG and IgM optical density rose sharply from [27 Jun 2017], when HEV-C RNA was 1st detectable in blood, to [25 Jul 2017], when clinical hepatitis began (Technical appendix figure 2). Despite high IgG levels, HEV-C RNA continued to rise until ribavirin was started.

To characterize the serologic response, Western blot using purified HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins (figure 2, panel A) was performed. Two mAbs raised against HEV-A were used: 1 produced a band in HEV-A IgG blot but not in the HEV-C blot (lane 8; figure 2, panels B, C) confirming specificity, and the other was cross-reactive against HEV-A and HEV-C (lane 9; figure 2, panels B, C). Polyclonal serum raised in mice inoculated with HEV-C protein reacted in both blots, showing that the serum was cross-reactive (lane 7). Patient serum collected on day 100 after transplant (lane 1) was tested against HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins. The serum specimen showed reactivity in both Western blots.

Two patient serum samples, one obtained 3 months before transplant and the other obtained on day 100 after transplant, were tested in IgG ELISAs using HEV-A and HEV-C protein-coated plates. The pretransplant serum (figure 2, panel D) had cross-reactive antibodies against both HEV-A and HEV-C proteins (less than 2-fold difference in titer using OD cutoff of 0.3). However, the posttransplant serum (figure 2, panel E) showed more than 16-fold rise in HEV-A IgG titer and markedly higher reactivity against HEV-A than against HEV-C (more than 4-fold difference in titer using a cutoff OD of 0.3).

Liver histologic and immunohistochemical analyses
Serial liver biopsies showed progressively worsening hepatocyte ballooning and degenerative changes (figure 3, panels A, B). Apoptotic hepatocytes were identified in the biopsy obtained on day 98 posttransplant (figure 3, panel B). Immunohistochemical staining with the cross-reactive mAb showed positive perinuclear cytoplasmic signals (figure 3, panel C), and negative control with bovine serum albumin instead of mAb showed no signals (figure 3, panel D).

Genomic description
Complete genome sequencing of the patient's fecal HEV isolate (LCK-3110) showed that the genome was 6942 bp long (GenBank accession no. MG813927). Phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 of HEV strains showed that LCK-3110 is most closely related to the Vietnam-105 strain (figure 4; Technical appendix figure 3, panels A, B), sharing 93.7% nt identity. Because no phylogenetic incongruence was found on comparison of trees of the 3 genomic segments, recombination was unlikely (table 2; Technical appendix). To determine whether commonly used RT-PCRs for HEV nucleic acid amplification could detect HEV-C, we aligned published primer/probe sequences of HEV RT-PCRs (19-22) with complete genome sequences of HEV-A (genotype 1 reference strain) and HEV-C (strains LCK-3110, Vietnam-105, and LA-B350) using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/). Alignment revealed significant lack of homology with HEV-C at the 3 prime end of either the forward or reverse primer for the assays described by Jothikumar et al. and Rolfe et al. (Technical appendix figure 4, panels A, B) (20,21). Our in-house HEV-A qRT-PCR is based on the primer/probe design of Jothikumar et al. and was unable to detect HEV-C in patient specimens (20). For the assays described by Mansuy et al. and Colson et al. (19,22), there was significant lack of matching of probe sequence (40%-45% mismatch) to HEV-C genomes (Technical appendix figure 4, panels C, D), which most likely would result in failure to detect any amplified nucleic acid.

Virus culture
We detected HEV-C RNA in supernatants from all 3 cell lines (figure 5, panel A) inoculated with patient's feces at steady levels from day 3 to day 7 after inoculation. RNA loads in cell lysates were about 1 log higher than concomitantly harvested supernatants, suggesting successful viral cell entry. Immunohistochemical staining (figure 5, panels B, C) of A549 cell monolayers and immunofluorescence staining of infected Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells (Technical appendix figure 5) confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic HEV ORF2 antigen when stained with antiserum against HEV-C. These findings suggested abortive viral replication of HEV-C in human cell lines.

Epidemiologic investigation
The 1st clinical sample with detectable HEV-C RNA was obtained 43 days after transplant. HEV-C was not detected in serum samples obtained before transplant. Serum samples from the organ donor and all 4 platelet donors tested negative by IgM Western blot against HEV-C recombinant protein (figure 2, panel C, lanes 2-6) and HEV-C qRT-PCR.

The patient's house unit was located adjacent to a refuse chute. He had noticed rodent droppings but had never seen rats inside his home. A site visit to the housing estate was conducted on [22 Nov 2017]. Rodent droppings were found around refuse collection bins on the ground floor and the floor where the patient lived. A total of 12 rodent fecal specimens, 2 swab samples from the drain, and 2 swab samples from the refuse room floor tested negative for HEV-C RNA. To expand the investigation, we retrieved archived rodent samples collected from the area around the patient's housing estate (about a 2.5 km radius) as part of preexisting pathogen surveillance programs. Spleen, kidney, liver, and rectal swab specimens from 27 rats were tested by qRT-PCR. The internal organs of 1 street rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) collected in 2012 tested positive for HEV-C RNA (strain name SRN-02). The ORF2 aa [amino acid] sequence of this isolate had 90.9% identity to LCK-3110.

Discussion
----------
Discovered in Germany in 2010, rat HEV variants have been detected in rodent samples in Asia, Europe, and North America (23-26). Because of high divergence from human-pathogenic HEV, rat HEV has been classified into a separate species, _Orthohepevirus C_, within the family _Hepeviridae_ (27). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is controversial. Virus-like protein ELISAs show possible subclinical infection among forestry workers in Germany and febrile inpatients in Vietnam, although interpretation of such studies is difficult because of serologic cross-reactivity between HEV-A and HEV-C (15,28). Immunocompetent rhesus macaques do not appear to be susceptible to experimental infection with a North America HEV-C isolate (23).

In this study, we detected HEV-C RNA in multiple specimens from a transplant recipient. The HEV-C infection manifested as persistent hepatitis, as shown by temporal correlation between blood HEV-C RNA detection and hepatitis onset, presence of HEV-C RNA in liver tissue, and normalization of liver function tests with viral clearance. These findings prove that HEV-C can infect humans to cause clinically significant illness and signal a need to reevaluate the importance of HEV-C as a human zoonosis among both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology.

The patient reported here acquired HEV-C infection despite having HEV IgG. Interpreted in parallel with the finding by Sanford et al. that inoculating pigs with HEV-C ORF2 protein did not protect them from HEV-A infection and low amino acid homology between HEV-A and HEV-C in critical immunogenic domains (29), our data suggest that HEV-A antibodies do not protect against HEV-C infection. The patient's postinfection serum showed significantly higher reactivity in an HEV-A-specific ELISA than in an HEV-C ELISA; the humoral immune responses of persons with past HEV-A infection to de novo HEV-C infection are worthy of further study to identify whether anamnestic responses are mounted.

The patient's HEV isolate had high nucleotide similarity to the HEV-C Vietnam-105 strain. It shared less homology with the North America LA-B350 strain, especially in the ORF3 domain, which is important for viral egress (30). Interspecies transmission could not be attributed to specific viral mutations. Future studies will need to include differences in zoonotic potential between HEV-C strains from Asia and the Americas.

The patient's immunosuppression possibly enabled the virus to surmount the species barrier, as described previously for avian influenza (31,32). HEV-C infections may go undiagnosed because of amplification failure in RT-PCRs, which are designed based on HEV-A sequences (Technical appendix figure 3). The Wantai ELISA, based on HEV-A genotype 1, was able to detect IgM in this patient, but whether the assay is sensitive for HEV-C infection or was detecting only HEV-A-specific antibodies is uncertain. Therefore, we believe that specific RT-PCR is the most reliable method to diagnose HEV-C infections.

Our findings are also relevant to blood and organ donation safety. Because of the inability of commonly used RT-PCRs to detect HEV-C, transmission from asymptomatically infected immunocompetent donors may occur, even in countries that screen donated blood for HEV. Studies examining frequency of HEV-C contamination in blood products are needed to quantify this threat.

The patient lived in a housing estate with evidence of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his home. We identified HEV-C in street rodents from the area, but the isolate was not closely related to the patient's isolate. The route of transmission is unclear; we postulate that contamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food supply is possible. Other possibilities include reactivation of a subclinical infection in the patient posttransplant or a donor-derived infection from residual HEV-C in the transplanted organ. However, we found no serologic or virologic evidence of HEV-C infection in donor and recipient serum before transplant. An occult infection in the donated liver, which reactivated after transplant as described previously for HEV-A, cannot be completely excluded. Detailed studies are needed to ascertain the route of HEV-C infection in humans.

As previously noted, a 2016 paper from Hanoi, Viet Nam serologically suggested human infection with a rat-associated strain of HEV:

Abstract
--------
"Zoonotic potential of a rat-derived hepatitis E virus (HEV), designated as HEV-C1, remains unknown. To evaluate the risk for HEV-C1 infection in humans, paired sera of 208 hospitalized febrile patients collected from 2001 to 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam, were examined for IgG antibodies to HEV-C1 and genotype 1 HEV (HEV-1), which is common in humans. IgG antibodies to virus-like particles (VLPs) of HEV-C1 and/or HEV-1 were detected from 99 of the 208 convalescent sera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgG antibody titers to HEV-C1 antigen in 3 of the 99 sera were more than 8-fold higher than those to HEV-1 antigen. IgM antibodies to HEV-C1 antigen were detected in acute sera from 2 of the 3 patients in ELISA and Western blotting. However, no HEV genome was detected. Clinical information was available for 1 of the 2 patients. Hepatic enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were mildly elevated (156 IU/l and 68 IU/l, respectively), and hepatomegaly was detected by ultrasonography. The patient recovered from the illness after 17 days. These results indicated that HEV-C1 or its variants infect humans in Viet Nam and may cause acute febrile illness with mild liver dysfunction." - Mod.LL
