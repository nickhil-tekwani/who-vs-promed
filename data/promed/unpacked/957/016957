Given the experience in Hong Kong, it would be of interest to screen
poultry workers in contact with the infected flocks for evidence of
flu-like illness, and serologic evidence of avian influenza.

I have been advised by a colleague that a summary of the recent AI outbreak
in NSW was recently posted on ProMED-mail, and that it contained a minor
error.
The paper said that there were 1,012 people working in the State disease
control headquarters, when in fact this should read 10 to 12. I know it was
cramped at times, but it wasn't that bad:-).

Of interest, the official summary of the outbreak has now been posted on our
website, at <http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/QA/health/ai97.htm>. (It may well be
a copy of this that was posted, I haven't seen it)

We also hope that there will be some more detailed publications forthcoming
in due course.
