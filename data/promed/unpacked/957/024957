CDC, FDA, and the Connecticut Department of Public Health are investigating a fatal case of GI [gastrointestinal] mucormycosis in a premature infant of 29 weeks gestation following the use of a probiotic supplement called ABC Dophilus distributed by Solgar, Inc., Leonia, NJ.

Shortly after birth, the infant received a probiotic supplement called ABC Dophilus, distributed by Solgar Inc., as prophylaxis against necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Subsequently, the infant developed signs and symptoms consistent with NEC. Surgical exploration revealed necrotic bowel, which was resected. Histopathology results from the resected bowel revealed a heavy fungal burden with angioinvasion, consistent with a Mucormycete infection.

Sequencing of fungal DNA recovered from the infant's tissue block identified the fungus as _Rhizopus oryzae_, a pathogenic Mucormycete. _R. oryzae_ was also recovered from unopened bottles of Solgar ABC Dophilus, lot no. 074 024 01R1, the same lot administered to the infant. Solgar ABC Dophilus is a probiotic product intended to contain _Bifidobacterium lactis_ and _Lactobacillus rhamnosus_ and has been used to prevent NEC in premature infants. This product is available for purchase in retail stores and online retailers and is used in healthcare settings.

The investigation into this fatal case of GI mucormycosis and its association with the contaminated Solgar ABC Dophilus is ongoing. As such, Solgar ABC Dophilus should not be used, especially in infants and children who may be more susceptible to infection, until further information regarding the safety of this product is available.

Clinicians who learn of:
1. Confirmed or suspected cases of infants with gastrointestinal mucormycosis (diagnosed via culture or histopathology), OR
2. Unexplained infant deaths within 30 days of receipt of Solgar ABC Dophilus since 1 Nov 2013 are asked to notify CDC Mycotic Diseases Branch, Dr. Tiffany Walker at <ydj7@cdc.gov> or 404-639-2641.

Solgar, Inc. of New Jersey is recalling ABC Dophilus Powder, a dietary supplement, because it contains _Rhizopus oryzae_, a fungus that causes mucormycosis, a rare infection. This infection can cause health problems in premature infants, children, and anyone with a weakened immune system. Otherwise healthy people can also become ill if they ingest this fungus. One consumer complaint has been received to date.

The product is Solgar ABC Dophilus Powder, NET Wt. 1.75 oz (50 grams). The UPC number is 0 33984 00010 0, and the Lot Numbers are 074024-01R1, 074024-01, and 074024-02, with Expiration Date 7/31/15.

It was sold in [the following U.S. states: AL, AR, AZ, CA, CT, CO, FL, IA, IL, IN, MI, ME, MO, MA, NC, NE, NY, NJ, NV, OH, OK, PA, PR, UT, TN, TX, VT, KY, WI, WA; and in the UK and Israel through pharmacies, retail stores, wholesale, and through the internet.

If you purchased this product, do not eat it or touch the powder. Discard or return to the place of purchase for a refund. Testing conducted by the CDC revealed the presence of the fungus.

Risk factors for developing mucormycosis include uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, organ transplant, low white blood cells, and skin trauma. The symptoms of mucormycosis include fever, headache, and sinus pain. Lung infections include fever and cough. Skin infections look like blisters or ulcers, with tenderness, pain, heat, redness, and swelling; the infected tissue may turn black. If the infection is not treated quickly, it can spread through the body and can be fatal. If you purchased this product and have experienced any of these infections, see your doctor immediately.

[Mucormycosis (also called zygomycosis) is the name given to infections caused by _Mucorales_ (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/). _Rhizopus oryzae_ is a fungal species in the phylum Zygomycota, class Zygomycetes, subdivision Mucormycotina, order Mucorales, and family Mucoraceae. Pathogenic genera in the Mucoraceae family include _Absidia_, _Apophysomyces_, _Mucor_, _Rhizomucor_, and _Rhizopus_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, such as in soil and decaying vegetable matter. Although most individuals are exposed to these fungi daily, usually mucormycosis occurs in individuals with predisposing medical conditions such as immunosuppression and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, necrotizing soft tissue mucormycoses have been described in immunocompetent individuals as a result of traumatic injuries following tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions (see ProMED-mail post Mucormycosis, fatal - USA: (MO) tornado-related 20110612.1789).

Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released into the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. _Mucorales_ species are angioinvasive, causing infarction of the involved tissue, and the mucormycosis spectrum ranges from cutaneous, gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and sinopulmonary to disseminated and frequently fatal infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts, such as premature neonates, solid organ transplant recipients, and those with hematological malignancies.

Healthcare-acquired mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surfaces, ingestion of contaminated material, or inhalation of aerosolized fungal spores (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02982.x/full). Specific examples include use of contaminated wound bandages; contaminated hospital linen; contaminated adhesive on ostomy bags; contaminated medication patches; contaminated wooden tongue depressors used to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or tongue depressors used to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites; and aerosolized fungal spores in ventilatory systems as a result of construction (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02982.x/full). - Mod.ML
