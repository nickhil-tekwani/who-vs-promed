An apparently rabid she-wolf terrorized the residents of Tiberias [HaZafon District] on Thursday [6 Mar 2014], biting 11 of them before being shot dead by an emergency services volunteer.

The attacks began in the morning and continued for hours into the afternoon, as Tiberias police and municipal inspectors swept the area to apprehend the biting beast.

A volunteer with United Hatzalah of Israel, an independent emergency medical service, spotted the she-wolf Thursday afternoon and shot it to death. The animal's remains were being transferred to the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Services unit to determine what it was infected with.

For hours, officials and Tiberias residents were unsure whether the animal was a rabid dog or jackal. One of the victims, Kobi Itzik, said he was at the Tiberias hotel where he works when he saw a woman who got bitten on her arm and leg.

"It really looked like a wolf, not a dog, and then he jumped on me and bit my leg," Itzik said. "I struggled with the animal and slammed it against a wall, but it wouldn't get off me; it was really strong. Then it ran off, and later I realized that it bit other people as well."

Last year [2013], a similar incident occurred in the central Golan Heights [HaZafon District], when a rabid dog bit 9 youths hiking in the area. They were vaccinated against rabies [as] were their friends who treated their wounds.

The number of rabies cases in Israel has grown in recent years, mainly in northern Israel. In 2007, 15 cases were reported, while 58 were reported in 2009. Last year [2013], the number of cases dropped to 29.

Around 60 000 people die annually from rabies [worldwide] despite the fact that it is preventable with appropriate medical care [post exposure].

[Tiberias, pop. 41 678 (as of December 2011), is situated on the western shore of Lake Tiberias. The city, established 20 AD, was named after the Roman emperor Tiberius. The described event, within an urban environment, is rather unusual. A picture of one of the animal's attacks, captured by a security camera, is available at http://mobile.mako.co.il/news-israel/health/Article-41a4eb168f89441004.htm (thanks to Dr Boris Yakobson for drawing this to our attention).

Until 2004, rabies was sylvatic in Israel, foxes being the vectors. The disease underwent a drastic change following the statewide implementation of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of foxes and jackals. Since 2004, the project covers most parts of the country, practically eliminating cases in foxes (see map at http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2004-2011.html). During the (recently started) 2014 annual operation, the dispersion rate will be 16-20 baits per square km.

Since 2009, a surge-up of rabies has been reported from northeastern Israel on the border with Syria, in spite of the oral vaccination. This has been found to be caused by the penetration of rabid stray dogs, and probably also wolves from Syria, infecting local pets (if unvaccinated) and susceptible domestic ungulates, particularly cattle, with the canine virus. For more details, see ref. 1 below and maps at http://tinyurl.com/pvfwqns and http://tinyurl.com/pascu29.

The current case has already been lab-confirmed, becoming the 3rd since the start of 2014; the previous cases involved a badger and a cow (map at http://tinyurl.com/nu5gyrm). On 4 Feb 2014, the Israeli State Veterinary Services declared a zone in northeastern Israel as a "high rabies risk" zone, within which livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses) are recommended to be preventively vaccinated against rabies (dog annual vaccination is compulsory throughout Israel). The geographic boundaries of the 'zone' have been based upon the distribution of rabies cases in animals during 2012-2013. The current event in Tiberias is outside the 'zone', the map of which is available at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/B7825EEC-E2CB-4763-9D82-8006070D2873/0/hozer_ezor_kalevet1.pdf.

The number of lab-confirmed rabies cases in various animal species in Israel during the years 2002-2013 is included in the following table. During these years, 8 cases involved wolves (there is an endemic wolf population in the Golan area).

No human case of rabies has been recorded in Israel since 2003.
