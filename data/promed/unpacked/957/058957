Update: West Nile Virus Activity - Northeastern United States, 7 Jan to 7
Aug 2000
----------------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance programs initiated in response to the 1999 West Nile virus
(WNV) outbreak have detected increased transmission in the northeastern
United States. Surveillance for WNV infection includes monitoring of
mosquitoes, sentinel chicken flocks, wild birds, and potentially
susceptible mammals (e.g., horses and humans). This report summarizes
findings of this surveillance system through 7 Aug 2000.
Avian morbidity and mortality surveillance has identified 188 WNV-infected
birds from 34 counties in four northeastern states; 111 (59%) have been
reported since August 1. These include 128 birds from New York (Albany,
Broome, Columbia, Dutchess, Erie, Franklin, Nassau, New York, Niagara,
Onondaga, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond, Rockland,
Schenectady, Suffolk, Ulster, Warren, Washington, and Westchester
counties), 54 from New Jersey (Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth,
Passaic, and Union counties), 4 from Massachusetts (Middlesex, Norfolk, and
Suffolk counties), and two from Connecticut (Fairfield and Tolland
counties). Infected species reported include 147 American crows (78%) and
23 blue jays (12%). Infections also have been reported in the red-tailed
hawk, fish crow, house sparrow, American robin, merlin, song sparrow,
Canada goose, great blue heron, northern mockingbird, eastern bluebird,
cockatiel, mute swan, and yellow-rumped warbler. WNV has not been reported
in sentinel chickens.
WNV also has been detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction and/or virus isolation in 38 mosquito pools collected in New York
(New York, Orange, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester counties)
and one from Connecticut (Fairfield County). Thirty-five of the
WNV-positive mosquito pools from New York were _Culex pipiens_/_restuans_,
two were _Aedes japonicus_, and one was _C. pipiens_. The positive pool
from Connecticut was _C. restuans_.
On 4 Aug 2000, the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) reported
that a person aged 78 years from south Richmond County, hospitalized with
viral encephalitis, tested positive for WNV. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum
samples were positive for IgM antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Confirmatory testing by plaque reduction neutralization for IgG
antibody from convalescent serum is pending. The patient's symptoms began
on 20 Jul, indicating that infection had started to 15 days earlier (3);
therefore, the infection occurred before the initial mosquito adulticide
spraying in Richmond County on 19-20 Jul. The patient resides in an area
where WNV-infected mosquitoes and birds have been found during 2000; no WNV
activity was detected in this part of the city in 1999. The patient had not
traveled for more than 50 years to areas where other flaviviruses had been
endemic and had not left New York during the incubation period.

1, Staten Island 1); Onondaga County, 1; Rockland County, 8; Schenectady
County, 3; Suffolk County, 6; Sullivan County, 1 and Westchester County, 1.
Nine positive mosquito pools were identified: New York City, 3 (Manhattan,
1; Queens 1; Staten Island, 1); Suffolk County, 1 and Westchester County, 5.
Note: the Sullivan County bird is the first documented positive finding in
that county.
The total number of West Nile positive specimens for New York State this
year is 155 birds, 60 mosquito pools and 1 human case. - Mods. JW/CP

Additional Crows Test Positive for West Nile Virus in Conn.,
No spraying scheduled at this time
------------------------------------------------------
The State of Connecticut today identified 8 crows testing positive for West
Nile virus (WNV) in 6 different Connecticut communities. The crows were
collected from 5 Jul 2000 through 31 Jul 2000 and transported to the
University of Connecticut Pathobiology Laboratory (UConn) for necropsy.
Tissue samples were taken to the Department of Public Health Laboratory
(DPH) where the virus was isolated. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station (CAES) has reconfirmed the positive WNV isolations.
The crows were collected from the following towns or cities:
* Stamford - 3
* Milford - 1
* Greenwich - 1
* Norwalk - 1
* Westport - 1
* Cheshire - 1
"The risk to humans is still low. Despite intensive mosquito trapping and
testing, we have had only one pool of mosquitoes test positive for West
Nile Virus, and that involved mosquitoes collected in Stamford on July 11,"
said Arthur J. Rocque, Jr., Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP).
