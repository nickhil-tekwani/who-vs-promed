2011 case count as of 5 Jan 2012:
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010*
Globally: 620 / 920 / 1352
- endemic countries: 315 / 223 / 232
- non-endemic countries: 305 / 697 / 1120

The above represents data in WHO as of 4 Jan 2011 for 2010 data and 3 Jan 2012 for 2011 data.
*The 2010 total for Congo includes cases with inadequate specimens that have been exceptionally classified as confirmed polio based on their association with the WPV1 outbreak.


Afghanistan
Three new cases, all WPV1, were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 74. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Dec 2011] in Maywand district in Kandahar province.

India
In the coming week, India will pass 12 months since the onset of paralysis of its most recent case. The case, which is the only case reported in India in 2011, had onset of paralysis on [13 Jan 2011] in West Bengal.

Nigeria
One new case was reported this week - the total number of cases for 2011 is now 51. The most recent case is a WPV1 with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2011] in Niger state.

Pakistan
Eight new cases were reported this week. The total number of cases in Pakistan is now 189. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of paralysis on [16 Dec 2011], in Khyber, Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

Lot Quality Assurance Sampling methodology applied to the December [2011] Sub-national immunization days indicate that coverage was likely to be less than 80 percent in key transmission areas, such as northern Balochistan, and less than 90 percent in parts of southern Sindh. Of the 61 Union Councils surveyed, however, 39 were found likely to have coverage not less than 95 percent.

Angola
No new cases were reported in the past week. The country has reported a total of 5 cases in 2011, the most recent of which had onset of paralysis on 7 July in Uige in the country's north.

Chad and CAR
No new cases were reported in Chad this week, and the total number of cases is 130 (127 WPV1s and three WPV3s). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [18 Nov 2011] (WPV1 from Logone Oriental).

One new case was reported from the Central African Republic (CAR) in the past week - the total number of cases for 2011 is now 4 (all WPV1s). CAR's most recent case had onset of paralysis on [8 Dec 2011] in Region Sanitaire 3 (RS3), in the country's north.

China
No new cases were reported in the past week. China has a total of 21 cases, all WPV1. The most recent had onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2011] from Akesu prefecture.
China is at continued risk of circulation of wild poliovirus.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
Three new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 92 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [28 Nov 2011] in Maniema province.

Horn of Africa
A case of WPV1 with onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2011] in Nyanza province, western Kenya, remains the only case to be reported in the Horn of Africa in 2011.

West Africa
No new cases were reported in this region in the last week. The most recent case in west Africa is from Niger, with onset of paralysis on [17 Nov 2011] in Tahoua district, Birni Nkonni province, near the border with Nigeria. The total number of cases for 2011 in the west African region is 50 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali and 4 from Niger). All cases are WPV3, except for 2 WPV1 cases from Niger.

[Because of time lags associated with collection and testing of laboratory specimens submitted for confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV infection), and in some cases, delays in identifying suspected cases in areas with reduced access to health services, one expects to continue to have reports of cases of WPV associated disease from 2011 during the early weeks of 2012. The above information includes information from the official report of the status of 2011 WPV associated disease as of Thurs. 5 Jan 2012.

A map of the geographic locations of WPV confirmed cases in 2011 can be found at: http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring.aspx. Looking at the map one can see a band of "heavy" transmission in Asia, most notably in Pakistan and Afghanistan with the spill over (via importation followed by local transmission) into western China. There are also bands of WPV1 transmission in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, and bands of WPV3 transmission in Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.

While it is very noteworthy that India is on the verge of completing a full year without reports of WPV associated disease (the most recent date of onset was 13 Jan 2011 in West Bengal), the continued transmission of WPV in neighboring Pakistan is a reminder of the continued risk of re-introduction of WPV.

The findings of the Lot Quality Assessment performed in Pakistan following the last rounds of immunization activities in December 2011 are disheartening, as vaccination coverages in known areas of WPV transmission are suboptimal (less than 80 percent), translating into continued pockets of inadequate vaccination coverages where WPV will most likely continue to circulate. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan - New 2011 cases since official report in [1]
Date: 6 Jan 2012
Source: Express Tribune
http://tribune.com.pk/story/317814/polio-update-two-more-cases-surface-in-k-p-fata/


Two more polio cases have been reported in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), pushing the toll in Pakistan to 191 cases as of [5 Jan 2012].

According to a Polio Monitoring and Coordination Cell report, one case each was reported in K-P and Fata last December [2011].

In Khyber Agency, [a one-and-a-half-year old male], who belongs to Sama Gari village in Bara, felt the 1st signs of paralysis on [23 Dec 2012]. According to his parents, [he] could not receive any oral polio vaccine dose in supplementary immunisation or vaccination campaigns, as the area is inaccessible due to security reasons since September 2009.

It is for this reason that 22 cases were reported from Khyber Agency alone last year. According to the report, 14 cases appeared in Bara and 4 each in Tirah and Landi Kotal. This, however, is the 7th polio case from Milaward in Sama Gari village. The claim is verified by the report, according to which over 40 per cent of the children remained inaccessible in the agency for most of 2011, except July [2011].

Similarly, in Tank district, [a] 23-month-old [male]from Gul Imam, suffered paralysis on [18 Dec 2011]. The report says the boyâ€™s family refused to have him vaccinated on religious grounds and he only received polio drops twice as an infant. This is the 3rd polio case reported from Tank, the report added.

Of the total cases confirmed in Pakistan up till [5 Jan 2011], 72 cases were reported from Balochistan, 56 from Fata, 32 from Sindh, 22 from K-P, 8 from Punjab and one from Gilgit-Baltistan.

Pakistan is currently among 4 countries where the endemic is prevalent and ranks 1st with the highest number of cases in the world. It has also been reported that the country will face travel restrictions if it is unable to eradicate the disease by the end of this year [2012]. [This should probably read "unable to interrupt transmission of the WPV by the end of this year", as eradication of WPV in a country is defined as 3 years with zero reports of WPV associated disease. - Mod.MPP]

In November 2011, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani appointed Begum Shahnaz Wazir Ali as the focal person for coordination and monitoring of polio eradication in Pakistan. The government is planning to completely eradicate the crippling disease from the country this year [2012]. However, with a host of new cases emerging in K-P and Fata, polio eradication seems to be a far-fetched goal.

[The above newswire mentions 2 additional cases that do not appear to be included in the official data reported as of 5 Jan 2012 (see [1]Worldwide - 2011 data as of 5 Jan 2011) as the date of onset of most recent case in the official report is listed as 16 Jan 2012, whereas the case in Khyber Agency had a date of onset of 23 Dec 2012, and the case in FATA had a date of onset of 18 Dec 2012. These 2 cases highlight the challenges confronting the goal of interruption of WPV transmission in Pakistan. In one case, the child was not adequately vaccinated because of civil strife leading to interruptions in service delivery. In the other case, the child was not vaccinated because of religious objection to vaccination -- most likely due to the rumors circulating in Pakistan that the vaccine is a western plot to induce sterility in vaccine recipients, as the predominant religion in the FATA region Islam, is not a religion that bans the use of childhood vaccines.

The Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa area borders with the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), which borders with Afghanistan, where there is also continued transmission of WPV (see official data below). - Mod.MPP]

Nigeria: 22 States in Nigeria Are Polio Free - NPHCDA
----------------
The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, Dr Ado Mohammed, has disclosed that 22 States in Nigeria have remained polio free for 3 years even as the country is among the 4 most endemic polio countries in the world.

Ado, who spoke in an interview in Minna, yesterday, said that as at the end of January 2011, the country has recorded as low as 51 cases of wild polio virus [WPV] in only 8 States.

According to him, the statistics represent 90 per cent of reduction in wild polio virus spread in the country as the country set 80 percent vaccine coverage in order to prevent further spread of the virus.

The Executive Director, who was in Minna for a one day sensitisation meeting of stakeholders on polio eradication and routine immunisation, disclosed that a national task team has been constituted to stop transmission of the diseases in the country by the end of this year [2012].

He said, "An immediate outcome of the task team's work is the accountability frame work to hold the federal, states, local government and our partners accountable for polio eradication".

[[For a map of Nigeria showing states, see http://allafrica.com/stories/201201061165.html. There are presently 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory (Abuja). Hence, the above report that 22 states are now WPV free for 3 or more years means that 59 percent of the states and Federal Capital Territory have been WPV long enough to be considered as having eradicated WPV in these states. Unfortunately, there are still 8 states with active transmission of WPV, some of which include states that had the vaccination activities seriously interrupted back in 2003/2004 due to rumors similar to those affecting Pakistan today (see above report [2] Pakistan - New 2011 cases since official report in [1]). One hopes that the current transmission is not related to persist pockets of population that refuse vaccination based on the old rumors.
