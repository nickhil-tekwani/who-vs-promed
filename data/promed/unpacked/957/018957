An unknown disease has claimed the lives of 5 people in Tiaty, Baringo county, over the past one week. More than 13 people are currently admitted to the facility with the same infection. According to Clara Lotum, nurse in charge at AIC Lodengo Health Centre, those affected experience severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.

She revealed that they had conducted tests on the patients and ruled out cholera which has similar symptoms. Ms Lotum however lamented that the facility lacks proper equipment to diagnose the disease.

The nurse noted that victims brought to the centre would succumb to the disease after only 2 hours of contracting it because of lack of quick medical attention. According to her, getting to the medical facility. She told Citizen Digital that locals resorted to using motorbikes even in their sick state and this is why they succumb to the disease en route to the health centre.

MCA [Member of County Assembly] Solomon Makal (Koloa ward) urged the government to intervene before the situation becomes worse. On his part, however, Tiaty MP [Member of Parliament] William Kamket said it is the responsibility of the county government to adequately equip health facilities. He however called on the National Government, Red Cross, and other stakeholders to help alleviate the situation before it gets out of hand.

[ProMED would like more information about this outbreak in Baringo county in Kenya. It is said that cholera has been ruled out but not stated what testing modalities are available. Rapidly fatal infectious diseases as described here are not common, but both meningococcal disease and cholera can do so. - Mod.LL
