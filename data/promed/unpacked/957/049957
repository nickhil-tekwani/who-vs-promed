Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 27 Jan 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been notified of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the cases are as follows:
WHO was notified of one case by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia. The case is a 54-year-old man from Riyadh who developed respiratory illness symptoms on [29 Dec 2013] and was hospitalized on [4 Jan 2014]. The patient received medical treatment in an intensive care unit. He died on [14 Jan 2014]. Samples tested positive for MERS-CoV after his death. The patient was a health care worker. He had a history of chronic disease and had no history of contacts with animals or contact with known cases of MERS-CoV. In addition, he had no travel history. The investigation is ongoing.

WHO was notified of one case by the Ministry of Health of Jordan on [23 Jan 2014]. The case is a 48-year-old man who became ill on [31 Dec 2013] and developed fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain, and vomiting, and was admitted to a hospital on [9 Jan 2014]. While there, his condition worsened and on [16 Jan 2014] he was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient died on [23 Jan 2014]. A sample taken from the patient on [21 Jan 2014] tested positive by PCR for MERS-CoV. The patient had underlying health conditions and he had travelled to the United Kingdom from [12 Nov 2013 to 25 Dec 2013] seeking treatment for his underlying conditions. The patient had no history of animal contact and is believed to have not attended any large social events in the last 30 days. It is reported that he had received 2 guests from Kuwait between [25 Dec 2013 and 31 Dec 2013]. National authorities in Jordan are following family contacts, medical staff, and health workers, in addition to strictly applying infection control measures. Further investigations are ongoing in Jordan and UK.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 180 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 77 deaths.

MERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health care workers and regularly refreshed.

Early identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.

When the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[2] Nosocomial impact on MERS: media report
Date: Mon 27 Jan 2014

The spread of MERS coronavirus infections in hospitals in affected countries is a significant but underappreciated problem, infection control experts wrote in a journal editorial published Monday [27 Jan 2014].

"The concentration of vulnerable patients, the frequent movement of patients, and the many daily contacts make health care facilities the perfect breeding ground for MERS-CoV transmission," the authors warned in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Focus on the health care setting may prevent continued human-to-human transmission among at-risk patients."

The authors are 3 specialists who travelled to Saudi Arabia last spring [2013] to investigate a large outbreak of MERS in a hospital at Al-Ahsa in the eastern part of the country. One of the 3 is Dr Allison McGeer, head of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.

Their publication came on the same day as the World Health Organization confirmed a doctor in Saudi Arabia had succumbed to the virus earlier this month [January 2014].

The man, a Bangladeshi who practised in a Riyadh hospital, is not known to have had contact with a MERS patient or with the types of animals -- bats and camels -- suspected of being involved in the spread of the disease. He had not recently travelled outside the country.

As it remains unclear how people are contracting MERS, authorities would not be able to rule out the possibility the doctor caught the virus outside the hospital. But the possibility remains that he was infected while treating a patient who was not recognized as having been infected with MERS.

The editorial drew parallels to the role hospitals played in the spread of SARS -- also a coronavirus -- during the 2003 outbreak. McGeer was a key figure in Toronto's battle against that frightening new disease and she actually contracted the virus in the early days of the outbreak.

The authors cited a study published last fall [2013] that noted 30 of the 1st 161 known MERS patients were health care workers. Since then at least 2 more health care workers have become infected with the virus.

Just over a third of the health care worker cases have been described as asymptomatic -- showing no signs of illness. But a number of health care workers have required intensive care treatment and at least 3 have died.

Health care workers make up about 18 percent of confirmed MERS cases so far. The WHO said Monday [27 Jan 2014] that there have been 180 confirmed cases to date; 77 of those patients have died.

In the SARS outbreak, health care workers made up about 20 percent of cases globally. In Canada, health care workers comprised 43 percent of probable and suspect SARS cases.

"I think there's a tendency to look at this and say 'Well, SARS was much worse.' And it's true. It's much better than SARS from a perspective of health care workers," said McGeer.

"But there is still clearly too much serious illness and death in health care workers. And to my mind until we solve where this is coming from, we can't effectively reduce that risk."

Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert who has been following the MERS outbreak closely, said he believes people haven't grasped the scale of MERS health care infections, perhaps because the outbreak to date has remained in countries on the Arabian Peninsula.

Toronto's large SARS outbreak really drove home for western countries the risk the new disease posed, said Osterholm, who is the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

"If we had a situation where we had a sizable outbreak in the western world, where 17 to 20 percent of the cases where in health care workers, I think you'd be seeing a very different attitude towards the concern about health care workers and MERS."

The editorial was published in conjunction with a report on the disease course and symptoms of 12 MERS patients treated in the intensive care units of 2 Saudi hospitals. 3 of the 12 were health care workers.

[With the inclusion of these 2 newly confirmed cases, both fatal, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV is now 180 including 77 deaths. The Saudi case was a Bangladeshi surgeon working at a hospital in Riyadh who did not have a history of direct care of a known MERS-CoV infected case; nor did he have a history of exposure to animals (that may be the source of infection to the sporadic cases), nor a history of travel to known MERS-CoV transmission locales (locales where there have been clusters of cases.)

In contrast, the case reported by Jordan is perplexing -- there was a history of travel to the UK from approximately 6 weeks up to 6 days prior to the onset of presumed MERS-CoV associated illness, no known exposure to animals, and while he did not attend any known large gatherings, he may have had visitors from Kuwait during the 6 day period after return from the UK and the onset of illness. With the exception of the small family cluster in the UK in February 2013, there has been no known MERS-CoV transmission reported in the UK. This patient did have a co-morbidity that was under treatment in the UK, placing the individual in the health care environment.

The media report included in part [2] relates to an Online First Annals of Internal Medicine editorial (Perl TM, McGeer A, Price SC: Medusa's Ugly Head Again: From SARS to MERS-CoV. Ann Intern Med. Published online 28 Jan 2014 doi:10.7326/M14-0096; http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1817261) accompanying a report on clinical course of MERS-CoV infections (Arabi YM, Arifi AA, Balkhy HH, et al: Clinical Course and Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection. Ann Intern Med. Published online 28 Jan 2014 doi:10.7326/M13-2486; http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1817260). The editorial raises the point that nosocomial spread of MERS-CoV may be more important than has been previously discussed. The authors of this editorial highlight that 33 percent of cases of MERS-CoV infection have been in health care workers, and during the investigation of an outbreak in Al-Ahsa province, 91 percent of cases were related to transmission in the healthcare environment.

Both of the newly reported cases had a history of spending time in the health care environment -- the Saudi case was a physician in a hospital in Riyadh. As there have been cases of MERS-CoV infection in Riyadh, it is possible this most recent case had exposure to MERS-CoV infected individuals that were undiagnosed -- either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. As for the Jordanian case, there is mention the case was in the UK for medical treatment up to 6 days preceding the onset of clinical illness. What is not mentioned is whether there was contact with the health care sector in Jordan upon return from the UK.
