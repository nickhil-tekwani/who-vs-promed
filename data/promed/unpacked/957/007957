Some additional comments on the prevalence of rabies in Russia
--------------------------------------------------------------
[The following information has been provided by Ivan Kuzmin of the Rabies
Group, Institute for Natural Foci Infections, Omsk, Russia, to supplement
data contained in the ProMED-mail posts: "Rabies, human - Russia (Mordovia)
20030913.2313" and "Rabies, human - Russia (Mordovia) (02) 20030914.2324".
- Mod.CP]
(1) The central region of the European part of Russia is endemic for fox
rabies. Although human cases were not registered in Mordovia since 1985,
they were registered regularly in surrounding territories.
(2) The data extracted from the GIDEON database is mostly correct. However,
one should take into account that wildlife rabies surveillance in Russia is
very limited. Rabies in Russia (as well as in most other states of the FSU)
after World War II has been maintained by small canids (such as red foxes,
steppe foxes, raccoon dogs in particular regions, and arctic foxes in the
Arctic). The dog, cat, ruminant, etc., cases have been registered in the
territories that are enzootic for wildlife rabies. The same may be stated
about human rabies cases. The exceptions are the Black Sea coast and the
Central Asian states, where dog rabies is enzootic.
(3) The increase in human cases in 2001 and 2002 was related to the
activation of wildlife epizootics, by the lack of public health services
(reduced availability of anti-rabies biologicals), and by common social issues.
(4) One human rabies case of bat origin had been registered in 1977
(Voroshilovgrad, Ukraine; the virus sero/genotype had not been identified),
and another one in 1985 (Belgorod, Russia; European bat lyssavirus type 1
(EBLV-1)).
(5) Bat lyssaviruses were isolated in the Ukraine in 1967 (one case, not
identified) and in 1988 (2 cases, EBLV-1); in West Siberia in 1981 and 1984
(both are unavailable for identification due to contamination by the
laboratory CVS strain of rabies virus). The positive bat sample reported
from Yakutia (1987) was contaminated by arctic fox rabies virus. Also a few
bat lyssaviruses reported from Uzbekistan (1976) and Stavropol region
(2002) had not been identified to sero/genotype. The other bat lyssaviruses
available for identification were isolated in Kyrgyzstan in 1991 (Aravan
virus, suggested as a new genotype); in Tajikistan in 2001 (Khujand virus,
suggested as a new genotype); in East Siberia in 2002 (Irkut virus,
suggested as a new genotype) and in Krasnodar region in 2002 (West
Caucasian bat virus; suggested as a new genotype). The information on
Aravan virus has been partly presented (Arai et al., 2003), information on
Khujand is in press, and data on Irkut and West Caucasian Bat viruses are
under consideration for publication. Investigation of almost 3000 other
bats, collected in different territories during active surveillance yielded
no lyssaviruses. In general, no documented report of the presence of
genotype 1 lyssaviruses in Russian bats (as well is in other Old World
bats) is available. The prior suggestion of six genotype 1 isolates from
_Myotis daubentoni_ (really accounting for one third of the bats tested!)
requires further clarification and corroboration.

[The identification of Aravan virus as a new genotype of rabies virus is
described in: Arai YT, et al. New lyssavirus genotype from the lesser
mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythi), Kyrghyzstan. Emerg Infect Dis 2003; 9(3):
333-7 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no3/02-0252.htm>. This paper, of
which Dr Kuzmin is a co-author, reports that Aravan virus was isolated from
a lesser mouse-eared bat (_Myotis blythi_) in the Osh region of
Kyrghyzstan, central Asia, in 1991. The complete sequence of the
nucleoprotein (N) gene was determined and compared with those of 26
representative lyssaviruses. Aravan virus was distinguished from the 7
established genotypes of rabies virus on the basis of nucleotide and amino
acid identity. Phylogenetic analysis based on both nucleotide and amino
acid sequences showed that Aravan virus was more closely related to
genotypes 4, 5, and to a lesser extent 6, which circulates among
insectivorus bats in Europe and Africa. Thus Aravan virus does not appear
to belong to any of the 7 known genotypes of lyssaviruses, namely, rabies,
Lagos bat, Mokola, and Duvenhage viruses and European bat lyssavirus 1,
European bat lyssavirus 2, and Australian bat lyssavirus. It is proposed
that Aravan virus should be designated a new genotype of rabies virus.
Decisions on the taxonomic status of the other bat lyssaviruses (Khujand
virus, Irkut virus, and West Caucasian bat virus), together with an
assessment of their potential as human pathogens, are awaited with
interest. - Mod.CP]
