---------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on cryptosporidiosis in Australia are abstracted from Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2] (primary references available on request):

Rates of cryptosporidiosis in Australia are somewhat higher than those in New Zealand, and 7- to 8-fold those reported in the United States -- graph follows [3] http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Cryptosporid-ANZ.png

Infecting species
-----------------
Sporadic cases of cryptosporidiosis are caused by _Cryptosporidium hominis_, _C. parvum_, _C. andersoni_, and _C. fayeri_.
_Cryptosporidium parvum_ has been detected in the Sydney water supply since 1998.
_Cryptosporidium canis_ has been recovered from dogs, and _C. felis_ from cats -- neither posing a significant public health risk to humans.
_Cryptosporidium_ sp. have been recovered from urban-adapted Common brushtail possums (_Trichosurus vulpecula_) and barramundi (_Lates calcarifer_)
_Cryptosporidium cuniculus_ has been identified in rabbits.
_Cryptosporidium fayeri_, a species associated with marsupials, has been identified in a case of human infection.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 2.2 percent of HIV-positive MSM [men who have sex with men], 0.6 percent of HIV-negative MSM, and 3 percent of controls (Sydney, 2003 to 2006)
- 0.8 percent of stool samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects (Sydney, 2008 to 2009)
- 24.5 percent of pre-weaned sheep (Western Australia, 2009 publication)
- 22.3 percent of pre-weaned calves (Western Australia and New South Wales, 2010 publication)
- 58.5 percent of dairy and beef calves with diarrhea (_Cryptosporidium_ spp., 2011 publication)
- 8.5 percent of fecal samples from animals living in Sydney water catchments (_Cryptosporidium_ spp., 2011 publication)
- 71.4 to 81.3 percent of fecal samples from lambs in southern Western Australia (2011 publication)
- 9.3 percent of western grey kangaroos (_Macropus fuliginosus_) in Western Australia -- 25 percent of these identified as _Cryptosporidium fayeri_ (2011 publication)

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1991 (publication year): an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis was reported among children in Adelaide.
- 1994 to 1995: outbreaks (70 cases) were reported in the Sutherland area of Sydney during September 1994 to January 1995 -- 17 of these acquired from a swimming pool.
- 1998: an outbreak (161 cases confirmed) was reported in The Australian Capital Territory -- 60 percent related to 2 public swimming pools.
- 1998: outbreaks related to swimming pools was reported in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne.
- 2001: an outbreak (47 cases) in Tasmania was ascribed to animal contact at an agricultural show.
- 2002 (publication year): An outbreak was associated with drinking unpasteurized milk.
- 2005: outbreaks (180 cases, approximate) were associated with swimming pools in New South Wales.
- 2008: an outbreak in Sydney was associated with a swimming pool.
- 2009: an outbreak (1141 cases) was associated with swimming pools in New South Wales.
- 2009: an outbreak (628 cases during January to March) was reported in Sydney.

Just a comment concerning the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Cairns, Australia reported 5 Feb volume 2012, number 066. Dr Donohoe has advised adequate swimming pool chlorination as a preventive measure.

However the parasite is chlorine resistant and other measures such as ozonation or ultaviolet treatment of the water would be needed to reduce infectivity. Certainly, changing the swimming pool water after each use as he suggests would be helpful.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for providing background information and Stanley M Cassan for pointing out that _Cryptosporidium_ is inherently resistant to chlorination.
