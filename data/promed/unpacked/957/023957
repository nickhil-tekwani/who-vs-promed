[According to media reports (see http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/25/uk-health-birdflu-france-idUKKBN0TE11C20151125): "This 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in 8 years is located in a southwestern region home to many foie gras and poultry producers.

The outbreak comes just before demand for foie gras, produced from duck or goose liver, peaks over the year-end holiday season, but officials play down any impact."
