Bird Flu Virus Revealed in 2 More Russian Villages
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has been confirmed in 2 more Siberian villages, while 19
others are being kept under observation after reports of suspected
cases, news agencies reported Tuesday [18 Oct 2005]. The 2 infected
villages are located in the western Siberian province of Kurgan,
while those under observation are in the Novosibirsk and Altai
provinces, Russia's agriculture ministry said Monday.
The statement gave no indication of whether the infection involved
the H5N1 strain that has killed more than 60 people in Asia and which
is feared could mutate into to a form easily transmissible between
humans and trigger a major health crisis, AFP reported.
3 other provinces where bird flu was detected earlier -- Chelyabinsk,
Omsk and Tyumen -- are now free of the virus, the statement said. [A
map and background information on Russia's administrative division is
available at 20050908.2666. - Mod. AS]
Russian authorities have culled hundreds of thousands of fowl and
imposed numerous quarantine zones in a bid to wipe out the virus
since it arrived in Siberia this summer [2005].
The spread of bird flu from Asia to Russia, apparently carried by
migratory birds, presaged more recent outbreaks in Europe.
A number of countries have imposed full or partial bans on bird
product imports from Russia and Kazakhstan, where a bird flu outbreak
was also recorded in the summer.

Bird flu confirmed in Tula region
-------------------------------------
The national reference laboratory on bird flu in Vladimir has
confirmed the disease in poultry in the village of Yandovka
[Latitude: 53.034, Longitude: 38.399] in the Tula region, says a
report from the Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service.
"The presence of the antigen and genetic material of the H5N1 virus
subtype has been established in several samples taken from sick birds
in the village. The genetic structure of the virus and its connection
with the virus that caused the outbreak of the disease in Siberia
earlier this year [2005] are being examined," the report says.

[This is the 1st case of avian influenza H5N1 in the European part of
Russia. According to a previous newswire by the Itar-Tass news
agency, sent by A-Lan Banks, the affected farm included 240 chickens,
ducks and geese. Tissue samples were sent yesterday (18 Oct 2005) for
laboratory analysis, an exemplary demonstration of expedient
diagnosis. The village of Yandovka, where the birds died, was
reportedly placed under quarantine upon the initial recorded suspected cases.

China reports bird flu outbreak in Inner Mongolia
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has killed at least 2600 birds at a poultry farm in China's
northern region of Inner Mongolia, and the outbreak has since been
brought under control, Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday [19 Oct 2005].
The birds were killed by the H5N1 strain, which can be fatal to
humans, near the regional capital of Hohhot, the report said, citing
information from China's Agriculture Ministry.
Xinhua said the outbreak had been contained, without mentioning any
human infections or when the outbreak was discovered.
The Health Ministry said it had not heard of any human infections.
Scientists fear H5N1, which emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 and has
infected 117 people in 4 countries and killed 60, could mutate into a
form easily transmissible among humans and spark a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization has said that the strain is endemic in
poultry in China and across much of Asia, meaning it may only be a
matter of time before it develops the ability to pass easily from
human to human.
China neighbors Viet Nam, where the H5N1 strain has killed 37 people,
and hosts sections of 3 global migration routes for migratory birds.
It also has the 2nd largest domestic poultry industry in the world.
China has in the past successfully controlled outbreaks of bird flu
with a combination of vaccinations, culling and surveillance. It
reported 2 outbreaks in the far-flung western regions of Qinghai and
Xinjiang earlier this year [2005]. But it was also widely criticized
for initially trying to cover up the outbreak of SARS, which emerged
in southern China in 2003 and spread around the world, infecting 8000
people and killing 800.

China: 2600 birds found dead of bird flu
---------------------------------------------
Some 2600 birds have been found dead of bird flu in northern China's
grasslands, the government said Wednesday [19 Oct 2005].
In Brussels, a European Union official said there is a suspicion of
bird flu in Macedonia. The disease has already affected birds in at
least 2 other European countries; Romania and Greece.
In Russia, hundreds of birds have died suddenly in a region south of
Moscow, local media reported on Wednesday [19 Oct 2005], raising
fears of a new outbreak of bird flu there. If confirmed, the
discovery in the Tula region, about 125 miles south of Moscow, would
mark the 1st time that the deadly virus has appeared in European
Russia, west of the Ural Mountains.
The dead birds in China were found in a breeding facility in
Tengjiaying, a village near Hohhot, the capital of the Inner
Mongolian region, the official Xinhua news agency reported. They were
infected by the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, Xinhua said. It did
not give any further details.
"The epidemic is under control," Xinhua said [see commentary].
European Union officials said they were preparing to extend a ban on
imports of pet birds and feathers from Siberia because of the bird flu.
EU spokesman Philip Tod also said the EU executive would send experts
to Greece to help identify the bird flu strain there. Health
officials said they will also hold a simulation exercise of a flu
pandemic by the end of the year [2005] to improve preparedness.

The apparent delay in internationally notifying the avian influenza
outbreak in Inner Mongolia illuminates the need for improved
transparency. China's transparency on human and animal-health issues
seems to have been steadily improving since the SARS outbreak, as
reflected by this released news about the (when?) outbreak; further
improvement is expected. The Chinese seem to be perfectly aware of
the expectations; according to an article "Watchful eye on epidemics
during olympiad," published today (Wed 19 Oct 2005) by the official
Xinhuanet, China's public health authorities will report daily
occurrences of epidemics during the Beijing Olympiad to be held in
August 2008. See
