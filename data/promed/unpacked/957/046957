Outbreak of brucellosis in southern Chile
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of bovine brucellosis has been confirmed in the Chilean
province of Osorno, according to the Minister of Agriculture, Alvaro Rojas.
Measures to isolate the outbreak in the rural area of Osorno have
been taken, and "we're talking with farmers about the complications
to rural activities which this entails," Rojas is quoted by an Osorno
daily, adding that since "we have an open alert system," the
reappearance of the outbreak was rapidly detected."
However, Chile's Agriculture and Livestock Service, SAG, responsible
for animal and plant's health, admitted that the exact location of
outbreaks has yet to be determined.
Luis Paredes, from SAG's Livestock department, said that the
outbreaks come as a "great surprise," since "Osorno has been the
region which has most advanced in the matter, and no outbreaks had
been reported for a very long time."
"We believe we are facing isolated cases, but it's a call of
attention to remind us we must be alert at all times," added Paredes.
Veterinary surgeon Francisco Lanuza recalled that immunization of
heifers is essential to avoid outbreak of the disease and must be
done when calves are 5 to 8 months old.
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria of the
genus _Brucella_. These bacteria are primarily passed among animals,
and they cause disease in many different vertebrates. Various
_Brucella_ species affect sheep, goats, cattle, deer, elk, pigs,
dogs, and several other animals. Humans become infected by coming in
contact with animals or animal products that are contaminated with
these bacteria.
In livestock, the bacteria attacks mainly cattle of reproductive age,
causing abortions. An infected animal can rapidly spread the disease,
particularly in areas of high density or concentration, such as dairy farms.
In humans, brucellosis can cause a range of symptoms that are similar
to the flu, and may include fever, sweats, headaches, back pains, and
physical weakness.
Osorno is 900 km south of Santiago and north of Puerto Montt.

It is interesting to note the reference to an "open alert system"
rapidly detecting the disease. What exactly is meant by an "open
alert system" remains in question. Also, they know the region but not
the exact location. Perhaps this is a slaughter report that tested
positive, or perhaps it is an export. There seem to be many
epidemiological questions left unanswered. - Mod.TG]
