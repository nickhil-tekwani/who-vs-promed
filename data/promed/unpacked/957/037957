Ten Human Contacts of Fatal Equine Case Under Surveillance
----------------------------------------------------------
About 10 people in northern Queensland are being tested for symptoms of the
potentially fatal Hendra virus. A horse near Townsville died from the virus
last week. The virus affects the horse's lungs and is spread to people
through body fluids. The latest case was south of Townsville and the
horse's handlers and vet staff are being monitored for symptoms. Last month
a Cairns vet contracted a mild case while conducting an autopsy. The vet
has since recovered.
Tropical health doctor Jeffrey Hannah says the disease originates in flying
foxes during the breeding season. "All of the incidences have been in
Queensland, four of the five in north Queensland and it's at the later part
of the year," he said.
Hendra virus appeared in Brisbane 10 years ago when a trainer and 14 of his
horses died.

[In 1994-95 a new virus appeared in Queensland, killing two humans and
fifteen horses in two separate outbreaks. In January 1999, a single horse
near Cairns died of the disease and in December 2004, Hendra virus was
confirmed in a dead horse from the Townsville area. In the Brisbane
outbreak in September 1994, a total of 13 horses died of hyperacute
respiratory disease with clinical signs similar to African Horse Sickness.
The trainer and a stablehand suffered from respiratory disease at the same
time. The stablehand recovered slowly but the trainer died despite
hospitalisation.
Symptoms in horses include breathing difficulties, high fever and a
blood-tinged foamy discharge from nose and mouth as the virus attacks blood
vessels and causes pulmonary oedema - lungs filled with fluid. Hendra virus
produces both lung and brain disease, consistent with related viruses such
as canine distemper and measles.
The virus was initially called equine morbillivirus, but genetic analysis
of the entire virus later showed that its most appropriate classification
is a new genus within the fa mily _Paramyxoviridae_. The name Hendra virus
originates from the Brisbane suburb in which the original outbreak
occurred. The genus now includes the two virus species _Nipah virus_ and
_Hendra virus_ and has been assigned the name _Henipavirus_
It has been shown experimentally that Hendra virus can cause severe
clinical disease in cats and guinea pigs. There is infection, but no
disease in fruit bats. No infection or disease occurs in dogs, chickens,
rat and mice. Hendra virus does not appear to be highly contagious, but if
an infection occurs it can cause death, except in fruit bats. Fruit bats
(also known as flying foxes) are the natural host of the virus. This means
the virus is carried by fruit bats but has little effect on them. However,
when it is transmitted to humans and horses, its effect is
lethal. Antibodies to Hendra virus have been found in four species of
fruit bats. Approximately 25% of the bats surveyed had antibodies to the
virus. Of 13 wildlife species tested, only bats had antibodies to Hendra virus.
In 1996 the Hendra virus was classified as requiring Level-4 security. More
detailed information can be obtained from the CSIRO web-site
