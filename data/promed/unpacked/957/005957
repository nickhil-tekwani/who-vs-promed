Outbreak in Denmark of Shigella sonnei infections related to uncooked 'baby
maize' imported from Thailand
Twenty-nine cases of _Shigella sonnei_ infection were reported to the
Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen between 27 July and 8 August 1998, 25 of
which were domestically acquired. Usually less than three domestically
acquired cases are reported each week. Most of the cases were adults and
reports were received from all parts of Denmark. In two cases information
supplied by the attending physician suggested that uncooked 'baby maize'
might be the vehicle of the infection. A case control study conducted on 6
and 7 August showed an association between consumption of 'baby maize' and
_S. sonnei_. Of 10 incident cases, 9 had consumed 'baby maize' in a three
day period before onset of illness, compared with none of 10 controls
matched for age, sex, and municipality.
The implicated 'baby maize' was imported from Thailand and distributed in
Denmark in packages of 125 grams. There are only a few importers in Denmark
and the product was distributed to retail outlets throughout the country.
A total of 140 cases of _S. sonnei_ [infection] have been reported to week
32 in 1998. One hundred and one (72%) were not associated with travel,
compared with only 25 domestically acquired cases in the same period of
1997. Many of the cases in 1998 were related to five local outbreaks before
the present widespread outbreak. In each of the five outbreaks, vegetables
or lettuce served in a salad bar or as ingredients in mixed salad have been
the suspected vehicles. It was not possible, however, to identify specific
salad ingredients as the source of the shigella infections. With hindsight,
'baby maize' from Thailand may be the source for most of these outbreaks as
well as for some other sporadic cases in 1998. 'Baby maize' was served in
all the five outbreaks and interviews with _S. sonnei_ patients with dates
of onset of illness before 27 July suggest that this was a more common
exposure compared with exposures to other raw vegetables. Iceberg lettuce,
which previously has been associated with outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ was not
considered a likely source because the iceberg lettuce consumed at each
outbreak had been produced in different countries (Spain, the Netherlands,
and Denmark).
The Danish Food Authority was informed. A press release describing the
problem was issued to the public on 7 August. At the same time importers
and major retailers assisted with implementing withdrawal of the product.
Participants in the European Union Enter-net surveillance network
(scientific coordinator Ian Fisher <ifisher@phls.co.uk> are reviewing
recent data on _S. sonnei_ infection in their countries.
