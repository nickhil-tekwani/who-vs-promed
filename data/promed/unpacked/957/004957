Avian Flu Diary has published an on-line report picked up from several news sources in Viet Nam of 2 people infected with the recently emerged A/H5N6 avian virus in Nghe An Province. Dr. Michael Coston, [editor, Avian Flu Diary] feels the report is accurate, as just over 2 weeks ago, the virus was reported in the adjacent province to the north (see comment below).

An outbreak of avian influenza A / H5N6 outbreak in Quy Hop district, Nghe An, caused an infection in 2 people. The Local Veterinary Authority has issued 11 000 doses of vaccine to control the outbreak. The source Pioneer said outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in the neighborhood of Dinh Xuan Nghia, Quy Hop district, Nghe An. It is a location with concentrated population.

Talking to reporters from dimension 5/4, the Director of DARD in Nghe An, Ho Ngoc Sy, confirmed the report, adding that after the outbreak, the veterinary authorities in collaboration with the district of Nghe implemented advanced emergency measures [in the rural district of Quy Hop] to control and extinguish the outbreak.

"There are families raising chickens, 150 children in [contact with?] infected chickens. The province has mobilized 11 000 doses of vaccine against the disease and will conduct quarantine and disinfection of the whole barn area that has bird flu. They have temporarily banned the sale of poultry in the affected area," said Ho Ngoc Sy.

The Director of Health Services in Nghe An, Long Bui Dinh, said the 2 patients infected with avian influenza A / H5N6 were transferred to Hanoi for treatment.

In early August 2014, H5N6 suddenly popped up in widely separated outbreaks in central and northern Vietnam (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2014/08/oie-two-outbreaks-of-h5n6-in-vietnamese.html), hundreds of kilometers south of its original emergence. Since then there have been at least 6 additional reports of outbreaks in Vietnamese poultry.

Over the past few months China has reported more than 2 dozen outbreaks around the country (see OIE, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public%5C..%5Ctemp%5Creports/en_fup_0000017459_20150403_145032.pdf), and 2 days ago, Fri 3 Apr 2015, FluTrackers reported an unconfirmed case from China: "Farmer suspected H5N6 bird flu case after outbreak in geese," in Wujin District, Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China. (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h5n1-h5n8-h5n6-h5n3-h5n2-h10n8-outbreak-tracking/728618-china-farmer-suspected-h5n6-bird-flu-case-after-outbreak-in-geese-april-3-2015).

[Nghe An is a province in the North Central Coast region of Viet Nam and is Viet Nam's largest province by area.

The first flu case/death from H5N6 was noted in May 2015 in a 49-year-old man from China, Nanbu county, Sichuan province, who had been exposed to dead poultry and died in a hospital after receiving treatment. He suffered a severe case of pneumonia and avian influenza H5N6 strain was detected in a throat swab. This was considered an isolated case. People who had close contact with the patient did not show any symptoms after medical observation. It was thought that because of the widespread distribution of this virus and the rare human infection, that H5N6 is not easily transmissible between birds and humans.

Since early 2013, several new avian influenza virus strains have been reported in East and Southeast Asia, threatening both poultry-dependent livelihoods and human health. In March 2013, avian influenza A(H7N9) emerged in China causing a total of 456 human cases, and claiming 172 lives as of 5 Nov 2014 [645 cases as of 5 Apr 2015]. The virus is of low pathogenicity in poultry (no clinical signs are observed in infected birds, making control difficult) but can cause lethal pulmonary infection in mammals.

Sporadic human cases have also occurred from other avian influenza strains in China. In May 2013, a 20-year-old woman became the 1st human to be infected with another bird flu strain, H6N1. The woman had not been exposed to poultry and she recovered after a few days, according to Taiwanese health officials. In December 2013, China reported the 1st human case of avian flu virus, H10N8, in a 73-year-old woman from Jiangxi province. (http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/07/health/h5n6-flu-china-death/index.html ). 3 additional cases were reported, 2 of whom died.

"Low-path" H5N6 appears to circulate widely globally. But high-path avian influenza H5N6 is a '2nd-generation' HPAI H5 virus that has shown an ability to infect and seriously sicken humans. In early May 2014, the People's Democratic Republic reported outbreaks in poultry caused by highly pathogenic H5N6. This highly pathogenic virus has caused at least 7 H5N6 poultry outbreaks in Viet Nam with the initial outbreak in April 2014 following 2 outbreaks in Lao People's Democratic Republic. The viruses from these 2 countries have been shown to be genetically similar. In March 2015, the Xinhua News Agency reported an outbreak of H5N6 bird flu virus in poultry in Viet Nam's central Thanh Hoa province. According to a report by the Thanh Hoa provincial department of agriculture and rural development on 12 Mar 2015, a bird flu outbreak occurred in a farm in Hai Linh commune, leaving 293 birds sick. H5N6 bird flu virus in poultry was reported in Viet Nam's northern Lang Son and central Ha Tinh provinces in mid-August 2014, according to Viet Nam's Ministry of Health's General Department of Preventive Medicine. Outbreaks spread to several localities across the country including northern Lao Cai, Bac Giang, Phu Tho, central Quang Tri, Quang Ngai, Thua Thien Hue, and Quang Nam provinces.

The diversity of avian influenza viral strains circulating in eastern Asia threatens to give rise to new reassortant viruses in addition to H5N6, with unpredictable consequences for animal and human health. H5N6 should be included among a growing list of emerging disease threats that demand attention through constant monitoring and maintenance of preparedness to respond.
