Re: 1st report of banana freckle, Cavendish strain, in Australia
----------------------------------------------------------------
This report raises a very interesting point: is freckle disease on Cavendish banana plants widespread on islands in the Pacific other than those of Hawai'i, where it is well known?

Recent research in Australia [see reference below] has shown that what was originally considered to be 'Cavendish [AAA genome; see comment below] competent' and 'cooking banana (ABB) and plantain (AAB)' strains of the one fungus (_Phyllosticta musarum_) are actually 4 separate _Phyllosticta_ species. _P. cavendishii_ is described as a new, widely distributed species, appearing primarily on Cavendish, but also on non-Cavendish banana cultivars. The data in that paper include 2 records of the newly named species from 2 locations in the Pacific other than Hawai'i -- Tonga and Micronesia.

I have always tried to keep a look out for freckle on Cavendish when I have come across them on many different islands in the Pacific, and so far I have not seen any. It would be great to broaden the study of this group of fungi, now that molecular tools are available for a more definitive ID.

[We thank Dr Davis for these interesting comments and the valuable information.

There may have been 2 previous observations of freckle on Cavendish in Western Australia (1979 and 2001), but no confirmed reports seem to be available.

The majority of today's cultivated bananas are related to either _Musa acuminata_ (A) and/or _M. balbisiana_ (B). These varieties are mostly triploid and sterile; some diploid and partly fertile cultivars exist as well. The specific genetic background of a banana variety is indicated by the letters A or B. For example, the Cavendish genome is represented by AAA.

Banana freckle is caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta maculata_ and affects leaves and fruit of _Musa_ species. Symptoms include dark spots resulting in a rough surface ('sandpaper feel'; due to protruding fungal structures), leaf streaking and yellowing, as well as loss of plant vigour. Severe infections may lead to wilting and death of plants. Fruit yield and quality can be reduced significantly. The fungus is spread on individual plants by spores moving in water on the leaf or fruit surface, or within plantings by windblown water droplets over short distances. Long distance spread occurs mostly with infected plant material. Disease management may include fungicide and cultural techniques (such as bagging of fruit bunches).
