State officials said [Mon 17 Nov 2014] that 312 of the 355 livestock quarantines issued since the beginning of a vesicular stomatitis outbreak earlier this year [2014] have been released.

"As colder weather and snow has moved into the area, the fly population should be reduced and decrease the transmission of (the disease)," Keith Roehr, state veterinarian, said in a statement. "Hopefully the incidence of this disease will trend downward with the temperatures, but continue to be vigilant for the clinical signs of the disease."

An outbreak first reported 14 Jul 2014 in Boulder County has been running rampant through the state's livestock and is said to be the worst in roughly a decade. The quarantines have been issued statewide, although the virus has mostly been contained to northern Colorado.

As of [Mon 17 Nov 2014], 43 locations remained under quarantine.

The disease causes oral blisters and sores that can cause livestock pain and hinder eating and drinking. Horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids are all susceptible to infection.

[This has been a tough year for animal owners facing vesicular stomatitis. It has been widespread in both Colorado and Texas. It is good news to know that most of the quarantines have been lifted.

Readers are encouraged to read my comments on ProMED-mail post 20140927.2811014 for more information on the vesicular stomatitis virus.
