Results of tests conducted on local dairy products were negative for bovine
tuberculosis, chairman of the Cooperative Societies Union (CSU) Mohammed
Al-Ansari told Al-Jarida.

Al-Ansari confirmed the Public Authority for Agricultural Affairs and Fish
Resources (PAAAFR) took the necessary precautionary measures immediately
after receiving reports that some cows at the cattle farms in Sulaibiya are
infected with the disease. He said the Union met officials of Kuwait
Industries Union to put in place a mechanism to contain the disease and
protect the health of consumers.

On the other hand, chairman of the Union of Fresh Dairy Products Ahmad
Abdulkarim Al-Ahmad revealed the PAAAFR has agreed to slaughter 1300 cows
in Sulaibiya, which were found infected with the disease. He said the
authority also granted a compensation of KWD 800 [USD 3000] per slaughtered
cow to the owners.

Meanwhile, the chairman of the Board of Directors of Ardiya Cooperative
Society said the co-op and its branches removed locally-produced fresh milk
and its byproducts from their shelves to ensure the safety of consumers. He
explained they are waiting for an official announcement from the Ministry
of Health and Kuwait Municipality that these products are safe for human
consumption before putting them back on the shelves. Commenting on
Al-Ansari's criticisms on the precautionary steps taken by the cooperative
societies, the chairman stressed "we put the health of consumers on top of
our priorities, as protecting people's health is more important than money."

[ProMED-mail posting 20080504.1526, which addressed bovine tuberculosis in
Kuwait, included the following 2 requests for information:
1. According to OIE's WAHID interface, bovine tuberculosis, a reportable
disease, is endemic in Kuwait. During the period July-December 2007, 2
outbreaks were reported in Al Jahrah; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_status_detail_pop&pop=1&diseaseid=32&country=KWT&y=2007&m=7&admin1=1626&detail=3&sdid=123198>.
Reportedly, out of 1261 susceptible bovines, there were 522 cases, of which
5 were slaughtered. The large number of "cases" ( only 5 of which were
slaughtered) needs clarifying.

2. Information on Kuwait's policy and the number of tuberculin tests
performed within the framework of its declared "targeted surveillance" in
the local bovine population would be helpful.

The above information remains to be obtained.

The following educated commentary from Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo is gratefully
acknowledged. It provides some useful background information on the disease
situation in the region, addresses public health issues of the event and
raises some crucial issues, while underlining the need for complementary
information and additional diagnostic efforts. - Mod.AS]

The public health value of this post prompts a comment. Finding TB in 1300
animals within a very short time is indeed worrying. Was the specificity
limitation of the commonly used tuberculin test taken into consideration?
It is also worrying because tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and
movements of potentially infected cattle and farm personnel may have
occurred. If all the animals are truly positive, it is not impossible that
a great deal of re-infection has been going on which could have affected
the herders/workers at the farms. They may need to be tested not just for
their health but to prevent infecting other people and animals.

Since the aim of public health intervention is to break transmission to
other susceptible hosts, should it be assumed that slaughtering means
destruction, such that the animals killed do not find another route back
into the food chain? Intentional consumption of improperly disposed of
organs may particularly involve the disadvantaged in the society, such as
nationless persons and the low paid, poorly educated foreign workers
(mostly from Africa or Asia).

In addition, improperly disposed of carcasses may give rise to
aerosolization and re-infection, exposing persons, cattle and other
susceptible animals to infection.

Cats, which are ubiquitous in the Gulf countries, can be infected. Unless
the biosecurity measures at the slaughter site or farm is of high
standards, cats may access and spread infection.

Camels can also play a role in local TB epidemiology; this deserves further
studies. For a relevant and recent piece of information from Dubai (UAE),
where the Central veterinary lab detected TB in a racing camel herd, see
Ref 1. The fact that they isolated and molecularly typed the isolate makes
their work outstanding in the region. However, their study is limited to a
single farm and may be viewed as convenient sampling (another paper,
published earlier, addressed the same outbreak). Since the laboratory
services are available mainly or exclusively to racing camels, data
concerning the majority of camels in the region, especially those bred for
milking or slaughtering, may be missing. Not all animals are equal.

The possible presence of drug resistant TB strains may complicate the issue
even further. Further studies of bovine TB in the region, including
genotyping of the human isolates, is thus urgently needed. This need is
amplified by the fact that though zoonotic TB seems to be endemic and
uncontrolled in the region, very little molecular typing of human isolates
of TB goes on, particularly in cases assumed to be zoonotic because of the
pathological lesions or known occupational/geographical risks. Unlike in
Africa, lack of resources is most unlikely to be the reason for the lack of
use of molecular discriminatory tools.

ProMED-mail may want to know more about the reach of the targeted
surveillance as well as the diagnostic methods and isolates, if any.
