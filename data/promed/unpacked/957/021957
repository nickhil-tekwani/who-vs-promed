New cases of trichinellosis in Novosibirsk (Russia)
---------------------------------------------------
A family of hunters residing in the Chistoozernaya district of the
Novosibirsk region has been affected by trichinellosis. 2 family members
were admitted to hospital in serious condition.
According to the newspaper Vesti Novosibiskaya, only 11 cases were
registered [in Novosibirsk] during 2003, while 5 times as many cases have
already been registered in 2004. Health officials are recommending that the
public beware of meat that has not passed veterinary inspection.

covers 775 000 square km. - Mod.NR
The report mentions that there were hunters in the family, suggesting that
they had consumed wild meat. If this is the case, infection with
trichinella is not surprising. If, however, the infection was acquired
through farm-raised pork, it is more worrisome. More information on the
source of infection is needed. - Mod.EP]
