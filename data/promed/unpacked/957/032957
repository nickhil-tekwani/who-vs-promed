The Kwara State Government says it has discovered 2 cases of yellow fever disease at Oro Ago area in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state.

The state's Commissioner for Health, Sulaiman Alege, to reporters on [Mon 18 Sep 2017] at his office in Ilorin, the state capital that a male and female were tested positive for the disease.

Alege said a medical team from the State Ministry of Health had visited some communities in the local government where 38 samples were collected and sent to the Virology Unit of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital.

He said Oro Ago is densely populated and susceptible to mosquito bites, adding that government is improving on sensitising residents of the area.

The commissioner, however, said health organisations were conducting further analysis to provide immunisation and treatment to the 2 affected victims aged 14 and 10.

[This is a report of a 2nd case of yellow fever (YF) in Oro Ago area of Kwara state. The collection of 38 blood samples from individuals in some communities suggests that there is a suspicion that YF virus may be circulating in an area wider than the Oro Ago area. Although the report indicates that mosquitoes are common in the area, the critical question is whether _Aedes aegypti_, the common vector of YF virus, is abundant there. With this 2nd case, and perhaps more, intensified surveillance and a targeted vaccination campaign are urgent. Treatment of the 2 cases is urgent also. However, it is too late for vaccination of these 2 individuals -- they are already infected. One hopes that fake YF vaccination cards have not been sold in this area, providing a false sense of protection.
