Puppy giveaway leads to rabies alert
---------------------------------------
What began as a give-away at a flea market in Litchfield, Minn., last month
has turned into a search for 4 puppies, and the humans who adopted them,
because they might be infected with rabies. State epidemiologist Dr. Harry
Hull warned Tuesday [14 Nov 2000 that at least one of a litter of 10
puppies had rabies. Four [that were given away at the flea market might be
infected, but health officials don't know who has them. "The most urgent
priority is to locate these 4 puppies to determine if they are ill or if
families that have them need to get rabies shots," Hull said.
If infected, the puppies could spread rabies to humans through a bite or a
scratch, and even potentially by licking a person with an open wound.
Anyone who has the puppies or came in contact with them at the flea market
should call the Minnesota Department of Health at 1-877-676-5414 so that
their risk of rabies exposure can be evaluated.
The 10-to 12-week-old puppies are black and are a mix of German shepherd
and Labrador. The flea market was held about a mile east of Litchfield on
Hwy. 12. The puppies were given away from the back of a black or dark blue
pickup with Iowa license plates. The truck was parked near the entrance to
the flea market, next to a lunch cart, the Health Department said.
The mother of the litter has died, apparently from rabies. The owner who
gave away the puppies has been located and has provided information about
the whereabouts of the five puppies that were not given away at the flea
market. They will be quarantined or destroyed. Health officials became
aware of the case after a veterinarian suspected that one puppy from the
flea market had rabies. It was found to have the disease on Monday after it
had been euthanized and a necropsy was done. The family that adopted the
puppy is receiving rabies shots as a preventive measure, and the veterinary
team that came in contact with the animal is receiving booster shots.
Rabies can only be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms
appear. After the onset of symptoms, which include numbness, dizziness and
paralysis, the disease is often fatal. [Recorded recoveries are
extraordinary and very very few. You die. -MHJ
Minnesota had its first case of human rabies in 25 years when a Becker
County man died of rabies last month after being bitten by a bat. He did
not seek treatment for the bite until weeks later. Last year, Minnesota
animal-control officials investigated 135 possible cases of rabies in
animals. Of those, 92 were in dogs, and 63 of them were euthanized as
suspected rabies cases.

[As it is now the 15th of November and exposure was "last month." Anyone
exposed is running out of time as the usual shortest incubation period is
21 days. The vaccine works very well if initiated in time. - Mod.MHJ
