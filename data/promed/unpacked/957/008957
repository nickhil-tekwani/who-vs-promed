A Hong Kong man developed dizziness, numbness, and shortness of breath around 5 minutes after consuming honey at home on 25 Mar 2017 in what has been diagnosed as a case of so-called "mad honey" poisoning.

The 37-year-old was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on the same day for treatment. He discharged himself, against medical advice, the next day and is reported to be in stable condition, Sing Pao reported.

An initial investigation by the Center for Health Protection showed the honey contained grayanotoxin, a neurotoxin that can affect nerves and muscles, and has earned the epithet "mad honey" in the Black Sea region of Turkey where cases have been reported of people falling ill after eating honey.

The toxin comes from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family, including rhododendrons, from which bees collect nectar and pollen.

The Hong Kong man said the honey he ate was from Nepal and he bought it from a friend. Investigations are ongoing, Oriental Daily reported.

The Center for Health Protection advised the public to buy honey from a reliable source, discard honey with a bitter or astringent taste, and pay special attention to honey from Nepal and the Black Sea region of Turkey.

[Rhododendrons are very nice, large plants or hedges and do contain grayanotoxin. Bees love the blooms of the rhododendrons and can transfer the grayanotoxin to the honey.

Grayanotoxin in honey can produce renal and/or cardiac failure. With rapid and appropriate treatment the cardiac issues typically resolve in approximately 24 hours. Resolution of cardiac issues, may help prevent the renal issues, which may take a little longer. This patient should at least be checked at the end of the week, and of course sooner, if he was severely affected.

Various rhododendron species, depending on their location, are most likely to cause this. Some of the species are: _Rhododendron ponticum_, _R. occidentale_, _R. macrophyllum_, and _R. albiflorum_. Azaleas, are also in this family and produce grayanotoxin. Other members of the botanical family Ericaceae, to which rhododendrons and azaleas belong, can produce grayanotoxin-contaminated honey. Among these, mountain laurel (_Kalmia latifolia_) and sheep laurel (_K. angustifolia_) are probably the most important sources of the toxin. - Mod.TG
