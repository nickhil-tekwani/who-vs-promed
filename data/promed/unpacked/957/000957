Manitoba Pork has released an update on the number of cases of the porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus as of 28 Aug 2019:

- 68 cases of PED (29 finisher, 13 nursery, 25 sow, 1 quarantine): of these, 8 are transitional and 60 are positive;
- 56 in southeast Manitoba, 9 west of the Red River in the Lowe Farm/Morris area, 2 in Whitemouth, 1 in Notre Dame de Lourdes.

Pork producers are encouraged to consult their herd veterinarians and visit Manitoba Pork's biosecurity webpage (https://www.manitobapork.com/animal-care/biosecurity).

Registered producers can log in to the password-protected Manitoba Coordinated Disease Response (MCDR) to access more detailed information on PED-affected premises, including status, location and manure application (https://www.manitobapork.com/animal-care/swine-health/manitoba-coordinated-disease-response-mcdr).

All Manitoba producers are urged to sign up for the MCDR. To register for the MCDR, or for any other swine health concerns, contact Jenelle Hamblin, Manitoba Pork's Manager of Swine Health Programs, at 204-235-4442 or <jhamblin@manitobapork.com>.

[PED virus causes severe dehydration and diarrhea in pigs and is generally fatal in young animals. It does not transmit to humans or other animals and is no risk to food safety. This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long-lasting effect on the price of pork in the province and the nation.

However, diseases such as this affect all the workers with ill and dying piglets and pigs. Although biosecurity is important, it can also take a toll on workers through investigations into where a biosecurity lapse could have occurred.

A refresher course on biosecurity and what it means and how to put it into action is always an appropriate reminder in the face of a disease such as this. Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases. Viruses are impossible to see, and what cannot be seen can more easily slip through a biosecurity protocol. Someone forgets to wash the boots or the truck. It almost takes 2 people to remember to do all required every time until the protocol becomes a habit.

We certainly hope this situation is resolved and does not spread. Furthermore, we hope this is not a new strain of the virus representing an impending outbreak in other areas. - Mod.TG
