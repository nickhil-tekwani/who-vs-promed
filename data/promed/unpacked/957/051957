After over a month after a mysterious fever gripped 260 people of
Deol village in the Kangra district, medical authorities in the
district have detected some patients with typhus. A report of the
Central Research Institute, Kasauli (CRI), where the blood samples of
the patients were sent for examination, has confirmed 12 cases as
positive for the rickettsial disease typhus. No deaths have been
reported so far.
According to epidemiologist at Rajendra Prasad Medical College
(RPMC), Dr R.K. Sood, "The preliminary report of CRI has not
confirmed the species of typhus, for which the blood samples of the
12 patients have been sent to National Institute for Communicable
Diseases (NICD), Delhi. Until their report, we would not like to jump
to conclusions."
He is monitoring the situation of Deol village since the 1st week of
July 2007, when the 3 medical teams were sent out for a survey of the
village for the 1st time after cases of fever started surfacing in the village.
Sood said patients suffering with typhus have reported symptoms of
moderate headache, fever, and shivering. They have been put on
doxycycline and chloramphenicol and are responding positively.
Experts say it is a mixed outbreak as many patients also tested
positive for typhoid.
Of the 260 cases of fever detected in the house-to-house survey in
Deol village, 200 have recovered and the rest are under treatment.
Cases are said to be declining although 4-6 new cases are being
reported everyday.
Since the past week [16-22 Jul 2007], patients with high-grade fever
are pouring in at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH)
and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hos parts of Shimla district. Senior Medical
Superintendent of IGMCH Dr Hardayal Chauhan said about 20 such cases
have been reported so far, but none of them have tested positive for
typhus or scrub typhus. A few patients with fever and typhoid are
also being treated in the hospital.

[The Kangra and Shimla districts are both located in the Indian state
of Himachal Pradesh, in the far north of the country. These districts
are clearly separate geographically from the Kerala state in the
south, where cases of typhus, including one fatality, have been
reported over the past week and reported by ProMED-mail (See map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg>).
It is not entirely clear whether this is truly louse-borne epidemic
typhus rather than the usually milder scrub typhus and other
varieties and, as mentioned, some abdominal typhus (typhoid).
The mountainous areas of Himachal Pradesh, however, can certainly
facilitate the harboring of the clothing (body) louse more easily
than areas of hotter climate where much less clothing is worn.
