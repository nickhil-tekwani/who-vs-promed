[1] Wilt diseases, black pepper - Kerala

The Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development (DASD) conducted
the annual pepper survey in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. Pepper
production in Kerala is expected to increase in Idukki district, but
it is seen declining in Wayanad, sources said. Idukki now accounts
for 60 percent of the pepper production from the state.

Indian pepper output has dipped drastically from around 75 000 to 100
000 tonnes to the current levels of around 55 000 tonnes because of
disease and declining productivity.

The survey reports a decline in production in Karnataka while the
crop in Tamil Nadu is expected to be normal.

Viet Nam has overtaken India as the largest pepper producer with per
hectare productivity of around 1200 kg [approx 2700 lb] to 1300 kg
[approx 2900 lb], while India's per hectare output is just around 314
kg [approx 700 lb]. Spices Board has drawn up plans to increase
production and viability of pepper farming.

[2] Corm rot, saffron - Jammu & Kashmir

Saffron spice cultivation should be a growth industry for Indian
Kashmir. It's a niche industry with potentially high returns: the
spice is the world's most expensive by weight and sells for more than
USD 5000 a kilogram in India alone.

However, local farmers struggle to make ends meet. Production of the
labour-intensive crop totalled 40 tonnes a year in the early 1990s
but now has slumped to just 6 tonnes annually from the 226 villages
that grow the crop, according to the government agriculture
department. Many former farmers say that falling production prompted
them to sell up and walk away from a tradition that dates back at
least 1000 years.

The flowers carpet the fields but then die off after several weeks.
Firdos Nehvi, Kashmir's leading saffron scientist and an associate
professor in the state's main agriculture university, says declining
rainfall in the mountainous region is a serious problem. Over the
past 2 years the crop has been hit by a disease called saffron corm
rot, caused by a pathogen that spread when apples and saffron were
grown in the same fields, said Nehvi.

[Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_)
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_ was reported to cause
problems in Wayanad earlier in 2009. It is considered the most
serious threat to this crop in India and a yield decline of 75
percent has been reported in some instances. It affects leaves and
vines, but once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies within a
month. The fungus is spread by splashing rain and mechanical means.
It has a very wide host range and therefore a large pathogen
reservoir making it difficult to control. Disease management includes
fungicides, biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars,
and cultural practices.

Slow wilt (also called slow decline, yellows) caused by nematodes is
also present in Kerala. Symptoms include leaf yellowing and shedding,
root degeneration, blackening of branches, and eventual death of the
vine. Disease management of nematodes is difficult and includes
nematicides, use of resistant host varieties, and crop rotation with
non-host species. Both quick and slow wilt diseases are likely to be
affecting black pepper yields in India at present.

Saffron (_Crocus sativus_) is an important crop used as a spice and
for pharmaceutical purposes. Corm rot is a great threat to the
saffron industry particularly in India. Fungal pathogens such as
_Fusarium_, _Penicillium_, and _Rhizoctonia_ species have been
reported from corm rot affected saffron crops. In addition, recently
_Athelia rolfsii_ (previously _Sclerotium r._) was found to be a
major pathogen associated with the disease in Kashmir. Symptoms start
as small patches in a field that gradually enlarge each year and
include brown, sunken, irregular lesions below corm scales. Leaves
from severely infected corms dry up from the tip downwards and corms
rot. Stress factors like the drought reported above may make plants
more susceptible to infection. Disease management includes cultural
measures and corm treatment with fungicides.

_A. rolfsii_ is an omnivorous, soilborne fungus common in warm and
humid regions. It affects at least 500 species in 100 families
including many crops. While the pathogen has been reported to cause
root rot in apple nurseries, other species could also serve as
reservoirs if co-cultivated with saffron crops.
