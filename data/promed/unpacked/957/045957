Authorities to euthanize surviving Hendra virus horse
-----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says the only horse to
recover from Hendra virus at a south-east Queensland vet clinic will
have to be put down as a precaution. A total of 4 other infected
horses have died since the outbreak at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic
in July 2008. 2 workers remain in hospital after also becoming
infected with the virus.

Biosecurity Queensland chief veterinary officer, Dr. Ron Glanville,
says a decision to destroy the surviving racehorse was made in line
with national guidelines. "As part of our response to this incident,
we have got one horse left now that's been infected with this Hendra
virus and has now recovered," he said. "But the national policy in
relation to these horses is that they need to be put down to protect
the future health of both people and horses."

Horse with Hendra recovered, but condemned
------------------------------------------
The owner of a racehorse which appeared to have recovered from Hendra
virus has been advised that the national AusVetPlan requires the
horse be euthanized to ensure it cannot infect humans or other horses
in the future. The advice was provided following a meeting of the
chief veterinary officers from around Australia at which it was noted
the AusVetPlan states any horse which has been confirmed with
positive test results to Hendra must be destroyed.

The AusVetPlan is a nationally approved set of best practice policies
for responding to emergency diseases. The meeting also took advice
from medical authorities, and an expert group reviewed current
scientific information about the risks associated with recovered horses.

Biosecurity Queensland's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Ron Glanville,
said there is a real risk the horse could relapse with the disease in
the future and pose a risk to other horses or humans. "The AusVet
plan is very clear on what is required, to prevent any further spread
of this highly fatal disease. In these cases, human health and safety
must come 1st," Dr. Glanville said. "In the interests of protecting
people and horses from further infection, euthanasia is the most
appropriate response," he said.

Biosecurity Queensland, a specialist unit within the Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries, has been managing the response to
the latest Hendra virus outbreaks, at Redlands and Proserpine, in
cooperation with the owners of the animals involved, local
veterinarians and a range of stakeholder organisations.

[Let's hope they bleed it out and save the antibody-rich serum. It
could be used to save another horse. - Mod.JW

If the horse has recovered and is being euthanized anyway, then it
would be appropriate to learn something of how and why this animal
recovered.

Furthermore it would serve much more purpose to keep the animal alive
[in quarantine] and continue to monitor it to understand why its
immune system kicked off this virus while the other animals died.
There is far too little known about this disease, and it appears that
a theoretical risk of transmission may be risking more by not studying
the survivor. - Mod.TG
