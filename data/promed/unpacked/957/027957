An Everett, Washington, man who was sickened with [a] hantavirus
[infection] earlier this summer is a reminder to take care when
camping or sweeping or cleaning at home, public health officials say.
The man, who is in his 40s, is recovering from the virus [infection]
he acquired while camping in central Washington. The man's case is
thought to have occurred in late June [2010]. No further information,
such as whether the man was hospitalized, was immediately available,
said Suzanne Pate, spokeswoman.

Hantavirus[es] are spread by inhaling dust from droppings, urine or
nesting materials of infected deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].
Initially it causes symptoms such as fatigue, fever and muscle aches.
It can progress to cause shortness of breath, and can kill.

The Snohomish County man is thought to be the 2nd case reported so
far this year in Washington, Pate said. A King County patient was
recently hospitalized with [a] hantavirus [infection] and then
discharged, she said.

Typically, 1-5 cases are reported in the state each year. [A]
Hantavirus can occur anywhere in the state because mice are found
throughout Washington, said Mary Small, a spokeswoman for the
Chelan-Douglas Health District, the area of the state where the
Everett man was camping.

Nationally, 534 hantavirus [infection] cases have been reported, more
than 500 of which have occurred since 1993, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 36 percent of all cases
have resulted in death.

Health officials say the risk of getting the virus can be reduced by
airing out cabins, checking for signs of rodent infestation and
disinfecting cabins or shelters before sleeping in them. Instead of
sweeping or vacuuming, spray areas with a mix of 1 1/2 cups of bleach
to a gallon of water.

[Although several hantaviruses occur in North America that can cause
human disease, the hantavirus involved in this case is not stated,
but very likely is Sin Nombre virus.

reservoir rodent host of Sin Nombre virus, is available at
