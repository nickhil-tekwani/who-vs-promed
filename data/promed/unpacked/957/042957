2004/044 _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ found in Finland
---------------------------------------------------------
Potato ring rot caused by _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_
[Cms] (EPPO A2 list) was found in Finland, between Oct 2003 and Feb 2004,
on 4 farms producing ware (table) potatoes. The following potato lots were
found infested: _Solanum tuberosum_, cv. Matilda (3 lots - 8.82 ha), Van
Gogh (1 lot, 3.26 ha), Fambo (1 ha), Asterix and Van Gogh (1 lot, 0.31 ha)
and Matilda (1 lot, 0.06 ha).
These findings were made during investigations done to trace back
infestations that had been found during market control. Investigations are
continuing to identify farms that used the same seed potato clones that
were found infected in the 4 farms concerned. Official phytosanitary
measures are taken according to EU Directive 93/85/EEC and the Decision of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 100/95.
The situation of Cms in Finland can be described as follows: present, found
on ware potatoes in a limited number of farms, under eradication.

[According to Antec International, a balanced, stabilised blend of
peroxygen compounds, surfactant, organic acids, and an inorganic buffer
system [Virkon-S] is recommended as a means of controlling Cms and
_Ralstonia solanacearum_, [Rs] which cause bacterial ring rot [BRR] and
potato brown rot [PBR], respectively. Sanitation, cleanliness, and
disinfection are the keys to eradication of bacterial ring rot. If either
pathogen is confirmed on a commercial farm, a thorough clean-up of storage
and equipment must be carried out to reduce the chance of any bacteria
remaining and causing contamination of incoming certified seed lots
destined for the following year's potato crop. Access to seed storages and
equipment by commercial growers and their trucks should be limited and
controlled. Equipment should not be shared between commercial and seed
farms, and all trucks from commercial potato farms should be cleaned and
disinfected before they enter seed storages or seed handling areas. Because
of the volume of references, I am citing only 2 references, one for potato
wilt and the other for clavibacter. - Mod.DH]
