There has been a 10-fold increase in cases of measles across Lancashire, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has said. In the last year, the number of confirmed cases has risen from 6 to 59, classing it as an outbreak. More than 600 cases have been confirmed in the North West this year [2012], with most on Merseyside and in west Lancashire.

Dr Ken Lamden from the HPA said the low uptake of the MMR jab in the late 1990s was partly to blame. "There is also more infection in other areas of the country, making it more likely that it will pass into Lancashire," he added. "Because we're seeing more cases, and it's a highly infectious disease, we're particularly concerned about schools and nurseries where children could be easily affected."

Dr Lamden added: "Anyone who isn't fully vaccinated is liable to be vulnerable to it."

A measles outbreak has hit a Bolton secondary school and a nursery, with 31 children coming down with the illness. The majority of the cases were in the last few days among pupils at Harper Green School, Farnworth and babies at a nursery in Bromley Cross.

Now, parents are being urged to get any children who have not had the MMR jab, or who have not had the 2nd booster injection, immunised to stop the spread of the disease. It is thought to have spread among the secondary school children who have not had their MMR jab, or who have not had their 2nd booster. Babies affected at the nursery are thought to be under 12.5 months old, the age when they are immunised.

In 2011 in Bolton, there was just one case of measles, but so far this year [2012], there have been 31 confirmed cases and 7 possible cases. Immunisation levels in Bolton are currently at 96.3 per cent, higher than the national threshold of 95 per cent [for elimination of measles virus infection]. But in 1998, immunisation levels of babies dropped after controversial research was published which claimed to link the MMR jab with autism. At its lowest point, the rate was just 84 per cent.

There has been a huge rise in measles cases across the UK this year [2012], and, in Greater Manchester, there have been 98 confirmed cases this year, compared to 21 in 2011. Of these, the majority are in Wigan and Bolton, with 15 cases part of a national outbreak amongst the traveller [Roma] community. In September 2012, 3 children living in the Hall Lane travellers' camp, Moses Gate, were diagnosed with measles. The current outbreak is not linked to those cases.

Of the children affected in the recent scare, 2 needed hospital treatment. Staff from the HPA have visited both the school and the nursery and immunised any children who have not had the MMR jab or the booster. A pregnant member of staff at the school and another staff member with health complications were sent home as a precaution.

Harper Green deputy head Sara Cain said the outbreak seemed to have been contained, and there had been no new cases this week. She added: "We had a few children who had contracted measles. Generally, these were children who did not have the MMR and were slightly more susceptible.

Health protection specialist Graham Munslow, from NHS Bolton, said it was the highest number of cases in Bolton in more than 12 years. "It is not like chicken pox; measles is much more damaging to children."

[Bolton is located in the Greater Manchester area. A description and map of the Greater Manchester area can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area.

The Greater Manchester Urban Area is an area of land defined by the Office for National Statistics, consisting of the large conurbation that encompasses the city of Manchester and the continuous metropolitan area that spreads outwards from it, forming much of Greater Manchester in North West England. According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the Greater Manchester Urban Area has a population of 2 240 230, making it the United Kingdom's 3rd most populous conurbation after the Greater London and the West Midlands urban areas. - Mod.CP]

Twelve new cases of measles in children and young people have been diagnosed in the past week, public health officials have confirmed. Three patients have been treated in hospital but have all now been released. Six schools across the Swansea Bay area are said to have children with the highly infectious disease. Letters have now been sent to parents of children in all schools in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot warning of an epidemic. The letter sent by Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in Communicable Disease Control Mid and West Wales Health Protection Team, urges parents to make sure their children are vaccinated.

Measles is highly contagious and is generally spread from person to person by respiratory droplets such as coughs and sneezes. Early symptoms include a high temperature, cough, painful red eyes, and sometimes small white spots inside the mouth. A red, blotchy rash appears around 3 days later, usually starting on the face and then spreading down the rest of the body. Any person with a rash should stay at home for 5 days after the start of the rash.

The best way to get protection from measles is by vaccination. In the UK, each child should have the 1st MMR vaccine just after their 1st birthday and the 2nd between the ages of 3 and 5 years. If your child is aged one or older and missed being vaccinated, or if you yourself have not been, you and your child can still be vaccinated.

An outbreak of measles in the Ambursa/Kardi Development Area in Kebbi State has caused the deaths of 5 children and isolation of 187 others. An official of the Primary Health Care (PHC) in the area, Isa Abubakar, told journalists in Ambursa on Thu 6 Dec 2012 that, initially, 192 children were afflicted by the disease. He said that state, federal, and international agencies had intervened to curtail the spread of the disease and provide drugs to victims.

The Chairman of Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area, Musa Dan-Illelah, who inspected the isolation camp and victims in Ambursa, lamented the deaths of the children because of the scourge. He said that efforts would be intensified to ensure the prevention of the spread of the disease to other communities in the state, especially immunisation of children against the 6 killer diseases[?]. He said that drugs and medical facilities would be provided at the designated place of isolation for the victims.

Measles is a serious hazard to the health of children with acute respiratory diseases. Measles is highly contagious and prone to occur as epidemics. In 2012, cases of measles have been fewer than in 2011. But in some provinces such as Hubei, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Qinghai, and Sichuan, the number of cases recorded in 2012 has been higher than reported previously.

As of 22 Nov 2012, the situation in Yunnan province in particular has been grim, with 336 confirmed cases reported since the beginning of the year, an increase of 208.26 percent compared to the same period in 2011 (109 cases), which placed the province under great pressure to react to this situation. The Health Department of Yunnan Province, the province the CDC regards as the most important in the struggle to combat measles virus infection, instructed the province to initiate a comprehensive vaccination programme to raise population immunity, starting within 14 days from Wed 6 Dec 2012.

Measles vaccination is planned for children aged 8 months to 4 years old, born on or after 1 Jan 2008. Children with no history of measles vaccination should be vaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine.

Measles vaccine contraindications:
(1) Children suffering from serious diseases, acute or chronic infection, fever, and with immunodeficiency disease or long-term use of immunosuppressive agents.
(2) Children with a history of allergies (especially those allergic to egg protein, and with a neomycin allergy).

Notes on vaccination:
(1) Children fasting or fatigued should not be vaccinated to prevent fainting.
(2) After inoculation, children should rest, be allowed to drink plenty of water, and avoid becoming chilled.
(3) A minority of children may exhibit swelling at the site of inoculation, fever, or exhibit an allergic reaction. Therefore, vaccinees should be kept under observation for a period of 30 minutes following vaccination.
(4) Children should not be bathed on the day of vaccination.

A responsible person from the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) mentioned that measles infection is spreading among children under 12 years old in a Kachin refugee camp at area No. 6 on the Myanmar-China border, and they are providing vaccination to the children. A local authority, U Dwel Pe Sar, says that only one or 2 children had measles at the beginning of November 2012, but now more than 40 children have the infection. Thus, the health department from KIO provided vaccination for the children in the camp last week.

He says: "The infection is transmitted to many children, but with no fatalities yet. We have provided vaccination and medical staff. They think the children in the camp had not received vaccine prior to this outbreak."

Now, there are more than 800 people in this camp. The people ran away from their villages due to warfare and now stay in this camp. Since the children had not been vaccinated earlier, infection has spread in the camp. Measles infection can spread rapidly and can be fatal if severe. Thus, vaccination should be provided to the children in order to prevent the infection.

A 10-day measles vaccination campaign was funded by UNICEF and WHO and was carried out in all states and regions during March 2012.
