'Brain-eating amoeba' _Naegleria fowleri_ claimed its 1st victim of 2017 in Karachi on [Fri 14 Apr 2017], health officials said.

According to the Sindh Department of Health, the victim was identified as a 23-year-old resident of Tando Allah Yar [Tando Allahyar, Sindh]. He succumbed to the lethal amoeba while admitted at a private hospital in the city.

_N. fowleri_, which is found in freshwater, claimed 5 lives during 2016, Health Department officials said.

Doctors and health experts say _Naegleria_ usually enters the brain and attacks the nervous system when infected water is ingested through the nasal cavity while bathing, swimming, or performing ablution.

The deadly amoeba survives on bacteria in warm waters and can only be [eliminated] through proper chlorination or boiling of water.

[This is the 1st fatal case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) that has been reported from Karachi, Sindh in 2017. The 23 year old deceased belonged to Tando Allahyar, an interior city in Sindh province. The temperatures in the province are currently around 35-42 deg C (95-108 deg F], which are quite favorable for the parasitic ameba. As reported last year (2016), water chlorination was found to be sub-optimal in Karachi in 2016. Inadequate chlorination of the water supply is often implicated in outbreaks of PAM. Therefore, adequate chlorination is a key recommended measure to prevent _N. fowleri_ infection. - Mod.UBA
