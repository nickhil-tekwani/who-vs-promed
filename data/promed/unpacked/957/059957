Vectors of leishmaniasis in Nicaragua
-------------------------------------
We thank Dr Kenneth. R. Dardick, of Connecticut Travel Medicine in Storrs,
Connecticut, USA, who e-mailed ProMED to point out that it is sandflies, not
mosquitoes -- as translated from the Spanish in the post of 4 Jun 2005
(archive number 20050604.1563) -- that transmit leishmaniasis.
I would like to make a plea for calling the vectors of leishmaniasis (and
other infections such as the sandfly fevers and bartonellosis, also known as
Oroya fever or Carrion's disease) "phlebotomine sandflies", not just
sandflies. This is because in some parts of the world the small biting midges
of the family Ceratopogonidae (comprising _Culicoides_ species) and simuliid
blackflies are called sandflies.
Note that in the New World the phlebotomine vectors of leishmaniasis are
species in _Lutzomyia_, a genus confined to the Americas, whereas in the Old
World the vectors are _Phlebotomus_ species.
In September 2003 there were at least 1600 recorded cases of leishmaniasis in
the department of Jinotega (The Nicaraguan Network - <http://www.nicanet.org>).

[It is unfortunate that Spanish speakers in Latin America tend to call any
kind of small fly a "mosquito", ignoring the niceties of entomological
classification. Christopher Freisenbruch also picked up the error. - Mod.JW]
