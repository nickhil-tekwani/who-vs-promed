Juniper plants in 'critical state'
----------------------------------
A study by Plantlife said juniper was in a "critical state" due to the spread of the deadly fungal disease [caused by] _Phytophthora austrocedrae_. The report followed a survey carried out by amateur enthusiasts. [A] decline of [the] juniper [population] is caused by the failure of bushes -- many of which are over a century old -- to produce seeds.

Once infected, a juniper bush turns orange then brown. The survey found that 63 per cent of bushes surveyed in Scotland have brown patches, and 79 per cent of juniper recorded in 2014 was either mature, old, or dead. Deborah Long, Plantlife Scotland, said: "We know juniper populations are struggling, but they now face an additional threat [with] this new disease."

Murdo Fraser MSP, Conservative politician representing Mid-Scotland and Fife, added: "Juniper is one of our most iconic species. Used not only by birds as cover and food, juniper is a key native plant for human use too. Today though, it is in trouble. Plantlife's report is a call to action for us all to do what we can for juniper."

[European juniper (_Juniperus communis_) is a small conifer. Its berries are popular as a spice and for medicinal uses in northern and central Europe, and are also used in the making of gin.

The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora austrocedri_ (Pa; synonym _austrocedrae_) was first characterised as a new species from Argentina in 2007 associated with lethal dieback of _Austrocedrus chilensis_ (Chilean cedar), which is native to the region. In the UK, it was first reported in 2011. Symptoms on juniper include necrosis of needles, lesions on stems, dieback of twigs and branches, and eventually death of the bush.

The genus includes some of the most destructive crop pathogens (for example, _P. infestans_, causing potato late blight). New species are being identified frequently, many of which are thought to be due to hybridisation between local pathogen strains. Symptoms vary between hosts, but on trees and shrubs the pathogens mainly causes root rots and stem cankers, which destroy the host's access to water and nutrients. Symptoms usually include yellowing of foliage followed by dieback, and sudden death of the host may occur when additional water stress is imposed by a dry season.

The pathogens are soil borne. They are spread with soil and plant material, by water, and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species.

_P. kernoviae_ and _P. ramorum_ are considered serious pathogens of native trees and shrubs in Europe and North America. _P._ taxon Agathis is devastating native kauri tree populations in New Zealand. _P. cinnamomi_ has caused immeasurable damage to eucalypts and other native vegetation after its introduction to Australia. Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful.
