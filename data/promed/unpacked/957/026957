--------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background information on scrub typhus in India is
abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon
e-book series: [1] (primary references available on request)

_Orientia tsutsugamushi_ is one of 7 _Rickettsia_ and
_Rickettsia_-like organisms that have been associated with human
infection in India; (the others are _Rickettsia sibirica_, _Rickettsia
conorii_ subsp. indica, _Candidatus Rickettsia kellyi_, _Rickettsia
typhi_, _Rickettsia prowazekii_ and _Coxiella burnetii_).

Epidemics of scrub typhus were previously reported among troops
stationed in the north and east. Risk factors include living close to
bushes and wood piles, work on farms, reports of rodents at home and
at work, and raising domestic animals (Darjeeling, West Bengal, 2009
publication).

Exported cases
--------------
- 3 cases of imported scrub typhus were reported in the United States
during 1983 to 1988 -- all originating in India.
- In 2002, a Belgian traveler developed scrub typhus following a trip
to India.
- 17 fatal cases were reported in Himachal during 2001 to 2002.
- 21 cases (3 fatal) were reported in Himchal Pradesh during 2004.
- 9 cases were confirmed in Uttarakhand (2010 publication).
- 29 cases were reported from a hospital in Manipal, Karnataka during
2009.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 24.1 per cent of febrile hospitalized patients in Vellore (2006
publication).
- 15 per cent of children below age 14 hospitalized for fever in Tamil
Nadu (2003 to 2004).
- 14.3 per cent of children hospitalized with fever and at least one
suggestive feature of rickettsial infection (central India, 2011
publication).
- 37.5 per cent of febrile malaria-negative patients in Tamil Nadu in
2004, and 9.2 per cent in 2005.
- 47.5 per cent of patients hospitalized for acute undifferentiated
febrile illness in Vellore, Tamil Nadu (2010 publication).

The principal vector is _Leptotrombidium deliense_ [a species of
mite].
- _Schoengastiella ligula_ mites infesting shrews (_Suncus murinus_)
were identified as vectors during an outbreak in Kurseong, Darjeeling
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21941043].

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 2001 to 2002: an outbreak (28 cases, 3 fatal) was reported in Tamil
Nadu.
- 2003: an outbreak (225 cases, 19 fatal) was reported in Himachal
Pradesh.
- 2006 to 2008: an outbreak (50 cases) was reported in Pondicherry.
- 2007: an outbreak (38 cases) was reported in Bishnupur district,
Manipur.
- 2009 to 2010: an outbreak (80 cases, 5 fatal) was reported in
Meghalaya.
- 2011: outbreaks were reported in Himachal Pradesh (200 cases, 13
fatal) and Nagaland (9 cases, 3 fatal).
