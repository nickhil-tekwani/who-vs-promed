Russia's agriculture minister said Wed [5 Oct 2005] that the situation with
bird flu, which swept parts of Siberia during the summer, has stabilized even
as authorities reported a new case in southern Siberia.
Avian flu, blamed on wild migratory birds from Southeast Asia, was first
detected in a Siberian region in July 2005 and has since spread to at least 5
other provinces. The H5N1 strain of the flu can be lethal to humans, but no
human cases have been registered in Russia.
Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev told a news conference that the bird flu
situation was under control, but said preventive measures were still needed.
The Agriculture Ministry said the number of towns and villages affected by the
outbreak have fallen from 50 to 7. Investigators are conducting tests in 19
other settlements suspected to have the bird flu cases.
The latest outbreak was recorded in the Kurgan region in southern Siberia,
said Lyubov Voropayeva, a spokeswoman for Russia's epidemiological service.
The outbreak at the Utyatskaya farm in the Kurgan region was the 1st to be
recorded in the region, located just east of the Ural Mountains.
More than 1/5 of the farm's 460 000 birds have died and authorities will
likely slaughter the rest, Voropoayeva told The Associated Press. She said the
farm stopped sales on 28 Sep 2005 when the 1st birds died.

[According to additional information, derived by ProMED-mail's Russian
correspondent from local media, several foci of avian influenza have been
registered in other parts of the Kurgan region during August and September
2005, affecting private farms. The current outbreak involves a large
integrated farm.
Kurgan oblast, where this outbreak is located, is situated within the Urals
Federal District (Administrative center: Yekaterinburg), which is one of
Russia's 7 main Federal Districts. The other oblasts in Urals are Sverdlovsk,
Tyumen and Chelyabinsk. The Urals Federal District includes also 2 autonomous
districts: Khantia-Mansia and Yamalia. A description of Russia's
administrative divisions and corresponding maps can be found in ProMED post
