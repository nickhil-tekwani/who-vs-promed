Mumps outbreak in Cumbria
-------------------------
There is a mumps outbreak in Cumbria as an increase in cases has been seen
across the county. Last week [week of 22 Jun 2009], 11 new suspected cases
were confirmed in Cumbria and many of these were in people aged 18 to 25.
Only 12 cases have been recorded in Cumbria so far this year [2009] but
this could rise to 23 with the latest possible outbreak, compared with 29
cases in the whole of last year [2008]. Associate director of public health
Dr Nigel Calvert said: "In the last few years there has been a noticeable
increase in the number of cases of mumps, particularly in teenagers and
young adults. This can be a concern as mumps [is caused by] a virus, which
can easily spread and in some cases affect fertility. If you're going to be
attending a new college or university in the autumn, or if you're not sure
if you've had both doses of MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella], please go
see your doctor and get a booster. Mumps can make you feel very ill and
it's so easy to avoid catching it."

[Mumps virus infection] causes fever, headache, and painful swollen glands
in the face neck and jaw and although most cases are mild some people can
experience complications, which can be serious. The best way for people to
protect themselves is to make sure they have had 2 doses of the MMR
vaccine, which are usually given to children before they start school.
Anyone can check if they're fully immunised or arrange a free booster
injection by seeking advice from their GP [general practitioner] or
practice nurse.

According to the UK Health Protection Agency before the introduction of the
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1988, mumps occurred commonly
in school-age children, and more than 85 per cent of adults had evidence of
previous mumps infection. Mumps was the cause of about 1200 hospital
admissions each year. Mumps was made a notifiable disease in the UK in
October 1988 at the time of the introduction of the MMR vaccine. High
coverage of the MMR vaccine resulted in a substantial reduction in mumps
transmission in the UK and the incidence declined in all age groups,
including those too old to have been immunised.

Since 1999, there has been a considerable increase in confirmed mumps
cases. Most of these cases have occurred in adolescents or young adults who
were too old to have been offered MMR vaccine when it was introduced in
1988 or to have had a 2nd dose when this was introduced in 1996. They had
not previously been exposed to natural mumps infection as children and so
remained susceptible.

In late 2004, a further increase in clinically diagnosed and confirmed
mumps infections was observed. The vast majority of confirmed cases were in
those born between 1980 and 1987 and outbreaks occurred mainly in higher
education institutions.

Currently the incomplete acceptance of the triple MMR vaccine in the UK
allows continued circulation of mumps virus in the community and leaves a
cohort of young adults vulnerable to infection as witnessed in this
outbreak in Cumbria and elsewhere in the UK. - Mod.CP]
