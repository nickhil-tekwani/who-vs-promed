Daily COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, which is grappling with a quickly growing omicron wave, topped 2000 for the 1st time today [14 Feb 2022] as the public health system struggled to cope. Meanwhile, cases soared in New Zealand, another government that had kept COVID-19 low in earlier surges but is now coming to terms with the much more transmissible omicron variant.

Hong Kong is struggling with a testing backlog, but today [14 Feb 2022] it reported 2071 cases, with about 4500 preliminary positives, according to the South China Morning Post. A temporary lab set up by a company on the mainland is expected to begin operation tomorrow [15 Feb 2022] to help speed up testing (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3166970/coronavirus-hong-kong-breaks-covid-19-record).

Occupancy rates of isolation beds at public hospitals have reached 90% capacity, [with] infections in hospital staff adding to the pressure on [the] health system. In another development, health officials announced delaying resuming in-person schooling for 2 more weeks.

Elsewhere, New Zealand reported a record 981 cases today [14 Feb 2022], and the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the rise isn't surprising and that the country will remain at phase 2 as long as cases stay between 1000 and 5000 a day, according to Radio New Zealand (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/461484/new-zealand-to-move-to-phase-2-of-omicron-plan-jacinda-ardern). Ardern said the country can expect to see an unprecedented surge, but its vaccination efforts will help it avoid large numbers of serious illnesses and deaths.

More global headlines
---------------------
- New Zealand is among the locations where protests over COVID-19 measures, modeled after the truck convoys in Canada, have taken root (https://wapo.st/33r4kmP). Others include Europe and Australia.

- Viet Nam tomorrow [15 Feb 2022] will start allowing international flights to resume, according to Reuters. The country had early success by barring flights but experienced later COVID-19 waves. About 98% of the country's population has received at least 2 vaccine doses (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/vietnam-end-covid-curbs-international-flights-feb-15-2022-02-13/).

- South Korea is the latest country to green-light 4th doses of COVID-19 vaccine for high-risk groups (https://wapo.st/3uS7tHy).

- The global COVID-19 totals today [14 Feb 2022] climbed to 412 913 570 million cases and 5 822 052 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[The report above states that "At least 10 000 infected people [are] still waiting to be admitted to Hong Kong hospitals as cases overwhelm [the] public healthcare system.... The city's public healthcare system is said to be on the brink of collapse, with the occupancy rate of isolation beds pushed to its upper limit of 90%, thousands of COVID-19 patients [are] still waiting in the community for admission, and more healthcare workers [are] getting infected." This surge in Hong Kong is in contrast to decreasing cases in the United States. - Mod.LK]

Older women's estrogen levels may be linked to their chances of dying from COVID-19, with higher levels of the hormone seemingly protective against severe infection, according to an observational study yesterday [14 Feb 2022] in BMJ Open (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/2/e053032).

The study included 14 685 postmenopausal Swedish women from 50 to 80 years old who had COVID-19. Researchers divided them into 3 groups: (1) women with previously diagnosed breast cancer and receiving endocrine therapy (decreased estrogen levels), (2) women receiving hormone replacement therapy (increased estrogen), and (3) a control group of women not receiving either therapy.

There were 227 women in group 1 (2%), 2535 in group 2 (17%), and 11 923 controls (81%). All were diagnosed as having COVID-19 sometime from 1 Feb 2020 to 14 Sep 2020.

The investigators found that the unadjusted odd ratios (ORs) for death following COVID-19 were 2.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-3.65) for group 1 and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.34-0.6) for group 2, but only the adjusted OR for death remained statistically significant for group 2, with an OR of 0.47, or a slightly more than 50% reduction. Absolute risk of death was 4.6% for the control group vs 10.1% and 2.1% for the decreased and increased estrogen groups, respectively.

As reflected in numerous previous studies, age was significantly associated with the risk of dying from COVID-19, with each extra year tied to a 15% greater risk, while each coexisting medical condition increased the odds of death by 13%.

The researchers conclude, "This study shows an association between oestrogen levels and COVID-19 death. Consequently, drugs increasing oestrogen levels may have a role in therapeutic efforts to alleviate COVID-19 severity in postmenopausal women and could be studied in randomised control trials."

[3] Maternal vaccination: baby benefits

COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy -- already known to protect women from hospitalization and severe complications -- can also protect babies younger than 6 months, researchers reported today [15 Feb 2022] (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm). In other COVID-19 research developments, a separate team that looked at COVID-19 hospitalizations in kids found that levels jumped dramatically during the omicron variant surge, especially in kids younger than 4, a group not eligible yet for vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e4.htm).

The study on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy on the youngest infants examined hospitalization trends across 20 children's hospitals in 17 states from July 2021 through January 2022. The team published its findings today [15 Feb 2022] in an early online edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

At a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) briefing today [15 Feb 2022], Dana Meaney-Delman, MD, MPH, who wasn't involved in the study and heads the CDC's Infant Outcomes Monitoring Research and Prevention Branch, said scientists already know that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are found in umbilical cord blood and can cross the placenta. However, she said it wasn't known if the maternal antibodies provided any protection to babies. "Now we have real-world evidence in babies younger than 6 months," she said.

The study authors found that babies born to pregnant women who had received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine were 61% less likely than those born to unvaccinated moms to be hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection. Of 176 babies hospitalized with COVID-19 over the study period, 84% were born to mothers who were unvaccinated during pregnancy. Of 43 infants who were admitted to the intensive care unit, 88% had mothers who were unvaccinated. Of the critically ill babies, one died -- a child of an unvaccinated mother.

Effectiveness was lower if a woman was vaccinated in early pregnancy, during the first 20 weeks, with protection at 32% vs 80% in later pregnancy. But researchers warn that the confidence interval is wide and that the pattern should be interpreted with caution.

Senior author Manish Patel, MD, with the CDC's COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, said the numbers were too small to look at the impact of vaccination by trimester. And Delman said there aren't any changes in recommendations that relate to the timing of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. She said vaccination levels in pregnant women are increasing and are encouraging, but aren't where health experts need them to be.

Maternal vaccination has been found to help young infants against other infections such as flu and pertussis, and now extend to COVID-19. "This new study will undoubtedly be factoring into my counseling sessions," Meaney-Delman said.

In a snapshot of COVID-19 hospitalizations in children and adolescents, another research team examined data from 14 states covering July 2021 to January 2022, a time that covered delta circulation, then quickly transitioned to omicron in December [2021].

Their findings also appear in an early online edition of MMWR. Once the omicron variant became dominant, hospitalizations in children and adolescents reached levels that were 4 times higher than those of delta's peak. The largest increase in hospitalizations was in children ages 0-4, who weren't eligible for vaccination.

During the study period, adolescents ages 12-17 were the only pediatric group approved for COVID-19 vaccination during the entire study period. When researchers compared their hospitalizations to that of unvaccinated peers, they found that levels were 6 times higher in the unvaccinated group.

"All persons who are eligible for vaccination should receive and stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk for severe disease for themselves and others with whom they come into contact, including children who are currently too young to be vaccinated," the group wrote.

[The summary from the 2nd study, regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations in children by Marks et al, follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is already known about this topic? COVID-19 can cause severe illness in children and adolescents.

"What is added by this report? Coinciding with increased circulation of the omicron variant, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents aged 0-17 years increased rapidly in late December 2021, especially among children aged 0-4 years who are not yet eligible for vaccination. Throughout the periods of delta and omicron predominance, hospitalization rates remained lower among fully vaccinated adolescents aged 12-17 years than among unvaccinated adolescents.

"What are the implications for public health practice? Strategies to prevent COVID-19 among children and adolescents, including vaccination of eligible persons, are critical." - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 43 countries, including Germany (177 515), Russia (166 631), France (142 253), Brazil (123 827), USA (113 667), Turkey (94 730), South Korea (90 430), Japan (79 896), Italy (71 023), Indonesia (57 049), Netherlands (53 506), UK (45 922), Denmark (40 778), Spain (34 380), Viet Nam (31 814), India (30 615), Ukraine (29 724), Australia (27 372), Belgium (26 458), Austria (25 177), Iran (25 034), Chile (24 979), Georgia (22 748), Israel (22 594), Poland (22 267), Malaysia (22 133), Greece (21 958), Romania (21 885), Réunion (21 707), Mexico (21 207), Switzerland (20 134), Czech Republic (19 512), Singapore (19 420), Slovakia (18 896), Norway (18 875), Argentina (18 573), Jordan (18 477), Portugal (18 135), Ecuador (17 670), Thailand (16 462), El Salvador (12 677), Sweden (11 751), and Latvia (11 105), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 12 019 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Feb 2022 to late 14 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. However, the 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 91 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 49 of the 91 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 21.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 46.7% decrease in daily reported cases and an 8.1% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 2.04 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 416.01 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.85 million reported deaths. Despite some decreases in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
