An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis affecting 31 people occurred
between 3 and 5 Aug 2007 during the Formula One race that took place
at the Hungaroring in Mogyorod, Hungary. The venue has a capacity of
around 200 000 spectators.
Epidemiological findings
------------------------
As of 15 Aug 2007, 31 patients were registered with subfebrile
temperatures or fever, vomiting, stomach ache and diarrhea. Of those,
25 were foreign visitors (11 Swedish, 7 Finnish, 3 Norwegian, 3
Dutch, and one Austrian), and 6 were Hungarian citizens. The
investigated patients started feeling ill between 3 and 6 Aug 2007.
The 1st known patient developed symptoms at about 5 pm on 3 Aug 2007.
In total, 23 patients were hospitalized: 22 patients received medical
support in a hospital in Budapest and one patient was treated in
Finland. The health authority was alerted by the ambulance and by the
hospital in Budapest during the evening of 4 Aug 2007.
Hot dishes prepared at a restaurant in Budapest were offered at a
buffet at the Hungaroring racetrack and were suspected as the cause
of the infection. Of the 31 patients that were investigated, 26 had
consumed food from the suspected buffet on the 1st day of the race (3
Aug 2007) and 5 of them on the 2nd day (4 Aug 2007). The epidemic
curve shows all 31 cases by hour of onset of disease [the curve can
be seen at the original URL. - Mod.LL]
Based on the epidemiological information, the buffet was closed by
the local health authority on the morning of 5 Aug 2007. An alert was
sent to the municipal health authorities in Hungary by the National
Centre for Epidemiology and by the regional health authority, which
investigated the outbreak. In addition, an alert was sent via the
Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).
The incubation period among those who ate at the suspected buffet on
the 1st day of the race varied between 4 and 23 hours; in most of the
cases it was 7 hours. Among the 5 people who ate at the buffet on the
2nd day, the incubation period varied between 27 and 29 hours in 2
cases, and between 46 and 49 hours in 3 cases.
According to the history of food consumption, 26 patients consumed
chicken at the buffet on 3 Aug 2007, and 20 of them also ate rice
with egg. Those who ate at the buffet on the 2nd day also consumed
chicken with rice.
The investigation continued in the restaurant in which the dishes had
been prepared, collecting information the preparation and the amount
of the suspected foods that had been served in the buffet. A total of
300 portions of chicken and 500 portions of rice with egg were served
for the event spectators on both the 1st and 2nd days of the race.
The buffet served rice, either with eggs alone or with meat: pork,
lamb, and the suspected chicken. Chicken was not served alone. This
corresponds to a maximum of 500 people who were potentially exposed
to the contaminated dishes on either day (3 and 4 Aug 2007).
Laboratory findings
-------------------
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis was confirmed as the
causative agent in 22 cases; 21 of those patients had eaten at the
buffet on 3 Aug and one on 4 Aug 2007. Stool samples were taken from
21 reportedly asymptomatic staff members working at the buffet and
restaurant. _S._ Enteritidis was isolated from 12 of them. The _S._
Enteritidis strains isolated from patients and asymptomatic carriers
among the staff were shown to be PT8 (phage type 8) using the
Colindale sets of phages (English phage typing system). PFGE results
are pending.
No leftovers could be found of the dishes served on the 1st 2 days of
the race, but samples were taken from dishes available on the site on
the morning of the 3rd day, when the local health authority closed
the buffet. _S._ Infantis was detected in samples taken from both
frozen raw and cooked chicken, indicating irresponsible practices
used in preparing the dishes. The raw chicken samples were taken
before being used by the restaurant. It is likely that the chicken
was not cooked long enough. In addition, the temperature of the meals
was lukewarm during the transportation from the restaurant in
Budapest to the buffet at Hungaroring: the different chicken dishes
stored at the buffet had temperatures between 17.6 and 20.3 deg C
(63.7-68.5 deg F) when measured by the local authority on Sunday
morning [5 Aug 2007]. Each member of the staff ate the meals served
at Hungaroring, including the suspected chicken and rice with eggs.
This preliminary report shows the difficulties of investigating an
outbreak in the context of an international mass gathering, with
visitors arriving from all over Europe. After the race, most of the
spectators immediately traveled home. Medical services at the race
and in the towns near Hungaroring were informed of the outbreak in an
attempt to register cases. It is important to carefully consider any
measures taken during an event such as this so as not to cause a
panic; however, this can also make the locating of affected
spectators without symptoms more difficult. In order to further limit
the spread, an EWRS message was launched.
