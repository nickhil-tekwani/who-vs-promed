Summary of outbreaks

Outbreak 1: Stanislaus County, Stanislaus, California
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Sep 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 26 258 / - / - / 26 258 / -
Affected population: commercial meat-type turkey flock

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As part of the pre-slaughter testing and surveillance program for H5/H7 avian influenza, H7N3 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a commercial meat-type turkey flock. Partial HA /NA sequencing determined the H7 and N3 to be a low pathogenic virus of North American wild bird lineage. Further characterization is pending virus recovery. The affected flock was depopulated, and the carcasses have been rendered. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) are conducting an epidemiological investigation of the event and have increased testing as a result of the detection. Ten additional commercial poultry premises located within the 10 km [6.2 mi] zone are being tested for influenza virus.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; stamping out; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory (local laboratory) / birds / agar-gel precipitation (AGP) test / 6 Sep 2018 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory) / birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 8 Sep 2018 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory) / birds / virus sequencing / - / pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material.

"When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks. Because LPAI does not typically kill poultry the way that HPAI does, there may be additional control options beyond depopulation. Federal and state officials will determine what option(s) are available to affected producers."
