[1] vaccine safety questioned
Date: Mon 24 Jun 2019

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nearly-half-of-american-adults-doubt-vaccine-safety-as-measles-cases-continue-to-rise-24614/


A recent Harris poll reveals that more than 2 in 5 American adults (45%) say something has caused them to doubt vaccine safety.

The spread of negative attitudes towards vaccines is a phenomenon deeply rooted in human psychology and amplified by social media, according to perinatal psychiatrist Rachel Shmuts, DO.

"From an evolutionary perspective, humans are primed to pay attention to threats or negative information," she says. "So it makes sense that people hold onto fears that vaccines are harmful, especially when they believe their children are in danger."

She believes it is possible that, since vaccines have been so effective in eradicating disease, people may have more fear of possible vaccine side effects than the actual diseases vaccines prevent.

"For some, it really might be that vaccines are viewed as the more salient threat," says Dr Shmuts.

Although 55% of Americans don't doubt vaccine safety, 45% noted at least one source that caused doubts about the safety of vaccination. The top 3 doubt-causing sources were online articles (16%), past secrets/wrongdoing by the pharmaceutical industry (16%), and information from medical experts (12%).

From 1 Jan-20 Jun 2019, 1077 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 28 states. This is an increase of 33 cases from the previous week. This is the greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.

[2] Case update
Date: Mon 24 Jun 2019
Source: Yahoo News, Reuters report [edited]
https://news.yahoo.com/u-records-33-cases-measles-135306449.html


Last week [week of 17 Jun 2019], 33 new measles cases were recorded in the United States, most of them in New York, federal health officials said on [Mon 24 Jun 2019], bringing the number of confirmed cases this year to 1077 in the worst US outbreak of the virus since 1992.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease rose 3% in the week ended 20 Jun 2019 from the prior week. The 2019 outbreak, which has spread to 28 states, is the worst since 1992, when 2126 cases were recorded.

All but 3 of the 33 new cases occurred in New York, with 20 in Rockland county and 10 in New York City, a CDC spokesman said. According to New York City and State health officials, the state has recorded hundreds of cases of the virus since September [2018].

Health experts say the virus has spread among school-age children whose parents declined to give them the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. A vocal fringe of US parents, some in New York's ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, cite concerns that the vaccine may cause autism, despite scientific studies that have debunked such claims.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travelers coming from countries where measles is common.

CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the ongoing outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.[The 1st report we carried mentioning cases in New York was in mid-Auguest 2018 (Measles update (51): Americas, Europe 20180816.5970434), from a CDC report. - Mod.MPP]

The outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the United States from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel, and the Philippines, federal officials said.

Los Angeles county health officials said [Sat 22 Jun 2019] that they are looking into identifying anyone who may have been exposed to 2 residents who recently traveled and became ill with measles shortly after returning to the county.

These 2 new cases were not linked to each other and were likely exposed to measles while traveling outside of the United States.

There have been 10 measles cases among Los Angeles county residents in 2019, in addition to 8 non-resident measles cases that traveled through Los Angeles county. Of the 10 measles cases among residents, 5 are not linked to any of the others, and 3 of these cases are linked to international travel.

The majority of the cases were unvaccinated, officials said.

Democratic Republic of Congo's government has declared an epidemic of measles, which the latest health ministry figures show has now killed at least 1500 people, 100 more than have died of Ebola [the number of deaths from Ebola has increased to 1510 as of 23 Jun 2019, so it is equal to the number of measles deaths. Both are too high. - Mod.LK].

While health officials have focused on the hemorrhagic Ebola virus in Congo's east, about 87 000 suspected measles cases have been reported across the country so far this year [2019], more than the 65 000 recorded in the whole of 2018.

Congo's health ministry announced the measles figure when it declared the epidemic on [Mon 17 Jun 2019].

Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on [Tue 18 Jun 2019] that 1500 deaths from measles had been recorded in the 1st 5 months of 2019, the highest since 2012, which was the deadliest measles epidemic of the last decade.

Ebola has so far killed 1390 [1510 as of 23 Jun 2019. - Mod.LK] people in Congo's North Kivu province, the latest Congo health ministry figures show.

MSF called for "a massive mobilisation of all relevant national and international organisations in order to vaccinate more children and treat patients" affected by measles.

The health ministry said its vaccination campaign would target a further 1.4 million infants, and that 2.2 million had been vaccinated in April [2019].

Health officials say comprehensive vaccination programmes are the only way to prevent measles spreading out of control, but say ill-informed opposition can sometimes scupper such plans.

The UN launched a campaign in April [2019] to counter a backlash against measles vaccination.

Ukraine health officials reported an additional 967 measles -- 436 adults and 531 children, during the past week. This brings the total cases to 54 065 people -- 25 439 adults and 28 626 children, including 18 deaths since the beginning of the year [2019].

During the past week, most cases of measles were registered in Kyiv (110 patients: 46 adults and 64 children) and Kharkiv oblasts [regions] (97: 63 adults and 34 children); Kyiv [city] (87:47 adults and 40 children). Also, high rates were recorded in Ternopil (80 patients: 23 adults and 57 children) and Lviv oblasts (64: 27 adults and 37 children).

The Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine puts the measles total to 110 000 cases and 39 fatalities.

The Ministry of Health of Ukraine, together with the Center for Public Health, held meetings with representatives from all regions to organize additional immunization measures to combat the outbreak of measles. A "special operation" to raise the level of vaccination and overcoming the outbreak has already taken place in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytsky regions. Other areas have received instructions on the necessary steps to prepare plans for additional measures to combat measles.

Nine children and one adult have been diagnosed with measles in the village of Urk [Flevoland], most of whom had not been vaccinated against the disease. Urk, a former island, is one of the most staunchly Protestant parts of the country and a place where many parents do not have their children vaccinated for religious reasons. Just 60% of 2-year-olds on the island have had all the recommended childhood vaccination. 3 of the children had been given at least one vaccination, broadcaster NOS said. The 10 people infected with measles come from 2 families which had close links and no other cases have been found on the island. This means it is not an outbreak, the local health board told website Nu.nl. The last measles outbreak on Urk was in 2013, in a year in which 30 000 people nationwide were diagnosed with the disease.

Health workers from the Department of Health Center for Health Development (DOH CHD) Caraga, together with their local government unit (LGU) counterparts, continued to battle measles disease as the death toll from the infectious disease rose to 20.

In the latest update from the Center for Health Development (CHD) [in Butuan City on [Tue 25 Jun 2019], a total of 1206 cases of measles have been reported from different disease reporting units in the region from [1 Jan-22 Jun 2019].

"This is 506% higher compared to the reported cases last year [2018]," the regional office of the DOH 13 said. With this number of cases, the CHD Caraga has mobilized nurses hired under contract of service to augment the local health staff in advocacy and vaccination activities.

Logistics and vaccines are pre-positioned at the Provincial Health Offices (PHOs) for easy access by respective Rural Health Units (RHUs).

Rapid Coverage Assessment (RCA) was done by the DOH CHD Caraga staff regionwide to ensure that all barangays are covered by vaccination teams.

Heightened advocacy utilizing major communication channels were also used to strengthen advocacy for immunization.

However, with all these efforts, new clustering cases have been detected since 26 May until 22 Jun.

The majority of the new reported cases came from Agusan del Sur, specifically in far-flung towns of La Paz, Loreto, Rosario, San Luis, and Talacogon.

Since the start of the year [2019], a cumulative report of 20 deaths, classified as suspected measles deaths had been recorded by CHD Caraga. Of the 20 reported suspected measles cases, 18 came from the Agusan del Sur. The latest of these reported deaths were in the month of June coming from San Luis (2), Loreto (3), and Talacogon (4) towns.

In its initial investigation, the CHD Caraga has noted that cases come from indigenous peoples communities.

Members of these communities are often mobile, meaning their settlements are often transferred from one area to another.

Following initial reports, the DOH 13 Caraga has sent 2 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) together with the staff from the Provincial Health Office of Agusan del Sur to Talacogon on 11-13 Jun and to Loreto on 20-22 Jun 2019.

https://7news.com.au/news/public-health/measles-spike-raises-fears-that-virus-has-evolved-and-vaccine-is-not-providing-immunity-c-182822


A spike in measles cases has sparked new fears among medical experts that the measles vaccine may no longer be working.

A joint investigation from the Victorian Health Department and several Melbourne hospitals has found 13 Victorians contracted the disease in recent years despite already being vaccinated.

It's raised concerns the virus has evolved.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease, with an estimated 110 000 deaths worldwide in 2017, mostly in children under 5.

Confirmed cases
---------------
There have been 92 confirmed cases of measles in Australia so far in 2019.

In the US, health authorities are grappling with an outbreak. 33 new measles cases were recorded in the US last week [week of 17 Jun 2019], most of them in New York, federal health officials said on [Mon 24 Jun 2019].

The new cases brought the number of confirmed cases this year to 1077, the worst US outbreak of the virus since 1992. Research by the Department of Health, the Doherty Institute and Royal Melbourne Hospital shows that, between 2014 and 2017, 13 Australians who had been vaccinated still contracted the virus.

Medical experts suggest a 3rd vaccination may be necessary to keep people immune.

Loss of immunity fears
----------------------
The Royal Melbourne Hospital's Dr Katherine Gibney is an epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services.

She says because Australia has done such a good job at eliminating measles, people who have had only one vaccine aren't getting a natural immunity boost as the disease isn't circulating in the community.

"If you had been vaccinated and came into contact with someone with measles you might get a little natural boost in your antibody levels," said Dr Gibney.

The research, published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal [see reference below], showed a number of people who were hospitalised with the disease had been vaccinated at least once in the past, but their immunity had waned over time.

'This research has demonstrated some vaccinated people are getting measles.' They had what is called secondary vaccine failure, meaning they had at least one dose of the vaccine and showed antibodies in their blood, but that protection waned and they contracted measles.

The symptoms weren't considered 'classic measles' -- patients weren't reporting fever, cough, and runny nose -- but they did have a rash.

"Normally, if people have documented receiving 2 doses of measles vaccine we would be confident they won't contract measles, but that's getting greyer -- this research has demonstrated some vaccinated people are getting measles," Dr Gibney said.

"Abstract
--------
"Background. Waning measles immunity among vaccinated individuals may result in an attenuated illness and is considered less infectious. This study aims to compare the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory profile of measles cases with waning immunity to other measles cases.

"Methods. PCR-positive (+) measles cases notified to Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) from 2008-2017 with immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG tested at diagnosis were classified according to serology at diagnosis: IgG negative (-) [non-immune]; IgM+/IgG+ [indeterminate]; or IgM-/IgG+ [waning immunity].

"Results. Between 2008-2017, 297 measles cases were notified of whom 190 (64%) were included in this analysis; 151/190 (80%) were non-immune at diagnosis, 26 (4%) were indeterminate and 13 (7%) had waning immunity. Between 2008-13 and 2014-17, the proportion of cases with waning immunity increased from 0/87 (0%) to 13/103 (13%) (p<0.001) and the diagnostic sensitivity of initial IgM fell from 93% to 81% (p=0.012), respectively. 7 (54%) waning immunity cases reported receiving measles-containing vaccines; one case had 2 documented doses and 3 cases had one documented dose. Compared to non-immune and indeterminate cases, waning immunity cases were more likely to be male; less likely to report fever, coryza, and cough; and had lower burden of virus (higher Ct values on respiratory specimens). Among IgG+ cases, waning immunity cases had higher IgG titres than indeterminate cases (mean optical density [OD] values 1.96 vs. 0.71, p=0.004). Onward transmission from one waning immunity case to 2 infant household contacts too young for vaccination was documented.

"Conclusions. Waning immunity among measles cases (IgM-/IgG+ at diagnosis), associated with secondary vaccine failure and modified clinical illness, is emerging in Victoria with transmission potential."

Understaffed health facilities and bad roads are only a few of the challenges of vaccinating against measles in Madagascar. Listen as the BBC's Pumza Fihlani travels to a remote village and speaks to the health workers carrying out the vaccinations and the people who often have to travel far to get immunised. Poverty, malnutrition, bringing in vaccine, all contribute to the problem.
