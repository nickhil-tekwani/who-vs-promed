End of February [2020] respiratory disease update from EDCC [equine disease communication center]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An attending veterinarian reported equine influenza was confirmed in one horse in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, on [28 Feb 2020]. The 6-year-old Appaloosa gelding had onset of clinical signs on [25 Feb] 2020 including coughing, fever, and nasal and ocular discharge. The unvaccinated gelding was alive at the time of reporting. On the premises, 5 other horses were suspected with equine influenza and 20 others were exposed.

It was noted at testing the confirmed gelding also tested positive for equine herpesvirus type 4.

Multiple cases of equine influenza have been confirmed on premises in Nebraska and Iowa.

Nebraska
--------
Two premises were reported with multiple cases of equine influenza in Douglas County, Nebraska.

An attending veterinarian in Douglas County, Nebraska, reported one confirmed case and 11 suspected cases of equine influenza. There are 50 other horses exposed. A voluntary quarantine has been put in place.

The positive horse was a 2-year-old Quarter Horse gelding having onset of clinical signs on [8 Mar 2020] including anorexia, coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. The gelding was confirmed with equine influenza on [13 Mar 2020]. The gelding also tested positive for EHV-4 on a nasal swab.

Also in Douglas County, Nebraska, an attending veterinarian reported 2 horses had tested positive for equine influenza, 3 were suspected of having the disease, and 8 other horses were exposed on a premises.

The 1st horse was a 6-year-old mustang mare having coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. She also was confirmed positive for EHV-4. The unvaccinated mare is recovering.

The 2nd horse was a 9-year-old Quarter Horse gelding having onset of clinical signs on 6 Mar 2020 including coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. The unvaccinated gelding is recovering.

Note that Douglas County, Nebraska, is on the Eastern edge of the state and Pottawattamie County, Iowa, is on the Western edge of the state.

Iowa
----
An attending veterinarian reported one confirmed equine influenza case in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. There are 9 suspect cases on the premises and 15 exposed horses.

Equine influenza was diagnosed on a premises in Pottawattamie County, Iowa

The positive equine influenza case was in a 3-year-old Quarter Horse gelding having onset of clinical signs on [3 Mar 2020] including coughing, fever, and nasal discharge. He was confirmed positive on 7 Mar 2020. The unvaccinated gelding is recovering. He also tested positive for EHV-4 in nasal secretions.

Information for this report was provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center.

Although the same county in Iowa is mentioned in reports [1] and [2] above, these are different horses (see http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts: select start/end dates and click on the state of Iowa to see details of both cases).

Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among naive horses. Horses 1-5 years old are the most susceptible to infection. Orthomyxovirus A/equine-2 was first recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries. China, Japan, and Australia experienced devastating epidemics of equine influenza affecting tens of thousands of horses in 2007. Before that, equine influenza had not been reported in China since 1993, in Japan since 1972, and had never been reported in Australia.

Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild, inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of [airborne] respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift seen with specific strains of A/equine-2 virus in some parts of the world.

Clinical findings and lesions
-----------------------------
The incubation period of influenza is approximately 1-3 days. Clinical signs begin abruptly and include high fever (up to 106 deg F [41.1 deg C]), serous nasal discharge, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and coughing that is dry, harsh, and nonproductive. Depression, anorexia, and weakness are frequently seen. Clinical signs usually last less than 3 days in uncomplicated cases. Influenza virus replicates within respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in destruction of tracheal and bronchial epithelium and cilia. Cough develops early in the course of infection and may persist for several weeks. Nasal discharge, although scant and serous initially, may become mucopurulent due to secondary bacterial infection. Mildly affected horses recover uneventfully in 2-3 weeks; severely affected horses may convalesce as long as 6 months. Recovery may be hastened by complete restriction of strenuous physical activity. Respiratory tract epithelium takes approximately 21 days to regenerate; during this time, horses are susceptible to development of secondary bacterial complications such as pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, and chronic bronchitis. Complications are minimized by restricting exercise, controlling dust, providing superior ventilation, and practicing good stable hygiene. Primary complications of vasculitis, myositis, and myocarditis are seen infrequently.
