The administration of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the
Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] for Rostov
region (oblast) reports that the epidemic situation is alarming in the
region due to many cases of foodborne botulism.

There were 24 botulism cases in the region in 2006 and 5 of them died. The
numbers for 2007 are 24 affected people including one fatal case. The
numbers for 2008 so far are 12 cases and 2 deaths.

The last cases were in the Morozowsk settlement in April 2008. Two people
fell sick after eating dried bream. The last outbreak was in the city of
Belaya Kalitwa, where 3 people got sick and 2 of them died. Rospotrebnadzor
reports that the most common food that causes botulism is homemade products
like dried fish, mushroom marinades, vegetable cans. These dangerous goods
are also sold in local non-authorized markets.

The testing of food specimens taken from cases revealed botulinum toxin in
70-75 per cent of cases and the producing organism in 10-30 per cent of
cases. The epidemiological analysis showed that the most risk for botulism
is coming from homemade products for self-use and from the same products
sold in non-authorized markets.

[About 30 cases of botulism are registered in Rostov province every year.
In the southern regions of the province closer to the Azov Sea, the main
product causing botulism is dried and smoked fish, whereas in the northern
parts, mostly covered by forest and plains, it is mushroom cans. Botulinum
toxin type B prevails in the region. - Mod.NP
