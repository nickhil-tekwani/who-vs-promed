Risk of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in blood supply
----------------------------------------
A parasitic infection common in Latin America is threatening the United
States blood supply, public health experts say. They are especially
concerned because there will be no test for it in donated blood until 2004
at the earliest. The infection, Chagas disease, is still rare in this
country. Only 9 cases are known to have been transmitted by transfusion or
transplant in the United States and Canada in the last 20 years. But
hundreds of blood recipients may be silently infected, experts say, and
there is no effective treatment for them.
After a decade or more, 10-30 percent of them will die when their hearts or
intestines, weakened by the disease, explode. Chagas is still little known
in the United States, but in Mexico, Central America, and South America, 18
million people are infected, and 50 000 die of it every year. Experts
expect it to become better known as new tests are developed.
"I wouldn't say that it's as rare as hen's teeth, but it's rare," said Dr.
Ravi V. Durvasula, a Chagas expert at the Yale School of Public Health.
"It's one of the top threats to the blood supply, but it's an emerging
threat." Because the disease is most common in rural areas from southern
Mexico to northern Chile, the threat is greatest in American cities with
many immigrants from those areas.
Across the United States, said Dr. David A. Leiby, a Chagas expert at the
American Red Cross, the risk of getting a transfusion of infected blood is
only about 1 in 25 000. But in 1998 in Miami it was found to be 1 in 9000,
he said, and in Los Angeles the same year, he measured it at 1 in 5400, up
from 1 in 9850 only 2 years earlier.
No more recent study of the blood supply has been done. The only routine
screening for Chagas now is in the standard set of questions asked of
donors -- whether they come from or have visited a country where Chagas is
endemic and whether they ever slept in a thatched hut. But that often isn't
reliable, said Dr. Louis V. Kirchhoff, a professor at the University of
Iowa's medical school who researches Chagas in Guadalajara, Mexico, where
the chance of getting infected blood is 1 in 126. Potential donors "are
kind of leery of those questions," he said, and may not answer honestly.
Since 1989, several advisory panels to the United States Food and Drug
Administration have recommended that all donated blood be screened for
Chagas. But no test has been approved yet.
Last year [2002], the FDA invited diagnostics companies to create one, and
the 2 largest, Abbott Laboratories and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, are
trying. But representatives of the companies said they were under little
deadline pressure. Abbott's test may be ready in 2004.
Little sense of urgency exists because "there are always new things that
come up," Dr. Leiby said. Hepatitis and AIDS were followed by mad cow
disease, West Nile virus and bacterial contamination of platelets, so
"Chagas gets pushed to the side," he said. Mary Richardson, a spokeswoman
for Ortho, which hopes to have a test by 2005, added: "Clinical trials take
time. There's only so much speeding up you can do." Nonetheless, she added,
"the F.D.A. feels it's the next biggest threat."
An F.D.A. spokeswoman said her agency did not like to rank all the threats
to the blood supply -- including hepatitis, AIDS, and West Nile virus --
but reiterated that "we would certainly recommend a Chagas test if one is
developed."
Prevalence rates in Latin America vary widely, from 25 percent in Bolivia
to 1 percent in Mexico. It is not found on Caribbean islands like Puerto
Rico, the Dominican Republic, or Cuba. In some countries, it is a serious
threat to the blood supplies; in one Bolivian city, half of the blood was
infected. About 30 tests are used in different countries, but none meet FDA
accuracy standards. Some Latin American blood banks disinfect with gentian
violet, but it is unpopular because it gives recipients a purplish tinge.
The disease is named for Carlos Chagas, the Brazilian doctor who described
it in 1909. It is caused by a protozoan, _Trypanosoma cruzi_, which infects
humans in a particularly disgusting way. Reduviids, also called kissing or
assassin bugs, drop down from the thatch, follow the trail of carbon
dioxide to the mouths of sleeping humans and suck their blood. They leave
behind a protozoan-laden drop of feces, which the sleeper often
inadvertently rubs into the itching wound. Charles Darwin may have been
infected on his travels; he suffered with Chagas symptoms for many years in
England.
There is no vaccine and no effective treatment. The first phase, which
starts within weeks of infection, may include fever and swollen glands,
liver, or spleen, but is rarely fatal except in infants and in adults with
compromised immune systems. It is often misdiagnosed. The disease can then
lie dormant for 10 to 30 years, then kill suddenly as weakened organs rupture.
The failure of the blood industry and its regulators to develop a test
since it was endorsed by a Blood Products Advisory Committee in 1989 seems
to be a combination of bureaucratic inertia and divided responsibility for
such a decision. Blood banks cannot use a test that the FDA has not
approved. The agency usually defers to its advisory committees, which have
many experts from blood banks as members.
"It's a political process that is not always fully engaged," said Dr.
Stuart J. Kahn of the Infectious Disease Research Institute, a Seattle
group hunting cures for tropical diseases. Dr. Hira Nakhasi, director of
transfusion-transmitted diseases at the FDA, agreed that neither the blood
banks nor his agency had been very aggressive. Things tended to move when
"the public and media put pressure on," he said. Cost concerns made blood
banks hesitant, Dr. Kirchhoff said. It may cost $50 million to $100 million
a year to screen the whole United States blood supply, he estimated, and
"people will reasonably say, `Why should we do this if we're not seeing a
lot of sick people?"
Although perhaps 120 Americans a year get infected blood, he said, between
70 and 90 percent will not become seriously ill, and few of those who do
will live long enough to die of Chagas. Most transfusion recipients are
fairly sick, and half die of other causes within 2 years anyway. But he
pointed out that the risk was growing rapidly. Census figures show that net
immigration from Mexico is about 1000 people a day, he said. Of those, 5 to
10 are probably infected.
Meanwhile, blood banks increased their appeals to Hispanics in the 1990's,
under extra pressure when mad cow disease eliminated donors who had made
long visits to Europe, and AIDS eliminated gay men and other risk groups.
Interest in Chagas seems to be growing, Dr. Kahn said, because
breakthroughs in biogenetics make it easier to attack diseases, and because
the interest of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in third-world health
"put a lot of diseases up on the radar screen."

[The article discusses the theoretical risk of transmitting _Trypanosoma
cruzi_ through blood transfusion. Only 5 cases of blood transfusion
infections have been confirmed in the US and Canada. Infections with
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ are endemic in several Latin American countries, and
the risk of _T.cruzi_ infections through blood transfusions has been
estimated to be between 1 per 43 to 1 per 1072 transfusions in different
countries [Schmunis et al. EID 1998,4(1):5-11].
However, the risk of being infected if receiving blood from a _T.cruzi_
seropositive donor is most probably overestimated. Recent seroprevalence
studies showed that approximately 0.1 percent of blood donors likely to
have been born in or have traveled to disease-endemic countries were
seropositive for _T. cruzi_. Moreover, American Red Cross studies of
recipients of _T. cruzi_Â­seropositive blood and blood products showed no
evidence of transmission [Chamberland et al. EID 1998, 4(3)]. - Mod.EP]
