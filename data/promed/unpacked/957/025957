A new study that investigated the cause of a large outbreak of _E.
coli_ [O157] in 2009 pointed the blame at raw chocolate chip cookie
dough. The researchers say it is the first time an outbreak of food
poisoning caused by the dangerous Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ has
been traced to store-bought, ready-to-bake cookie dough or a similar
product. The outbreak, between March and July 2009, sickened at least
80 people across 30 states, 35 of whom had to be hospitalized.

Anyone who has ever baked homemade cookies knows how tempting the
batter can be. And although most people are aware that sneaking a bite
carries a risk, that knowledge apparently is not much of a deterrent.
A 2008 study of risky eating behaviors among college students found
that 53 percent admitted to eating unbaked homemade cookie dough. In
the new study, published in the latest issue of the journal Clinical
Infectious Diseases, several of the people who were sickened bought
the contaminated cookie dough with the sole intention of eating it
raw. “They had no plans to actually bake cookies,” the authors
reported.

Prudent chefs and parents everywhere usually cite a single cookie
dough ingredient, raw eggs which can carry _Salmonella_, as the reason
to bake before eating. But the study, led by Dr. Karen Neil, a medical
epidemiologist with the CDC, found that the culprit in this case was
likely not eggs, but flour.

“Out of all the ingredients, raw flour is the only raw agricultural
product that was in the cookie dough,” Dr. Neil said. “It didn’t
undergo any specific processing to kill pathogens, so we feel that’s
the most likely suspect for what may have introduced contamination
into the cookie dough. We couldn’t prove it conclusively, but
that’s what we suspect.”

As with many commercial food products, the eggs used in the
contaminated cookie dough were pasteurized, a process that kills
pathogens. The molasses, sugar, baking soda and margarine used in the
dough also underwent “pathogen kill steps” during processing that
made them unlikely to be sources of the contamination, and the
chocolate chips used in the dough revealed no evidence of _E. coli_,
the researchers found.

One study that looked at commercial wheat flour samples found almost
13 percent contaminated with _E. coli_. The investigators also pointed
out that wheat flour can also be contaminated with _Salmonella_, and
that flour-based mixes have previously been implicated in outbreaks of
food-borne illness.

Home cooks who prefer making their own batter should still be just as
wary of consuming unbaked cookie dough, especially because of the
Salmonella risk from raw eggs, Dr. Neil added. “It’s difficult to
do a direct comparison of the risks,” she said, “but the bottom
line is consumers should not eat raw cookie dough, or really any other
raw product that’s intended to be baked or cooked before
consumption.”

“I think the safest thing people can do is just practice good safety
measures in general,” she said. “The four basic messages we use
are clean, separate, cook and chill.” For more information, visit

[Although an enterohemorrhagic strain of _E. coli_ was reported to
have been isolated from a previously unopened package of the Toll
House refrigerated cookie dough, the strain was not shown to be
identical to the outbreak strain. At least 10 cases associated with
the outbreak resulted in hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Commercial flour is not generally thought of as a source of enteric
pathogens but certainly needs to be thought of in the right situation.
