Willy Burgdorfer (1925-2014)
----------------------------
Willy Burgdorfer a medical entomologist who in 1982 identified the cause of what had been a mysterious affliction, Lyme disease, died on [Mon 17 Nov 2014] at a hospital in Hamilton, Montana. He was 89.

The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said Tom Schwan, a colleague of Mr Burgdorfer's for many years at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Hamilton.

Lyme disease took its name from the Connecticut area where it first drew attention in the 1970s, including the towns of Lyme, Old Lyme, and East Haddam. Scores of people in the area, particularly children, had developed rashes, fevers, swollen joints, and sometimes more serious symptoms. Early on, it was called Lyme arthritis. It did not take long for scientists to speculate that there was a common link: blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks.

Many of the children lived and played in wooded areas and developed rashes after being bitten by deer ticks. Cases were more prevalent east of the Connecticut River, where there were more deer. Many laboratory hours were devoted to determining if the deer ticks were spreading a virus. But no virus was detected. There had to be another explanation.

Dr Burgdorfer, who was born and educated in Basel, Switzerland, moved to Hamilton in 1951 to pursue his distinctive specialty: tick surgery, as he liked to call his meticulous method of dissecting ticks to study the diseases they spread. Hamilton, a small city in the Bitterroot Valley, had been home to a prominent laboratory for decades, after the discovery in 1906 that wood ticks in the region were transmitting Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

In the early 1980s, Dr Burgdorfer was analyzing deer ticks from Long Island [NY] that were suspected to have caused spotted fever when he stumbled on something unexpected under his microscope: spirochetes, disease-causing bacteria shaped like corkscrews. They were located in only one section of the ticks, the so-called midguts. He had studied spirochetes in graduate school.

"Once my eyes focused on these long, snakelike organisms, I recognized what I had seen a million times before: spirochetes," he said in a 2001 oral history for the National Institutes of Health, which include the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

He had not been working on Lyme disease, but he had spoken with the doctor who helped discover it, Dr Allen Steere of Yale [University]. After he saw the spirochetes in the Long Island ticks, he quickly realized that the bacteria might also be in the deer ticks believed to be playing a role in Lyme disease in Connecticut and elsewhere, including Long Island.

Deer ticks had not been known to carry spirochetes, but more testing proved him right. In 1982, he and several colleagues published the findings in the journal Science.

Dr Burgdorfer sometimes said that his discovery was serendipitous -- an accident that might have happened only to someone with more than 3 decades of experience in tick surgery.

"Some people use the translated quote from Pasteur that says something like 'chance favors the prepared mind,'" said Dr Schwan, who is also a medical entomologist. "I heard that many times regarding Willy's discovery."

Wilhelm Burgdorfer was born on [27 Jun 1925], to Karl and Else Burgdorfer. He received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Basel and the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel, where he specialized in zoology, parasitology, and bacteriology.

His survivors include his wife, Lois; his sons, Bill and Carl; 2 grandchildren; and a brother, Karl. His wife of more than 50 years, the former Gertrude See, known as Dale, died in 2005. Another influential Lyme disease expert, Stephen E Malawista, who helped oversee Dr Steere's work at Yale, died last year [2013].

In 1951, Mr Burgdorfer received a fellowship from the United States Public Health Service to work at the Hamilton lab. In the 30 years before he discovered the cause of Lyme disease, he spent much of his time studying Rocky Mountain spotted fever, relapsing fevers, plague, and other diseases that can be spread by blood-feeding insects, including ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas.

The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 300 000 people are found to have Lyme disease each year. A vast majority of reported cases are in the Northeast and the Midwest [US]. Lyme disease can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, but not always, and it can continue to cause harm and illness for months or even years after treatment has ended.

There is still no cure, but knowing the role ticks play has prompted educational efforts about Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. When people learn how to recognize and remove ticks, Dr Burgdorfer said in 2001, "then the chances of getting sick are not so great."

He retired in 1986. He won numerous awards as well as other forms of recognition.

The bacterium that causes Lyme disease has been named in honor of him: _Borrelia burgdorferi_.

[Willy Burgdorfer will long be recognized for his having discovered the Lyme disease spirochete named after him, _Borrelia burgdorferi_. The success in having found the spirochete that causes the disease is a reflection of his careful, detailed approach to the way he studied ticks and the pathogens that they transmit. His many scientific contributions provide a strong base for others working in tick-borne pathogen area to build upon. - Mod.TY]
