For those who may be interested the first case of human to human rabies
transmission by corneal transplant occurred in Oregon and Idaho. The donor
of the cornea was from Oregon where he was likely bitten by a rabid bat.
He was taken to Boise Idaho for treatment. After death, his cornea was
transplanted into a 37 year old woman who developed rabies 6 weeks later
(New England Journal of Medicine, volume 300, 1978(?).

[From a previous post: The farmer, who stuck his hand in the cow's mouth
while examining it, will likely submit to a series of painful rabies
vaccinations so he won't get the disease.
There are two common MISCONCEPTIONS about human rabies vaccines. One is
that they are "painful". As I was vaccinated several times in vet school, I
can say they are no more painful than any other vaccine. [Was this
pre-exposure vaccination or post-exposure? Mod. TG The second
misconception is that they are injected into the stomach or abdomen (as
seen in a famous painting of Pasteur watching a physician injecting the
vaccine into the first patient). In fact, they are given just like any
other vaccine either as sub-cutaneous or intramuscular injections (shoulder).

I know it's a "news media (edited)" source but, "...submit to a series of
painful rabies vaccinations..."..."painful"???...expensive, perhaps
unpleasant, but "painful"??? When consulting with people in Texas who have
been exposed to rabid/potentially rabid animals, I regularly tell them that
the days of the "painful" rabies immunizations (people still remember tales
of the old many-dose series in the abdomen regimens) are over. Over at
least with the exception of perhaps having to have a large volume of rabies
immune globulin injected into/around the bite site (if there even is bite
site, often there isn't). Receiving rabies post-exposure prophylaxis isn't
much different than getting any other injection(s) in the arm. However,.it
can be "traumatic" enough to be receiving rabies post-exposure prophylaxis
(with death as a possible alternative to immunization) without telling the
recipient that they'll be "submitting" to a "series of painful rabies
vaccinations".

[It is my understanding that immunoglobulins can be quite painful.
Furthermore, large doses of immunoglobulin is also painful. Pre-exposure
immunization is not the same as post exposure immunization. Each person*s
pain threshold is different. The very nature of immunoglobulins being
injected can be painful. However, it is a locally painful thing and is
quite nothing compared to fear of losing one*s life. Perhaps the real
tragedy here is that vaccination of the animals could have prevented it.
There are excellent vaccines against rabies for horses and cattle. Many
veterinarians recommend rabies vaccination for horses and cattle, just as
for dogs and cats. This is always a good idea and in the long run is a
cheap insurance policy. - Mod.TG
