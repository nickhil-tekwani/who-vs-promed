Deceased toddler confirmed to have died of bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
Blood samples taken from the 2-and-a-half-year-old chld who died last
week [23-27 Mar 2009] in Pekanbaru, Riau, have tested positive for
the bird flu virus, an official said on Wednesday [1 Apr 2009].
Azizman Saad, coordinator of the bird flu prevention team at the
Arifin Ahmad hospital in Pekanbaru, that confirmation that the child
died from bird flu had been received by the Riau Health Office
several days ago. "The victim is believed to have contracted the
virus from dead chickens in his surrounding areas," Azizman told The
Jakarta Post. Indonesia's bird flu death [toll] reached 119 as of
early this month, according to data from the national bird flu
commission. Blood samples of patients believed to have been infected
with the virus are usually sent to the Health Research Agency of the
Ministry of Health in Jakarta.

Following the confirmation, Azizman urged the child's family members
and neighbors in Tanjung Rhu village, Pekanbaru to go to the nearest
community health center to have a check-up. "There has not been any
evidence that the bird flu infection can be transmitted from human to
human, but the case shows the bird flu outbreak took place in the
victim's area. It's better for those who had made contact with the
victim to go to the health center even though they do not have any
health problems," he said.

Azizman explained that the child was intensively treated for high
fever and coughing and breathing difficulties in an isolated room at
Arifin Achmad hospital. "One day before he died, his condition was
improving but, finally, his condition [deteriorated] and he fell
unconscious. Six doctors tried to save his life, but to no avail," he
said. Azizman explained that before the disclosure of the laboratory
tests the child was believed to have died from multi-organ failure.

Rini Hermiyati of the Pekanbaru Health Office said she had assigned a
team to observe the health condition of the victim's family members
and at the same time make an inventory of neighbors who were in
contact with the victim. "No one has been found with symptoms of bird
flu, but those having contact with the victims will be closely
watched out for 21 days," Rini said.

The Pekanbaru Livestock Husbandry Office made the decision to cull
chickens in the victim's surrounding areas to help curb the spread of
the virus. "The number of chickens raised here is small," she said.
Meanwhile, Susi Herlinda, a member of the Pekanbaru Legislative
Council, criticized the administration for its failure to anticipate
the bird flu infection. The death of the victim showed the
administration was not aggressive enough in campaign about the danger
of bird flu, she said. "It has become a habit of our people,
everybody acts only after somebody falls victim to a certain
diseases. The death of this child should have been used as momentum
to improve," she said. "Related institutions have to create awareness
among the public about the danger of the bird flu," Susi added.
