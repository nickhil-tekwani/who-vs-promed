Suspected anthrax has killed 25 buffaloes in northeast Namibia, Environment Minister Pohamba Shifeta confirmed on [Tue 10 Oct 2017].

Anthrax has already claimed the lives of 120 hippopotami over the Oct. 1-8 period [2017], also in the Bwabwata National Park in the Zambezi region.

Pohamba said authorities are waiting for laboratory results to determine what killed the animals, although anthrax appears to be the most likely cause. "The state will do anything in its power to make sure that disease control programs are put in place to avoid such high number of mortalities in the future," Pohamba said.

[A very brief statement by the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation
https://www.nbc.na/news/suspected-anthrax-outbreak-killed-hippos-could-have-affected-buffaloes.12975 stated: "A suspected anthrax outbreak that killed hippos in western Bwabwata National Park could have affected buffaloes as well." Which confirms what the News Ghana report suggested. While it is very probable that both species are affected with anthrax, we still await the results of laboratory confirmation. The previous report from Namibia was of 109 hippo deaths, so 120 indicates a wider search for carcasses, which is probably the origin now of the buffalo deaths report. - Mod.MHJ
