Two people from Far North Queensland are in hospital being treated for meningococcal disease. Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service said 3 cases associated with St Mary's Catholic College were confirmed this week. Parents were notified on Monday [23 May 2022] once the 1st case was confirmed.

Contact tracing was undertaken and the hospital said close household contacts had been provided with antibiotics in line with national guidelines. Antibiotics will also be offered to students and staff at the school, in case any are carrying the bacteria that causes the disease.

Principal Wayne Wood said 2 senior students and a teacher had tested positive but he did not confirm which of the 3 remained in hospital. Mr Wood said a consent letter would be sent to parents ahead of a "one-tablet dose" of antibiotics being offered on Friday [27 May 2022]. "We will make sure that all students, every student at St Mary's, is included in the antibiotic rollout," he said. "The need for it to happen quickly and all together is the most important thing in addressing the situation."

People have been urged to watch for signs and symptoms, including rash, vomiting, fever, headache, confusion, a stiff neck and joint pain. "If concerned, people should seek immediate medical attention, as early treatment with antibiotics can be life-saving," Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair said.

Meningococcal disease is a relatively rare illness, but the disease can cause serious illness marked by a rapid deterioration. It is caused by bacteria, not by a virus, and can be spread via droplets from the nose or throat during coughing and sneezing or close contact, such as kissing.

"We don't really understand why this common germ that's carried by one in 10 people sometimes causes diseases and outbreaks," Dr Gair said. "When we get outbreaks, what we aim to do is eradicate carriage in the people who are most likely to have given it to the case."

Dr Gair said one of the cases in the outbreak was caused by serotype B, but there were different types of this serotype. "The vaccine that we have for serotype B is only effective against 76% of the strains found in Australia," he said.

Tropical Public Health Services organised a virtual forum to give families and staff more information and to answer questions.

[Patients with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), which usually consists of either meningitis or bloodstream infection (called meningococcemia), require hospitalization because of the severity of the illness. The news report above says that only 2 of the 3 patients in Cairns with meningococcal meningitis are hospitalized; this requires further explanation. The 3 cases, 2 senior students and one teacher, are associated with St Mary's Catholic College in Cairns.

IMD is usually due to one of 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) of _Neisseria meningitidis_. In Australia, serogroups B, W, and Y account for most cases of IMD, with serogroup B accounting for about 50% of cases (https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-meningococcal-W.htm). We are told that one of the 3 cases was caused serogroup B, but we are not told the serogroup(s) causing the other 2 cases. To be a common source outbreak, all 3 cases should be caused by the same serogroup.

_N. meningitidis_ shows considerable genetic diversity, owing to the ability of meningococci for transformation and horizontal gene exchange, presumably with co-colonizing strains in the human nasopharynx. Genetic diversity characterizes meningococci recovered from the nasopharynx of healthy carriers, whereas molecular epidemiology has revealed that only a few hypervirulent clonal complexes cause most cases of IMD (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). Although asymptomatic carriage of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic _N. meningitidis_ is common, few carriers develop invasive disease; for the majority of people, carriage is an immunizing process that results in a systemic, serogroup-specific protective antibody response (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

_N. meningitidis_ spreads from person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions during close and prolonged contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of the outbreak strain of _N. meningitidis_ as soon as possible, regardless of immunization status, because only close contacts are at increased risk for infection. Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest during the first few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours after the case is identified).

Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

Far North Queensland is the northernmost part of the Australian state of Queensland; its largest city is Cairns (pop., about 154 000 residents in 2019), a popular tourist destination because of its access to the Great Barrier Reef (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns). St Mary's Catholic College is a Catholic co-educational secondary school (grades 7-12) in Cairns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Mary%27s_Catholic_College,_Queensland). A map showing the location of St. Mary's College in Cairns can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Mary%27s_Catholic_College,_Queensland#/map/0. - Mod.ML
