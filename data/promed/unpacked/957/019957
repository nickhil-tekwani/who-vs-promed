Influenza activity continues, but starts to decline in the WHO
European Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- Clinical influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory
infections (ARI) activity has peaked in 27 countries.
- 42 percent of sentinel ILI and/or ARI specimens, and 52 percent of
sentinel SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] specimens were
positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B continue to
co-circulate in the Region.

Current situation -- week 7/2011 [14-20 Feb 2011]
-------------------------------------------------
During week 7/2011, one country (Georgia) reported very high
intensity of influenza activity; 9 countries reported high intensity;
25 reported medium intensity; and 7 countries, low intensity. 22
countries reported widespread activity. Of the 26 countries reporting
on the impact of influenza on health care systems, one (Georgia)
reported severe impact; 13 countries reported moderate impact; and 12,
low impact.

Epidemiological data suggest that significant influenza activity
continues, but in general may be starting to decline in intensity
across the WHO European Region. Increasing trends in clinical
consultation rates for ILI and/or ARI were observed in 13 countries,
while 18 reported declining trends. Clinical ILI or ARI activity has
peaked in 27 countries.

During week 7/2011, 9 countries reported data on sentinel
surveillance for hospitalized SARI cases (Armenia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian
Federation, Serbia and Ukraine). Sentinel SARI hospitalizations in
Kazakhstan, Romania, the Russian Federation, and Serbia remained
relatively stable compared to the previous week and are above
pre-season levels. SARI hospitalizations in the Republic of Moldova
and Ukraine remain below earlier peaks. In Georgia, SARI
hospitalizations declined in week 7/2011 following the notable
increase reported in week 6/2011 [7-13 Feb 2011]. This decline is
concurrent with the decline in ILI consultation rates in Georgia
during recent weeks. A significant percentage of sentinel SARI
specimens continues to test positive for influenza. Of the countries
testing 10 or more sentinel SARI specimens, the percentage testing
positive for influenza ranged from 44 percent (Romania) to 65 percent
(Georgia) with a median of 50 percent (mean: 52 percent). Further
information on the sentinel SARI surveillance systems represented in
the EuroFlu bulletin can be found in the "Overview of sentinel SARI
systems in EuroFlu"
[<http://www.euroflu.org/documents/EuroFlu_Overview_of_SARI_Surveillance_Systems.pdf>].

Virological situation -- week 7/2011 [14-20 Feb 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 16
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 10 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 5 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 2291 respiratory specimens, of which
966 (42 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 492 (51 percent)
were influenza A and 474 (49 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 415 were subtyped: 399 (96 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 16 (4 percent) as A(H3). In the 30 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent to
94 percent, with a median of 48 percent (mean: 45 percent). In
addition, 5882 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 4523 (77 percent) influenza A and 1359 (23 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 3994 were subtyped: 3946 (99
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 48 (1 percent) as A(H3).

Out of 227 sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 7/2011, 119
(52 percent) tested positive for influenza: 77 (65 percent) were
influenza A; 42 (35 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 60 were subtyped: 53 (88 percent) as pandemic A(H1), and 7
(12 percent) as A(H3).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-7/2011 [4 Oct 2010-20
Feb 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 64 935 influenza virus detections was reported during this
period, of which 46 855 (72 percent) were influenza A and 18 080 (28
percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 36 054 were
subtyped: 34 794 (97 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1259 (3 percent) as
influenza A(H3), and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010] to week 7/2011 [14-20 Feb 2011],
888 out of 3340 sentinel SARI specimens (27 percent) tested positive
for influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 430 (48 percent) were
influenza A and 458 (52 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 308 were subtyped: 284 (92 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 24
(8 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 2222 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1276 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 779 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 99 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 67 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 343 influenza viruses, 151 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 8 belonged to the pandemic
A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 33 belonged to the pandemic A/Hong
Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 29 were reported as A(H1) pandemic not
attributed to group category but belonging to the recently emerged
A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T substitution in the
HA; 9 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 7
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 19
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 9 belonged to the
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 78 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 5 countries (Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, and
the UK) have screened 806 viruses for susceptibility to the
neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed
most of the viruses screened (671). Out of the total of 743 isolates
of pandemic A(H1N1) viruses that were tested, 713 were sensitive to
both inhibitors and 30 viruses (4.0 percent) carried the NA H275Y
mutation. These 30 viruses were resistant to oseltamivir but remained
sensitive to zanamivir. One influenza A(H3N2) virus was tested and
found to be sensitive to both inhibitors. All of the 61 influenza B
viruses tested for susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 62 tested for
susceptibility to zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 35
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that
were screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be
resistant.

Comment
-------
Significant influenza activity continues in the WHO European Region.
While increasing clinical consultation rates of ILI and ARI are
observed in some countries, many others have reported recent declines
in clinical outpatient activity. This observation is consistent with
recent declining trends in the percentage of sentinel detections of
influenza A and influenza B viruses across the Region.

Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 is circulating with the highest
intensity in the south-central and eastern parts of the region.
Cumulative data for weeks 4 to 7/2011 [24 Jan-20 Feb 2011] indicate
that during this time 68 percent of sentinel SARI specimens that
tested positive for influenza also subtyped as influenza A(H1N1)2009
virus. Hence, now that influenza A(H1N1) 2009 has moved into the
eastern portion of the Region, the relative distribution of influenza
types and subtypes in hospitalized SARI patients has become similar to
that observed cumulatively from other sentinel and non-sentinel data
sources.

[In brief, as before, slightly fewer than half influenza-like illness
and acute respiratory infection sentinel specimens tested positive for
influenza virus, and slightly more than half in the case of severe
acute respiratory infections.

The epidemiological data suggest that significant influenza activity
continues, but in general may be starting to decline in intensity
across the 45 Member States in the WHO European Region.

Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 16
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 10 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 5 countries. The previous seasonal strain of
influenza (H1N1) virus has been isolated only rarely.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map. - Mod.CP]
