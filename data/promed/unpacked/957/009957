Guizhou reports 2 human bird flu cases
--------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health today [10 Feb 2013] notified the Centre for Health Protection of 2 confirmed human cases of influenza A (H5N1) in Guizhou. A 21 year old woman and a 31 year old man living in Guizhou are in critical condition. Neither had an obvious history of exposure to poultry before they came down with symptoms. There is no epidemiological link between these 2 cases. Both tested positive for H5N1.

The Centre is liaisoning with the Ministry to obtain more information and will heighten vigilance and continue to maintain stringent port health measures in connection with this development.

China confirms 2 human cases of bird flu
----------------------------------------
China on Sunday [10 Feb 2013] reported 2 human cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in the south western city of Guiyang, the Ministry of Health announced. A 21 year old woman and a 31 year old man, who developed symptoms on 2 Feb 2013 and 3 Feb 2013 respectively, tested positive for the H5N1 virus on Sunday [10 Feb 2013], the Ministry said, citing local health authorities.

"They are in critical condition and medical workers are carrying out emergency treatment," the ministry said in a statement. "No epidemiological connections have been found between the 2 cases."

An investigation did not find the 2 had contacts with fowl before they fell ill, it said. People who had close contacts with the 2 patients have been put under medical observation, but none of them has been found ill so far.

The human highly pathogenic avian influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease mainly caused by the deadly H5N1 virus. The main symptoms include high fever and pneumonia. The human cases of bird flu are mainly transmitted from poultry to humans and there are no reported outbreaks of sustained human-to-human transmission.

[Guizhou is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the south west region of the country (see map at http://www.planetware.com/i/map/CHN/china-guizhou-province-map.jpg. Its provincial capital city is Guiyang.

Previously there have been 43 human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection recorded in China, 28 of whom died. The 2 new fatal cases reported above are the 1st confirmed cases of 2013. Significant features of these 2 new cases are that they are unrelated and have had no known contact with each other, or with diseased fowl.

It is possible that these individuals have enhanced susceptibility to infection by the avian A/H5N1 influenza virus. It has been established recently that a specific gene mutation in the interferon induction pathway (rs12252-C) is present in 69 per cent of Chinese patients hospitalised with H1N1 swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09 infection], and rare in other populations. This may explain the greater apparent vulnerability of the Han Chinese population to swine influenza virus (A/H1N1pdm09) infection. Although this variant affects severity of infection rather than susceptibility, it is likely that susceptibility will be affected by similar mutations.
