Are COVID vaccination programmes working? Scientists seek 1st clues
--------------------------------------------
Vaccinated people in Israel are less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but a population-wide effect will take time to become clear.

Nature Briefing commentary: All eyes are on Israel, which has vaccinated roughly one-quarter of its population, for the 1st real-world evidence of a COVID vaccine's efficacy. A preliminary analysis of people older than 60 who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine found that it cut the chances of testing positive for the virus by a 3rd at 2 weeks after the 1st injection, compared with a matched group who did not receive the jab. More conclusive results will come after people receive their 2nd shot. "We were happy to see this preliminary result that suggests a real-world impact in the approximate timing and direction we would have expected," says epidemiologist Ran Balicer.

The big question is how vaccines will change the course of the pandemic. Teasing apart the population-level effects of vaccines on a drop in COVID-19 cases from the impacts of other public-health interventions, such as social distancing and lockdowns, will be tricky. In places where outbreaks are rampant or lower-efficacy vaccines are being rolled out, it will be some time before immunization significantly reduces transmission. "But even with an imperfect vaccine, that population-level impact on deaths could still be quite substantial," says epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre.

Nature report: As countries worldwide roll out COVID-19 vaccines, researchers are eagerly watching for early signs that they are having an impact on the pandemic. Last week, researchers in Israel reported preliminary figures suggesting that people vaccinated there were about 1/3 less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than people who had not received a shot. But scientists say that population-wide effects of immunization will take time to become clear. Many factors will determine how soon scientists can detect the impact of vaccines on the pandemic. Among them are the extent of vaccine coverage, the effectiveness of shots at preventing disease and infection, and the rate of viral transmission.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates are leading the world in vaccine coverage. The 2 nations have vaccinated roughly one-quarter of their populations, more than 2 million people each. Other nations, such as the United Kingdom and Norway, have targeted their vaccination programmes at high-risk groups. Britain has vaccinated more than 4 million people, mostly health-care workers and older people, including those living in care homes; Norway has immunized all residents living in nursing homes, some 40 000 people.

First signs
The results from Israel are among the 1st to report the impact of vaccines administered to people outside clinical trials. They provide an early indication that the 2-dose RNA-based vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech can prevent infection or limit its duration in some vaccinated people.

In a preliminary analysis of 200 000 people older than 60 who received the vaccine, compared with a matched group of 200 000 who did not, researchers found that the chances of testing positive for the virus were 33% lower 2 weeks after the 1st injection. "We were happy to see this preliminary result that suggests a real-world impact in the approximate timing and direction we would have expected," says Ran Balicer, an epidemiologist at Israel's largest health-care provider, Clalit Health Services, in Tel Aviv. He expects to get more conclusive results several weeks after people receive their 2nd shot. Another analysis, by Maccabi Healthcare Services, found a similar trend, although neither study has been peer-reviewed.

Clinical trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine show it to be around 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, and the preliminary data suggest it can also provide some protection from infection. But it will take longer to establish whether vaccinated people no longer spread the virus to unvaccinated people, says Balicer.

As more than 75% of older people in Israel have been vaccinated, Balicer says he expects to see a drop in hospitalizations among vaccinated older people over the coming weeks.

Most countries are prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations for people who have a high risk of getting severe disease and dying. So, the 1st evidence that shots are working in those countries will probably be reductions in hospitalizations, and then in deaths, says Alexandra Hogan, an infectious-disease modeller at Imperial College London.

Indirect effects
If vaccines are effective at preventing infections, then their indirect benefit -- protecting unvaccinated people -- will be visible only once enough people have been immunized, says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Israel will probably be the 1st country to see this kind of population-wide impact, say researchers. This is because it is using a high-efficacy vaccine and aiming for wide coverage with the explicit goal of achieving herd immunity, when enough people are immune to a virus for its spread to be controlled. In some places, the 1st signs of indirect protection might emerge in specific groups who have been widely vaccinated, such as health-care and long-term-care workers and their families, says Dean.

But teasing apart the population-level effects of vaccines on a drop in COVID-19 cases from the impacts of other public-health interventions, such as social distancing and lockdowns, will be tricky. "Infectious diseases are very unpredictable, so you end up needing a lot of data to smooth out a lot of unpredictability," says Dean.

Challenges ahead
The effect of vaccines on reducing overall COVID-19 infections will be more difficult to ascertain in regions such as Norway, which have largely brought the virus under control, says Hogan.

Yet rampant transmission also complicates such investigations, until countries reach high vaccine coverage, adds Dean. Vaccinated health-care workers, for example, might be able to protect their families from infection, but when the virus is everywhere, there will be lots of opportunities for it to enter a household, she says.

Israel aside, vaccines will not have an impact on viral spread any time soon, says Raina MacIntyre, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. "Many other countries are using much lower-efficacy vaccines, which are unlikely to control infection," she says.

Modelling work by Hogan shows that vaccines that are less effective at preventing infection will have a smaller impact on transmission in the population. "But even with an imperfect vaccine, that population-level impact on deaths could still be quite substantial," she says.

[These results, while promising, appear to highlight the need for 2 doses, raising concerns were only one dose to be administered to extend vaccination to as many naive individuals as possible. It is hopeful the vaccine will prevent infection and transmission and not only disease, although even the latter is welcome. - Mod LK]

[2] Variants and immune escape
Date: Fri 22 Jan 2021

Ref: Kupferschmidt K, et al.: New mutations raise specter of 'immune escape.' Science. 22 Jan 2021; 371(6527): 329-330; DOI: 10.1126/science.371.6527.329

When the number of COVID-19 cases began to rise again in Manaus, Brazil, in December 2020, Nuno Faria was stunned. The virologist at Imperial College London had just co-authored a paper in Science estimating that 3/4 of the city's inhabitants had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic coronavirus, more than enough, it seemed, for herd immunity to develop. The virus should be done with Manaus. Yet hospitals were filling up again. "It was hard to reconcile these 2 things," Faria says. He started to hunt for samples he could sequence to find out whether changes in the virus could explain the resurgence.

On [12 Jan 2021], Faria and his colleagues posted their initial conclusions on the website virological.org. Thirteen of 31 samples collected in mid-December [2020] in Manaus turned out to be part of a new viral lineage they called P.1. Much more research is needed, but they say one possibility is that in some people, P.1 eludes the human immune response triggered by the lineage that ravaged the city earlier in 2020.

Emerging variants of the coronavirus have been in the news ever since scientists raised the alarm over B.1.1.7, a SARS-CoV-2 variant that 1st caught scientists' attention in England in December [2020] and that is more transmissible than previously circulating viruses (Science, 8 Jan 2020, p. 108). But now, they're also focusing on a potential new threat: variants that could do an end run around the human immune response. Such "immune escapes" could mean more people who have had COVID-19 remain susceptible to reinfection, and that proven vaccines may, at some point, need an update.

At a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting on [12 Jan 2021], hundreds of researchers discussed the most important scientific questions raised by the wave of new mutations. WHO also convened its COVID-19 Emergency Committee on [14 Jan 2021] to discuss the impact of the new variants and the travel restrictions that many countries are imposing to contain them. The committee called for a global effort to sequence more SARS-CoV-2 genomes to help track mutations.

The more transmissible variant, B.1.1.7, is already spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark, and probably in many other countries. But scientists are just as worried about 501Y.V2, a variant detected in South Africa. Some of the mutations it carries, including ones named E484K and K417N, change its surface protein, spike, and have been shown in the lab to reduce how well monoclonal antibodies combat the virus. In a preprint published earlier this month [January 2021], Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, showed that E484K also reduced the potency of convalescent sera from some donors 10-fold, although he is quick to add this does not necessarily mean the mutation would cause people's immunity to the new strain to drop 10-fold.

P.1 adds to the concerns because it appears to have hit on a similar constellation of mutations and has emerged in a place with a high level of immunity. "Anytime you see the same mutations arising and starting to spread multiple times, in different viral strains across the world, that's really strong evidence that there's some evolutionary advantage to those mutations," Bloom says.

Like B.1.1.7, the Brazilian variant is already on the move. Just as Faria was finishing his analysis of the Brazilian genomes, a report was published of a variant detected in travelers arriving in Japan from Brazil, and it turned out to be P.1. (As Science went to press, U.S. researchers also reported several new variants, but their importance remained unclear.)

How these new variants are affecting the course of the pandemic is unclear. In Manaus, for example, P.1 might have nothing to do with the new surge in infections; people's immunity might simply be waning, says University of Oxford epidemiologist Oliver Pybus. Or it might be driving the boost because it is transmitted more easily, like B.1.1.7, not because it can evade the immune response. "Of course, it could be a combination of these factors, too," Pybus says.

Similarly, in a recent modeling study, researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine calculated that South Africa's 501Y.V2 variant could be 50% more transmissible but no better at evading immunity, or just as transmissible as previous variants but able to evade immunity in one in 5 people previously infected. "Reality may lie between these extremes," the authors wrote.

Ester Sabino, a molecular biologist at the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, has launched a study to find reinfections in Manaus that could help decide between these hypotheses for P.1. Lab studies investigating the variants are also underway. The United Kingdom on [15 Jan 2021] launched a new consortium, G2P-UK (for "genotype to phenotype-UK"), headed by Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London, to study the effects of emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2. One idea discussed at the [12 Jan 2021] WHO meeting is to set up a biobank that would aid studies by housing virus samples, as well as plasma from vaccine recipients and recovered patients.

Interactions between the new mutations may make it harder to tease out their effects. The variants from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Manaus all share a mutation named N501Y, for instance, or Nelly, as some researchers call it. But the mutation, which affects the spike protein, also occurs in some variants that do not spread faster, suggesting N501Y does not operate alone, says Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research: "Nelly might be innocent, except maybe when she's hanging with her bad friends."

Bloom thinks none of the changes is likely to let the virus escape the immune response entirely. "But I would expect that those viruses have some advantage when a lot of the population has immunity," which might help explain the surge in Manaus.

So far, the virus does not appear to have become resistant to COVID-19 vaccines, says vaccinologist Philip Krause, who chairs a WHO working group on COVID-19 vaccines. "The not-so-good news is that the rapid evolution of these variants suggests that, if it is possible for the virus to evolve into a vaccine-resistant phenotype, this may happen sooner than we like," he adds. That possibility adds to the urgency of putting good surveillance in place to detect such escape variants early on, says biostatistician Natalie Dean of the University of Florida.

Some scientists worry that proposed changes in vaccine dosing regimens could hasten the evolution of such strains. Desperate to tame a massive surge in cases, the United Kingdom on [30 Dec 2020] decided to allow up to 12 weeks between the 1st and 2nd dose of 2 authorized vaccines, rather than the 3 or 4 weeks used in the vaccines' clinical trials, so more people can get their 1st dose quickly and have at least some immunity. And the Trump administration decided to ship all available doses immediately, rather than holding back 50% to guarantee that people receive their 2nd doses on time. That policy, which the Biden administration has said it will follow, could inadvertently extend the dosing interval if future vaccine deliveries don't arrive or aren't administered on time.

Widespread delays of the 2nd dose might create a pool of millions of people with enough antibodies to slow the virus and avoid getting sick, but not enough to wipe it out. That could well be the perfect recipe for creating vaccine-resistant strains, says virologist Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai: "If we end up with everybody just getting one dose with no doses available for a timely boost, that would, in my opinion, be a problem."

But others say unchecked spread of the virus poses greater risks. "It's carnage out there," says evolutionary microbiologist Andrew Read of Pennsylvania State University, University Park. "Twice as many people with partial immunity has got to be better than full immunity in half of them." Historically, few viruses have managed to evolve resistance to vaccines, with the notable exception of seasonal influenza, which evolves so rapidly on its own--without vaccine pressure--that it requires a newly designed vaccine every year.

If vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains emerge, vaccines might need to be updated. Several vaccines could be easily changed to reflect the latest changes, but regulators might balk at authorizing them without seeing updated safety and efficacy data, Krause says. If new variants circulate alongside older strains, multivalent vaccines, effective against several lineages, might even be needed. "To be clear: These are downstream considerations," Krause says. "The public should not think that this is imminent, and that new vaccines will be needed." But Ravindra Gupta, a researcher at the University of Cambridge, says manufacturers should start to produce vaccines designed to generate immunity to mutated versions of the spike protein, because they keep cropping up. "It tells us that we should have these mutations in our vaccines, so that you shut off one of the avenues for the virus to go down."

For now, increased transmissibility is the biggest worry, says virologist Angela Rasmussen of Georgetown University. "I'm puzzled why [that] isn't a bigger part of the conversation," she says. The U.S. hospital system, she says, "is at capacity in many places, and further increases in transmission can tip us over the edge where the system collapses. Then we'll start seeing potentially huge increases in mortality."

[Other possible explanations for the surge in cases in Manaus include waning immunity following the primary infection, interaction among mutations rather than a single mutation being responsible, increased infectiousness or transmissibility of the strains in lineage P.1, among other possibilities. Further study of these cases of re-infection and laboratory experiments will clarify what is behind the surge.

"Abstract
"There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses. However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these "future" viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers greater than 1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of "future" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."

Ref: Horby P, Huntley C, Davies N, Edmunds J, Ferguson N, et al. NERVTAG [New and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group] note on B.1.1.7 severity

NERVTAG Summary
1.The variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 appears to have substantially increased transmissibility compared to other variants and has grown quickly to become the dominant variant in much of the UK.

2. Initial assessment by PHE of disease severity through a matched case-control study reported no significant difference in the risk of hospitalisation or death in people infected with confirmed B.1.1.7 infection versus infection with other variants. [1]

3. Several new analyses are, however, consistent in reporting increased disease severity in people infected with VOC B.1.1.7 compared to people infected with non-VOC virus variants.

7. Based on these analyses, there is a realistic possibility that infection with VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death compared to infection with non-VOC viruses.

8. It should be noted that the absolute risk of death per infection remains low.

Summary
20. There is evidence from analysis of Pillar 2 testing data linked to COVID-19 deaths that infection with VOC B1.1.7 is associated with an increased case-fatality rate compared to infection with non-VOC viruses. The relative increase in CFR appears to be apparent across age groups.

21. An initial retrospective matched cohort study from PHE (also based on linked testing and mortality data) found no evidence of a significant difference in risk of hospitalisation or death between individuals with VOC and individuals with non-VOC when analysis was restricted to those with completed 28 days follow-up, but had insufficient statistical power to assess this accurately. A later update of the analysis with additional follow-up time has now also identified an increased risk ratio for 28-day case fatality.

22. CO-CIN [COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN)] has not found evidence of an increase in hospital case-fatality rate associated with VOC B.1.1.7, both across the whole cohort and in a single trust with a high rate of good-quality data using sequence-determined lineage. However, increased severity may not necessarily be reflected by increased in-hospital death risk.

23. There are limitations in all datasets that it may not be possible to resolve, but as more data accrue, the analyses will become more definitive.

The new, more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 found in England is just one of many variations of the virus being detected around the world.

A strong global surveillance system is required to detect the genetic changes in the virus, followed by good clinical and biological studies analyzing the implications of those changes. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (193 956), Brazil (55 319), Spain (42 885), and the UK (40 261) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 818 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 21 Jan to late 22 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Spain Brazil, UK, France (23 292), Russia (21 513), Mexico (21 007), Germany (16 366), Colombia (15 073), India (14 344), Portugal (13 987), Italy (13 633), Indonesia (13 632), and Argentina (10 753). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 52 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 21.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 5.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are almost 650 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours -- 100 000 less than yesterday (21 Jan 2021) -- and over 98.7 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.11 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 4 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 12 out of the last 13 days. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
