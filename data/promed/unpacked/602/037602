Randall Foods Inc. on Wednesday [19 May 2021] recalled all 21 varieties of its Randall-brand beans, citing "manufacturing deviations" that may have allowed for botulism contamination. According to the voluntary recall issued by the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company, the affected beans were potentially underprocessed, which can result in _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination. The manufacturing deviations included a nonfunctioning temperature-indicating device, but no illnesses linked to the potentially compromised products have been reported, the company stated.

An estimated 1.6 million cases of affected beans were distributed between 1 Mar 2019 and 15 May 2021 at retail locations across the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

According to the CDC, botulism is a rare but potentially deadly illness that can affect neural and motor function. Symptoms may include:
- Double vision
- Blurred vision
- Drooping eyelids
- Slurred speech
- Difficulty swallowing
- A thick-feeling tongue
- Dry mouth
- Muscle weakness

[This is the 2nd recall of canned beans for botulism risk in the past few weeks. Specific information including lot numbers and food descriptions can be found at the source URL above.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
