USGS surveillance update, as of Wed 18 Jun 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) reflect information for the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season
that has been submitted and verified to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) up to Wed 18 Jun 2003.
The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are created
from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance database. The maps
portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive surveillance data reported to
the CDC by cooperating health departments and verified to ArboNET. In
addition, maps for two surveillance categories (avians and mosquitoes) will
portray counties that have done "testing" of samples for WNV. Discrepancies
noted between these data and data presented from other sources reflect
local variations in reporting policies and procedures. It is not unusual
for cases to be announced in other media before being reported and verified
in ArboNET.
The following information is a synopsis of the results of West Nile virus
surveillance listed according to state. The original USGS maps further
locate both positive and negative surveillance reports by county. (The data
are provisional and may be subject to revision.)
Birds
-----
Twenty-six states are conducting surveillance with 20 states reporting
cumulative positive test results as follows: Alabama (5), Colorado (1),
Florida (5), Georgia (9), Illinois (1), Indiana (2), Iowa (4), Kentucky
(0), Louisiana (38), Michigan (6), Mississippi (3), New Hampshire (0),
Nebraska (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), North Carolina (2), North
Dakota (2), Ohio (4), Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (2),
South Dakota (0), Tennessee (1), Utah (0), Washington (0), Wyoming (1).
Mosquitoes
----------
Nine states are conducting surveillance with three states reporting
cumulative positive results as follows: Colorado (0), Connecticut (0),
Georgia (2), Indiana (1), New Hampshire (0), New Jersey (1), North Carolina
(0), Pennsylvania (0), Utah (0).
Sentinel Flocks
---------------
Two states are conducting surveillance, both reporting unchanged cumulative
positive test results as follows: Florida (34), North Carolina (1).
Veterinary
----------
Eight states are conducting surveillance and all 8 are reporting cumulative
positive test results [presumed to be equines] as follows: Alabama (1),
Arkansas (1), Georgia (1), Kentucky (1), Minnesota (1), North Dakota (1),
Wisconsin (1), Wyoming (1).
Human
-----
There are no reports of surveillance activity or positive test results from
any state. [A suspected case of human infection in Washington state (see:
West Nile virus, human - USA (Washington): suspected 20030601.1334) has not
been confirmed. Mod.CP]

[Since the previous report dated 11 Jun 2003 the number of states carrying
out surveillance of wild birds has increased by 6 to 26. West Nile
virus-positive birds have been confirmed in Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska,
North Dakota, and Ohio for the first time. The number of states reporting
West Nile virus positive equines has increased by one (North Dakota). Three
of the 9 states conducting surveillance of mosquitoes have reported West
Nile virus positive results (Georgia, Indiana, and New Jersey). Reports of
West Nile virus positive sentinel flocks remain unchanged. No human cases
of West Nile virus infection have been confirmed anywhere in the United
States. - Mod.CP]
