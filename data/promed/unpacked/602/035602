Northern Mongolia hit by anthrax outbreak
-----------------------------------------
Mongolian authorities on Thursday [8 Jul 2010] confirmed that 3
herders have been infected with anthrax and that containment measures
are already under way. All 3 cases happened in the Selenge province
in northern Mongolia, where authorities have taken measures to
quarantine and disinfect areas surrounding the herders' residences,
the national emergency management authority said.

A total of 7 other local residents were suspected of being infected
with the usually fatal bacterial disease, which affects both animals
and human beings, and have been sent to hospitals, the government
said. It added that so far 6 cattle, 2 horses, one sheep and one goat
have died due to anthrax infection, and some 5300 livestock in the
region have been vaccinated.

[Selenge is not the most commonly reported province for anthrax in
Mongolia. Nationally human cases are sporadic: 2000 (2), 2001 (4),
2002 (16), 2003 (-), 2004 (22), 2005 (3 & 1 died), 2006 (4), 2007 (7
& 1 died), 2008 (15). Livestock outbreaks are most commonly reported
for cattle with outbreaks in low double digits (19 - 29); other
species affected are horses, sheep & goats, and camels, as in this
outbreak. It was reported in Selenge in 2004 and 2006.

As this winter was extremely rough on the livestock and thousands
died, we can assume that there is extensively rural poverty and thus
more moribund animals will be killed, slaughtered & butchered, with
more human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
