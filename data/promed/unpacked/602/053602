[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of ruminants (_Bos_ and _Bubalus_ genera)
caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ SC (MmmSC; SC, small colony). It is
manifested by anorexia, fever and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnoea, cough and nasal
discharges in bovines. Diagnosis requires the isolation of the aetiological agent. The main problems
for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of subacute or subclinical infections, the
persistence of chronic carriers after the clinical phase and the lack of extensive vaccine coverage.
The said summary and additional information on CBPP, its diagnostic techniques and vaccine requirements is available in OIE's Terrestrial Manual at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.08_CBPP.pdf.

The 2 outbreaks reported in the above (delayed) "immediate notification" are located on Namibia's border with its northern neighbour Angola. CBPP is regarded to be endemic in Angola, as apparent from Angola's annual reports to the OIE. - Mod.AS
