Nearly 70 people have been diagnosed with leptospirosis, a disease
spread through exposure to water contaminated with the urine of animals.

Health workers on Sunday [28 Dec 2008] distributed antibiotics to
contain an outbreak of a waterborne bacterial disease in coastal
Guyana, where December rains have flooded low-lying villages and
cultivated fields. Knee-deep water stands in several villages east of
Guyana's capital after rains started flooding the area 2 weeks ago.

Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy told reporters that officials were
closely monitoring the flood-hit towns and will evacuate anyone
showing symptoms of the infection, which include fever, chills,
vomiting and kidney failure. He urged people with symptoms of the
potentially fatal disease to seek help immediately.

More than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain have fallen in some
parts of the South American country in less than 2 days. The floods
have displaced hundreds of people, many to homes of relatives and friends.

[Leptospirosis is often spread to humans via water contaminated with
urine from infected animals, commonly rodents but also livestock, and
is often facilitated by flooding. The transmission may also be
related to close animal contact rather than via a water reservoir.

Therapy to prevent leptospirosis in the affected areas has been used
in large outbreaks or in highly endemic areas. Doxycycline can be
used; a USA Army study done in soldiers training in Panama found that
200 mg of doxycycline taken once weekly prevented leptospirosis,
symptomatic or subclinical (serological conversion), with an efficacy
of 95 percent (1). However, a more recent report from India (2) found
that that same treatment statistically decreased clinical disease but
did not prevent serologically proven, subclinical infection. The
differences between the studies may well be the degree of risk, with
the later study having a higher risk of exposure.
