Regarding ProMED-mail posting "Bluetongue, ovine - Morocco
(02)20061121.3316":
1. In September 2006, Epizootic hemorrhagic Disease (EHDV) outbreaks in
bovines were reported in Morocco (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_78.HTM>). The virus strains of the
EHDV circulating in Morocco or in Algeria (2006) have not been serotyped
yet. [See comment further. - Mod.AS]
2. In November 2006, BTV outbreaks in sheep were reported in Morocco. The
BTV serotype is BTV-1, the same type circulating in Algeria. The typing was
done by the Community Ref. Lab, at Pirbright, UK. See
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/outbreaks.htm>. [See also
first-hand data in the following paragraph 2 - Mod.AS].

few days together with their sequence data. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue virus was isolated in Morocco from the blood of a sheep showing
clinical signs of BT, using [IV inoculation in] embryonated chicken eggs and
passage in BSR cells. The sheep was from a small village called Guenfouda
near Oujda in the East of Morocco. Samples were also sent to the BTV
Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) at IAH Pirbright, (arriving on 20 Oct
2006) and were assigned reference collection numbers MOR2006/06 and
MOR2006/07 [See
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-1.htm#MOR2006/06#MOR2006/06>].
The original samples were confirmed by the CRL as positive for BTV RNA by
Seg-7 RT-PCR (results obtained within 24 hours). The identification of BTV
was also confirmed by Seg-1 real-time RT-PCR. The same RNA samples were also
assayed by RT-PCR using serotype specific primers (targeting genome segment
2) for the European BTV serotypes (types 1, 2, 4, 9, 8 and 16).
Reactions products of the expected size were obtained with primers for
BTV-type 1. This gave the first indication that the isolates were BTV-1
(results obtained within 24 hours). These results were confirmed by RT-PCR
reactions using serotype-specific primers against all 24 BTV serotypes.
The cDNA products derived from MOR2006/06, using the 3 sets of BTV-1 type
specific primers, were sequenced and compared with other BTV-1 strains. The
data demonstrated a close similarity to other BTV-1 Seg-2 sequences,
confirming the Moroccan isolates as BTV-1 (Maan et al 2006). The sequence
comparison also revealed that the 2006 Moroccan and Algerian strains of
BTV-1 are related and both are from an African lineage. See

[This first-hand authoritative information is very much appreciated.
Morocco is currently one of 3 countries officially known to be affected by
BTV-1. The others are Algeria (since Aug 2006) and Italy (Sardinia),
allegedly affected since late October 2006.
It may be assumed that the Sardinian isolate is of the same west African
lineage as the Maghreb isolates; the Sardinian strain has been isolated and
identified in a different laboratory (the OIE reference laboratory in
Teramo, Italy) and does not seem to have been included in the comparative
genotyping. It seems to affect, clinically, ovines of susceptible breeds.
Two other BTV serotypes are currently circulating in Europe: BTV-4 in
Portugal and BTV-8 in ovines and bovines in Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands, France, and -- as has become apparent today (see a separate
posting) -- also identified in Bulgaria. - Mod.AS]
