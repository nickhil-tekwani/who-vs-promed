[2] Risk assessment
- Fri 28 Sep 2018. More DRC Ebola cases as risk raised to "very high"
[Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy (CIDRAP) News, extracted, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/09/more-drc-ebola-cases-risk-raised-very-high

As new Ebola cases continue in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday [Thu 27 Sep 2018] raised the risk assessment for spread of the disease within the country and regionally from "high" to "very high" while keeping the risk of international transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) low.

"This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan," the WHO said in a statement. "Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries."

Recent violence by armed rebels in Beni, the site of the WHO's response efforts in eastern DRC, has led the agency to call this week a "critical juncture" in the outbreak.

"WHO response activities have been severely limited as Beni and nearby towns mark a period of mourning for those who were killed. Security in Beni and other areas remains challenging," the WHO said. The agency added that rumors and traditional practices have led relatives to care for sick family members at home, which increased the risk for infection.

The past week has also seen Ebola patients move in to "red zones," insecure communities that health workers cannot reach.

Yesterday and today [27-28 Sep 2018] the DRC's health ministry reported 4 more Ebola patients, all in Beni, 2 of whom are known contacts who declined vaccination but voluntarily went to an Ebola treatment center after their symptoms began.

The health ministry today also noted one new death in Beni. There are now a total of 155 cases (124 confirmed, 31 probable), including 102 deaths, in this outbreak. Eleven suspected cases are currently under investigation.

As of 26 Sep 2018, response efforts in Beni resumed after a period of mourning following the 22 Sep 2018 attacks in the city was lifted. DRC officials said there was more enthusiasm and cooperation among community members in the Ndindi district, which has been referred to as Beni's "cradle of resistance." The DRC said residents of Ndindi voluntarily registered to get vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

According to the WHO, of the 149 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex are known, 23%, 20%, and 22% are aged 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 years, respectively; females accounted for 56% cases. A total of 19 healthcare workers, 3 of whom have died, have been infected.

[WHO has appropriately raised the risk level in the DRC to very high. It seems a little surprising, however, that WHO continues to consider international risk low, since at least one neighboring country, Uganda, has ramped up preparedness in parallel with increasing concern that Ebola virus might spill over from the DRC.

[3] Preparedness
- Thu 27 Sep 2018. Uganda steps up Ebola preparedness response in 22 high-risk districts
[AllAfrica, extracted, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201809280145.html

The epicentre of the current outbreak is close to Uganda's border to the west, with a lot of cross-border movements. Natives from both countries cross to engage in business, attend school, and access healthcare and social services.

In that regard, with 22 at-risk districts identified, Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners have implemented Ebola preparedness and readiness activities to prevent the disease from crossing into Uganda and to ensure early detection of the disease should it be imported.

The activities include coordinating the preparedness activities, strengthening surveillance, capacity building in contact tracing, laboratory diagnostics, infection prevention and control, and clinical management of patients, including psycho-social care. Safe and dignified burials, enhanced risk communication and community engagement, and cross-border surveillance are also part of the activities.

Border-entry screening at all major border points in all the very high-risk districts has been implemented. Using volunteers trained by the WHO and Red Cross, and infrared thermometers, everyone crossing into Uganda from DRC is screened for body temperature. The people found with high temperatures are further screened for Ebola-like symptoms.

On average, the busy border-screening points receive 5000 people; however, during market days, the number grows tremendously. For instance, Mpondwe border point registers over 20 000 people during the market days, every Tuesday and Friday. Surveillance and active case search have also been heightened to detect any alert or suspected case.

In preparation for any suspected case, Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) have been set up at Bundibugyo General Hospital, Bwera Hospital in Kasese, and Rwebisengo Health Center in Ntoroko district, and another is under construction at Naguru Friendship Hospital in Kampala.

Risk communication and community engagement are also ongoing. Teams are engaged in door-to-door visits and distribution of Information Education Communication (IEC) material. In addition, messages are also running on TV and radio to reach the wider public within and outside the high-risk districts.

To ensure proper handling of Ebola samples, WHO supported MoH to build the capacity of 40 laboratory technicians in the 5 very high-risk districts in sample collection, packaging, handling, and transportation. Additionally, 19 technicians from the national reference labs were trained in the diagnosis of Ebola virus disease using GeneXpert and Rapid Diagnostic Tests.

[4] Unrest
- Fri 28 Sep 2018. Violence and displacement in Ebola-hit DR Congo threatens humanitarian response.
UN News [extracted, edited]
https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1021322

Speaking in Geneva, Mr. Baloch [UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR spokesperson] explained that there has been a sharp rise in attacks and displacement in recent months in the Beni area of North Kivu province and further north, in Ituri province.

"It is estimated that more than a million people are displaced in North Kivu," he said. "An estimated half a million have been forced from their homes this year alone."

Some 13 000 people fled their homes in August around Beni, the UNHCR spokesperson added, before underlining the significance of the attack on the city, where residents have been effectively under siege for 2 months by armed militia.

"While these groups have previously been active around Beni, it is the 1st time that fighting has reached the city itself," he said. "Security is what they want. And security from all risks as well."

UNICEF, the UN Children's Fund, has more than 50 staff in the Ebola-affected areas including Beni, Mangina, and Butembo. It has deployed specialists in community communications, education, and psycho-social assistance, in addition to water, sanitation, and hygiene experts to help contain the disease and avoid any further spread.
