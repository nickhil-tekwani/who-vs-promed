Arizona state health officials and the beef producer told CNN (Cable News
Network) on Thu 7 Jun 2007 that 13 cases of infection with _E. coli_
[O157:H7] may be linked to a multistate beef recall. No deaths have been
reported in connection with the recall, but 4 people are hospitalized,
according to United Food Group (UFG), which greatly expanded the recall on
Wed 6 Jun 2007.
UFG says illnesses were reported in 5 states: 3 in California, 4 in
Arizona, 2 in Colorado, and one each in Wyoming and Utah. But Michael
Murphy, spokesman for Arizona Department of Health Services, said that
health officials had identified 6 cases in that state and, "in at least 2,
we definitely tied them to eating ground beef," he said.
The beef linked to those 2 cases is a few days outside the recall dates
announced by United Food Group, but test results indicate it was
contaminated with _E. coli_, Murphy said. UFG "may want to consider
expanding the recall dates," he said. Of those infected in Arizona, 2 were
hospitalized but recovered, and an investigation into the other cases
continues, Murphy added.
The company announced on Wed 6 Jun 2007 that it had expanded the recall of
its ground beef products sold in 11 states to nearly 5 times the original
amount. On Sun 3 Jun 2007, the recall covered 75 000 pounds (about 34 020
kg) of beef. The recall was expanded on 6 Jun 2007, to include 445 000
pounds (981 057 kg) of beef suspected of being contaminated.
The tubes of ground beef were distributed to 13 supermarket chains:
Albertson's, Basha's, Grocery Outlet, Fry's, "R" Ranch Markets, Sam's Club,
Save-A-Lot, Save-Mart, Scolari's Wholesale Markets, Smart and Final,
Smith's, Stater Bros, and Superior Warehouse Club supermarkets. The meat
was produced in Vernon, California, on 13 Apr 2007, and sold under the
brand names of Moran's All Natural, Miller Meat Company, Stater Bros,
Inter-American Products Inc, and Basha's, with sell-by dates from 20 Apr to
7 May 2007.
Stores in 11 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New
Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and Montana, sold the product,
according to UFG. Sam's Clubs in California, Arizona, and Nevada were the
only stores belonging to that chain stocked with the recalled product.

substantially from this point. Commonly, ground beef that has already been
sold is difficult to recall. - Mod.LL]
