Britain on Rabies Watch After Infected Bat Found
------------------------------------------------
British agricultural authorities issued a warning to the public on Tuesday
[28 Sep 2004] after a bat that eluded the island nation's strict controls
tested positive for a strain that can infect humans.

Britain's farm ministry said the bat was found by a member of the public in
an alley in Staines in southeast England in August 2004 and has been
undergoing tests ever since.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) called on
the public to be vigilant and seek medical advice if bitten [by a bat].

"The wound should be immediately thoroughly cleaned with soap and water.
Additional cleansing of the wound site with an alcohol-based or other
disinfectant is also recommended and immediate medical advice must be
sought," it said in a statement.

DEFRA said the bat died on 23 Sep 2004 before being sent to Veterinary
Laboratories Agency for closer examination.

"Initial tests carried out...have shown positive results for a strain of
rabies," the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
said in a statement. DEFRA said the animal tested positive for European
Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV), a strain of rabies virus common in bats across
Northern Europe. It added that this type of affliction is closely related
to the classical rabies virus, but that further tests are being carried out
to confirm the disease.

Rabies is a serious infection of the nervous system and is usually
transmitted to humans and animals by a bite from an infected animal. Once
clinical rabies develops, it is almost always fatal.

DEFRA said that 3 individuals who are known to have cared for and handled
the bat took precautions and wore gloves, and are receiving appropriate
medical treatment.

The EBLV strain of rabies has been detected in bats on only 2 occasions in
Britain, in 1996 and 2002. In addition, a person in Scotland, thought to
have been bitten by a bat about 6 months previously, died in November 2002
from the same strain of rabies-like virus. The last person to die from the
disease before that was in 1902.

"Although such human cases are very rare, the risk posed to humans from an
EBLV infected bat still exists," DEFRA said.

In Europe, a total of 630 EBLV cases were confirmed between 1977 and 2000,
mainly in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.

Britain operates a strict quarantine system regarding importation of
animals to prevent the spread of rabies and other diseases.

Rabid bat discovered in UK town
---------------------------------
A bat found in an alley in Surrey has tested positive for a strain of
rabies which can infect animals and people. The animal carried European Bat
Lyssavirus, which is closely linked to the classic rabies virus.

3 people are known to have handled the bat, but all took precautions and
are now receiving medical treatment.

The bat was found by a member of the public in Staines in August 2004 and
tested at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey.

The EBLV virus is common in bats across Northern Europe, but only 2 other
cases had previously been discovered in the UK -- one in 1996 and the most
recent in 2002 when [a man] from Angus, Scotland, died after contracting
rabies from a bat bite.

Initial tests showed that the strain of virus in the new case was closely
linked to the previous examples, according to the Health Protection Agency
and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Confirmatory tests are now to be conducted and the incident is still being
investigated.

In February, scientists found bats posed only a minor threat of passing
rabies on to humans. A study by the Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural
Heritage and Defra found it is rare to contract the killer disease from the
mammals. The report revealed just 2 percent of one species of bat -- the
Daubenton -- could carry the rabies disease after antibodies were found in
its blood.

Deaths from bat rabies are extremely rare, and since 1977 there have been 3
deaths in Europe attributed to EBVL infections, including that of [the
Scottish man mentioned above].

In Europe, between 1977 and 2003, more than 700 confirmed EBVL cases were
found in animals -- mainly in Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, France,
Spain and Germany.

A spokesman for Defra said anyone who found a sick or ailing bat should not
approach or handle the animal but seek advice from the Bat Conservation
Trust. Anyone bitten or scratched by a bat should seek medical attention.

[The Daubenton's bat, _Myotis daubentonii_, is a medium-sized bat (between
4.5 cm and 5.5 cm in length). It rarely lives more than 2 km from water,
usually roosting in trees, old mills, tunnels, and under bridges. - Mod.AS]
