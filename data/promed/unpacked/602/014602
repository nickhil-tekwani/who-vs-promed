If you are getting as tired as I am of seeing all these messages
about pig-killing exercises, ill-defined diagnoses, and unscientific
statements attributed to uninformed politicians, please see my
comments below.
I refer to, for example:

[excerpts]
Preparations are under way for the culling of an estimated
4000 pigs from a farm in Seelong, near Senai, after blood
samples from pigs there tested positive for the Nipah virus...
Dr Chua said "The public at large is not at risk because the
affected farm is deep in an oil palm estate and there are no
human settlements within a five-kilometre radius.  "The other
81 farms in Johor are located in remote areas, at least 15
kilometres from any residential area.So there is no reason
to panic," he stressed.  A 0.5km radius of the farm has been
sealed off and the police will deploy a 24-hour road-block near
the farm...
On blood samples taken from the farmer and seven workers
from the pig farm in Seelong, Dr Chua said the WHO collaborating
centre for air-borne [sic -- should read "arthropod-borne," meaning
carried by mosquitoes, ticks, etc.] viruses in Universiti Malaya had
confirmed them negative for the Nipah virus. Dr Chua added that a
nearby vegetable farm had also been asked to cease operations
immediately.
Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today only 31
suspected JE cases were currently being treated in various
hospitals in the country...
"A total of 258 people who were suspected VE cases were
admitted at the height of the outbreak in March of which 100
died while another 127 had been discharged," he said...
He also reminded residents in VE affected areas in Lukut not
to return to their houses for the moment until the Cabinet Task
Force has made a decision on the matter...
Meanwhile, the JE Humanitarian Fund today received RM30,000 ...
for relief work for 204 families affected by the viral encephalitis
outbreak in Bukit Pelandok.

>From the very outset of this Nipah virus epidemic -- whenever
that was -- we have been bombarded with misinformation and
misstatements.  I have not seen or heard of a shred of evidence
that there has been a single confirmed case of Japanese
encephalitis [in peninsular Malaysia] since very early 1999,
either in humans or in pigs. 
If such data are available, we would welcome them and would
post them immediately on ProMED-mail.
The basic problem remains definitions for "a case" and "an
infection with". Antibody to a virus in a serum sample from an
ill person or pig (or horse or anything else) is confirmatory of
nothing.  Yet the Malaysian authorities are reported to have
publicly pronounced this many cases of JE virus and that many
cases of Nipah virus.  A confirmed "positive", in terms of a human
or a pig, depends upon either virus isolation or a change in
antibody titers between paired acute- and convalescent-phase
serum samples. 
No doubt finding IgM antibody in a single serum sample from a
sick human (or pig) provides excellent presumptive data, but it
does not provide confirmatory evidence of recent infection.
We have heard nothing regarding persistence of Nipah virus in
pigs.  If there is evidence that persistent infections occur, we
would like to know that -- as would everyone else.  If there is no
evidence for such a persistent state, then why are pigs that are
"positive" (assuming this means they have been shown to have
antibody in a single serum sample) being killed?  Seems to me
these immune animals would be the ones to retain.
Until we begin to receive real data, rather than statements from
government spokespeople, ProMED-mail will not post repetitive
and unhelpful reports, but will continue to post messages regarding
areas newly discovered to have infected animals, and other
important data. 
No further mention of Japanese encephalitis will be made here
unless some confirmatory evidence is presented that JE virus is
still circulating or has infected even one human or one pig since,
say, January 1999.
Terms such as "VE", meaning "virus encephalitis", are
obfuscating with regard to whether a human or a pig has
Japanese encephalitis or Nipah virus.
The Malaysian government task force responsible for
investigations of the epizoodemic of Nipah disease is still
called the "State Japanese encephalitis/Nipah Task Force",
which suggests that JE is not only a current problem but
THE principal curent problem. It could as well be called
the State Ebola/Yellow Fever/Nipah Task Force and be just
as accurate. Indeed, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia)
Berhad, Sat 24 Apr 1999) quoted Health Minister Chua as
having said that there were more than 13 000 malaria cases
last year but no yellow fever cases. He could have added no
smallpox either.
Personally, I suspect that the actual situation with regard to
the causes of this epizoodemic, the political reasons and
repercussions deriving therefrom, and the overall logistics
have not begun to be mentioned.  I have received, addressed
to me personally, many messages from people in Malaysia
who have told me of scientific personnel in Malaysia being
threatened with firing, transfers, and funding reductions if they
continue to speak out in conflict with official statements, and of
other even more heinous accusations. 
The free exchange of information can never cause the
expansion of an epidemic, and statements that the public
should not panic cannot begin to assuage public feelings
that the entire story is not being told.
