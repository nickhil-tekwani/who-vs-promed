Once again, the population should be alert about salami, hot dog, mortadella, sausages, and all of the delicious processed meat and pork products commonly used in our cuisine.

After 49 cases of trichinosis being reported in Merlo, Moreno, and Marcos Paz municipalities, all of them belonging to VII Health Region in Buenos Aires province, the local Ministry of Health recommended not to consume home-made raw and partially cooked sausages, as well as similar products without an official stamp from an authorized manufacturer.

Fortunately enough, Ms Zulma Ortiz, Ministry of Health, says that affected persons are recovering after being taken care of in Heroes de Malvinas de Merlo, Posadas de Haedo, Mu√±iz and Alvarez local hospitals. However, the reported cases set on all alarms. Officers from the Ministry of Health have asked affected patients where they purchased the sausage products, in order to inspect such places in order to limit the occurrence of new cases.

What is trichinosis [trichinellosis]?
-------------------------------------
It is a disease caused by a parasitic worm that lives in the muscles of pigs and other wild animals, such as boars and pumas. Humans may acquire the disease by eating undercooked pork or sausage products, particularly those that are home-made. In the case of pigs, these animals acquire the disease by eating food waste in garbage dumps, where there is also a significant rodent population.

[_Trichinella_ spp. are common in pigs in Argentina, and ProMED-mail has reported several outbreaks since 1999. So-called "back-yard" pigs are slaughtered without veterinary control and the home made sausages might be sold on markets and consumed locally. - Mod.EP
