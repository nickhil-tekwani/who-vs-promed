A blight disease in chickpea crops in parts of Gujarat has farmers worried. Chickpea is cultivated in a large area in the state. Due to the disease, the crop starts to dry up at any stage of growth. A black line is seen at the root.

The disease is spread through seed and soil. It is less common when planting certain crop varieties. Fungicides should be applied before planting, or the crop should be sprayed with fungicide. Crop rotation plays an important role, for example with sorghum.

[Several fungal pathogens are known to cause blights of chickpeas, including species of _Alternaria_, _Stemphylium_, and _Phoma_. Ascochyta blight (AB) caused by _Mycosphaerella rabiei_ (previously _Ascochyta rabiei_) is considered the most important disease of chickpeas worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and is specific to chickpeas. The reference above to the importance of crop rotation may point toward this disease.

Atypical AB has been reported, e.g., from Canada (ProMED posts 20200828.7723943, 20190826.6640755), to which additional external factors are suspected to contribute. AB fungal strains with increased virulence that have broken host resistance in currently used cultivars have also emerged, e.g., in Australia (ProMED post 20150925.3669437).

There is also a bacterial blight of the crop (_Xanthomonas_ species), which is considered a minor disease reported mainly from India. Reliable diagnosis is essential to design effective control strategies for any crop disease or disorder.
