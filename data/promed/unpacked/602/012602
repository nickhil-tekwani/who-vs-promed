The Director of Disease Prevention and Control at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Dr. Amara Jambai, has yesterday [19 Jul 2012] disclosed an outbreak of yellow fever in the Pujehun District.

Speaking to journalists at the weekly press briefing at the Ministry of Information and Communications, Dr. Jambai said the outbreak should be a serious concern to the government and people of Sierra Leone.

"Yellow fever is potentially a fatal viral infection that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Our investigation team is trekking to Bevehun in the Pujehun District to look into the outbreak," Dr. Jambai explained.
