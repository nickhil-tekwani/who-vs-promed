The latest from Nigeria is that 3 samples were confirmed positive in the Dakar lab.

I am not sure which samples are positive, but suspect they are from the index case. Surveillance is ongoing, and I am not sure whether all reported cases are actually monkeypox.

Other samples leave Nigeria tonight for CDC Atlanta. We should have more information later when Nigeria wakes up tomorrow.

[It is gratifying to learn that 3 samples have been tested and results have been announced. These 3 samples are positive for monkeypox. Prof. Tomori suspects that these are from the index case. It is good that these samples are being sent to the USA CDC for further confirmation. The question about the laboratory diagnosis of the other 30 cases in 7 states is still open. ProMED-mail is awaiting the results from laboratory tests from samples taken from these cases with considerable interest. If these are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox, this will be an unusual monkeypox outbreak given the wide geographic area in which the cases occurred during the same period. One health authority in Nigeria has indicated that at least some of these cases are varicella (chickenpox) (see Monkeypox - Africa (09): Nigeria, hospital cases NOT, other states' cases susp. 20171014.5380964).
