An Underberg farmer and top canoeist has been declared brain dead after contracting rabies from a stray dog, a family spokesman and doctor said on Thursday [7 Jun 2012] in Durban.

"We discovered through a SPECT scan on Wednesday [6 Jun 2012] that [he] was brain dead. His family will have to turn the machines off in the next few days," Dr Grant Lindsay said. The victim (29) has been in the ICU at a Pietermaritzburg hospital for about 5 weeks. "He contracted rabies from the saliva of a sick dog he had taken in and kept in his shed," Lindsay said.

125 rabies cases have been reported in KwaZulu-Natal since the beginning of the year [2012]. Two people have died as a result of the outbreak in the province.

KwaZulu-Natal agriculture and environmental affairs MEC Meshack Radebe launched the rabies campaign in the Royal Hotel in Durban on Thursday [7 Jun 2012]. The World Health Organization has donated R 16.5 million [about USD 2 million] to help fight rabies in the province. Manager of the Rabies Elimination Project, Kevin le Roux, said the money would contribute to the vaccination of about 600 000 animals a year. The department would roll out a vaccination programme aimed at vaccinating 70 per cent of animals in KwaZulu-Natal per year. Awareness campaigns in the media worth R one million [USD 119 240] would be used to encourage people to vaccinate their animals.

"The department of education has agreed to let children go home and collect pets on vaccination days in their communities. "I've suggested that there should be a way of marking all vaccinated dogs and cats, so if someone decides to play with a pet, they will at least know if it has been vaccinated," Radebe said.

[This report records the final moments of a tragic story. The text of this report now implies, but does not implicitly state, that the victim was infected by contact with a rabid pet dog within KwaZulu-Natal before spending some time in Mozambique. Hopefully, the animal vaccination campaign in KwaZulu-Natal set in train by this unfortunate event will help to prevent a future recurrence. - Mod.CP
