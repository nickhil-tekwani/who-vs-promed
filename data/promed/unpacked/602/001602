There is another reference to oral transmission of West Nile Virus in mice:
Odelola HA, Oduye OO (1977) West Nile virus infection of adult mice by oral
route.
Arch Virol 1977;54(3):251-3
Adult Swiss albino mice were fed orally with suspensions of a strain of
West Nile virus isolated in Nigeria. Most of these mice became sick and
died 7 days post feeding and virus was recovered from organs of such
infected mice. Histological lesions were observed in some tissues and
antibody to the strain of West Nile virus developed in mice that survived
infection.

[Given the previous message from Ernie Gould and other references we have
posted, the possibility is distinct that West Nile virus can infect
vertebrates to which virus is introduced by the oral route. I smell a
grant proposal. - Mod.CHC
