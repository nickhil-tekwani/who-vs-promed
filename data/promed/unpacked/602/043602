Cambodia's Ministry of Health reported on Tuesday [3 Jan 2012] that at least 72 Cambodian children had been killed by dengue fever in 2011, an increase of 89 percent, compared with the 2010's deaths of 38 children. It said that there were 15 805 dengue fever cases reported in 2011, up 26 percent from 12 500 cases in a year earlier [2010].

"The disease broke out in a large scale every 3 to 5 years and the year 2011 was the large scale breakout, that's why the cases were on the rise and the deaths were almost double," Ngan Chantha, director of dengue control at the Ministry of Health, told Xinhua over telephone on Tuesday [3 Jan 2012].

He said the long-stayed floods that had submerged most provinces between August [2011] and October [2011] were also the main cause of the disease increase.

Ngan Chantha estimated that the country spent an average USD 7 million a year for campaigns to prevent the disease and for medical attention.

Dengue [virus] is [transmitted] by mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, and rash.

In Cambodia, outbreaks of dengue fever usually begin at the onset of the rainy season, from May to October.

Pacific
---
- Marshall and Yap Islands. Medical authorities say a dengue fever outbreak that has claimed at least 2 lives in the northern Pacific has peaked. In the state of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, more than 900 people remain infected, while in Marshall Islands where 1400 people were infected, just a few new cases are being reported each day. A World Health Organisation medical epidemiologist based in Suva, Dr Eric Nilles says there's no connection between the outbreaks as they are [caused by] different strains of the fever [dengue virus].
