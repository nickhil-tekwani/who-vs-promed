Arizona: 1st Locally Acquired Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------
State and local health officials today reported the 1st probable case
of locally acquired West Nile virus infection. The patient, an adult
female, contracted the illness in Pima County. She is recovering and
is not hospitalized. She does not pose a health threat to other
residents. West Nile virus is not spread from one person to another.
"While this is the first human case reported who contracted the
disease in the state, our surveillance data has indicated the
presence of the West Nile virus in 12 of the 15 counties in Arizona.
We knew it was just a matter of time before someone acquired the
disease in the state. The good news is this person is recovering,"
said Craig Levy, manager of the Vector-Borne Diseases Program.
Testing done at the State Health Laboratory identified this patient
as a probable case, with official confirmation pending from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To date, the State Lab
and the University of Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Lab have
collectively confirmed West Nile virus infection in 88 horses, 69
mosquito pools, 38 dead birds, and 14 sentinel chickens statewide.
Dr. Karen Lewis, an infectious disease specialist with the
Department, said that the state's 1st locally acquired human case of
West Nile should cause residents to take precautions, but not to
overreact. "The chance that any one person is going to become ill
from a mosquito bite is low," she said. "Most people do not become
ill, and for those who do, most suffer only a mild flu-like illness
for a few days before they recover. The people who do become more
seriously ill with encephalitis tend to be those 50 years of age and
older."
Local health departments are accepting dead birds for testing of West
Nile virus if they meet certain conditions. Not all dead birds are
eligible or will be accepted for testing. For more information please
visit the Arizona Department of Health Services' web-site at
<http://www.hs.state.az.us>, or call the State Public Health Hotline
at (800) 314-9243.
