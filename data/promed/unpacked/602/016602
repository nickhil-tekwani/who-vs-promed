[The location in Thrace, west of the Dardanelles and nearing the
Bulgarian border can be seen on the map included, as always, in the OIE link.
This particular type O differs from the FMD type A found relatively
near the current outbreak in 2006 but is similar to the one found in
the general vicinity earlier this year (2007). This area allows
vaccination and is a buffer between the FMD endemic situation in
Anatolian Turkey and the rest of Europe. For an excellent summary of
FMD in the European part of Turkey see Mod.AS's comments in
ProMED-mail posting 20070406.1159. - Mod.PC]
