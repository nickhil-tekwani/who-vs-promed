[1] Cholera - Cameroon (Far North Province)

A cholera outbreak has killed at least 28 people in Cameroon's Far
North province neighboring Lake Chad, state radio reported on Thu, 2
Nov 2006. Health authorities blame the outbreak on living conditions
and lack of clean drinking water which forced people to fetch water
from polluted sources, the radio said.
Cholera, caused by water-borne bacterium, is a seasonal problem in
many African nations. An outbreak in 2005 killed more than 800 people
across several countries in the West African region. The bacterium
spreads through contact with feces and is associated with heavy rains
that flood latrines and contaminate drinking water.
In Cameroon, "the hardest hit is the Logone and Chari division where
28 people have died out of 541 cases registered so far," Cameroon
Radio Television (CRTV) reported. The provincial delegate for Public
Health provided the figures during an emergency meeting in Kousseri,
capital of the Far North province, to seek a solution to the crisis.

Cholera has spread in Rakai district with 6 deaths and 20 people
admitted in hospital. District director of health services Dr.
Robert Mayanja said tests by the Central Laboratory in Kampala
confirmed it was cholera.
Opening a health workshop at Rakai district headquarters on Mon, 30
Oct 2006, Mayanja said cholera is caused by eating food contaminated
with human waste.
Mayanja said the epidemic had spread from Rakai town council and
Byakabanda sub-county to the neighboring sub-county of Kifamba.

A cholera outbreak has killed 4 children in northern Nigeria's Kaduna
State, and 25 other people have been hospitalized in the past 3 days,
a senior health official said.
Aminu Sabo, the health director in the Chikun region of the state,
told Radio Nigeria on Sat, 28 Oct 2006, that the disease was caused
by drinking contaminated and untreated water. He said residents of
the affected area had resorted to the open wells as a source of
drinking water after their taps went dry for weeks.
He also said the government had sent medical personnel and drugs to
the affected area while the open wells were being treated.
