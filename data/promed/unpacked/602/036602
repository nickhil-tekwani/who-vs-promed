Malaria kills 87 in Nueva Vizcaya, Igugao province, Philippines
------------------------------
Malaria claimed the lives of at least 87 people and infected 279 others in
13 barangays of the province, according to initial data from the
semi-annual report of the malaria-control program of the Nueva Vizcaya
health office.
Based on the report, which covered a 6-month report from January to June
2003, the 87 deaths recorded were broken down into 40 males and 27 females.
Topping the list of most affected barangays were Alfonso Castaneda with 132
cases; Diadi, 41; Quezon, 23; Bambang, 19; Bagabag, 17; Sta. Fe and
Villaverde, 10 each; Aritao, 9; Dupax del Norte, 7; Solano, 5; Bayombong,
4; and Kayapa and Kasibu, one each. In Alfonso Castaneda, the lingering
malaria outbreak has been blamed on the drying up of the Casecnan River
owing to rampant illegal logging.
Casecnan is also the site of the multibillion-peso Casecnan Dam, which
irrigates thousands of hectares of farmland downstream in Nueva Ecija and
neighboring provinces in Central Luzon.
The affected barangays in the town were Pelaway, Lipuga, and Cuayan, where
15 malaria-related deaths were reported. Also seriously affected, the
report said, are Barangays Talbec and Abaca in Dupax del Sur. The report, a
copy of which has been obtained by The Times, said the provincial health
team registered a total of 33 523 consultations from ages one to 65. Of the
total, 11 737 were clinically diagnosed, while 21 845 were in the
outpatient category. Patients who tested positive for malaria consisted of
152 males and 127 females. The patients either contracted malaria-related
diseases like [infections by] _P. falciparum_ (235), _P. vivax_ (40) and
mixed infection (4).
In the monitoring survey by the health team from 13 barangays, 3789
underwent the smear test, 252 cases were indigenous (or malaria infection
originated from the place), and 27 cases were considered "imported,"
meaning these originated from other places. Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports
reaching Bayombong also said that the malaria outbreak that hit some
barangays in the town of Nagtipunan in neighboring Quirino province has
been raised to a higher level of alarm status, with the death of 2 more
people. As reported earlier in The Times, at least 15 people died of
malaria in Barangay Mammad, Nagtipunan.

[Malaria mortality has decreased from 3 per 100 000 in the 1970's to 0.9
per 100 000 in 1995 (Roll Back Malaria). A WHO assessment of the Philippine
Malaria Control Program in 1997 includes Ifugao as one of the remaining
provinces with substantial malaria transmission (305 cases registered in
1996). The number of microscopy-confirmed cases reported is 279, which
still suggests a doubling from the 1996 data. Ifugao province had a
population of 161 623 in 2000, and if all 87 deaths from January to June
were due to malaria, the annual mortality rate would be over 100 per 100
000 population. Further information on the extent of the outbreak is
clearly needed . - Mod.EP]
