[I know that I cut the thread and that the following is peripheral but it
is too good a story to not share, and learn from. As Ken Newell taught us,
before starting an investigation, first confirm your diagnosis. MHJ
While you have indicated that the pachydermal anthrax thread has been cut,
perhaps you might allow a bit of unrecorded history to be presented.
In 1966 (or 1967) CDC received a cable from the US Embassy in Katmandu
stating that a village health worker had reported an outbreak of plague in
Western Nepal, and the Ministry of Health had requested CDC assistance and
the WHO Country Representative was in agreement with the request. As CDC
assembled a team to provide assistance a second cable came in informing CDC
that a senior physician consultant to USAID (a former city health officer
in the USA) had been flown to the village by helicopter and had corrected
the diagnosis to anthrax. Further, there was a "massive" dieoff of cattle.
This envisioned anthrax spores spreading through the Tarai. [The lowland
plains of Nepal bordering northern India. CDC switched gears, mobilized a
team headed by Dr. Philip Brachman, the Center's expert on anthrax, with
support from a veterinarian and a sanitarian to help with the disposal of
carcasses. As their plane landed in Delhi, a third cable came in stating
that _P. pestis_ [now _Y. pestis_ had been identified in the National
Laboratory and the cattle were dieing from rinderpest.
And, as usual, the outbreak was over before the epidemiologists arrived.

[Thanks David. And hands up all those epidemiologists who have never gone
into the field without first having a confirmed diagnosis! As I thought,
not many hands. We've all done it, and some more than once. -Mod MHJ
