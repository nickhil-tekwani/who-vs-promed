Since the beginning of the year [2017], Switzerland has recorded 257 cases of meningitis due to tick bites [tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus], according to figures from l'office fédéral de la santé publique [federal office of public health; FOPH]; a record.

Ticks are particularly active during the period from March to November. This year [2017] in Switzerland, the authorities estimate that there have been 23 000 consultations for tick bites, an average value (29 000 in 2016).

On the other hand, the number of annual cases of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) transmitted by ticks has ranged between 52 in 2002 and 257 in 2017, with a record of 36 cases in the month of October [2017] alone the FOPH said [Mon 13 Nov 2017].

"The only effective preventive measure is the vaccine, recommended for at-risk groups," says the Swiss agency. Those at risk are people who often go to the forest and reside or stay in areas known to harbor ticks infected with the TBE virus.

[As noted in the previous post, perhaps a proactive vaccination campaign against TBE as has been implemented in Austria could reverse the increasing trend in case numbers. Health officials in Switzerland urge individuals to get vaccinated. WHO states, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tickborne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
