MAFIKENG, NWEST (November 12, 2002): A University of North West veterinary
student was in a stable condition at the Mafikeng Provincial Hospital after
being exposed to anthrax from dead cows last weekend, the North West
Province's Health Department reported on Tuesday. The student was exposed
to the disease in Miga, near Ramatlabama in Mafikeng.
In a statement, department spokeswoman Tidimalo Manyaapelo said 11 other
people from the same village consulted at the local clinic for mild
diarrhea after eating meat from dead cows. "Health MEC Dr Molefi Sefularo
has urged all communities of the province to refrain from eating meat of
dead animals as it poses danger to their lives. Members of the community
are also urged to visit local clinics in their areas if they suffer from
any symptoms of anthrax so they can be treated," Manyaapelo said.

[This illustrates the frequency of mild symptoms in relation to
gastroenteric exposure to this pathogen. This is not to make light of this
lethal risk but to remind us that for every severe case there will be a
number of very lucky folk. If there are any ProMED-mail readers in NW
Province who can provide background information on this outbreak, it would
be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
