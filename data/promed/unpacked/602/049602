New York: multidrug-resistant HIV and rapid progression of disease reported
---------------------------------------------------
A single case of infection with a highly drug-resistant strain of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that progressed rapidly has been diagnosed in
a New York City resident who had not previously undergone antiviral drug
treatment (1). The individual was infected within the previous 20 months,
suggesting that the resistant virus had been transmitted relatively
recently. The virus strain has reduced susceptibility to drugs in 3 of the
4 available classes currently available. In addition, there appears to have
been a very short time interval between HIV infection and the onset of
AIDS. No other cases of this particular strain of transmitted virus have
been documented in New York. There is, however, very limited surveillance
of this type currently undertaken in New York City.
This case is noteworthy for 2 reasons (2). Firstly, transmission of HIV-1
resistant to drugs within 3 of the 4 available classes of anti-retroviral
drugs occurred recently, and secondly, disease progression was rapid.
Although each of these occurrences is rare, they are both previously
documented in the literature, and may be independent of each other.
The prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in the United Kingdom
(UK) and the rest of Europe is assessed by surveillance of resistance in
drug-naive individuals, and also in those individuals with recent
infection, which is more comparable to the case described above. The UK HIV
Resistance Database recorded a prevalence of any form of transmitted
resistance of 18 per cent within 2410 drug-naive individuals studied
between 1996 and 2003, with 3 per cent infected with 3-class resistant
virus in 2002 (3). A similar data set from the Europe-wide CATCH study
reported 10 per cent (of a population of 1633) with any form of resistance
between 1998 and 2002 (4).
The largest data set from individuals with recent infection (thus allowing
more accurate estimation of time trends for transmitted resistance) comes
from the Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe
(CASCADE), a large collaboration of seroconverter cohort data. Of 453 such
individuals known to have been infected from 1987 to 2003, 12 per cent had
any form of resistance at diagnosis, with a peak of 19 per cent in 1999.
Only 0.5 per cent were infected with 3-class resistant HIV (5). Since such
cohorts allow follow-up of recruited individuals with a known time of
infection, it is possible to explore the impact of transmitted resistance
in the absence of therapy on CD4 decline, as a surrogate for disease
progression. Such analysis of the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters over a
5 year follow-up period showed no difference in disease progression between
those infected with resistant virus and those without (6). This suggests
that the rapid progression in the recent New York case was not necessarily
due to the resistance pattern of the infecting virus strain.
Taken together, these data sets show that transmission of drug resistance
is evident in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe as a whole. Although
infection with such strains will compromise response to first line
anti-retroviral therapy, there is little evidence to date, that such
transmission is itself associated with increased pathogenicity or faster
disease progression. Nevertheless, there exists a myriad of forms of HIV
resistance. The possibility that particular resistant variants, currently
at low frequency in the population, are more transmissible than others, or
are more damaging cannot be excluded. In view of the ongoing transmission
of HIV within Europe, such a possibility must be considered (7).
It is important to maintain large-scale population-based surveillance of
transmitted resistant viruses. In particular, linking such data to clinical
cohort follow-up will be essential for the early detection of viruses that
respond poorly to anti-retroviral therapy and/or cause rapid disease
progression.
