4 people died during the last 2 weeks of February 2006 as a result of
an anthrax outbreak in the Garu Tempane District of the Upper East
region.
The district assembly has therefore provided 5700 doses of anthrax
vaccines free of charge to help remedy the situation. So far, only
2270 animals have been vaccinated due to the refusal of most farmers.
Mr. Emmanuel Sin-Nyet Asigri, the Garu-Tempane District Chief
Executive, (DCE), announced these at a durbar of chief opinion and
religious leaders at Garu on Thursday. The aim of the durbar was to
explain government policies to them and to solicit their views on how
best to move the district forward as a united team. [the term durbar
is derived from a Hindi word for a formal reception and audience held
by a ruler. - CopyEd.PG]
Mr. Asigri expressed displeasure about the farmers' refusal to
vaccinate their animals adding, " you are not endangering your lives
only, but the whole of the district ". He appealed to them to
reconsider their stance since there were no ill motive against them
as been rumoured. He also appealed to the people to desist from
feeding on dead or sick animals, which might be infected with the
disease.

[Ghana is severely afflicted with anthrax in all livestock species,
especially in the Northern Region, but also Upper East, Eastern, and
parts of Volta and Central Regions. The number of humans affected is
always a worry, though the numbers have declined over the past 6
years. Why the farmers in Garu Tempane are reluctant to vaccinate is
unclear, but it might parallel the similar problems over human
vaccination in Nigeria. The Ghanian veterinary service is one of the
best in West Africa. Garu is in the northeast corner of Ghana. -
