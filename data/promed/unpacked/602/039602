Headlines
- The GPEI is deeply saddened by the reports of attacks on health workers in Afghanistan [see section [2] below]. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to the families, relatives, and colleagues of the victims. These incidents are a somber reminder of the difficult and often dangerous environments health workers operate in. Health workers must never be a target, and any attack on health-care providers remains completely unacceptable. All parties must respect and uphold the neutrality of health interventions and ensure the safety of all health workers, who are working across the country to prevent disease and improve the health of communities.

- Delivering on the Promise of a Polio-free World, the new Polio Eradication Strategic Plan 2022-2026 was launched at a virtual event on 10 Jun [2021]. The Strategic Plan has been developed in close consultation across the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) stakeholdership and lays out the roadmap to securing a lasting polio-free world. Key to success will be the ongoing commitment of all partners around the world, to ensure the plan can be fully implemented. The launch event brought together senior leadership of the governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the core partners of the GPEI.

- The heads of state of the G7 countries, at the annual meeting held in the UK on 11-13 Jun 2021, in their official communique highlighted the need for increased global efforts to detect global public health threats by building international surveillance on existing networks such as polio surveillance.

- Philippines outbreak officially closed: With no new virus detected in the Philippines in more than 16 months as a result of comprehensive outbreak response, the outbreak has officially been closed. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative commend the Department of Health, government agencies, partners, and civil society efforts that ended the polio outbreak in the country.

[This report has good news and not-so-good news. The good news is that once again there were no AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases associated with WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) infection, nor were there any environmental samples positive for WPV1.

The not-so-good news is the continued outbreaks associated with cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses), at present exclusively cVDPV2 (type 2 cVDPV: 7 countries have identified new AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 infections, and an additional 2 countries identified cVDPV2 in environmental samples. (Note that Burkina Faso reported 2 cases with date of onset in 2020 and Niger reported 1 case with date of onset in 2020.) Hence, at least 7 countries are represented with active transmission/circulation of cVDPV2. Other not-so-good news is the recurrence of violence against polio vaccinators and their protectors (see sections [2] and [3] below), leading to cessation of vaccination activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan where the WPV1 is under cover but present, as evidenced by a positive environmental sample for WPV1 reported in last week's update (Poliomyelitis update (10): Senegal, cVDPV2 20210614.8447598). - Mod.MPP]

Statement on attacks on polio workers - Dr. Ramiz Alakbarov, United Nations DSRSG, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator
--------------------
Health workers in 5 locations in Nangarhar province were attacked today [Tue 15 Jun 2021] during the course of their life-saving work; 5 were killed, and 4 were injured in 5 separate incidents.

I extend my deepest condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of those who lost their lives and wish those who are injured a full and swift recovery.

I am appalled by the brutality of these killings. This is not the 1st time health workers have come under attack. We witnessed the killings of 3 innocent polio workers during the national polio vaccination campaign in March this year [2021] as well. Such senseless violence must stop immediately, and those responsible must be investigated and brought to justice.

The national polio vaccination campaign, which began yesterday [14 Jun 2021], has been suspended in the East region. Polio immunization campaigns are a vital and effective way to reach millions of children to protect them against polio. Depriving children from an assurance of a healthy life is inhumane.

The United Nations strongly condemns all attacks on health workers anywhere. The delivery of health care is impartial and any attack against health workers and those who work to defend them is an attack on the children, whose very lives they are trying to protect.

Peace and Security
Five health workers carrying out a polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province were killed on Tuesday [15 Jun 2021], and 4 others injured, during a series of attacks condemned by a senior UN official on the ground as brutal and "senseless."

The UN humanitarian coordination office OCHA, said the deaths and injuries occurred during 5 separate attacks on health workers, the latest in a recent spate that saw 3 health workers killed in March [2021] during the national polio vaccination effort in Nangahar.

Earlier this month [June 2021], humanitarian workers with the Halo Trust demining group came under attack in northern Afghanistan, where extremists from an ISIL affiliate killed 10 and wounded more than a dozen [12], in what the UN Security Council described as an "atrocious and cowardly targeted attack."

The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the country, Dr. Ramiz Alakbarov, said that he was "appalled by the brutality of these killings" on Tuesday [15 Jun 2021], adding that "the senseless violence must stop," urging Afghan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.

He said the national campaign, which only began on Monday [14 Jun 2021], aimed at reaching nearly 10 million under-5s, had been suspended in the eastern region. "Polio immunization campaigns are a vital and effective way to reach millions of children...Depriving children from an assurance of a healthy life is inhumane."

An attack on children
"The UN strongly condemns all attacks on health workers anywhere. The delivery of healthcare is impartial, and any attack against health workers and those who work to defend them is an attack on the children, whose very lives they are trying to protect," he added.

The UN extended deepest condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of those who lost their lives, wishing the injured a full recovery.

Tedros "deeply saddened"
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, tweeted that he was "deeply saddened" by the attacks, adding that "access to essential health service and immunization campaigns should be unimpeded so that communities can be protected."

According to news reports, Afghanistan reported 56 new cases of polio last year [2020]. But officials have reported that only 1 wild poliovirus case has been detected in the country since October last year [2020].

[3] Pakistan suspends campaign due to violence
Date: Thu 17 Jun 2021 08:21 p.m. IST

https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indefinitely-suspends-polio-vaccine-drive-after-attacks-on-health-workers-101623941178150.html


Pakistan has "indefinitely" suspended its nationwide anti-polio campaign to protect some 270 000 polio field staff from growing attacks.

The anti-polio drive, which was launched in April [2021], was suspended last week [week of 7 Jun 2021] after the country's National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio directed all provinces to halt the drive, Deutsche Welle reported, citing local media.

Last week, 2 police personnel guarding a team of polio vaccine workers were shot dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mardan district. Before that, 2 polio workers were gunned down in the line of duty in Swabi city.

"After the Peshawar incident, the uncertain and threatening situation for the frontline polio workers has emerged, and we need to save the program from a further major damage," Dawn quoted the EOC as saying in a statement.

It further said that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ([G]PEI) partners had backed the move. "Hence, no further vaccination or catch-up activity will be conducted in any area for this campaign," said the EOC.

[At a loss for what to say here. One thought was wondering how these people sleep at night knowing they are harming innocent children, but knowing they obviously don't care and probably sleep well. Another thought was wondering if the international court in The Hague could find these groups guilty of crimes against humanity. It's beyond my comprehension. - Mod.MPP]
