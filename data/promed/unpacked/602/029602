Burundi: A new disease is decimating the goats in the north
-----------------------------------------------------------
A new disease of goats has already killed 140 animals in the northern
town Bwambarangwe, Kirundo [map at http://healthmap.org/r/1fnn]
within the last 2 weeks, as reported by Xinhua on Friday [16 Sept
2011] following a phone contact with Dr Juvenal Karaga, veterinarian
at the Provincial Agriculture and Livestock Department, Kirundo.

Dr. Juvenal Karaga indicates that the hair of affected goats is
gradually lost with sores everywhere including at the muzzle, to the
point that the goat cannot graze and eventually dies because of
hunger. He added that the goats attacked by the disease, caused by a
yet unidentified virus, have bad odor with stink.

He says that all the goats that were distributed by the Ministry of
National Solidarity, Human Rights within the rehabilitation of
displaced persons and refugees, have been decimated. "In total, 140
goats were distributed to 70 families with 2 goats per family."

According to Dr. Juvenal Karaga, in addition to the goats distributed
by the said Ministry, other goats, granted by the NGO[non-governmental
agency] Prodema (Project Development and Productivity of Agro-pastoral
Markets) [2nd phase of LVEMPII], the Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project Phase 2) were also affected by this disease.
Consequently, he asked the providing NGOs to temporarily stop the
activity until further research on the disease is applied. He also
asked the authorities to caution the population against consuming the
dead goats. All goats that died were burned to prevent such
consumption.

Giteranyi: goat population threatened by an epidemic
----------------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease threatens the goats in the community of Giteranyi
[map at http://healthmap.org/r/1fno]. At least 248 goats have caught
the disease and 75 of them have already died.

Measures have been adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock to prevent the spread.

This disease is characterized by nodules on the body of the goat,
sores in the mouth that prevent the animal from grazing and
hyperthermia. The areas most affected by this contagious disease are
Giteranyi and Mugano.

On Thu 18 Aug 2011, a delegation from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry visited Mugano to collect more information on this
disease that has no cure to date. The delegation left after Muyinga
recommended to limit the movement of livestock from nearby hills,
systematically destroy all the goats with the disease as soon as
possible, disinfect the premises, and delay reintroduction of new
goats for a period of 3 months.

Infected goats were burnt and buried on Mon 22 Aug 2011. According to
the veterinary service in Muyinga, a comprehensive study on the causes
and treatment of this disease is most urgent.

[The described pestilence seems to have started at least a month ago.
Item number [2] above, published on 31 Aug 2011, includes a picture of
an affected goat, demonstrating nodules covering its entire body. This
animal seems to show typical signs of goat pox, an OIE-listed disease.
The written description of the disease in the 2 media items is also in
accordance with such a suggested diagnosis. Laboratory confirmation
could be helpful, though clinically-based diagnosis is not
exceptional. Goat pox is not zoonotic.

Burundi's last available annual report to the OIE dates back to 2009.
At that year, sheep pox and goat pox were reported to be absent; their
last occurrence was, reportedly, "unknown." For OIE's distribution map
of sheep pox and goat pox, go to
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease_status_map, select
"sheep pox and goat pox," year 2010 and period Jan-Jun.

Probably, introduced susceptible animals have served as sentinels for
a circulating pathogen in Burundi.

Imported goats should be vaccinated against goat pox and PPR (peste
des petits ruminants) prior to their introduction into endemic
territories, such as Burundi. Before re-introducing susceptible goats
to the affected premises -- even 3 months after disinfection -- new
stock should be vaccinated. An efficacious, live-attenuated vaccine
against goat pox is long and widely used in African countries with
good results. - Mod.AS]
