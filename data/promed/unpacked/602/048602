Molecular studies have confirmed the presence of GPGV [_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_] in grapevine samples collected from the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. As a result, sequences of 13 isolates of GPGV could be obtained and characterized. Among these isolates, 12 were collected from various cultivars (including cvs. 'Alibernet', 'Andre', 'Dornfelder', 'Muller Thurgau', 'Veltliner', 'Welschriesling') at different locations in the Slovak Republic, and 1 GPGV isolate was collected on cv. 'Laurot' in South Moravia region in the Czech Republic.

These studies showed that GPGV could be frequently detected in a relatively limited number of samples, which may suggest that this virus is common in grapevine and more widely distributed than originally thought. In addition, it was not only detected in 'Pinot gris' or 'Traminer', but in other white and red-berry cultivars. It is also pointed out that in this current work, no typical symptoms could be associated with GPGV, and all GPGV-infected Slovak and Czech grapevines were simultaneously infected by other viruses. Therefore, it is underlined that further studies are needed to understand the prevalence, geographical distribution and pathogenicity of GPGV.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine, which was identified in Italy on grapevine cv. Pinot Gris with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms. Previously, GPGV has also been reported from the Republic of Korea and Slovenia [see ProMED-mail post 20140226.2300860].

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology and impact of GPGV.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.
