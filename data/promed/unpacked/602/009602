Nearly 900 people have excessive amounts of lead in their blood
thanks to a nearby factory; 4 will suffer long-term brain
damage. Some 250 children sickened by emissions from a lead smelter
in western China remain in hospital weeks after the mass poisoning
case was uncovered, and at least 4 are likely to suffer permanent
brain damage, state media said yesterday [15 Sep 2006].
Of the children from Hui county in Gansu Province, 4 are reported to
have more than 450mg of lead per liter of blood -- a level which
constitutes severe poisoning and that usually results in brain
damage, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
At least 877 people from Hui county's villages of Xinsi and Moba,
including 334 children have tested positive for excessive amounts of
lead in their blood since last year [2005]. Xinhua said the 250
hospitalized children, all of whom are under 14 years of age, are
being treated with vitamin supplements and most are in stable
condition. [But see comment below].
The pollution has been traced to the Hui County Non-Ferrous Metal
Smelting Plant, a 10-year-old factory that was allegedly warned
several times by environmental officials to stop discharging
pollutants but continued to do so. The plant has since been demolished.
In 2003, the plant released 182 tonnes of lead into the atmosphere,
800 times acceptable levels, Pan Yue, the deputy director of
the State Environmental Protection Administration, was quoted as
saying by the China Daily newspaper.
There have been no reported arrests or punishments meted out to the
Hui county plant or to county officials. The smelter has allegedly
agreed to compensate affected villagers but details of the
compensation have not been released.

[Vitamins do nothing to cure lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead
levels are treated with chelation therapy. The medications are called
chelating agents, which decrease blood lead levels by binding to the
lead, so that it can be excreted in the urine. Medications include
DMSA (also called Chemet, Succimer or Dimercaptosuccinic acid), an
oral drug that binds to lead and mercury and is given every eight
hours for 5 days and then every 12 hours for 2 more weeks. It is
usually used for blood lead levels between 45 and 69. The lead level
should be rechecked 7 - 21 days after treatment is begun to determine
if treatment has been adequate. Other chelating agents that are used
for treatment of symptomatic lead poisoning and for blood lead levels
of more than 69 is EDTA (Calcium Disodium EDTA) which is given as a
continuous infusion or as intramuscular injections for 3-5 days, and
BAL (British anti-lewisite or dimercaprol) which is given as an injection.
