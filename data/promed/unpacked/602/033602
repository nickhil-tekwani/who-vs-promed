Over 15 cases of malaria and 25 of fever were reported today [28 Sep 2003] at
the Civil Hospital, Manimajra [Chinargarh]. The malaria cases came from
village Burj Kotia in Pinjore. Some other malaria cases also landed at
General Hospital, Sector 6, Panchkula. Of the 15 malaria patients at
Manimajra, 5 are suffering from malaria [resulting from _Plasmodium
falciparum_], a parasite rarely found in any part of the country. The rest
were victims of the [_Plasmodium vivax_] parasite, another [cause] of malaria.
Cases of fever were meanwhile reported from various parts of the city and
parts of Panchkula, such as Indira Colony, Manimajra township, and Rajiv
Colony. Until late evening, health officials could not clarify the nature
of the fever the patients were suffering from.
In 2002, around the same time of year, about 100 cases of dengue were
reported from various parts of the city, mainly Manimajra, Indira Colony,
and Rajiv Colony.

[Haryana State is bordering Punjab and Himachal Pradesh states, and the
climate only allows transmission of _P. falciparum_ from May to the end of
September. Incidence of malaria in the area was less than one diagnosed
case per 1000 population in the years 1986 to 1997, and the area generally
is regarded as being at low risk for malaria. The transmission season in
the area is therefore coming to its end, but the infection may reappear
next year. - Mod.EP]
