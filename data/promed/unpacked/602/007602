Czech Republic: Rising Incidence of Tick-borne Encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------------------
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is endemic in virtually all countries in
central and eastern Europe. It is caused by several closely related but
distinct flaviviruses. 3 subtypes are recognised at present: a Far-Eastern
subtype, a Siberian subtype and a European subtype. The Siberian subtype is
associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted
predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_, whereas the European
subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by _Ixodes
ricinus_.
The clinical spectrum of acute TBE ranges from symptoms of mild meningitis
to severe meningoencephalitis with or without myelitis (1). The incubation
period of central European TBE is 7-14 days (2). Onset is generally
biphasic. The 1st phase involves a non-specific influenza-like illness with
fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, lasting about a week. After a period
of remission lasting a few days, the fever returns with aseptic meningitis
or encephalomyelitis. The case fatality rate is 1-5 percent and about 20
percent of survivors have neurological sequelae. Residual motor defects are
rare. Russian spring-summer encephalitis is more serious, with a more acute
illness and a case fatality rate of about 20 percent. Up to 60 percent of
survivors are left with neurological sequelae, including flaccid paralysis.
Vaccination using licensed vaccines is the only real way to prevent TBE. 2
commercially available vaccines are used in Europe: new versions of Encepur
produced by Chiron Behring, Germany and FSME-IMMUN by Baxter, Austria. The
conventional vaccination schedule consists of 3 doses at day 0, 1-3 months
and 9-12 months after the 2nd dose. After 30 years of development, both
vaccines are now available in adult and paediatric formulations that cause
few adverse side effects. Encepur is licensed for rapid immunisation at
days 0, 7 and 21, and this provides protection 2 weeks after the 2nd dose
of vaccine. The FSME-IMMUN rapid schedule involves 2 vaccine doses given 2
or 3 weeks apart. This 2-dose rapid schedule is only recommended for
immunisation protection over the summer months because, unlike the Encepur
schedule, its protection is only optimal for 6 months.
The population of the Czech Republic is near 10 million. In 2003, the
approximate incidence of TBE was 5.9 per 100 000 population. Incidence is
higher in regions south of Prague near the city of Ceske Budejovice. There
has been constantly high incidence near the town of Pilsen in the western
part of the Czech Republic. Recently, foci of TB have been identified in
the northern part of the province of Bohemia. In the east of the country
there has been a high incidence near Olomouc. Clinical cases of TBE are
notified from April through November every year.
Since 1970, the incidence of TBE has changed twice: during the 1980s,
incidence fell by about 30 percent compared to previous levels, but in 1993
incidence doubled to its present level, about 50 percent above its pre-1980
level (3). No single factor can adequately explain the rising incidence of
the disease in the Czech Republic. The changing weather pattern in the past
few years is a possible factor. The average annual temperature in the Czech
Republic increased very slightly from 1970, but then much more markedly
from 1989 (4), and rainfall patterns have also changed, possibly affecting
tick survival and development rates. Changes in the geographical
distribution of _Ixodes ricinus_ have been observed, with ticks appearing
at higher altitudes in mountains than in earlier years [Dr. Daniel,
National Institute of Public Health, Prague, personal communication, (5)].
There is no direct support from state institutions to target residents in
areas of high endemicity for vaccination. There is partial financial
support for vaccination of children and adolescents under the age of 18
across the whole country (with reimbursement of a single dose of vaccine),
but childhood cases tend to recover spontaneously. Private companies
immunise employees who work in forests.
The risk of acquiring TBE has been evaluated in 2 published studies from
the United States (US) (6) and Austria (7). In Kosovo, the risk for members
of a US military unit that trained in a highly endemic area was evaluated.
The TBE virus infection rate was 0.9/1000 man-months of exposure. For an
unvaccinated tourist staying for 4 weeks in a highly endemic province of
southern Austria (Steiermark/Styria), the risk of acquiring TBE was 1/10
000 man-months of exposure (7). Based on total numbers of tourist overnight
stays in Austria during the summer season, about 60 travel-associated cases
of clinical TBE could be expected to occur among holiday makers after their
stay in Austria.
Effective and protective inactivated vaccines are available, inexpensive
and have been licensed in the Czech Republic for more than 10 years.
Visitors to the Czech Republic and other endemic areas should consider 3
factors before deciding on whether to be vaccinated: length of stay, place
of residence (urban or rural), and whether or not they intend to visit
high-risk areas (in the Czech Republic, this would be the south, and parts
of western Bohemia). Vaccination is recommended for those travellers who
intend to stay longer than 3 weeks, who intend to visit rural areas in
endemic regions, or who plan to camp.

Latvia: Western and Far-eastern Subtypes of TBEV Detected
---------------------------------------------------------
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been notifiable in Latvia since 1955. In
1993, annual incidence quadrupled from the mean level of the previous 2
decades (nearly 8 cases per 100 000 population), reaching the highest
levels in 1994 and 1995 at 53 cases per 100 000. Since 1999 the incidence
has been significantly lower, down to 6.5 cases in 2002, but back up to
15.7 per 100 000 in 2003 (Figure). About 60 percent of TBE cases over the
last 10 years affected the meninges, about 30 percent were febrile and 10
percent had the most severe clinical course, meningoencephalitis.
There are 2 tick species in Latvia, _Ixodes ricinus_ and _Ixodes
persulcatus_. _I. ricinus_ has 2 seasonal activity peaks in the western and
central part of Latvia. _I. persulcatus_ has only one spring activity peak
and predominates in the eastern part of the country. According to
monitoring data, the abundance of ticks has increased since 1994, with the
highest peaks of _I. ricinus_ tick activity recorded in 1998 and 2000,
which does not match the epidemiological pattern exactly.
The highest TBE virus (TBEV) prevalence in field-collected ticks was
observed in 1995 (28.4 percent), 1996 (10.8 percent) and 2002 (9.2
percent). Apart from these 3 years, over the whole observation period since
1973, the mean annual TBEV prevalence rate in field-collected ticks was
about 3 percent. Tests on ticks engorged with human blood, brought to the
vaccination service by members of the public, started in 1998. The TBEV
prevalence rate in these ticks was found to be much higher, about 30
percent. Typing of TBEV isolated from ticks and patient serum samples in
collaboration with German and Swedish virologists revealed that the viruses
belong to Far Eastern and Western subtypes and are highly homologous with
the Vasilchenko, Neudoerfl and Sofyn strains previously described (2,3,4).
Annual changes in TBE morbidity depend on factors other than tick activity,
such as vaccination, awareness campaigns, changes in usual recreation due
to weather, etc. There is a significant correlation between marked
decreases in TBE morbidity and increases in vaccination coverage. According
to the incomplete data from vaccination services, which are mostly
privately run and not obliged to submit statistical data, the number of
completely vaccinated people since 1993 rose 3-5-fold. Vaccine uptake
according to the recommended vaccination schedule improved during the last
decade, when the number of 2nd and 3rd doses came nearer to the number of
1st doses.
The number of booster doses also increased significantly. Each year, the
demand for immunisation is usually highest during April, May and June, when
tick activity first peaks and awareness of the problem is higher.
In 1994, a campaign to vaccinate children against TBE began in areas of
high TBE risk in Latvia. There are 5 rural areas where child TBE incidence
level exceeded the mean level in country (20 cases per 100 000 children);
in areas with the highest TBE incidence, the levels exceeded the mean by
more than 6 times. These became a vaccination priority and 75 percent of
children in these rural districts are now covered. Vaccination in the 2
highest-risk groups of infected territories was completed in 1998.
Altogether, children have been vaccinated in more than 100 rural districts.
The childhood vaccination campaign was funded by humanitarian aid (51
percent) and national budget (49 percent), and this has brought the child
TBE incidence in high-risk areas down to a rate similar to the mean in the
whole country since 1999.
However, according to predictions (which were calculated using the child
TBE incidence rate over previous 5 years), the theoretical morbidity in
high-risk rural districts could exceed the rate from notified data more
than 5 times. According to official statistics, the immunisation coverage
for the whole population of Latvia is about 5 percent, but results of a
population survey of TBE prophylaxis awareness (1000 respondents) suggested
the percentage of vaccinated adults was higher: 15 percent people on low
incomes and 26 percent of all respondents reported that they had been
vaccinated.

Lithuania: Incidence of TBE in 2003 Highest of all Baltic Countries
--------------------------------------------------
In 2003, the epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Lithuania was
very unusual. The incidence rate (763 cases, 22 per 100 000 population) was
double the average incidence over the last 10 years, and was the highest
annual rate recorded since notification began at the end of the 1960s. This
rate was also the highest of all the Baltic countries in 2003. 4 lethal
cases of TBE were notified in 2003. TBE is normally transmitted by a tick
bite, but in 2003, 22 cases of TBE (4 clusters), were acquired by consuming
unpasteurised goat's milk, a well-recognised transmission route.
From 1993, the TBE incidence rate in Lithuania suddenly increased to >5
per 100 000 population, a 10-fold increase compared with the previous 2
decades. There was a further 3-fold increase in 1997/98, followed by a
decrease to nearer the 1993 level, before the dramatic increase last year.
One explanation for the high incidence in 2003 may be that there were
higher numbers of ticks this particular year.
TBE has a strict seasonal pattern, probably due largely to seasonal
patterns of tick activity and human visits to the forests. In 2003 most TBE
cases were registered in September and October, as usual. The highest
incidences of TBE, about 80 percent of all notified cases, are recorded
every year in the northern and central part of the country, mainly in 3
counties: Kaunas, Panevezys and Siauliai. In 2003, the incidence rate in
these areas was the same, but incidence rates were much higher in many
other counties. 8 districts out of 44 reported a 2-5-times higher incidence
rate than the average incidence in Lithuania. The highest incidence rate
was in Panevezys, at about 100 per 100 000 population.
In Lithuania, TBE affects 1.4 times as many males as females. People from
rural areas are 1.7 times more affected than people living in urban areas.
This has stayed constant over the last 10 years. About 40 percent of all
cases of TBE were in retired and unemployed people, who constitute a
particular risk group. This number has stayed relatively constant over the
past few years.
One reason could be that these people are more likely to collect mushrooms
and berries, which can serve as an additional source of income. TBE
incidence is about 2-3 times higher in adults than in children. Typically,
20 percent of all cases of TBE in Lithuania are in people over 60. In 2003,
people aged 40-49 also made up nearly 20 percent and the increased
incidence rate affected all age groups.
Despite TBE being a very big problem in Lithuania, vaccine coverage is too
low to control the disease: about 20 000 doses of TBE vaccine are given
each year, according to official statistics. Vaccination is recommended but
the government does not provide financial assistance for this, and people
have to pay the full costs themselves. Some employers provide vaccination
for employees such as forest workers, who, through their occupation, have a
higher risk of TBE.
