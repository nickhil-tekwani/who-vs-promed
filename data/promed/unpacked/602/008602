The Los Angeles County Health Department is reporting an increase in wound botulism cases linked to heroin injection in recent months. Since [1 Jun 2020], 6 suspected cases of wound botulism associated with heroin injection have been reported in Los Angeles County (1 case a month June through August and 3 cases in October). The cases are apparently unknown to each other. The sources of the heroin remain unknown.

A total of 5 of the 6 cases presented with wound infections or abscesses and a recent history of injecting heroin. Symptoms included diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, slurred speech, facial paralysis, difficulty breathing, and muscle weakness. Five cases required intensive care treatment and had respiratory failure requiring intubation. All patients were treated with Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BATÂ®). In 2020 to date, there has been a total of 9 reported cases of wound botulism, more than twice the annual average.

Between 2015-2019, 20 confirmed cases of wound botulism occurred in Los Angeles County, all of which were associated with drug use. Of these 20, 11 cases were associated with black tar heroin, 7 with heroin and 2 were associated with injection/inhalation of cocaine and/or methamphetamine.

Botulism is a rare, potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by the neurotoxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Wound botulism occurs when a wound is contaminated by _C. botulinum_ spores that germinate and produce toxin inside the wound. Wound botulism in drug abusers occurs in dermal abscesses from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection (skin or muscle "popping").

[Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin) is heroin acetate. "Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in "homebake heroin" in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid."

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least one study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).

"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _C. botulinum_ infection." - Mod.LL
