Viet Nam: nurse contracts avian influenza
---------------------------------------------
A 26-year-old Vietnamese man, who worked as a nurse in a hospital with
avian influenza patients in northern Viet Nam, had contracted the deadly
virus, a doctor said today [Mon 7 Mar 2005]. It is still unclear whether
the man contracted the virus from a patient or through contact with sick
poultry, the doctor said. Further investigations would be carried out.
"He is the nurse who took care of a patient confirmed positive for H5N1
virus," a doctor from Hanoi's Institute of Tropical disease told Agence
France Presse. The patient, 21, from northern Thai Binh province, has been
in critical condition for the past 10 days.

Viet Nam: male nurse contracts avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A 26-year-old Vietnamese male nurse, who tended a patient with avian
influenza, has caught the virus that has killed 47 people in Asia, a health
official said on Monday 7 Mar 2005. But it was not yet clear whether the
nurse caught the virus from the patient or by other means, said Tran Khac
Vien, head of a district health care center in the northern province of
Thai Binh, 70 miles southeast of Hanoi. "He looked after and had contact
with an H5N1 patient," Vien told Reuters. "We have been informed that he
was infected by bird flu, but there might be other reasons that could cause
the infection. We have not made any conclusion yet," he said.
Vien said the nurse was in a Hanoi hospital with a high fever, a symptom of
the H5N1 strain that infected his patient, a 21-year-old man from Thai Binh
who caught the virus after drinking raw duck blood last month [February
2005]. The nurse had provided bed care to the man, whose 14-year-old sister
was also infected after coming into contact with sick poultry.
In January [2005], another man in Thai Binh was killed by bird flu after
drinking duck blood, and his 2 brothers had also been infected, but later
recovered. The Thai Binh siblings have raised public concerns about the
possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus that 1st erupted in
Asia in late 2003, believed to have been brought by migrating birds.
Health Minister Tran Thi Trung Chien said last week [1st week of March
2005], prior to the nurse's case, that all avian influenza cases in Thai
Binh were related to slaughtering or eating poultry. There was no evidence
of human-to-human transmission of the virus, which has killed 13 Vietnamese
since the latest outbreaks in December 2004.
Vietnamese researchers said last week [1st week of March 2005] that initial
tests of a H5N1 vaccine on monkeys were successful, raising hopes in a
country hit hard by the virus that a vaccine may be ready for human tests
later this year. Experts fear that if the versatile and resilient virus
mutates into a form that could easily jump between humans, it would kill
millions in a global pandemic. Almost all the Asian victims -- 34
Vietnamese, 12 Thais and a Cambodian -- have caught it from infected
poultry. Bird flu has killed more than 70 percent of those known to have
been infected, but doctors say victims can be saved if they are diagnosed
early.

[From the ages of the patients described in the 2 reports, their only
identification, it is probable that the male nurse is a previously
described case whose occupation is now being considered as a relevant
factor in his case history. This is verified by the most recent WHO update
(below) - Mod.CP]

Avian influenza - situation in Viet Nam: WHO Update 10
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed an additional 4 cases of
human infection with H5N1 avian influenza.
Details about these 4 cases are as follows:
A 21-year-old man from Thai Binh Province. He developed symptoms on 14 Feb
2005 and was admitted to the hospital on 20 Feb 2005.
His 14-year-old sister, also from Thai Binh Province. She developed
symptoms on 21 Feb 2005 and was hospitalized the following day.
A 69-year-old man, also from Thai Binh Province. He developed symptoms on
19 Feb 2005, was admitted to the hospital the same day, and died on 23 Feb
2005.
A 35-year-old woman from Hanoi. She developed symptoms on 18 Feb 2005 and
was hospitalized on 24 Feb 2005.
WHO continues to work closely with the Vietnamese Ministry of Health to
further investigate additional cases which may have occurred since 2 Feb
2005. WHO will update its cumulative list of confirmed cases accordingly.
Earlier this year [2005], staff from WHO, Japan's National Institute of
Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, began working with health authorities in
Viet Nam to improve the sensitivity and reliability of laboratory
diagnostic tests. This activity, which aimed to upgrade laboratory capacity
and included a training component, involved the re-testing in Tokyo of
specimens from several persons initially classified in Viet Nam in January
2005 as negative for H5N1 infection. Re-testing detected H5N1 in specimens
from 7 persons. WHO is awaiting further details about these cases,
including outcomes. Upon receipt of this information, WHO will also include
these cases in the cumulative total for Viet Nam.
One additional case in Viet Nam, dating back to February 2004, has been
identified retrospectively from specimens stored as part of a study of
encephalitis (see the New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 352:686-691).
H5N1 infection, which was not considered in the diagnosis of this fatal
case, was identified in November 2004, when specimens were submitted to a
battery of tests. Specimens collected from other patients in this study are
now being systematically tested for possible H5N1 infection.
Information on new cases is of greatest concern, and WHO continues to
gather as much data as possible on each new case. Such data are urgently
needed at a time when many countries are intensifying their pandemic
preparedness activities.
