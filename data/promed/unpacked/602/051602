Epidemiological alert: Cholera situation in Haiti and the Dominican
Republic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this alert is to provide an update of the
epidemiological situation of cholera in Haiti and the Dominican
Republic, including the actions implemented by both countries in
response to the situation. Also included are the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) recommendations to Member States related to this
theme.

The information presented was provided by the Haitian Ministry of
Public Health and Population (MSPP) and by the Dominican Republic's
Ministry of Health, respectively.

Haiti
-----
Since the beginning of the cholera outbreak, starting epidemiological
week (EW) 42 [17-23 Oct] in 2010, until 10 Jul 2011 (EW 28), the MSPP
registered a total of 388 958 cholera cases of which 53.2 percent (206
882) required hospitalization and 5899 died (1.5 percent global case
fatality rate).

According to the MSPP's surveillance system, the national number of
cases and hospitalizations has decreased in the past 3 weeks,
following an increase that occurred between EW 20 and 25 [16 May-26
Jun 2011] due to the rainy season that affected the country.

At the local level 2 departments, Nord and Nord Ouest, recorded an
increase in the number of new cholera cases and new hospitalizations
since EW 22 [30 May-5 Jun 2011]. Meanwhile, Port-au-Prince and the
Centre, Grand Anse, and Nippes departments, which had recorded an
increase in cases between EW 22 and 23 [30 May-12 Jun 2011], have
recorded a decline for the past 3 weeks.

Dominican Republic
------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak in EW 42 [18-24 Oct] of 2010 up to
EW 29 of 2011 [18-24 Jul 2011] the Dominican Republic's Ministry of
Health has recorded a total of 13 200 suspected cholera cases and
confirmed 87 deaths due to cholera.

In the last 2 weeks the transmission was confirmed in 25 provinces and
53 municipalities. The Distrito Nacional and the provinces of Elias
Pina, San Cristobal, San Juan, San Pedro de Macoris, Santiago, and
Santo Domingo Est & Ouest registered the highest rates of cholera
transmission.

The Dominican Republic's surveillance system registered a decrease in
the number of suspected cholera cases as of EW 25 [20-26 Jun 2011],
although there were outbreaks in the Distrito Nacional and in some
provinces.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reminds Member States
of the need to strengthen methods of cholera prevention and control.
In this respect, PAHO/WHO recalls that the improvement of water supply
and sanitation remains the most sustainable measure to protect people
against cholera and other epidemic waterborne diarrheal diseases.

Similarly, the recommendations related to the travel and international
trade are reiterated. Experience has shown that measures such as
quarantine -- to limit movement of people -- and the seizure of goods,
are ineffective and unnecessary in controlling the spread of cholera.
Therefore, restricting the movement of people, as well as imposing
restrictions on imported food produced under good manufacturing
practices, based solely on the fact that cholera is epidemic or
endemic in a country, is not justified.

Date: Fri 29 Jul 2011

The Americas
------------
During 2010, _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 was introduced into Haiti for the
1st time in almost a century. The 1st cases were detected in October
2010 in the departments of Centre and Artibonite. The outbreak spread
rapidly to surrounding departments before expanding to the whole
country within 1 month. The CFR [case fatality rate] was high,
particularly in remote rural areas where access to health services is
limited, and in some areas the CFR exceeded 30 percent.

As of 31 Dec 2010, a total of 179 379 cases, including 3990 deaths,
had been registered from all departments including that of the
capital, Port au Prince.

Overall, 30 percent of the cases (53 556) and 23 percent of deaths
(844) were reported from Artibonite department. Port au Prince
registered 39 279 cases (22 percent of all cases reported in Haiti),
including 356 deaths (9 percent of all deaths from cholera reported in
Haiti).

As of 3 Jul 2011, the outbreak was still continuing, and a total of
381 236 cases, including 5609 deaths, had been registered in Haiti
[but see later fiigures in the report above]. The explosive spread of
the outbreak was linked to the lack of immunity against _V. cholerae_
as well as to the limited access to safe drinking water and basic
sanitation, and the internal migration that followed the earthquake in
January 2010. The spread was limited among those internally displaced
people who lived in camps with good access to safe water and
sanitation.

Dominican Republic
------------------
In November 2010, cases were detected in the Dominican Republic, which
reported local transmission in some areas and a total of 191
laboratory-confirmed cases as of the end of December 2010. As in
Haiti, as of July 2011, the outbreak is still ongoing in the Dominican
Republic and a total of 1872 laboratory confirmed cases including 117
deaths were registered by the end of June 2011.

Rest of Americas
----------------
Cases of autochthonous transmission of _V. cholerae_ O1 have been
reported in Martinique (6 cases), Mexico (1), and Canada (1). Canada
also reported 1 imported case. Additionally, 15 imported cases were
reported by the USA.

With the introduction of _V. cholerae_ into the Caribbean, it is
paramount that countries in the Americas ensure that surveillance to
detect cholera is strengthened so that control measures will be
triggered rapidly when a case occurs.

[Ref: Newton AE, Heiman KE, Schmitz A, Torok T, et al: Cholera in
United States associated with epidemic in Hispaniola. Emerg Infect
Dis. 2011 Nov; [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cholera caused by toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_, serogroup O1, serotype
Ogawa, biotype El Tor, was confirmed on 21 Oct 2010, in Haiti and on
31 Oct 2010, in the Dominican Republic. These countries are on the
island of Hispaniola. During 21 Oct 2010-4 Apr 2011, more than 275 000
cholera cases and more than 4700 deaths were reported from Hispaniola.
Of these cases, 840 culture-confirmed cases and 10 deaths were
reported from the Dominican Republic.

Illness caused by toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 has been documented in
the USA since 1832. During 1965-1991, an average of 5 cases per year
was reported. During the Latin American cholera epidemic that started
in 1991, the number of cholera cases in the USA increased because of
importation of cases related to the epidemic to an average of 53 cases
per year during 1992-1994 (1,2). As the Latin American epidemic waned,
during 1995-2000, the average annual case count decreased to 10 (3).
During 2000-2010, the average number of cases was 6, and 57 percent of
case-patients had traveled internationally (4). This experience raised
concern that a dramatic increase in USA cholera cases could result
from the Hispaniola epidemic.

In the USA, cholera is confirmed by identification of toxigenic _V.
cholerae_ serogroup O1 or O139 or by serologic evidence of infection
in a patient with diarrhea and an epidemiologic link to a
culture-confirmed case. Since 2000, suspected _V. cholerae_ isolates
have been sent by state public health laboratories to the CDC for
confirmation and characterization.

We summarize characteristics of confirmed USA cases associated with
the Hispaniola epidemic that were reported to the CDC Cholera and
Other _Vibrio_ Illness Surveillance System, a national database of all
laboratory-confirmed cholera and vibriosis cases. For each case of
cholera, state and local health officials submit a Cholera and Other
_Vibrio_ Illness Surveillance System report form that contains
demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic information, including
selected food and water exposures associated with cholera, travel
history, and vaccination status.

The 1st USA case associated with the epidemic in Hispaniola was
laboratory confirmed on 15 Nov 2010, in a USA resident who had
traveled to Haiti and returned to Florida. The 1st case in a patient
with history of travel to Dominican Republic was laboratory confirmed
on 29 Jan 2011. As of 4 Apr 2011, a total of 23 cholera cases
associated with the Hispaniola epidemic had been confirmed (Figure 1)
[for figures and tables, see source URL above - Mod.LL]. Patients
resided in Florida (10), Massachusetts (4), New York City (4), Kansas
(1), Michigan (1), North Carolina (1), Virginia (1), and Texas (1)
(Figure 2). Illness onset dates ranged from 23 Oct 2010 to 2 Feb 2011.
Median age was 38 years (range 9-84 years), and 43 percent were female
patients.

All patients were treated with antimicrobial agents, rehydration, or
both; 9 (39 percent) were hospitalized, 6 (30 percent) sought care at
an emergency department, and none died. 6 patients had illness onset
before returning to the USA, 5 had illness onset on the day of return,
and 12 had illness onset 1-11 days after return (typical incubation
period for cholera is 18 hours-5 days) (5). 20 cases were culture
confirmed and 3 were confirmed by serologic testing. All 20 isolates
matched the Haiti isolate outbreak pattern by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis. Susceptibility results for antimicrobial drug tested
showed that all isolates were resistant to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid,
sulfisoxazole and streptomycin, and 18 isolates showed intermediate
resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, or amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid.

13 patients reported recent travel to Haiti (median length of stay 7
days, range 2-54 days) and 9 to Dominican Republic (median length of
stay 4 days, range 2-9 days). One patient reported no recent travel
but consumed cooked conch brought to the USA from Haiti by relatives.
Travel was reported to the following departments in Haiti: Artibonite
(2), Ouest (7), Centre (1), Nord (1), and Sud (1). One case-patient
traveled to 2 departments and 2 did not specify a destination. All
cases associated with the Dominican Republic had attended a wedding in
La Romana Province on 22 Jan 2011; an investigation conducted by the
Dominican Republic Ministry of Health is ongoing. Aside from 2
case-patients who traveled to this wedding together, no other
case-patients reported traveling together.

Visiting friends or relatives was the main reason for travel to Haiti
(Table 1). 4 patients traveled to Haiti to participate in relief
activities, 2 as medical volunteers, 1 on a mission trip, and 1 to
distribute canned foods. One patient immigrated to the USA from Haiti
during the incubation period. A wide range of exposures was reported
(Table 2); 5 patients were exposed to persons with cholera or
cholera-like illness and to other risk factors for cholera
acquisition. Medical volunteers participated in direct patient care.
One volunteer reported no apparent lapses in safe water and food
practices, although detailed information about food preparation was
not available. No additional information was available for the other
volunteer. 7 of 15 patients with information available reported
receiving cholera prevention information before travel. Sources
included newspaper articles (4), friends (4), CDC traveler's hotline
(1), and the World Health Organization website (1); 2 patients
reported more than 1 source. None had ever received cholera vaccine. 2
patients reported receiving a Travel Health Alert Notice upon arrival
in the United States (M Selent, unpub. data).

6 months after the Hispaniola cholera epidemic started in Haiti, 23
associated cases were recognized in the USA. All cases were associated
with recent travel to Hispaniola or with consumption of seafood from
Haiti. The risk for cholera transmission in the United States is low
because of improved water and sanitation, and there is no evidence of
secondary transmission. Florida, New York, and Massachusetts have the
highest populations of persons of Haitian or Dominican ancestry (6).
Most cases were reported from Florida, the state with the largest
Haitian population. However, case-patients also resided in states with
small Haitian and Dominican populations. Travel between the United
States and Haiti is straightforward; 4 USA airports offer daily direct
flights from Florida and New York to Port-au-Prince. Many persons,
including many of Haitian descent, traveled from the USA to Haiti to
help with the response to the January 2010 earthquake in
Port-au-Prince.

Person-to-person transmission of cholera has only rarely been
reported; cases in medical workers are almost always attributable to
consumption of contaminated food or water. Person-to-person
transmission is not clearly supported for either of the cases we
report in medical workers, although it cannot be ruled out. Continued
surveillance and detailed investigation of cases in medical workers is
warranted to further define the risk, if any, of person-to-person
transmission.

Echoing the Latin American cholera epidemic in the 1990s, the number
of US cholera cases has increased after the cholera epidemic in
Hispaniola. Travelers to cholera-affected areas should be aware of the
risk and should follow prevention measures to avoid infection. In
particular, travelers visiting friends or relatives may be at higher
risk for travel-associated infection (7). Few case-patients had
received cholera prevention education (educational materials available
at http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/index.html); no cholera vaccine is
licensed in the USA. Until cholera in Haiti and Dominican Republic
resolves, clinicians, microbiologists, and public health workers in
the United States should be prepared for more cases in travelers
returning from Hispaniola.
