Local officials in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte [province] on Thursday [25 Jul 2013] declared a state of calamity in this town after the number of suspected chikungunya cases surged to more than 200, affecting at least 4 neighboring villages.

Vice Mayor Alfredo Valdez, a doctor, said the mosquitoborne disease might not be as deadly as dengue fever, but many local farmers who have contracted the disease could not go to the fields and work.

In a special session on Thursday [25 Jul 2013], the town council declared a state of calamity in San Nicolas so it could use its calamity funds for preventive measures against the spread of chikungunya [virus].

Valdez said the town needed to buy additional medicines and conduct fumigation in 24 villages.

[The chikungunya outbreak in the San Nicolas municipality continues and is increasing. The main mosquito vector in the outbreak areas above is _Aedes aegypti_, which breeds in and immediately around houses and other buildings. Fogging is of limited value. Reduction of breeding sites would have more effect in reducing vector mosquito populations.
