More raccoons with canine distemper are being reported this year [2015] in Charlevoix, Cheboygan, and Antrim counties, signaling a threat to household pets that aren't vaccinated against the highly contagious and deadly virus.

Humans don't get distemper, but the disease affects pets, and certain species of wildlife, such as raccoons, wolves, foxes, and skunks. Distemper is spread primarily through the air, but also through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Charlevoix-Cheboygan-Emmet [CCE] 911 Dispatch Center has seen an increase in sick animal calls.

"We have seen an uptick in sick and diseased animals, especially squirrels and raccoons," said Bob Bradley, CCE dispatch executive director. "In our case, we dispatch an officer or call the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] to generally dispose of the animal." If someone sees a wild animal acting strangely, call 911 and dispatchers can then determine whether a local police department or the DNR should deal with the animal. "Safety is our concern for everyone," Bradley said. "You don't know what the animal might have. In most cases, the DNR or law enforcement will come out and euthanize the animal."

In Boyne City, it is not unusual to see wild animals in town, but the cases of sick animals in August and September [2015] are high, said police chief Jeff Gaither. The police have responded to calls about a skunk, a porcupine, and about 15 calls dealing with sick raccoons. Several of the animals in Boyne City were so ill that they were no longer mobile, Gaither said. "It is unusually high to see this many sick animals," Gaither said. "We normally don't respond to animal calls, but when people call and don't know what to do we will generally assist and euthanize the animal."

In Charlevoix, the police have been dispatched to euthanize between 5 and 10 sick animals, said deputy chief of police Scott Hankins. [Is this per week? Or a month? What period of time? - Mod.TG]

The signs of recognizing an animal with distemper can be easy, said Brian Mastenbrook, wildlife supervisor with the Department of Natural Resources in Gaylord. "An animal with distemper will behave in ways you would never expect an animal to behave," Mastenbrook said. "There are more calls about raccoons during the day. An animal that has this virus may actually walk toward a person weaving or staggering like they're intoxicated."

The virus causes respiratory and intestinal problems, such as coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, or discharge from the nose and eyes. The virus also causes wild animals, such as foxes, coyotes, and raccoons, to show abnormal behavior, including a lack of fear, aggression, disorientation, and lack of alertness.

There is canine distemper and feline distemper. Raccoons and other animals can catch and spread both.

"That's the same distemper you get your house cat or dog vaccinated against," Mastenbrook said. "So if they come into contact with an infected animal, they don't get this illness." In addition to keeping your pets vaccinated, you should stay away from these animals. Call your local central dispatch or DNR if you see one. "Make sure you keep pets away from them so they don't get an infection, or even people to prevent an injury from one of these animals," Mastenbrook said. "They don't act normal because they're sick. So you can't really predict what they're going to do."

The DNR also encourages people to make sure their pets are vaccinated against the virus since dog and cats may come in contact with a sick animal. "The best way to prevent an infection is to have your pet vaccinated," Mastenbrook said.

The DNR has not determined a reason for the increase of distemper infections with animals this year [2015]. "We normally see a rise in distemper among raccoons in August, but the cases are unusually high," Mastenbrook said. "We have no conclusions or a reason why we are seeing this many animals infected with the virus." He encourages people to be cautious if they see animals acting out of the ordinary.

"The problem with an animal with distemper is they do approach people and that can be dangerous," Mastenbrook said. "These animals are not afraid. Don't approach wild animals. A healthy wild animal is not going to behave that way. Normally the animal should run away from you."

[It is unlikely that this is feline distemper. It is more likely to be canine distemper. Canine distemper is a viral disease that infects foxes, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and unvaccinated dogs and other carnivores.

Clinical signs of distemper include discharge from the nose and eyes, a rough coat of hair, often an emaciated appearance, and disorientation or wandering aimlessly. The clinical signs become progressively worse as the disease is usually fatal.

There is a neurological component to the disease. Animals may tremble, convulse, or display what is referred to as "chewing gum fits". The animal appears to be smacking its lips and chewing gum. The animal may turn, circle, or even bend its body so that this "chewing" appears to be directed at a flank. These neurological clinical signs can mimic rabies. Although distemper virus poses no threat to human beings, because the signs can appear similar to rabies, it is appropriate to contact a physician immediately. Distemper and rabies can only be distinguished by examining the animal's brain.

Transmission of the canine distemper virus (CDV) requires close contact, as the virus does not survive long outside of the body. A healthy animal (dog, raccoon, etc) may contract canine distemper from direct contact with an infected animal or its bodily fluids and waste.

Once an animal is infected with CDV, it begins to shed the virus about 5 days later. CDV seems to always be present in the environment. An animal may continue to shed the virus until its death, which may take as long as 6 weeks; usually, the course of the disease, is much shorter.

Young animals are most susceptible to the disease. Consequently, we see the disease manifest more in the spring and summer when young animals are more obvious. Not all raccoons get the disease. However, those that do are capable of passing it to other animals, including our domestic animals. It is strongly recommended that people vaccinate their dogs against this disease. There is prevention (vaccination) but there is no good treatment.

CDV tends to move in 5-7 year cycles. This may be the beginning of a cycle, and residents are again reminded to vaccine their pets.

What is concerning is this article has mentioned neurological component of this disease, which is true. But it has also mentioned felines, which are not that prone to CDV. Therefore, I am wondering why there is not some rabies testing or some other testing to verify the disease they have in these animals. - Mod.TG
