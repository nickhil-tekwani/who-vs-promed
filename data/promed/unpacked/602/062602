Haemorrhagic fever hits the Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------------
Medical authorities in Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo] say 9
people are dead from what could be haemorrhagic fever. District
Medical Inspector Edmond Mulamba says it is too early to label the
illness. It is also too early to say if the deaths are due to Ebola,
a type of haemorrhagic fever. He says tests were being run to
determine the cause of the deaths in remote Kasai Province.

At least 14 other people are suffering from symptoms of haemorrhagic
fever, including high temperature and violent vomiting. Mulamba says
a team of doctors from the World Health Organisation are travelling
to the province.

In 2007, at least 167 people died of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever] in
the same district where the current illness is being reported, around
700 kilometres [435 miles] south-east of Congo's capital, Kinshasa.

[It is not clear whether this outbreak is an extension of the
outbreak of undiagnosed illness reported in ProMED-mail which
occurred in the same in the same area in early October (see:
Undiagnosed illness - Congo DR: Kasai Occ, Ebola susp, RFI
20081009.3200), and which presumably has not since been confirmed as
an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever. The description of the
illness and the cause of death in the current outbreak are not
described in detail and haemorrhage is not mentioned. The location of
the outbreak, however, is in that part of the Kasai province of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo where a large outbreak of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever occurred in 2007, and on that basis a diagnosis of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever must be given serious consideration. Further
information from the region is requested.

A map of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be accessed at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/congo_demrep_pol98.jpg>. The
precise location of the current outbreak of undiagnosed illness is
not stated, other than it is occurring in the same district of Kasai
province where the 2007 outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever
occurred. A map of the province of Kasai Occidental can be viewed at:

which identifies the site of the 2007 outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic
fever. - Mod.CP]
