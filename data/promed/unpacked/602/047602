[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 4 Feb 2019. DRC Ebola cases surge to 785
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/drc-ebola-cases-surge-785
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Over the weekend [2-3 Feb 2019] and through today [4 Feb 2019], the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry reported 22 more cases, many from the current hot spot Katwa, but 7 other areas also reported new cases.

In other developments, a group of experts today urged the World Health Organization's (WHO's) emergency committee to meet again to consider declaring a public health emergency, and clinical experts pushed for more use of renal replacement therapy to prevent kidney failure in critically ill Ebola patients.

Latest case details
-------------------
Of the 22 new cases, the health ministry announced 11 of them in its update today. Among those lab-confirmed cases, 10 are in Katwa, with the following areas also reporting cases: Kyondo (4), Butembo (2), Kalunguta (2), Mabalako (1), Mangurujipa (1), Mutwanga (1), and Vuhovi (1). The increase lifts the outbreak's overall total to 785 cases, 731 of them confirmed and 54 listed as probable.

Health officials are still investigating 165 suspected Ebola infections.

In its latest updates the health ministry said 13 more people have died from their infections, 7 in community settings and 6 in Ebola treatment centers. Locations for community deaths, a factor that increases the risk of virus transmission, include Mangurujipa, Mutwanga, Mabalako, Kyondo, Katwa, and Vuhovi [North Kivu].

In a promising development, the ministry said contacts identified in Komanda have completed their 21-day follow-up period. And the number of people immunized with the experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine has risen to 73 309, roughly half of them in Beni and Katwa.

Experts call for global alert [see Lancet commentary below]
-----------------------------------------------------------
Writing in a Lancet commentary today [4 Feb 2019], several global health experts called for the WHO to reconvene its Ebola emergency committee and consider declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) to address the threat of cross-border spread and to trigger more high-level support for the response. Several of the international experts are from Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and Johns Hopkins' Center for Health Security.

The emergency committee last met in October 2018, and its members said they didn't consider the event at that time to be a PHEIC. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or sooner, if needed.

The authors of the commentary said cases have more than tripled since then, with illnesses detected in 18 health zones and less than 20% of cases coming from known contact lists. They also said a widening outbreak could destabilize the region, especially in South Sudan, where tenuous peace is haunted by continued violence and predicted famine.

Declaring a PHEIC could specify proactive measures that are needed to shore up the response and send a clear signal that UN leadership and high-level political, financial, and technical support are urgently needed.

The expert commenters acknowledged that a PHEIC might escalate conflict by raising the international response's profile. "Like any complex multilateral negotiation, cultural competence and smart diplomacy are required. Outsiders are unlikely to be privy to all on-the-ground realities and risks," the team wrote, adding that problems -- if they happen -- would require urgent reform of the process.

"WHO has shown leadership and operational endurance, working tirelessly to combat the DRC Ebola epidemic. But WHO and partners cannot succeed alone," they wrote, noting that the WHO and United Nations will likely increasingly be called on to response to complex humanitarian crises.

Supportive care, reporting delays [see Lancet paper below]
----------------------------------------------------------
In other medical literature developments:
- Experts from Canada and Africa writing in The Lancet today [4 Feb 2019] pushed for higher standards for supportive care for patients in Africa's outbreaks. Pointing out the role of renal failure in critically ill patients whose conditions deteriorate, they said that, although conventional dialysis isn't always feasible in many field settings, renal replacement therapy is an option when sterile water is scarce. They wrote that the bags are sealed until use, the approach is feasible, and the treatment would give patients time to recover from Ebola and associated acute renal failure.

- Georgia State University scientists who analyzed reporting dates in the DRC's current outbreak in the journal Epidemics [see comment] yesterday [3 Feb 2019] described a 2-wave pattern early in the outbreak, with the one surge in the 1st half of August [2018] and the other in late September [2018], likely linked to local armed conflict. They said reporting delays have shown an 81.1% decline and that the epidemic appears to have reached a steady state, averaging about 35 cases a week during the 8 weeks preceding [15 Jan 2019].

Epidemics. online 3 Feb 2019 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2019.01.003. This is an accepted but unedited version of the paper.

"Highlights
----------
- The Ebola epidemic displays a 2-wave pattern with the 1st surge in Ebola cases occurring between 30 Jul and 13 Aug 2018 and a 2nd case resurgence that occurred on 24 Sep 2018, which has been likely influenced by local armed conflict.
- Reporting delays, such as, time elapsed between the date of reporting and the date of symptom onset, have the potential to distort incidence curves, and in turn, estimates of transmission potential, forecasts of the outbreak trajectory, and the impact of control interventions.
- The epidemic appears to be approaching a steady state with an average of about 35 cases per week during the last 8 weeks.
- The average reporting delay exhibited 81.1% decline from a mean of 17.4 weeks in May 2018 to 3.3 weeks in September 2018. Our most recent estimate of the average reporting delay is 1.7 weeks (95% CI: 1.6,1.9) for the last month of the epidemic (3 Dec 2018-7 Jan 2019).
- During the last 4 generation intervals, the trend in the mean Rt has exhibited a slight decline (rho = -0.37, P less than 0.001), fluctuating around 0.9 (range: 0-1.8). Our most recent estimate of R is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.1) during the last generation interval of disease transmission."

It is important to note that this paper was last revised 25 Jan 2019, therefore data extend to that date at the latest. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 4 Feb 2019. Ebola DR Congo virus has spread to and around Katwa. Many infected people not seeking treatment
[The Hill, abridged, edited]
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/428369-ebola-poses-vexing-challenge-six-months-after-latest-outbreak
[Byline: Reid Wilson]

An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease in 2 eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo is growing in a large urban center where residents are distrustful of outside health officials, posing a massive challenge to national and international responders racing to contain the disease.

The outbreak began in a tiny rural village in the northern part of North Kivu province and quickly spread to Beni, a city of about a quarter-million residents. From Beni, the disease spread north into Ituri province, then south to the much larger city of Butembo.

"In a sense, what we've had is a series of linked brush fires, some of them quite intense," said Mike Ryan, a veteran Ebola hunter at the World Health Organization (WHO).

More recently, the virus has spread to and within Katwa, an urban area next to Butembo where residents live in dense conditions along the hills that adjoin the 2 cities. In recent weeks, dozens of new cases have popped up in Katwa, most of whom have not sought treatment.

[The Lancet, edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2819%2930242-9

[ref: La Montagne F, Clément C, Kojan R, et al. The Evolution of supportive care. The Lancet. Published online 4 Feb 2019]

"Historically, 60-70% of patients infected with Ebola virus in central African countries have died.(1) Ebola virus infected almost 30 000 people during the 2014-16 west African outbreak and mortality was initially greater than 70%.(2) Patients were admitted to isolation units. When they became critically ill, intravenous catheter placement was generally perceived as futile and potentially dangerous so intravenous treatment for dehydration was uncommon. There was limited capacity for diagnostic laboratory testing.

"In 2014, we and others proposed that aggressive supportive medical care was necessary and could coexist with infection prevention and control practices, making it safe for health professionals.(3) We believed that better supportive care would be the cornerstone of a successful Ebola response. With good care, local populations are more likely to willingly present early for screening and treatment, limiting the potential for community-based transmission. During the course of the west African outbreak, with improved case finding and earlier presentation for better care, mortality fell to less than 40%.(4) However, we can, and must, do better.

"During the 2014-16 outbreak, mortality was 18·5% in the 27 patients with Ebola virus disease treated in North America and Europe.(5) 9 (33%) of these patients received non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation and 5 (19%) received renal replacement therapy for between 2 and 28 days.(5) By contrast, only at the end of the west African outbreak was ventilation and renal replacement therapy available, and only in Sierra Leone in one treatment unit.(6)

"The world's 2nd largest Ebola virus disease outbreak is underway in the rural North Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since August 2018, 62% of the 733 infected people have died.(7) This outbreak has been complicated by military conflict that has hampered the public health response, vaccination, contact tracing, presentation to treatment units, and clinical care.

"DRC Ministry of Public Health, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and others have strived to provide best care to patients.(8) However, when patients develop Ebola-related organ failure in central Africa, the chances for survival are dismal. DRC Ministry of Public Health professionals, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale, WHO, and NGOs are trying to raise the standard of care. For example, the NGO Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) introduced individual isolation care units in DRC in 2018 that are certified at biosafety level (BSL)-4 and equipped with climate control and continuous observation capability.(9) Within the treatment units, every critically ill patient receives intravenous fluids, enteral nutrition, and electrolyte repletion guided by the results of daily blood tests. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, infusions of vasopressors, and positive pressure oxygen therapy are used when needed. In the DRC, we have seen the initial stabilisation of many critically ill patients; however, some patients do later deteriorate, generally in the context of complete renal failure.

"In patients with acute renal failure who need replacement therapy, the risk of chronic dialysis is increased but recovery of renal function is usually expected,(10) particularly for young, previously healthy individuals. In 2018, the international expert panel responsible for supportive care guidelines remained silent on the issue of renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation, because it was perceived beyond the scope of broadly applicable recommendations.(8) However, with advancements in baseline supportive care, we believe these therapies are both appropriate and necessary to reduce mortality beyond 40-50%.

"Conventional dialysis requires complex water treatment protocols to ensure a constant supply of a safe dialysate. These systems are not readily available in central Africa.(11) By contrast, renal replacement therapy can also be delivered by continuous self-contained, portable venovenous haemofiltration, haemodialysis, or haemodiafiltration. Many modern intensive-care units rely on such systems that use prefilled dialysate bags. In a setting where sterile water is a scarce resource, this approach has the additional advantage of avoiding risks of contamination since the bags are sealed until they are used. Used intermittently, as is done on a regular basis by necessity in some intensive care units,(12) this approach would be feasible, sustainable, and would give patients time to recover from Ebola virus disease and associated acute renal failure.

"During the Ebola outbreak in DRC, there have been many advances in Ebola research. Vaccination has been deployed across at-risk populations as a means to prevent infection. Large-scale randomised clinical trials are assessing anti-Ebola antibody-based medications mAb114,(13) REGN3470-3471-3479,(14) ZMapp,(15) and an antiviral medication remdesivir (NCT03719586). To have the greatest opportunity to detect potential clinical benefits, given the fairly moderate number (hundreds) of patients, the level of supportive care must be consistently good to reduce the risk of not identifying treatment effects against a background of variable overall care and mortality. Although we hope for so-called magic bullet medication cures, the treatment effect size we can realistically expect is probably much less than the 20-30% reduction in absolute mortality observed with the introduction of maximal supportive care among patients treated in Europe and the USA during the 2014-16 outbreak.(5) Alongside advancing medication-based clinical trials, we need to find mechanisms to provide effective life sustaining therapies for patients with failing organs who have a severe but survivable illness. This evolution of supportive care will afford patients the greatest chance of beating Ebola virus disease and provide an opportunity to evaluate new therapies."

[See open access publication for references. The difference in mortality rate -- 18·5% of 27 patients with Ebola virus disease treated in North America and Europe compared with 62% of the 733 infected people treated in the DRC since August 2018 is staggering. The advances that have been made since the West Africa outbreak, such as the ALIMA cubes, the anti-viral medications, the experience and expertise of the health care workers, should all contribute to lowering this high case fatality rate in country, especially when noted that during the course of the west African outbreak, with improved case finding and earlier presentation for better care, mortality fell to less than 40%. Patients are coming to health care centers late in infection in this current outbreak, largely because of their fear and distrust of the health care centers and the ongoing unrest. At that point, those with severe disease have failing organs, and need aggressive supportive therapy, which appears to be lacking. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 4 Feb 2019. Call for declaration of PHEIC
[The Lancet, abridged, edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30243-0/

[ref: Gostin L, Phelan A, Coutinho AG, et al. Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: time to sound a global alert? The Lancet]

Faced with an evolving complex humanitarian crisis, and recent elections complete, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus should reconvene the Emergency Committee (EC) and consider declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The 1st EC report on [17 Oct 2018], called for "intensified" action, fearing "significant deterioration".(1) The EC's fears have been prescient. Cases of Ebola virus disease have more than tripled, with an expanded geographical footprint into 18 health zones.(2) Governments, including the USA, have withdrawn personnel, fearing for their safety.(3)

Effective mitigation requires case identification. Yet less than 20% of new Ebola cases have been on known contact lists.(4) This situation undercuts vital interventions, such as contact investigations, isolation, and safe burials. WHO might have to shift from ring vaccination to vaccination based on geographical location but doing so effectively will require far more doses; limited vaccine supplies, therefore, are concerning.(5)

The risk of cross-border spread of Ebola virus disease to Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan is high.(2) Tens of thousands of Congolese cross borders daily to trade, to visit family, or for funerals. Roads to Kigali and Kampala are well travelled and could facilitate Ebola transfer to large population centres. Uganda and Rwanda have fairly strong surveillance systems and are preparing for cross-border spread. Uganda vaccinated essential health workers and is reportedly screening all travellers at Entebbe airport.(6) Yet cases could be missed at the border. South Sudan, meanwhile, is among the world's most fragile states. A widening epidemic of Ebola virus disease could destabilise the region and disrupt the tenuous peace in South Sudan, where violence continues and famine is predicted.(7) In the past 6 months, 300 000 DRC refugees have crossed into Uganda, adding to a refugee population of about 1 million.(8) The west African epidemic of Ebola virus disease in 2014-16 reduced regional economies by USD 2·8 billion.(9) Similar impact in DRC and neighbouring countries could devastate fragile economies.

The legal criteria for a PHEIC have been met.

A PHEIC is a clarion call to galvanise high-level political, financial, and technical support. A PHEIC would provide a clear signal from the world's global health body that UN leadership is urgent. A PHEIC also empowers the WHO Director-General to make temporary, non-binding recommendations that have normative force.(10)

WHO has shown leadership and operational endurance, working tirelessly to combat the DRC Ebola epidemic. But WHO and partners cannot succeed alone. We live at a political moment when international solutions to collective threats are increasingly hard to achieve. But WHO and the UN system will be called upon with ever-greater frequency in the future to manage complex humanitarian crises. We must plan for a future in which political violence and instability become the new abnormal.
