Yesterday [2 Jul 2009], Walter Poveda, minister of Agriculture and
Livestock, said that 74 cases of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] have
been recorded in Ecuador. In 2009, FMD reappeared on the border with
Colombia and spread to various zones in the country.

The official, who a week ago [week of 22 Jun 2009] had reported 69
cases of bovine infection, noted that the cases appeared initially in
the provinces of Esmeraldas and Cachi (in the north of the country,
on the border with Colombia) and spread to the Andean center and
south (including El Oro, on the border with Peru).

"The problem of FMD in Ecuador started more than 40 years ago, and
there hasn't been a coherent policy or responsible entity," Poveda
noted, adding that in the face of outbreaks "we realize there hasn't
been a policy" to confront the problem.

In January 2009, Peru suspended temporarily the import of ovines,
porcines, and bovines from Ecuador [see comment below].

In June 2009, the Colombian Livestock Federation issued an alert
about the danger that the epidemic of FMD in the border regions of
Ecuador and Venezuela represents for the country.

Ecuador is planning on vaccinating 4 million heads of cattle to
control the disease. The goal is to end vaccination by 2012 when it
expects to be declared free of the disease.

According to Francisco Jacome, director of Agrocalidad (Ecuadorian
Agency for Agriculture Quality Assurance), some 7 [8 -- Santo Domingo
de los Tsachilas, El Oro, Manabi, Los Rios, Esmeraldas, Santa Elena,
Guayas, and Imbabura. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] provinces in Ecuador are under
quarantine allowing only the internal movement of animals and
transport to slaughterhouses.

[On Sun 2 Aug 2009, after receiving official information on the
presence of type O FMD virus in Ecuadorian cattle from the Ecuadorian
Agency for Agriculture Quality Assurance, Peru again suspended
imports of ruminants and pigs from Ecuador for 180 days (see (in
Spanish)
<http://www.telesurtv.net/noticias/secciones/nota/55087-NN/peru-prohibe-importar-rumiantes-y-ganado-porcino-de-ecuador-por-fiebre-aftosa/>).

According to a newswire dated 25 Jul 2009 (in Spanish
<http://www.elnuevoempresario.com/noticia_11230_ecuador-levanta-parcialmente-la-cuarentena-por-la-fiebre-aftosa.php>),
the outbreak of FMD has been controlled in a large part of the
country. The Ecuadorian government has partially lifted the
quarantine, but not in the central Sierra or Amazon regions, where
control of the disease has not been verified; in addition, these are
areas where anti-FMD vaccination is quite deficient. An intensified
vaccination campaign and better communication with cattle ranchers
have been proposed. Vaccination in the coastal region has reached a
little more than 80 percent and there are hopes that the country will
be declared free of FMD in 2010. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
