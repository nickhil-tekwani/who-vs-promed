Cruise passenger dies of Legionnaires'
-------------------------------------
A passenger of a cruise ship which docked in Germany after a Greenland tour
has died of Legionnaires' disease, the Saxony-Anhalt state health ministry
said Tue, 26 Aug 2003.
The man had been treated for the disease at a hospital in Magdeburg after
the Ocean Monarch, carrying 358 passengers, arrived in the northern port of
Cuxhaven on Fri, 22 Aug 2003.
2 other passengers had contracted the disease and 6 people had shown
symptoms, officials said. All the passengers, including 218 Germans, had
left the ship on Fri, 22 Aug 2003. Health officials have appealed to any of
the passengers suffering from flu-like symptoms to contact a doctor
immediately.
Legionnaires' disease is caused by bacteria living in water droplets and
can develop in showers, air-conditioning and water-heating systems.
