Increase in botulism cases prompts warning
------------------------------------------
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has investigated several cases of confirmed or suspected foodborne botulism in the state since September 2020.

Testing from CDC confirmed 4 of the cases. One is still under investigation and test results are pending. All 5 cases occurred along the Front Range. The individuals are either hospitalized or recovering. 3 of the cases appear to be unrelated as no common food item was identified. The last 2 confirmed cases were likely the result of an improperly canned shared food made in the same household.

"5 cases of foodborne botulism in the span of a few months is unusual in Colorado and is cause for concern," said Nicole Comstock, deputy branch chief, communicable disease branch. "Botulism does not spread from person to person, so there is no risk to the public. However, these cases are a good reminder of how important it is to properly preserve and handle food in the home."

A variety of foods can be associated with foodborne botulism, including homemade foods that were improperly canned or preserved. The most common source of home canning related botulism cases come from foods with a low acid content, such as chiles, green beans, potatoes, beets, corn, and asparagus. Prior to these recent cases, the last confirmed cases of foodborne botulism in Colorado occurred in 2019 among a group that consumed a commercially prepared potato product held at improper temperatures.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism are related to inadequately processed food in the home, rather than that which is commercially prepared. It is not clear if there is any relationship between most of the cases. - Mod.LL
