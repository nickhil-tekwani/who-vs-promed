Human cases of a rare type of salmonellosis have caused the
Pennsylvania (PA) Department of Health to issue a warning to pet
owners. The health department says 21 cases of the illness in
Pennsylvania residents might be linked to dry dog food and advises
using safe buying and handling practices.
The illness being investigated by the health department is caused by
an uncommon strain called Schwarzengrund. Most of the infections
occurred in households with pets or where people are in close contact
with pets, but there is no evidence any human consumed pet food.
"While the department is working very closely with federal
investigators to identify a specific cause and source for these
illnesses, it is important that pet owners understand and follow
steps to prevent salmonella infection from occurring," state Health
Secretary Dr. Calvin B. Johnson said. Many of the salmonella cases
linked to the strain have occurred in infants and young children, who
are particularly vulnerable to infection.
The health department recommends the following to reduce risk of infection:
- purchase canned or bagged products with no signs of damage to the
packaging, including dents, tears, or discolorations.
- if possible, feed pets in an area other than the kitchen.
- before and after feeding pets food and treats, wash hands for 20
seconds with hot water and soap.
- wash pet bowls and scooping utensils with soap and hot water after
each use. If possible, don't wash them in a kitchen sink, or properly
sanitize the sink area after pet food dishes are cleaned and removed.
- don't use a pet's feeding bowl to scoop food. Instead, use a clean,
dedicated scoop.
- throw away old or spoiled pet food in a safe manner, in a securely
tied plastic bag in a covered trash receptacle.
- don't store or handle pet food in areas where human food is
prepared because it increases the chance of cross-contamination.
- promptly refrigerate or discard leftover wet pet food to prevent
growth of most harmful bacteria. Set refrigerators at 40 degrees F (4
deg C) and periodically check a refrigerator's temperature setting.
- store dry pet food and treats in a cool, dry place that's less than
80 deg F (27 deg C).
- store dry pet food in its original bag inside a clean plastic
container with a lid, keeping the top of the bag folded closed.
- keep pets away from food-storage and preparation areas.
- keep pets away from garbage and household trash.

[This interesting outbreak of a relatively unusual serotype of _S.
enterica_ appears to be linked to pets, although which pets is not
stated. An ongoing investigation may be able to assess what vehicle
-- but probably the pet food is the link -- and where the
contamination came from. No comment was made in the posting regarding
the antimicrobial sensitivities of the isolates. Of note, regarding
both of these points, the following are 2 citations about _S._
Schwarzengrund outbreaks. In both, the organism was resistant to some
commonly used antimicrobials and seemed to originate in the Far East.
1. Aarestrup FM: International spread of multidrug-resistant
_Salmonella_ Schwarzengrund in food products. Emerg Infect Dis 2007;
13:7 26-31:
"We compared 581 _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Schwarzengrund
isolates from persons, food, and food animals in Denmark, Thailand,
and the USA by antimicrobial drug susceptibility and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Resistance, including resistance to
nalidixic acid, was frequent among isolates from persons and chickens
in Thailand, persons in the USA, and food imported from Thailand to
Denmark and the USA. A total of 183 PFGE patterns were observed, and
136 (23.4 percent) isolates had the 3 most common patterns. 7 of 14
isolates from persons in Denmark had patterns found in persons and
chicken meat in Thailand; 22 of 390 human isolates from the USA had
patterns found in Denmark and Thailand. This study suggests spread of
multidrug-resistant _S._ Schwarzengrund from chickens to persons in
Thailand, and from imported Thai food products to persons in Denmark
and the USA."
2. Olsen SJ, DeBess EE, McGivern TE, et al: A nosocomial outbreak of
fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonella infection. N Engl J Med 2001;
344: 1572-9:
"Infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of salmonella is
rare, as is nosocomial salmonella infection. We describe the 1st
recognized outbreak of fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonella
infections in the USA, which occurred in 2 nursing homes and a
hospital in Oregon.
We interviewed medical staff and reviewed patients' charts and death
certificates. In Nursing Home A we conducted a case-control study.
Patients were defined as residents of the nursing home from whom
fluoroquinolone-resistant _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Schwarzengrund was isolated between February 1996 and December 1998.
Controls were residents with similar medical conditions whose
cultures did not yield salmonella. We compared isolates using
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis. We reviewed
pharmacy records to compare the use of fluoroquinolone among several
nursing homes.
11 patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonellosis were
identified at 2 nursing homes. The index patient had been
hospitalized in the Philippines and had probably acquired the
infection there. Transmission was probably direct (from patient to
patient) or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Treatment
with fluoroquinolones during the 6 months before a culture was
obtained was associated with a significant risk of salmonella
infection (4 of 5 patients had taken fluoroquinolones, as compared
with 2 of 13 controls; odds ratio, 22.0; 95 percent confidence
interval, 1.06 to 1177). The patients were not significantly more
likely than the controls to have taken other antibiotics. More
fluoroquinolones were used at Nursing Home A than at similar nursing
homes in Oregon. The isolates from the outbreak had similar patterns
on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and the same gyrA mutations. The
isolates from the outbreak were also similar to the only previous
isolate of fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonella in the USA, which
came from a patient in New York who had been transferred from a
hospital in the Philippines.
We describe a prolonged nosocomial outbreak of infection with
fluoroquinolone-resistant _S. enterica_ serotype Schwarzengrund. More
such outbreaks are likely in institutional settings, particularly
those in which there is heavy use of antimicrobial agents."
If the pattern continues, the isolates will be somewhat resistant to
antimicrobials and be found to have originated in the eastern Asia
probably in a pet-related product such food or a treat.
If other states are not involved, it is possible that the reservoir
is only distributed locally in Pennsylvania. With the popularity of
"natural" diets even for pets, it has been reported (Joffe DJ,
Schlesinger DP: Preliminary assessment of the risk of _Salmonella_
infection in dogs fed raw chicken diets. Can Vet J. 2002; 43: 441-2)
that one natural diet, commonly referred to as the BARF (bones and
raw food) diet (consisting of pieces of whole raw chicken together
with vegetables) transmitted salmonella serotypes including
Schwarzengrund to dogs and subsequently were excreted in the canine
feces. - Mod.LL]
