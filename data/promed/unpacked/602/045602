An unknown disease has claimed lives of hundreds of goats in the MV-56 village under Kalimela block in Malkangiri district during the last 3 months [March - May 2018].

The mass deaths have triggered fear among locals who are yet to recover from the mass pig deaths that occurred last year [2017] and particularly because most of them depend on goat farming as livelihood. "The goats fall sick for a few days and then succumb. We do not know the cause," said a villager.

The district administration has sent a team of veterinary doctors to the MV-56 village to identify the cause of death. "Blood samples have been collected and sent for examination," informed the officials.

"We received the complaints on [Fri 8 Jun 2018] and a team of veterinary doctors immediately left for the spot. A camp has been set up in the village and blood samples of goats have been collected," informed Sachin Panda, additional veterinary doctor. "We are waiting for reports of the blood test to ascertain the disease", Panda said.

[The rather scanty information in the above report can be summarized as follows:
1. Hundreds of goats in a single village have been dying during the last 3 months.
2. During the previous year, there were mortalities in pigs in the same village.
3. The affected goats "fall sick for a few days and then succumb".

Information on clinical signs (at least, body temperature), mortality rate (denominator, namely size of susceptible goat population), case fatality rate, PM (post mortem) findings (gross pathology), number of domestic animal of other species in the village, climatic conditions...

It may be assumed, that blood samples are accompanied, when "submitted to the lab for examination". Which tests have been requested?

The event could be caused by infectious or non-infectious agent(s). Among the formers, 2 serious infectious caprine diseases deserve to be ruled out: Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP). - Mod.AS
