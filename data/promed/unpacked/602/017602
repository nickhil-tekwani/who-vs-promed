WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (10)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

[Note: Now that West Nile virus (WNV) infection is endemic throughout much
of the eastern seaboard of the United States (see: West Nile virus - USA
2001: final report 20020613.4491), most reports on WNV infection in year
2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at regular intervals.
Reports of human infection, infection of new hosts, extension of
geographical range and events of special significance will be posted
immediately on receipt.
The USGS/CINDI West Nile Virus National and State Maps
(<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>) list
cumulative WNV positive results together with the dates of reporting of
individual cases. These maps appear to be updated at irregular intervals
and lag behind the current situation. Therefore the cumulative bird counts
will no longer be recorded here, especially as they can only be obtained by
the laborious procedure of accessing each state map in turn. Nonetheless
the maps provide a valuable graphic picture of the progress of the WNV
epidemic in 2002. Some of the cumulative WNV positive bird counts may be
deceptive because several states no longer report data after the initial
appearance of the virus in a county. Consequently the number of counties
affected in a state rather than the absolute number of positive birds
recorded will become the critical statistic. - Mod.CP]

Pennsylvania: fourth WNV positive bird - location correction
------------------------------------------------------------
State health secretary Robert S Zimmerman Jr confirmed yesterday that WNV
had been detected in a dead crow found several days earlier in Chester
Springs, West Vincent Township (NOT West Pikeland Township as was reported
earlier [in the Philadelphia Enquirer], and posted on ProMED-mail as part
[3] of "West Nile virus update 2002 - USA (09) 20020630.4638").

Indiana: WNV positive birds now total eight
-------------------------------------------
Three more birds, one crow from Allen County, and one blue jay each from
Allen and Monroe Counties were found to have WNV RNA. This brings the total
number of positive birds in the State of Indiana to 8: Porter 1, St Joseph
1, Allen 3, Marion 1, and Monroe 2. Once again, the distribution of
positives is widely scattered, fitting in with a pattern which is becoming
evident in the Great Lakes States.

Kentucky: first cases of WNV infection: colt and three birds
------------------------------------------------------------
Mosquitoes are always buzzing, biting, bloodsucking summer pests. But as
bug season heats up, mosquitoes are more than the usual nuisance this year.
Kentucky's first cases of WNV infection this year were confirmed last week.
The virus was found in a thoroughbred colt in Fayette County, two grackles
in Metcalfe County, and an Oldham county blackbird, confirming what public
health officials already knew -- West Nile virus is here to stay.

Phylogenetic analysis of WNV Strains
------------------------------------
The complete nucleotide sequences of 8 WNV strains (Egypt 1951, Romania
1996-MQ, Italy 1998-equine, New York 1999-equine, MD 2000-crow265, NJ
2000MQ5488, NY 2000-grouse3282, and NY 2000-crow3356) have been determined.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences
of these 8 viruses along with all other previously published complete WNV
genome sequences. The phylogenetic trees revealed the presence of 2 genetic
lineages of West Nile viruses. Lineage 1 West Nile viruses have been
isolated from the northeastern United States, Europe, Israel, Africa,
India, Russia, and Australia. Lineage 2 West Nile viruses have been
isolated only in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Lineage 1 viruses can
be further subdivided into 3 monophyletic clades.

Michigan: Genesee County crow confirmed WNV positive
----------------------------------------------------
The Michigan Department of Community Health has confirmed that a crow found
dead in the city of Clio last week has tested positive for WNV. This brings
to 3 the number of counties this year where birds have been tested positive
for WNV. The other 2 counties are Wayne and Ingham. No human cases of WNV
infection have been detected in Michigan.

Michigan: WNV detected in Branch County
---------------------------------------
COLDWATER: Branch County's first case of WNV infection has been confirmed,
a health agency announced on Wed 3 Jul 2002. A crow found in Coldwater
recently tested positive for the mosquito-spread virus, according to the
Branch-Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency.
The state Department of Community Health had previously said that crows
found in Genesee, Ingham, and Wayne counties tested positive for the
disease this year. The state's first infected bird this year was found in
Livonia in May. The potentially deadly virus, which first showed up in the
state last August, hasn't been detected in humans or horses in Michigan.
[NB: Michigan is one of the states that does not record positive birds
after the first positive test result in any county. The virus has now been
recorded in 4 counties in Michigan. - Mod.CP]

Tennessee: two more birds from midstate area test WNV positive
--------------------------------------------------------------
A blue jay found in Manchester and a crow in Robertson County both tested
positive for West Nile virus. In addition, positive test results were
obtained on one more bird from Shelby County, bringing the statewide total
for this year up to 8 of 125 birds tested. The virus has also been seen in
Davidson County.
This week is National Mosquito Control Awareness Week, and the Tennessee
Department of Health launched a website yesterday to help educate
Tennesseans about WNV and how to protect themselves. Go to
and click on "West Nile Virus" under HOT TOPICS.

Ohio: WNV likely in all 88 counties
-----------------------------------
WNV has now been confirmed in 25 counties. It is suspected that it has
infiltrated all of Ohio's 88 counties. Health officials say dead blue jays
in 4 Geauga County communities last week tested positive for the virus.
State Health Department spokesman Kristopher Weiss says people need to be
aware of the virus but shouldn't panic. Across mostly eastern coastal
states last year, 66 people in 10 states were infected, and 9 died. No
human infections have been reported in Ohio.

Louisiana: WNV positive bird total now 81; testing suspended in 7 areas;
suspected human case
------------------------------------------
BATON ROUGE: The Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) reports today
that the Louisian State University School of Veterinary Medicine has
confirmed WNV in 16 more birds. The birds, species, and location of their
discovery is as follows:
10 blue jays from Jefferson (Kenner & Metairie);
3 blue jays from Iberville (Plaquemine);
2 blue jays from Livingston (Denham Springs);
1 blue jay from East Feliciana (Clinton).
The bluejays that tested positive in Plaquemine and Clinton are the first
ever confirmed incidences of WNV transmission in Iberville and East
Feliciana parishes.
DHH's Office of Public Health (OPH) has determined that testing of birds
collected on the east bank of the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish
will be suspended. Health officials note that the virus is present and well
established in this area and there is no new information to learn by
testing more birds. OPH has already suspended testing in 5 other areas
earlier this month: East Baton Rouge, Tangipahoa, St Tammany, and West
Baton Rouge (Port Allen only) parishes, and the east bank of the
Mississippi River in Ascension parish. While collection and testing has
ended in these areas, however, OPH asks individuals to report the location
of dead birds to local health units for surveillance efforts.
A total of 81 birds have tested positive for WNV this year, according to
Ratard [state epidemiologist]. This is in addition to earlier confirmed
reports of 3 birds and 6 horses infected with eastern equine encephalitis.
Just last week DHH also reported preliminary results from blood samples,
noting that a 78 year old Hammond man was suspected to be infected with WNV
and that LaCrosse encephalitis had been confirmed in a 7 year old girl in
Vernon Parish.

Louisiana: 81+ birds, 6 horses, and a suspected human case
----------------------------------------------------------
State health officials reported finding birds infected with WNV in East
Feliciana and Iberville parishes for the first time on Tue 2 Jul 2002 [see
report 10, above]. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH)
also found 2 more infected birds in Livingston Parish, where only one had
been found previously. The department will suspend testing birds in the
Metairie-Kenner area, as it has in Baton Rouge, Port Allen, Gonzales, and
Tangipahoa and St Tammany parishes, officials said Tues 2 Jul 2002. Health
officials said they halted testing in areas where they have already
confirmed a number of cases of the virus to enable them to make the best
use of their limited testing resources. In areas where DHH continues to
test dead birds, it is limiting its testing to those species that provide
the most information, officials said. The virus tends to exist at higher
levels in blue jays, crows, and raptors.
Meanwhile, Dr Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said DHH is 99 per
cent sure that a 78 year old Hammond man has the virus. Two different
antibody tests established that case, he said. No other human cases of WNV
infection are definite, but Ratard confirmed that physicians have asked DHH
to test at least one other person in the Florida parishes for the
mosquitoborne disease.
So far, 6 horses have been found with the virus, including 2 in Ascension
parish. Two other horses have been confirmed with the virus in Cameron
parish, one in Calcasieu parish, and one in St Tammany parish, health
officials said.

New York: first WNV positive test result for Staten Island
----------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 5 Jul 2002, New York City reported a positive result for 1
mosquito pool (Staten Island 1). This is the first WNV positive finding for
Staten Island in 2002.
The total number of WNV positive specimens for New York for the year is now
16 dead birds plus the mosquito pool described above. The WNV positive bird
count has increased by 1 (the first report from Ontario county) since the
update of 27 Jul 2002.
County total WNV positive results to date are: dead birds -- 16 (Albany 5,
Erie 2, Monroe 1, Nassau 2, Niagra 1, Ontario 1, and Rockland 4). Mosquito
pool -- 1 New York City (Staten Island 1).
