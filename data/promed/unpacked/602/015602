Mexico ranks among the top exporters in the world for papaya. Recently, however, producers have begun to suffer significant losses due to 2 viruses that affect the plant -- papaya ringspot and papaya mosaic virus.

Currently, producers rely on visual identification [of the] viruses in the plants. Laura Silva of Mexico's Cinvestav [National Polytechnic] research center explained that to properly [deal with] infected plants, producers need to be certain that the diagnosis is valid. "It means using a laboratory and scientific support," she said.

The technology developed by Silva and her team can simultaneously detect both viruses. Producers need to provide leaf tissue from the plant in question. [The scientists] also hope to improve the technology to be able to detect other viruses that affect papayas.

[_Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV; genus _Potyvirus_) is the major limiting factor to production of the crop in many countries. PRSV symptoms on papaya leaves include yellowing, vein-clearing, mottling (which may be considered a "mosaic"-like pattern), and sometimes severe blistering and leaf distortion. Fruit symptoms are striking and consist of dark concentric rings and spots or C-shaped markings. Vigour of trees, life span, and fruit set are usually reduced depending on the age of the plant when infected. Fruit quality, particularly flavour, is also adversely affected. The virus is spread by many species of aphids and with infected plants or seedlings but is not usually seed transmitted.

_Papaya mosaic virus_ (PapMV; genus _Potexvirus_) has only been reported from the Americas. It causes leaf symptoms similar to PRSV, but fruit symptoms are less obvious. The virus is spread by mechanical means and infected plants, but has no specific insect vectors and is not transmitted by seed.

Disease management for both viruses includes quarantine measures, phytosanitation to limit sources of inoculum, and, for PRSV, vector control. Some resistant or tolerant cultivars are available. Most important is use of clean planting material. Both to certify virus freedom of planting material, and for reliable field diagnosis, molecular diagnostic procedures (as described above) are essential.
