Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) has confirmed yet another introduction of bird flu [avian influenza] at a Dutch poultry farm. It concerns highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu at a turkey farm in Weert.

To prevent the virus from spreading, the turkey farm (13 000 animals) was culled by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). In the 1 kilometer [0.6 mile] zone around the infected farm, there is one other poultry farm that was culled to prevent viral spread (66 000 animals).

Bird flu was not found at 7 other poultry farms in the 3 km [2 mi] zone.

In the 10 km [6 mi] zone, there are 128 other poultry farms. In this zone, a transport ban applies. This ban covers poultry, eggs, poultry manure, and used bedding, as well as other animals and certain products from commercial poultry companies. Part of this zone is in Belgium and measures of the Belgian authorities apply there.

Overview of previous Dutch farms with bird flu since late Oct 2020.
[The detailed table-form overview, addressing previous bird flu infections on commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands in 2020/2021, including a total of 11 outbreaks affecting chickens, ducks, or turkeys, found infected between 29 Oct 2020 and 22 Feb 2021, indicating type of farm, number of animals, and dates, is available at the source URL above].

Measures
--------
All current national measures, such as the obligation to house commercially kept poultry, will remain in full force. As of this week, for keepers of laying hens, breeding animals, and broilers a stricter reporting obligation is in place. They must report the loss of animals to the NVWA sooner. This allows bird flu infections to come to light earlier and reduces the risk of spreading.

In addition, zoos, petting zoos, and hobby bird owners are required to shield their poultry and waterfowl so that these animals do not come into contact with wild waterfowl and their droppings. This can be done, for example, by keeping the animals in an aviary or by placing them in a run. Furthermore, a ban has been imposed on the display of ornamental poultry and water birds.

Wild birds
----------
In particular, in the north and west of the Netherlands, sick or dead wild birds are currently found that test positive for avian flu. These birds are sent and examined. The advice is not to pick up dead birds yourself, but to report this to the Dutch Wildlife Health Center or the NVWA. Every week the NVWA places an update on the website where dead wild birds are found that are infected with the virus. Or see the overview map by WBVR elsewhere on this page. [The map "spread from April 2021" is available at the source URL, presenting the locations of outbreaks in poultry farms (purple), wild birds (red), and hobby farms/petting zoos (blue)].
