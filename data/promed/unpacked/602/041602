As the moderator invited informed comment, we would like to point out some facts, and some errors, relating to the previous post.

The Sudarshan (National Multicentric Rabies Survey) 2007 study did identify 235 deaths, but from 22 hospitals affiliated to medical schools. These deaths were subsequently used as index cases for community searches, estimated to cover a population of 10.8 million in India (less than 1 per cent of the total human population). These findings were then extrapolated to the whole country, as summarized in the paper's abstract: "Results: The annual incidence of human rabies was estimated to be 17 137 (95 per cent CI 14 109 - 20 165). Based on expert group advice, an additional 20 per cent was added to this to include paralytic/ atypical forms of rabies, providing an estimate of 20 565 or about 2 per 100 000 population." [Sudarshan et al, 2007, International Journal of Infectious Diseases].

From the abstract of the Suraweera (verbal autopsy) 2012 study conducted in India: "Conclusions and Significance: Rabies remains an avoidable cause of death in India. As verbal autopsy is not likely to identify atypical or paralytic forms of rabies, our figure of 12 700 deaths due to classic and clinically identifiable furious rabies underestimates the total number of deaths due to this virus" [Suraweera et al, 2012, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases].

The most recent Global Burden of Disease study -- utilizing largely verbal autopsy data (which as mentioned above will miss paralytic forms of rabies) estimated 12 349 (95 per cent CI 8196 - 15 399) deaths from rabies in India in 2013 [GBD 2013 authors. 2015, Lancet].

The recently published Partners for Rabies Prevention study, estimated 20 847 (95 per cent CI 7000 - 55 000) deaths in India [Hampson et al, 2015, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases].

These estimates of human deaths from rabies in India vary across the studies, as is to be expected from the divergent methodologies, but none of the 95 per cent confidence intervals fall as low as the number of human deaths (generally between 200 and 350 deaths per year) reported by India's Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI). The CBHI figures are not the human deaths experienced by India, but the human deaths officially reported in India (where human rabies is not a notifiable disease).

This discrepancy is entirely consistent with other active surveillance studies of human rabies deaths that have shown that passive surveillance records grossly underestimate human rabies incidence, sometimes by a factor of 100 [Cleaveland et al. 2002, Bulletin WHO]. Whilst 1 or 2 cases in urban areas may make headline news, in many countries, deaths are likely concentrated amongst the rural poor who die outside of the health system, and with no media interest.

If passive surveillance records were thought to be adequate to answer the question of how many people die of human rabies in canine rabies endemic countries, there would be no need for the detailed and time consuming research activities described above. Such studies attempt to quantify the extent of underreporting (of rabies and other diseases) to help decision makers prioritize disease control efforts and save lives. The data inputs, assumptions and methods utilized in each of the studies are explained in detail in the respective papers and should not be summarised as "abstract projections". We invite any scientific analysis of the data and the robust methodologies applied. Peer-reviewed scientific evidence, especially new active surveillance studies of rabies from India and elsewhere, will be of value to the whole rabies community.

What GARC [Global Alliance for Rabies Control] is saying here, in a great many more words, is that they and others took the actual verifiable body count from the 22 institutions most likely to actually be handling human rabies deaths (because most Indian hospitals don't knowingly admit rabies cases), and then multiplied them up to get a number similar to the number already claimed for decades, which was for them the politically most convenient number to use.

Meanwhile, the actual verifiable [Indian] body count since 2003, reported by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, has been 235, 274, 361, 221, 244, 260, 162, 223, 212, and 138, total of 2330, average of 233, median of 229, within a range of 138-361, with 4 of the 5 lowest annual counts coming in the past 4 years.

If the annual death tolls were actually close to 100 times higher, would not the numbers of cases seen by the 22 institutions most likely to be handling rabies deaths at least occasionally spike higher?

If under-reporting from remote villages really was causing such an extraordinary discrepancy in data back in 2003, when India was already among the most internet-wired and savvy nations in the world, would that condition really not have been remedied at all in the ensuing decade, during which India has become the call center and tech support desk for practically the whole of the English-speaking world?

If 17 000 to 21 000 Indians per year really were dying of rabies, could we not expect to see a rise in the reported numbers of cases, as has occurred with a variety of other diseases due to improved reporting, instead of seeing a pronounced decline from low to lower?

If human rabies deaths really were occurring at approximately the same rate as deaths by house fire (National Health Profile table 3.1.3.1), would they not receive approximately the same sort of media coverage, i.e. usually local notice only, rather than banner headlines throughout an entire community of millions, if a rabies case is even suspected?

Would government hospitals equipped to handle human rabies cases not be as common as fire departments?

The phrase "writ of habeas corpus" applies here, but in a forensic rather than legal contest. A "writ of habeas corpus" is literally a document requiring the jailer to produce the body.

Where 17 000 or 20 000 or 21 000 bodies are claimed to exist, but fewer than 250 can be found, the burden of proof is on the persons making the claim to find them. Exercises in math based on presumptive projection are no substitute for forensic evidence in bringing a murder charge, and should not be substituted for forensic evidence in allocating resources in disease control, either.

The consistently low numbers of verifiable rabies cases in India over the past decade suggests that rabies is close to eradication, if resources are allocated to vaccinating it out of existence in the places where it verifiably still occurs.

As a postscript, let me call your attention to the numbers below, posted by ProMED 2 days ago as Ebola update (60). What you may notice 1st of all is that Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are all much less economically, technologically, and educationally advanced than India. Yet they are able to produce reasonably credible and frequently updated body counts. Second, the death tolls in Liberia and Sierra Leone, if projected over a year's time, end up in about the same range as the GARC-projected rabies death toll in India. The Ebola death toll in western Africa produced global concern even when a fraction as high. Yet we are to believe that deaths on this order occurring in India, each and every year, are somehow eluding everyone's notice?

[Thanks to Merritt and Louise & her colleagues. However, I cannot but echo Merritt's last statement. If the scope of the rabies problem in India were to be accurately assessed, it would be seen to be a series of relatively isolated outbreaks, vulnerable to eradication by targeting the areas for saturation vaccination of dogs. Then canine rabies could be eliminated from India altogether within just a few years of intensive effort.

Probably the same could be actively considered in Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. India, though, has probably been within striking distance of eradicating rabies for 20-30 years now -- if the strikers were taking accurate aim at the problem -- instead of wasting effort with just retroactive village vaccination following a human case. One has to be proactive in areas, not just villages, with a recognised problem. Rabies should be relatively easily eradicable in Nepal, as well, but in Nepal (as in the US, Canada, & Europe) the wildlife vectors appear to be at least as problematic as the canine vector, and oral vaccinating foxes et al amid the rugged terrain will not be as simple as vaccinating urban street dogs. - Mod.MHJ]
