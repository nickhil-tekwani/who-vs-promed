Dr. Catherine Barr, assistant toxicologist at Texas A&M University's
Veterinary Medicine Diagnostic Laboratory has reported that tainted dog
food linked to the deaths of about 25 dogs in Texas in the past two months
has been traced to moldy corn damaged by insects during last summer's
drought. Tests revealed the culprit as aflatoxin B1, a mold toxin that gets
into kernels of corn that cracked because of insect activity and extreme
dryness. Apparently a pathologist noticed lesions suggesting the presence
of aflatoxin appeared repeatedly in the liver samples.
Douglas Cahill, chief executive officer of Tennessee-based Doane Products
Co., which manufactured the dog food, was cited as apologizing for the dog
deaths, adding, "We first learned of one isolated incident and got data
back last Friday identifying aflatoxin as the cause of death. We've
identified six pet owners with a total of 12 dogs, but now we know 25 dogs
have died. We've met with the six owners we've identified to find out what
they fed their dogs and where it came from. Our goal is to meet with every
pet owner." [see below - MHJ
Cahill added that a recall affects all of Texas and Shreveport, La., but
added that few products manufactured in July and August still are on the
shelves. The affected foods probably came from one batch, he said. Anyone
with a product included in the recall should return it, in the original
packaging, to the store where it was purchased. It will be replaced at no
charge, Cahill said.
"Our first concern is for the safety of family pets," he said. "Even though
the problem appears to be limited to a very small amount of dog food, we
are recalling more than enough production to assure we remove any pet food
that may be a problem."
Cahill said his company has intensified product testing.

Doane Products Company has asked that TVMA help distribute this information
to Texas veterinarians.
If someone would like more information about this, call Doane at
800-752-8057 or you can call TVMA at 512-452-4224 for a copy of the full
news release and list of recalled dog foods.
TEMPLE, TEXAS, NOV. 2, 1998. Doane Products Company announced today a
recall of dry dog food produced between July 1 and Aug. 31, 1998 at its
Temple, Texas plant. The recall includes several brands Doane manufactures
for other companies, and follows reports of illness or death of several
dogs in a small area of central Texas, primarily around New Braunfels. The
brands in the recall, on the attached list, are those manufactured at the
Temple, Texas plant only, and are designated as follows: SELL BY JUL 01 99
E and all dates inclusive through SELL BY AUG 31 99 E. The E is the
designator of the Temple plant. The date code will be on the back of the
bag, on or below the bag closure. The company believes essentially all of
the recalled product is in Texas or the Shreveport, Louisiana area only.
There are 54 different types of dog food included in this recall, of bags
of various sizes. The brand names include some versions of Country Acres,
Dura Life, Exceed, Feedin' Time, Golden Boy, Grand Paw, Hill Country Fare,
Maxximum, Ol' Roy, PMI Nutrition, Remarkable Menu, Retriever, Slick,
Sportsman, Wendland, Winchester, and Winner Chunk Style. Doane officials
said a veterinary diagnostic laboratory has attributed the deaths of
approximately 25 dogs to aflatoxins. Aflatoxins result from a naturally
occurring mold, which at high levels can cause liver damage. The mold may
be more likely to occur in corn that has been subjected to extreme weather
conditions.
Signs:
Doane says in its release: "We are concerned that the exposure to
excessive levels of aflatoxin, over a period of several days to several
weeks, may affect the health of the pet by damaging the liver affecting its
ability to function properly (acute necrosis and cirrhosis). Acute toxic
effects can be influenced by environmental factors, exposure level and
duration of exposure, age, health, and nutritional status of diet. Usually
the first clinical signs that aflatoxin has affected the pet, are lethargy,
weakness and loss of appetite. The pet that is normally active will act
like it is lazy and unhappy and will spend a lot of time lying down. The
pet may not eat any food and may appear to lose enthusiasm for many of the
activities it once enjoyed. Upon examination the following signs may be
expressed: jaundice, hemorrhage, and impaired liver and kidney function.
The pet may vomit and may have diarrhea that may contain blood. Frequently,
concurrent low grade infectious diseases become worse due to suppression of
the immune function. [In brief: Clinical signs ... anorexia, followed by
sudden death; depression; vomiting, sometimes w/ blood; clotting problems;
jaundice; some have a bloody stool; elevated ALT/AST, esp GGT; renal
enzymes secondary Diagnosis and treatment:
Serum chemistry profile may exhibit abnormal liver enzyme values indicating
liver function has been impaired. Remove the stressor by providing a
different pet food code date than those included in the recalled product or
their current pet food manufactured after Sept. 1, 1998. The pet should be
made comfortable and kept warm. Monitoring serum chemistry with emphasis on
liver function will help to assess the status of the pet*s health, while
providing assistance in establishing a prognosis. Supportive fluid therapy
may be required to re-hydrate the pet and *rinse* the toxic substance from
the body. If the pet is being treated with medications such as
barbiturates, phenytoin, and digitalis, consideration should be given to
withdrawing those medication since liver function is impaired.
Who will pay for your clients' veterinary bills?
Doane Product Company will pay for the reasonable expense of having to test
or treat pets that became ill after consuming the recalled product. Please
encourage your clients to call our Emergency Support line that was
established to answer specific questions regarding this situation:
1-800-752-8057."
