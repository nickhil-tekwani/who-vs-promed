The checkpoint of Rosselkhoznadzor in the International Airport Bolshoye Savino Perm [Russia] has recently been instructed to intensify the inspection upon flights arriving from Armenia and Tajikistan. This, to prevent the uncontrolled imports, in carry-on luggage and in the baggage of incoming travelers, of animal products which may be contaminated by the viruses of foot-and-mouth disease (Armenia and Tajikistan) or African swine fever (Armenia).

[Perm is located in the European part of Russia near the Ural Mountains; see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perm#/media/File:Map_of_Russia_-_Perm_Krai_(2008-03).svg.

The circulation of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and African swine fever (ASF) viruses in Armenia is well known (references in 'see also').

According to Tajikistan's last semi-annual report to the OIE (covering the period January-June 2015), FMD has been absent there since 2013. Information on the current FMD situation in Tajikistan will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
