First Case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Reported in Stavropol
-------------------------------------------------------------------
STAVROPOL: This year's first case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) has been reported in South Russia's Stavropol Territory. The
Deputy Chief Doctor of the territorial Sanitary and Epidemiological
Service, Olga Balaban, told Itar-Tass today that a patient suffering
from this disease is now in the infectious diseases ward of the
Central Hospital in Novoselitsky district.
Cases of hemorraghic fever have occurred in the territory for 3 years
in succession, Balaban said. Ticks are the main carriers of the
infection. According to local specialists, this past winter with its
warm and snowless spells was conducive to a considerable increase of
the tick population. The territorial government has approved a list of
measures to block large-scale spread of the disease and to provide
funds for the disinfestation of hazardous concentrations of ticks.

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever - Russia (Dagestan)
-------------------------------------------------------
Makhachkala, 20 Apr 2001: A case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) has been registered in Dagestan, reports the city sanitary
surveillance center. A citizen of Kraynovka village, Kizlyar district,
was hospitalized with the diagnosis in the resuscitation department of
the infectious disease center of the Republic. At the present time 37
people are under medical observation because they had contact with
the patient. [Only people who have been infected by the same ticks or
in contact with the blood or body fluids of the patient would be at
risk. - Mod.JW
Simultaneously, protective epidemic measures are being carried out. On
the instructions of Gennady Onishchenko, the chief sanitary physician
of Russia, a group of specialists from the Stavropol Plague Institute
have arrived in Dagestan.

[CCHF is endemic throughout all of southern Russia. In recent years
there have been significant seasonal outbreaks in the Stavropol
region, possibly as a result of increased local survival of the tick
vector. It remains to be seen whether vector disinfestation will
control CCHF. - Mod.CP
