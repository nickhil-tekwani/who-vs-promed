The Peruvian National Agrarian Health Service, Senasa, has confirmed the discovery of fusarium wilt tropical race IV (Foc TR4) in Piura, a northwestern region. Both the PCR and [nucleotide] sequencing tests were positive. Last week, Senasa reported that "after receiving various notices of possible cases," a 0.5-hectare field was labeled suspicious [ProMED post 20210412.8301760].

The national phytosanitary emergency procedure has been trigged, placing greater emphasis on the main banana- and plantain-producing regions. Senasa has an adequate surveillance system, laboratory diagnosis and a control plan that allows it to effectively and efficiently address this fungus. They also recommend that banana and plantain producers avoid bringing plant material, including seedlings or suckers, to their plots, as well as implementing phytosanitary measures and emphasizing biosecurity.

Peru is the 2nd country in Latin America to detect TR4, after Colombia [ProMED post 20190820.6630576]. It also spells trouble for the world's biggest banana-exporting region. Ecuador -- which lies between Peru and Colombia -- and Central American countries have not yet detected the disease.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostems; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades; consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4 (TR4), as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED posts 20210105.8075029, 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

In recent years, TR4 has been reported in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The recent detection in Colombia (ProMED posts 20190820.6630576, 20190712.6564489) was the 1st confirmed report of TR4 in the Americas. TR4 is of great concern worldwide, and development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

With TR4 now confirmed in Peru, trying to trace a possible source of the incursion would be an important next step to attempt to limit or at least delay further incursions in the region. Ecuador, which shares borders with Peru's Piura region and Colombia, has issued an alert for TR4 within its territory (ProMED post 20210412.8301760). Following the earlier detection in Colombia, an alert was also issued by Costa Rica for Central America (ProMED post 20200714.7572134).
