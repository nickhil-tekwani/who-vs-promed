From: Fabio Del Piero <fdp@vet.upenn.edu>

It is unclear if [the most recent death of a patient in New York and the
preceding deaths associated with West Nile virus infection [in New York and
New Jersey have West Nile virus as a primary cause, or if West Nile virus
is a secondary infection. It would be nice if this could be clarified.
Were the patients viremic? Were seroconversions identified? Were lesions and
associated West Nile virus observed in the patient CNS following
pathological examination?
