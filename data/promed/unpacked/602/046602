Dutch patient dies from Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 virus
----------------------------------------------------
Amid concern about rising resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in
influenza A/H1N1 viruses, a Dutch team this week reported the death
of a leukemia patient who was infected with an H1N1 virus that was
resistant to the antiviral drug. In a letter in this week's New
England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) [week of 31 Aug 2008], the Dutch
authors said the case suggests that oseltamivir-resistant H1N1
viruses can cause disease, despite evidence from animal studies that
the resistance mutation makes the viruses much less dangerous. The
letter said the man's virus was also resistant to amantadine, an
older antiviral drug.

On 20 Aug 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 31
percent of influenza A/H1N1 isolates from 16 countries that conducted
recent tests carried the H274Y mutation, which confers resistance to
oseltamivir. Resistance levels ranged from 100 percent (10 of 10
isolates) in Australia to 13 percent (4 of 32 isolates) in Chile.

Emergence of the oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 virus was first noted in
Norway in January, and since then researchers have found the virus in
35 countries, including the United States and Canada.

The spread of the oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 virus has puzzled
experts because it has not been clearly linked to treatment with the
drug. In the case report, authors from Erasmus University Medical
Center in Rotterdam wrote that a 67-year-old man who was on
chemotherapy in a 3-year battle with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was
hospitalized with shortness of breath, a dry cough, and fever. On his
2nd hospital day, he experienced acute respiratory failure, and his
physicians placed him on a ventilator and started empirical
antibiotic treatment.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed that the patient had patchy lung
infiltrates, and tests on samples from his respiratory tract showed
he had influenza A/H1N1. On the 6h hospital day the man received
oseltamivir, but by day 13 physicians discontinued the drug because
sequence analysis of the virus revealed the H274Y mutation and there
was no decrease in the viral load. The authors reported that the
mutation was found in samples obtained before the patient began
oseltamivir therapy. The man's family and the hospital record
revealed that he had had no contact with patients who were taking oseltamivir.

On the 15th hospital day the man's doctors prescribed amantadine, and
after a few days his neutrophil count increased, a sign of bone
marrow recovery, the group reported.

On day 20 doctors took the patient off the ventilator and instituted
zanamivir treatment. However, 2 days later the man had respiratory
failure again, and his medical team put him back on the ventilator
and discontinued zanamivir therapy. (Like osteltamivir, zanamivir is
a neuramnidase inhibitor, but no increase in zanamivir resistance has
been reported recently.)

By day 26 physicians detected no influenza virus, but did note that
sequence analysis showed an amantadine-resistance mutation in the
viral M2 protein (L26F). They wrote that recovery of the immune
system was probably responsible for clearing the virus, because the
patient had received only 3 doses of zanamivir.

A repeat CT scan taken on day 28 showed that pulmonary infiltrates
had progressed. Because of the man's poor prognosis, the ventilator
was removed on day 34, and he died 3 days later.

The authors cited animal studies indicating that oseltamivir
resistance leaves H1N1 viruses "severely compromised." Despite these
reports, they wrote, "the case we describe suggests that this
oseltamivir-resistant virus can be pathogenic, at least in an
immunocompromised patient."

In an editorial published by Eurosurveillance in January 2008,
authorities said resistant viruses with the H274Y mutation had been
seen in previous flu seasons but were rare and did not spread easily.
But the more recent H1N1 isolates with the mutation were "fitter" and
were spreading in the community, they wrote.
