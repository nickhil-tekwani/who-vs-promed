A viral pathogen that typically infects plants has been found in honeybees and could help explain their decline. Researchers working in the US and Beijing, China report their findings in mBio, the online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

The routine screening of bees for frequent and rare viruses "resulted in the serendipitous detection of _Tobacco ringspot virus_, or TRSV, and prompted an investigation into whether this plant-infecting virus could also cause systemic infection in the bees," says Yan Ping Chen from the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, an author on the study.

"The results of our study provide the 1st evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen can also be infected and that the infection becomes widespread in their bodies," says lead author Ji Lian Li, at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science in Beijing.

"We already know that honeybees, _Apis mellifera_, can transmit TRSV when they move from flower to flower, likely spreading the virus from one plant to another," Chen adds.

Notably, about 5 percent of known plant viruses are pollen-transmitted and thus potential sources of host-jumping viruses. RNA viruses tend to be particularly dangerous because they lack the 3'-5' proofreading function which edits out errors in replicated genomes. As a result, viruses such as TRSV generate a flood of variant copies with differing infective properties.

One consequence of such high replication rates are populations of RNA viruses thought to exist as "quasispecies," clouds of genetically related variants that appear to work together to determine the pathology of their hosts. These sources of genetic diversity, coupled with large population sizes, further facilitate the adaption of RNA viruses to new selective conditions such as those imposed by novel hosts. "Thus, RNA viruses are a likely source of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases," explain these researchers.

Toxic viral cocktails appear to have a strong link with honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD), a mysterious malady that abruptly wiped out entire hives across the United States and was first reported in 2006. Israel acute paralysis virus (IAPV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), chronic paralysis virus (CPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), deformed wing bee virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and sacbrood virus (SBV) are other known causes of honeybee viral disease.

When these researchers investigated bee colonies classified as "strong" or "weak," TRSV and other viruses were more common in the weak colonies than they were in the strong ones. Bee populations with high levels of multiple viral infections began failing in late fall and perished before February, these researchers report. In contrast, those in colonies with fewer viral assaults survived the entire cold winter months.

TRSV was also detected inside the bodies of _Varroa_ mites, a "vampire" parasite that transmits viruses between bees while feeding on their blood. However, unlike honeybees, the mite-associated TRSV was restricted to their gastric cecum indicating that the mites likely facilitate the horizontal spread of TRSV within the hive without becoming diseased themselves. The fact that infected queens lay infected eggs convinced these scientists that TRSV could also be transmitted vertically from the queen mother to her offspring.

"The increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses is associated with a gradual decline of host populations and supports the view that viral infections have a significant negative impact on colony survival," these researchers conclude. Thus, they call for increased surveillance of potential host-jumping events as an integrated part of insect pollinator management programs.

[An interesting discovery that on the surface sounds reasonable. If this is the case, perhaps a mechanism can be found to prevent this from happening.

On the other hand, if this virus is common, why hasn't it happened a long time prior to the 1st syndrome of colony collapse disorder? Or is it the case that it had to reach a certain magnitude before we recognized what it was doing to colonies? - Mod.TG

The results described in the original paper are interesting, but they do not adequately support the conclusions drawn by the authors. Equally, the claim in the media report above, "A viral pathogen that typically infects plants has been found in honeybees" is incorrect. Some of the main reasons are listed below.

1. The published results do not prove the presence of a virus in the bees, that is, that there are virus particles associated with the unidentified sequences or that these are encapsidated in any way. Particles shown in electron micrographs in the paper could be the bee viruses or from other sources. Bee-to-bee transmission has not been shown, but infectivity would be a key criterion for a virus.

2. If there is indeed a virus, the results do not show that it is a plant virus, that is, the authors have not checked whether the bee isolate is pathogenic on any plant indicators.

3. If there is indeed a plant virus, there is no proof that it is TRSV (_Tobacco ringspot virus_). Only a partial sequence is available and the authors do not seem to have checked their local plant populations for what viruses are there. TRSV isolates from other areas as found in GenBank say nothing about their local strains. For viruses, a sequence identity of at least 80 percent over the total genome is required to say that 2 isolates are the same species. The results do not show this and so the published phylogeny is flawed.

4. Without knowing what virus strains are present in the local plant hosts, the question must be considered if the results are not due to contamination with virus forms from local pollen. There are no adequate controls for virus sequences in bees without any pollen or in local pollen without bees.

5. TRSV and the 3 bee viruses reported in co-infection are in the same taxonomic order (_Picornavirales_; ss +sense RNA genome and -sense replicative forms), and the bee isolate has not been found on its own. The possibility cannot be excluded that replicative viral forms found in the bees are artifacts due to the presence of the other bee viruses with the same replication mechanism, since results are based only on PCR analysis of partial sequences.

6. Considering everything, what the authors have found could well be a new virus related to TRSV, but affecting bees and not plants, similar to a new aphid virus (_Acyrthosiphon pisum virus_) of as yet unclassified taxonomic family, but related to the families of both TRSV and the 3 bee viruses.

7. If the authors have indeed found a new bee virus, more work would be needed to determine its relationship with other members of the _Picornavirales_, including both insect and plant pathogens, and ascertain whether it contributes, let alone causes, colony collapse, and not just co-infects bees which are already affected by bee viruses as a secondary or opportunistic pathogen.

In summary, the results indicate the presence of sequences in the bees with partial homology to some known viral sequences, but do not prove the presence of any kind of virus. - Mod.DHA]
