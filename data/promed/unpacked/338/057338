CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER, PORCINE - ISRAEL: (HAZAFON), FIRST CASE, OIE CORRECTION

This report reads:

"Affected population: The population of the pigs in the farm is
divided into 2 premises 70 miles from each other."

The original OIE report states "70m" or meters, misinterpreted on
editing as miles. ProMED regrets the error.
