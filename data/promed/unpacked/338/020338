[ProMED-mail received a report from the media entitled "Deadly Rat
Bacterium Strikes North Queensland". Not very imaginative. "Alien
organism from outer space" would have been more alarmist and sold more
newspapers. In any event, the article was poorly written, confusing (same
thing), and inaccurate, besides the fact that this is old news. Just to
check what we might have considered posting on ProMED-mail, we contacted
Dr. Lee Smythe, Supervising Scientist, WHO/FAO Collaborating Centre for
Reference and Research on Leptospirosis, Western Pacific Region, Brisbane,
Queensland, and asked his to comment. His comments are below. This is not
a report of an outbreak, but Lee's comments provide a useful and complete
up-date. With it, this particular string is reopened and closed
simultaneously. - Mod.CHC

The media reports on the cases are not timely as the outbreak began in
January 1999 and was essential finished by June 1999, with cases quickly
decreasing to date. I placed a ProMED-mail article at the time [see above
archived postings - Mod.CHC to mark the outbreak. In total, to the end of
June 99 there were 180 cases notified and to date we have 215 cases
notified for Queensland. For each notified case my reference laboratory
sends out a questionnaire (with a 99% return rate) to the patients'
clinician, seeking substantial epidemiological information. Through this
avenue (for the outbreak period) we found a hospitalisation rate of approx
50% and average stay of 5 days. For the year to date in Queensland
(obviously biased by the outbreak numbers) we have a reported
hospitalisation rate of about 52%.
We have seen the cases (notified) rise from 61 for 1997, to 108 for 1998
and to 215 for 1999 for the State- but again also affected by the outbreak
numbers. In Australia we effectively have 18 different strains of
leptospirosis isolated from man or animals. We are doing ongoing research
to identify carrier species and the impact of disease in humans, especially
where there is a region with high incidence or noted increasing incidence.
Hence, the comment by the media re: the different strains should be taken
in this context not as new emerging strains, [although there may be
changes in the species carrying the different serovars/types.
We need to remain aware of the disease and the potential for outbreaks
supported by higher rainfalls, flooding and increasing rodent numbers as
occurred earlier this year in North Queensland.
I hope this clarifies the issue - again the reports should have represented
the fact that most of these cases related to an outbreak much earlier in
the year.
