For the 3rd time since December 2015, a cow in Perth County has tested positive for rabies.

According to the Perth District Health Unit, the latest case involves a calf from the Gowanstown area, north of Listowel.

A cow south of Listowel in the former Elma Township tested positive for the disease last November [2016]. It was also found in a calf and a skunk in the Ellice area south of Milverton.

Public health authorities believe the calf likely contracted the virus by coming into contact with a wild animal that was already carrying rabies.

The health unit says that anyone whose livestock pets have had contact with a wild animal should contact a veterinarian.

As of [Wed 30 Nov 2016], there had been 275 confirmed cases of rabies in Ontario, with the vast majority being in Hamilton and its surrounding area.

A total of 3 people are being treated for potential exposure to rabies after coming in contact with a rabid cat in the Glanbrook area. 2 are from Haldimand while the 3rd is from Hamilton.

An orange tabby was noticed wandering at large in the area of Glanbrook from 22 Jan to 30 Jan 2017. The cat came in contact with a number of people across a large area before it was found dead [Wed 1 Feb 2017]. A test for rabies came back positive.

"There has been some contact and some people are being treated," Marlene Miranda, Haldimand and Norfolk's general manager of health and social services, said this week.

This is the 2nd time in recent months that people in the Caledonia area have been treated for rabies. A rabid feral cat was confirmed there last August [2016]. An individual was bitten and underwent treatment to prevent the fatal illness.

"It is an unfortunate reminder that rabies can be easily transmitted to our feline friends," Dr Malcolm Lock, Haldimand and Norfolk's acting Medical Officer of Health, said in a news release. "We encourage pet owners to make sure their animal's rabies vaccination status is up to date."

Health officials and the Ministry of Natural Resources blame the problem on a resurgence of rabies in Ontario wildlife. For many years, rabies in Ontario was confined to the occasional sick bat.

However, rabies that established itself in the raccoon population in upstate New York [USA] about 20 years ago has finally made its way across the border. Since December of 2015, 187 raccoons and 85 skunks have tested positive in Ontario for rabies.

Raccoons and skunks have adapted to life in both rural and urban settings. The local health unit offers the following tips for minimizing risk of exposure to any diseases or parasites they might have:
- keep away from unfamiliar animals or any animal behaving strangely;
- stay away from wild animals and do not feed them;
- supervise children when they are around animals;
- prevent pets from coming in contact with wildlife;
- do not let pets roam free out of doors;
- feed pets indoors. Feeding pets outside will attract unwanted animals;
- properly secure lids on exterior garbage containers.

Members of the public who wish to report wild animals behaving strangely can do so by calling the MNR's [Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry] rabies information line at 1-888-574-6656. Police should be notified if wild animals are acting aggressively toward humans.

Anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal is encouraged to contact the local health unit at 519-426-6170. Pets who come in contact with wild animals should be examined by a veterinarian.

[3] New Jersey: coyote, canine, human exposure

http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2017/01/coyote_that_attacked_man_walking_dogs_had_rabies_a.html


The coyote that attacked a man walking his dogs on the Columbia Trail [Wed 11 Jan 2017] morning had rabies, authorities said.

Detective Paul Williams with the Morris County Park Police Department received confirmation from state officials on [Fri 13 Jan 2017] the coyote was infected by the disease.

Williams previously told NJ Advance Media a 66-year-old Belvidere man was attacked by the rabid coyote when the animal appeared on the trail and began to attack one of his dogs.

The man, who was with his sister and another adult at the time of the attack, then intervened in the fight and the coyote bit him on his back, buttocks and right calf, Williams said.

The man was able to fight back with a stick and incapacitate the animal before county park police officers arrived on the scene. The arriving officers later shot the injured coyote and sent the animal to the state for rabies testing.

Williams said the attack is believed to be an isolated incident.

The trail remains open to the public, but Williams advised hikers to take universal precautions while on the trail such as carrying a cell phone and only using a 6-foot leash while walking dogs.

The Belvidere man's injuries were relatively minor and he opted to take himself to a local hospital for treatment, Williams said.

There have been a handful of rabid coyote attacks in the Garden State [New Jersey] in recent years.

A Viet Nam veteran killed a rabid coyote that attacked him while he was hunting in Chester Township [Morris County] in [October 2014]. The veteran previously told NJ Advance Media he was "really happy I'm the last guy (the coyote) met."

In April 2015, 2 coyote attacks were reported in Norwood [Bergen County] before the animal was killed. Later that year [2015], a 53-year-old man needed stitches after he was attacked while walking his dog in Manchester [Ocean County].

The Garden State holds a special permit season from 1 January to 15 March of most years for hunters who wish to hunt coyote or fox.

[4] Arizona: bob cat, human exposure

http://www.dcourier.com/news/2017/jan/14/bobcat-put-down-after-attacking-four-people-sedona/


A bobcat attacked 4 people in separate incidents in the Sedona area [straddling the county line between Coconino and Yavapai counties] on [Thu 12 Jan 2017] according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD). The attacks occurred about 2.5 miles [4 km] from each other.

The initial attack took place around 8:30 a.m. when a man heard some noise coming from underneath his truck, AGFD spokeswoman Shelly Shepherd said.

As he bent down to see what was making the noise, a bobcat sprung out, scratching and biting both of his arms before running off. After receiving notice of the attack, AGFD and local law enforcement officers attempted to locate the animal. At 2 p.m., they were alerted that 3 staff members at Los Abrigados Resort and Spa were attacked by a bobcat. "All I heard were scratches from that incident; no bites," Shepherd said.

The bobcat was subsequently located, lethally removed and transported to the Arizona State Health Laboratory for a standard necropsy and rabies testing. Positive rabies results were reported late [Fri 13 Jan 2017]. Those who believe they or their pets may have been exposed to a bobcat recently in the general area surrounding the resort, located at 160 Portal Lane, Sedona, are encouraged to contact the Arizona Game and Fish Department at 623-236-7201 or Yavapai County Community Health Services at 928-442-5509.

The public is advised to avoid wildlife exhibiting unusual wildlife behaviors which can include showing no fear of humans; aggressive behavior; staggering and/or acting sickly; and nocturnal mammals active during daytime.

Rabies is an infectious disease affecting the nervous system of humans and other mammals, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. People and unvaccinated animals may get rabies from the bite of an infected animal, or if saliva from the animal gets directly into a person's or animal's eyes, nose, mouth or any break in the skin. Rabies vaccine is given to individuals after exposure to an infected animal to prevent the disease. Rabies is nearly always fatal if not treated after exposure resulting in an infection.

Authorities said a bobcat that jumped on a woman and scratched 2 other women trying to help her, in Connecticut, has been shot and killed. The attack happened [Tue 17 Jan 2017] in a greenhouse in Colchester [New London County]. The 3 women were treated at a medical center.

The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said it's rare for bobcats to attack people, but when they do, rabies is often the cause.

The bobcat was taken to the state health lab for a rabies test. The greenhouse is on the property of The Caring Community, a social service provider for residential and day programs.

http://wspa.com/2017/01/27/stray-cat-with-rabies-exposes-person-to-rabies-in-oconee-co/


One person may have been exposed to rabies by a stray cat in Oconee County. Health officials say the person was bitten on [Sun 22 Jan 2017] after the cat appeared at their home in the Westminster area.

Testing by the SC [South Carolina] Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) showed the cat was positive for rabies on [Wed 25 Jan 2017]. The person who was bitten has started post-exposure treatment.

DHEC tells people to contact animal control if they see animals in need.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend giving wild and stray animals their space," Sandra Craig said in a statement. Craig is with DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services.

"Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body of a healthy person or animal. Exposure can occur through a bite, scratch or contact with infected saliva to open wounds or mucous membranes such as the eyes, nose or mouth," Craig said.

Every year, hundreds of people in South Carolina undergo preventive treatment for rabies after they are exposed to animals that have or suspected of having rabies, according to DHEC.

There have been 5 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year [2017].

The cat is the 1st animal in Oconee County to test positive for rabies in 2017.

In 2016, 3 of the 94 rabies cases in South Carolina were in Oconee County

Rabies does not always manifest itself as a furious animal foaming at the mouth. The dumb kind of rabies results in a quiet, withdrawn animal. This behavior is usually out of the ordinary. An animal that is normally active and runs away may be sitting quietly awaiting a friendly pat on the head. So, any behavior out of the ordinary for any animal should raise concern.

Your pets should be vaccinated regularly. Rabies vaccines are good for either 1 or 3 years depending on the type of vaccine used and the age of the small animal. Rabies is a 1 year vaccine in large animals. If you have horses or show cattle or goats or sheep, it is important to vaccinate them as well. Farm animals are just as capable of coming into contact with another rabid animal and then attacking their owner because they acquired the disease. When large animals such as horses or cattle become rabid, they may attack their human handlers, and the consequences can be quite bad.

While technically there are no rabies vaccines licensed for goats, most veterinarians use the one approved for sheep and it appears to be working quite well. Goats can and do get rabies. Hopefully one of the companies will realize the gap and get an amendment to the label to include goats.

Some of these communities need to have some help to understand the strain of rabies they are dealing with, the likely reservoir, and to what other animals it has spilled into. Oral rabies vaccination, dropped form a plane usually, is very effective at reducing the rabies in areas where this has been done.

None of the articles above mention whether these communities suggested or are having a rabies drive to ensure pets are vaccinated, or indicated that they had public service announcements regarding the seriousness of rabies and where to get an animal vaccinated.

Vaccine clinics for large animals are just as important, especially if it is a show animal that someone is handling on a regular basis. I have long advocated vaccinating cattle, horses, and other farm animals. The cost is minimal considering the possible consequences of a large animal getting rabies and injuring someone, or even causing death.

If you have been bitten by an animal, get medical treatment. Post exposure prophylaxis needs to be given within a limited time from the bite. - Mod.TG]

[7] Belize: bovine, vampire bat

https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/02/02/belize-confirms-cases-bovarian-rabies/


Yesterday [1 Feb 2017] the Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) announced that bovine rabies has been confirmed in 3 districts in Belize: Orange Walk, Cayo, and Toledo.

Bovine rabies is a specific type of rabies that affects cattle; however, it can be transmitted to humans and as a result, farmers are advised by BAHA to vaccinate their livestock as well as sheep, cattle and horses.

Bovine rabies is a fatal disease that can be prevented through vaccination of animals.

Affected animals will show aggressive behavior and may salivate more than normal.

If [bovine] rabies is suspected in your district, please contact BAHA immediately at phone number 822-0818.

[Rabies is a viral infection caused by viruses belonging to the Lyssavirus genus. It is a zoonosis -- an animal disease that can spread to humans -- transmitted through saliva from bites, and even scratches of infected animals.

In Belize, as urban rabies is well controlled, most cases of rabies occur as bovine paralytic rabies transmitted by the vampire bat. Rabies in cattle has been reported in all 6 districts. According to the OIE vaccinating 70 percent of dogs allows rabies to be eradicated from a given endemic area.

Generally in Belize the rabies is of vampire bat origin. Cases of human rabies, including deaths, have been reported in Belize. There, several strains of the rabid virus circulate in the vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_.

The hairy-legged vampire bat, _Diphylla ecaudata_, is naturally infected by rabies virus (same variant as one infecting _D. rotundus_), so this vampire species is definitely a source for rabies cases in humans.

This vampire species ranges from Southern Tamaulipas (Mexico) to Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Belize, and Brazil (except the central Amazon basin); a single vagrant individual has also been reported from Southern Texas, USA. (For a picture go to https://naturalhistory.si.edu/mna/images/images/831032911523015.jpg).

Predators and parasites can be plastic when it comes to selecting their preys/hosts, and this confers to them the ability to adapt to environmental changes, and a phenomenon of special interest for public health, as it is associated with the link between human-driven change and emerging diseases.

Notifications of suspect rabies cases are investigated by BAHA, the MoH and the Ministry of Agriculture (MNRA) at no cost to the animal owner. A history of the animal determines the steps to be taken, I.e., whether it is isolated and kept for observation or euthanatized and the brain sent to the veterinary services laboratory in Panama. The MoH will determine human exposure to the virus. If warranted (bite, scratch, saliva) a post exposure regimen will be initiated which consists of 5 vaccines. Laboratory-confirmed cases in cattle trigger control response which includes vaccination of herd, vaccination of susceptible animals in protection zone and vampire bat control at farm and roosts (caves).

If you believe your animal, regardless of whether it is bovine, dog or other animal has rabies or is acting differently than normal, please call your veterinarian. Remember that thinking a bovine is choking and putting your hand in the mouth to remove the blockage may expose you to rabies.
