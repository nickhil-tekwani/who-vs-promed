Piggery in lockdown for suspect swine flu
-----------------------------------------
A Queensland piggery is in lockdown because of a possible swine flu
outbreak, with pigs testing positive for influenza A.

Tests are underway to confirm infection of influenza A (H1N1) --
pandemic human swine flu --, which is suspected at the quarantined
piggery. Authorities won't reveal the name of the piggery, only that
it is near Dalby, west of Brisbane.

Biosecurity Queensland chief vet Dr Ron Glanville said swabs and
blood samples were taken from pigs yesterday [24 Aug 2009] after a
vet reported a large number of pigs in a shed of 450 were showing
flu-like symptoms.

"Biosecurity officers have placed the piggery under quarantine and
are implementing strict on-site biosecurity measures," Dr Glanville
said. "This comes after positive tests for influenza A were delivered
to us late last night [24 Aug 2009]."

Officials say no pigs had recently left the property.

Results of the swine flu tests are expected in the next couple of
days but Dr Glanville suspects the animals will test positive to the
same strain affecting humans.

"The infection should be self-limiting within the piggery and the
response is designed to allow the disease to burn out as quickly as
possible," he said.

Australian Pork Limited chief executive Andrew Spencer said it was
important for people to remember there is no chance of the virus
infecting meat.

"We have a situation where there are hundreds of thousands of
Australians walking around spreading these flu viruses around, so the
expectation that we are not going to suffer in the pig industry is a
little over-optimistic," Mr Spencer said.

"A number of piggeries are starting to become affected by this virus
and that's an issue we need to deal with on those piggeries and to
again clean up the health status of those piggeries and get rid of
the disease."

[Cases] of swine flu were detected at a piggery in northern Victoria
last week [19 Aug 2009] and in New South Wales in July [2009].

The initial outbreak of swine flu in April this year [2009] had a
severe impact upon sales of pork, which had since been restored, Mr
Spencer said.

[This particular strain of influenza A (H1N1) has been allowed to
burn itself out in swine operations in Canada and in New South Wales
(Australia). These cases have not resulted in any dead swine, thus
far.

Both Canada and Australia have repeatedly stressed it does not affect
the meat. Evidence would indicate this is a correct statement. -
