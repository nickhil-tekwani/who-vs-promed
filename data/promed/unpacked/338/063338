Public health notice: outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to snakes and rodents
---------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections occurring in 6 provinces. The outbreak is ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to both snakes and rodents has been identified as the likely source of the outbreak. Many of the individuals who became sick reported having direct or indirect contact with snakes, pet rats, and feeder rodents (used as reptile food) before their illnesses occurred. The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that other sources could be identified.

In an effort to prevent further illnesses, Canadians are advised to practise good hand hygiene, frequent handwashing, and safe handling of snakes and rodents, their food, and their environments. This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Both reptiles and rodents can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even though they appear healthy and clean and show no signs of illness. Even having indirect contact with these animals or their environments can put you at risk for developing a _Salmonella_ infection. For example, children playing in a room where a reptile was previously allowed to roam can be at risk of an infection.

Investigation summary
-------------------
As of 10 Dec 2019, there are 92 confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium illness in the following provinces: British Columbia (4), Ontario (16), Quebec (52), New Brunswick (9), Nova Scotia (5), and Newfoundland and Labrador (6). Individuals became sick between April 2017 and October 2019. Six individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 0 and 88 years of age. The majority of cases (57%) are female.

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated this fall because of an increase in reports of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium illnesses in multiple jurisdictions across Canada. Cases have continued to be reported since the investigation was initiated. Through the use of a laboratory method called whole-genome sequencing, some _Salmonella_ Typhimurium illnesses dating back to 2017 and 2018 were identified to have the same genetic strain as the illnesses that occurred in 2019.

In Canada, _Salmonella_ Typhimurium is a common strain with an average of 750 cases reported per year to the Public Health Agency of Canada. There have been past outbreaks of _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to snakes and rodents, and the findings from these investigations have highlighted the important role snake and rodent owners can play in preventing new illnesses linked to these types of pets.

Who is most at risk
------------------
Anyone can become sick with a _Salmonella_ infection, but children aged 5 years and under, older adults, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for contracting serious illness. Most people who become ill from a _Salmonella_ infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

What you should do to protect your health
-----------------------------
Following these simple steps will help to reduce your risk of becoming ill from contact with reptiles, rodents, and their environments.

- Always wash your hands immediately after touching a reptile or rodent and anything they eat, or after being in the area where they live, play, or touch.
- Regularly clean any surfaces or objects your reptile or rodent touches with soapy water followed by a household sanitizer.
- Never kiss a pet rodent or reptile.
- Do not keep reptiles or rodents in homes, daycare centres, schools, or other facilities with children aged 5 years and under.
- Always supervise children when they touch or play with reptiles or rodents. Do not let them put reptiles and rodents or their supplies near their face or share their food or drinks with pets. Make sure they thoroughly wash their hands after touching reptiles or rodents.
- Do not clean or bathe reptiles and rodents in the kitchen sink or in bathroom sinks or bathtubs.
- Do not keep food used for reptiles or rodents in the kitchen or any room where people eat or drink.
- Keep reptiles and rodents and all their food, containers, and toys away from the kitchen and other places where food is made or eaten.
- Do not keep frozen rodents in the same fridge or freezer as human food. Freezing rodents does not kill _Salmonella_.
- Always defrost and prepare frozen rodents outside the kitchen, using dedicated utensils and containers.
- Be aware of the specific needs of your reptile. Stress for a reptile can increase shedding of _Salmonella_.
- Always keep reptiles and live rodents in habitats specifically designed for them.
- If you choose to have a reptile or rodent in your home, talk to your healthcare provider or veterinarian about the right reptile or rodent for your family, especially if your family includes children, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, or adults 65 years of age and over.

The government of Canada will continue to update Canadians if new information related to these investigations becomes available.
