[1] Measles in the Americas

Measles is brought back by unvaccinated travelers who get infected during a trip. Measles remains a common and serious disease in many parts of the world. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting infected when they travel internationally, and protection from measles is just one measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination away.

In the USA, most of the measles cases result from international travel. Measles is brought back by unvaccinated people who get infected during a trip. Upon returning home, they often spread measles to others.

In the USA, as of 16 Jun 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 93 people from 19 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles.

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that is spread through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Although severe cases are rare, measles can cause swelling of the brain and even death, says the CDC.

Additionally, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported in mid-July 2018 that 2472 cases of measles had been confirmed in 11 countries in the Americas.

The PAHO said Brazil has reported 677 measles cases in 6 states, with 65.6% percent of the cases near the Amazonas state. PAHO said the outbreak in Amazonas is expected to increase, as up to 80% of suspected cases have not yet been tested.

Almost all cases in Amazonas are genetically identical to the cases in the Venezuelan outbreak. Venezuela has recorded 1613 cases and 44 deaths in 2018.

When visiting a country that requires measles immunization for entry, acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity against measles includes at least one of the following:

- written documentation of adequate vaccination,
- laboratory evidence of immunity,
- laboratory confirmation of measles, or
- birth in the United States before 1957.

Before you leave on an international trip, check the CDC Travel Notices on measles. International travelers can easily request a vaccination appointment with a pharmacy at Vax-Before-Travel.

The CDC Vaccine Price List provides the private sector vaccine prices for general information, and vaccine discounts can be found here.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the FDA or CDC.

The 2 cases of measles detected in children in Argentina are of a disease strain "identical to that circulating in other countries of the Americas," according to the National Ministry of Health.

The studies were performed at the Malbrán Institute and indicated that the cases (detected in a 5-month-old baby and a 6-year-old child) have "a common origin," according to preliminary data.

It was officially determined that, according to Malbrán data, "the genotype found in one of the cases is D8 lineage Mvi / Hulu Langat.MYS / 26.11, identical to the strain circulating in other countries in the region."

"So far in 2018, 54 samples have been conclusively matched to the strain identified in the City of Buenos Aires and the reference strain Mvi / Hulu Langat .MYS / 26.11 D8. D," added the health authorities through a statement.

A recent report by the Pan American Health Organization established that this strain is the same one identified in 2017 in Venezuela, a country that is experiencing a serious outbreak of the disease.

While epidemiological studies to determine how the children contracted the virus are underway, the National Ministry of Health issued an alert urging health officials to verify the vaccination status of the population and intensify epidemiological surveillance of vulnerable areas to avoid the reintroduction of the disease.

For her part, Angela Gentile, president of the National Commission for the Elimination of Measles, Rubella and Congenital Rubella in Argentina, reiterated that "the 2 cases are related to each other, which is to say that they probably have a common source."

But according to the specialist, the source of infection "is different from the case of the child that was detected last March [2018]. Since it is a different strain from the one detected in March 2018, we know that the circulation is not endemic."

In Argentina, the vaccine against measles is mandatory, and the national vaccination schedule includes the 1st dose at 12 months (and is repeated at school entry age).

Thus, children aged 12 months-4 years must receive one dose of the trivalent vaccine (measles-mumps-rubella), and those older than 5 must have had 2 doses.

Those born before 1965 do not need to be vaccinated because they are considered protected because they have been in contact with the virus.

"It is important for people to know that the vaccination has a 10% primary failure rate, meaning that if we vaccinate 100 children, there will be 10 who must receive a 2nd dose in order to be protected," Gentile said.

"Adults should also have 2 doses of the vaccine," he added. The last endemic case of measles in Argentina was recorded in 2000.

"Since then, a total of 32 cases have been imported or related to imported carriers. The most recent occurred in the City of Buenos Aires in the epidemiological week 13 (April 2018) of the current year, of which 2 were imported and one related to an imported carrier," they added.

[3] Argentina (Buenos Aires)

The Ministry of Health confirmed that a baby of 10 months is the 3rd case of autochthonous measles between the city and the province of Buenos Aires so far this month [July 2018] and 4th during 2018. The cases of a baby of 5 months and a 6-month-old girl reported last week now join the 10-month-old baby who lives in the Buenos Aires town of Quilmes.

This outbreak of the disease puts the health authorities on alert, since the last case of endemic measles was registered in the year 2000. In March of this year [2018], the 1st case was confirmed, in an 8-month-old girl.

The last case "was detected in the epidemiological investigation of the 1st 2 cases, with symptoms beginning at the end of June 2018," reported the team conducted by Adolfo Rubinstein.

"The 3 cases presented compatible symptoms (fever, rash, cough and conjunctivitis) and were confirmed by serology (positive IgM in serum) and viral genome detection by PCR," says the latest epidemiological bulletin released by the government.

In all, the same genotype and lineage were identified: D8 Hulu Langat [see post above], indicated the health authorities, which remarked that "the 3 children recovered favorably." In addition, they emphasized that "control actions focused in the corresponding areas continue, and research is underway to determine the source of infection."

According to reports, after a meeting with the commission of measles experts called by the Ministry of Health, it was decided to launch a new health alert and intensify the epidemiological surveillance of the disease in case of detection in both jurisdictions.

"It is important to remember that measles is very contagious; it is contagious 4 days before and 4 days after the beginning of the eruption, so when a family visits a hospital or health center, mechanisms must be put in place so that they do not have long hours of waiting, but you can quickly identify it, and they can be treated in a separate place depending on each institution," said Angela Gentile, who chairs the National Commission for the Elimination of Measles, Rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the country.

During the meeting, the commission of experts gave new recommendations to the Minister of Health of the Nation, Adolfo Rubinstein, and to his peers from the City, Ana Bou Pérez, and from the Province, Andrés Scarsi. They include:

Strengthen epidemiological surveillance.
Intensify vaccination actions.
Establish a mechanism for rapid classification (of patients according to suspicious symptoms) in the guards of hospitals and private health centers in the city and province of Buenos Aires.
Maintain the start of the campaign to reinforce the vaccination against measles and rubella for next October [2018].

Two more cases of measles have been confirmed in Michigan.

According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), both cases are related to international travel and impact residents of Oakland and Washtenaw counties.

Including the 2 recent cases, this makes 4 cases of measles so far this year [2018] in Michigan that are the result of exposure outside the country.

One of the ill individuals arrived on 18 Jul 2018 at 11:59 p.m. at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) at the international arrivals area of the North Terminal and did not advise officials of being ill but was considered contagious at the time.

Health officials are in the process of contacting potentially exposed passengers from the flight. Limited exposure to others at DTW may have occurred as this individual exited the international baggage claim.

The 2nd person was not contagious during their flight or while at DTW.

Individuals who may have been exposed at DTW should watch for symptoms consistent with measles for 21 days after the possible exposure. If symptoms appear, contact your health care provider promptly.

Measles is a rare disease in the United States as a result of inclusion of the measles vaccine in routine childhood immunization since the 1960s. However, measles continues to be common in other countries.

The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) on Fri [27 Jul 2018] alerted the public of a potential measles exposure at 2 Boston locations, after receiving notification of a confirmed case of measles.

Anyone who visited the following locations during the specified dates and times could become ill between 26 Jul and 10 Aug 2018: [see URL for locations, including Logan airport, and times].

BPHC recommends monitoring for symptoms and contacting their health care provider.

BPHC is working with other health officials on this case and monitoring for potential exposures. BPHC has also reached out to Boston residents to increase awareness about risk of exposure and encourage people who were potentially exposed to call their health care provider by phone for further instructions.

http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/16383139.parents-urged-to-get-children-vaccinated-after-measles-outbreak/


As schools break up for the holidays, parents in Dorset have been warned to make sure their children's vaccinations are up to date following outbreaks of measles in Europe.

Cases in the UK have also rocketed this year [2018], as figures show parents are still not taking hundreds of young children for their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines. It means the area is falling below the vaccination level the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says is required to prevent outbreaks of measles.

The most recent figures show that, in the 2016-17 financial year, 93% of children in Dorset turning 5 had received the recommended 2 MMR jabs. It means that an estimated 250 5-year-olds in the area had not been vaccinated.

The ECDC warns that areas in which fewer than 95% of the population are vaccinated are at a heightened risk of a measles outbreak. But only 4 countries in the EU have hit this target, with the UK among those falling short.

Across the South West, just 90% of children had received both MMR jabs by the age of 5 in 2016-17.

In the UK, 757 cases of measles have been reported so far this year [2018], nearly triple the 274 cases reported in the whole of 2017.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has also advised teenagers who missed their jabs in the late 1990s to ensure they are up to date before travelling. Many missed the course of vaccination following discredited scare stories over links between the vaccine and developing autism.

While local figures are not available, NHS numbers show that by 2005-06, over a quarter of 5-year-olds in England were not receiving both MMR jabs.

Following significant outbreaks in France, Italy, Greece and Romania, the RCN's Helen Donovan said the threat posed by measles should not be underestimated.

She said: "Measles is extremely infectious, especially where large crowds of people gather, such as at festivals or in towns. Thanks to vaccination, it has become increasingly rare in the UK, but recent increases in infection rates show we can't be complacent."

Ms Donovan also urged people to ensure their vaccinations are up to date by contacting their GP.

She added: "The MMR vaccine is free. Getting immunised is quick and simple; an appointment with your practice nurse will only take a few minutes."

In the UK, babies are usually given the 1st MMR jab within a month of their 1st birthday as part of their routine vaccination schedule. The 2nd is usually given after they turn 3.

Children up to the age of 18 who missed their jabs are still eligible to receive them free on the NHS, as are certain vulnerable adults, including pregnant women.
