Rabbit disease found among Feilding pets
----------------------------------------
During the last 2 weeks, at least 8 domestic rabbits have died
unexpectedly in the Feilding district. A post-mortem examination at
Massey University on one of the animals showed rabbit calicivirus was
the cause of death.

Annabel Gorman, a veterinarian with Totally Vets in Feilding, said
the disease is preventable by having rabbits vaccinated. Calicivirus
disease, also known as hemorrhagic viral disease, was illegally
introduced into New Zealand in 1997. Of animals exposed to the virus,
30 to 80 percent will develop the disease and almost all the infected
animals will die.

The virus causes bleeding in the lungs, the windpipe (trachea),
liver, spleen, kidneys and the heart.

Dr Gorman said it is unclear how it is transmitted, but it's thought
that rabbits acquire the highly infectious virus by breathing it in,
by eating it, by direct contact with an infected animal or through
infected urine or feces. Insects are also able to carry the virus, so
isolating rabbits is not enough to prevent infection.

The incubation period is 1 to 3 days and research has shown that
rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are usually resistant to the virus.

Dr Gorman said there are 3 forms of the disease:
* Death without any other signs.
* Depression, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing, shaking, and
death within 1 to 2 days. Other signs may include a foamy or bloody
discharge from the nose or anus, nervous signs or rapid death.
Rabbits may appear to recover, then die several days later.
* Mild form -- depression, loss of appetite followed by recovery.
These animals become immune from re-infection.

Dr Gorman said rabbits can be vaccinated from 6 weeks old, and will
require boosters every 3 to 4 weeks until they are 3 months old. If
vaccination starts at 2.5 to 3 months the young rabbits will not need
another booster that year.

She said that in order to maintain immunity, all vaccinated rabbits
should receive an annual booster.
