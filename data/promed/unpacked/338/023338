Response to the question [see Poliomyelitis - India (Lucknow) (03) on the
"failure" of the polio immunization campaign in India.

Outbreaks are expected events during an eradication campaign, reflecting
improving disease surveillance and a heightened concern about the disease.
The outbreak of polio in Lucknow, India, does not imply the failure of the
campaigns in Uttar Pradesh or in all of India. The government of India is
investigating the cause of the outbreak and is taking appropriate action.
More than 1.8 million children have been immunized in the affected areas.
Approximately 120 million children were immunized in India during each of
the two rounds of the campaigns in December 1996 and January 1997. Not
every child has been reached. Immunization coverage was officially reported
to be in excess of 90% but not 100%.
What is clear from national data is that there has been a DRAMATIC
reduction in the incidence of polio in India during the two years since the
first national campaign started in December 1995 (when about 90 million
children were immunized). When the global polio eradication goal was set
in 1988, India reported 24,257 cases of polio. In 1994, they reported
4,237. In 1996, only 1,005 cases were reported nation-wide. So there has
been a 95% reduction in the last 8 years and a 75% reduction between 1994
and 1996. There will be a third nation-wide immunization campaign in
December 1997 and January 1998. Disease surveillance is improving rapidly,
detecting a much higher percentage of the cases which are actually
occurring.
While one cannot accurately predict what the final number of polio cases
will be in India in 1997, the apparent trend remains downward. Even if
there is an increase in the number of cases reported, it will reflect
increased case detection rather than an increase in disease incidence.
The Government of India has made the commitment to eradicate polio by the
year 2000 and is clearly on track to do so.
