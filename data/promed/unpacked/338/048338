A common virus leading to cold-like symptoms is making many Stateline [Illinois] babies sick. Pediatricians in the Stateline say they're seeing a higher number of cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in young children and babies.

RSV is a virus that Dr Tiffanie Ferry says affects almost all of us at some point in our lives. For most babies and kids, the virus causes nothing more than a cold. For a small percentage, RSV can lead to more serious problems like bronchitis and pneumonia.

RSV is highly contagious. Symptoms include coughing, runny nose, and fever.

Dr Ferry says she's seen about a dozen babies test positive for cases in the past few weeks. "You may get it more than once, but typically once you've been exposed to something more than once, your body is able to fight it a little bit better. Small infants and children with asthma and lung problems have a harder time fighting off the illness so they're definitely more susceptible," explains Dr Tiffanie Ferry, a physician at Swedish American hospital.

New data show that 36 percent of babies tested in Rockford, tested positive for RSV. Dr Ferry says treatments are limited. Since RSV is a virus, antibiotics do not work. She recommends treating RSV like a typical cold: drinking lots of fluids, washing hands frequently, and getting rest. Only 1-2 percent of children who get RSV need hospitalization.

If your child does have RSV, doctors recommend keeping them home and away from other people until their fever goes away. Symptoms of RSV could last up to 14 days. The virus is more common in the winter months, November to March.

New data shows that there is an epidemic locally, regionally, and nationally.

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract. It's so common that most children have been infected with the virus by age 2. RSV can also infect adults.

In adults and older, healthy children, the symptoms of RSV are mild and typically mimic the common cold. Self-care measures are usually all that's needed to relieve any discomfort.

Infection with RSV can be severe in some cases, especially in premature babies and infants with underlying health conditions. The disease can also become serious in older adults, adults with heart and lung diseases, or anyone with a very weak immune system (immunocompromised).

Each year, on average, in the United States, RSV leads to:
- 57 527 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old;
- 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old;
- 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths among adults older than 65 years.

Information on cases and outbreaks of RSV infection is collected in the United States using the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). This is a voluntary, laboratory-based surveillance system that was established in 1989 to monitor trends in several viruses, including RSV.
