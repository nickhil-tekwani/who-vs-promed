Death Toll in Ugandan Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Rises to 51
------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: The death toll from the Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in
northern Uganda has risen to 51, an official said on Sat 21 Oct 2000. Health
workers continued to search for anyone who may have come into contact with
this deadly virus. The virus, which can lead to hemorrhagic fever for which
there is no known cure, has infected as many as 88 others, said Dr. Sam
Zaramba of Uganda's national health service. "The epidemic has not been
controlled at this stage, but we hope that in the next week it should have
reached a peak and hopefully stabilize with a few cases," Zaramba told
reporters in Kampala. The number of identified cases of Ebola infection was
expected to rise, he said, as the health teams spread out through the
villages in the area around Gulu, which lies 225 miles north of Kampala.
