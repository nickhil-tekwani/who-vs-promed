Cultist says guru ordered botulin attacks
An Aum Shinrikyo figure testified in court Friday that cult founder
Shoko Asahara ordered him to spray deadly botulin bacteria on government
and other public buildings and on facilities belonging to other
religious sects in Tokyo.
Shigeo Sugimoto, 39, claimed during Asahara's Tokyo District Court trial
session that the guru explained to a dozen senior cultists in April 1990
that killing "helps people to put their souls in a higher stage, since
they are repeating an evil deed in the modern world."
Sugimoto claimed he and Tomomitsu Niimi, a senior cultist, afterward
drove to Tokyo from Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi Prefecture, in a car
specially remodeled to spray botulin on such targets as the Diet
building, the Imperial Palace and the American Embassy several times
around April and May 1990 and once in August 1993. The attempts did not
succeed in killing anyone, he said.
Sugimoto is accused of playing roles in the deadly Tokyo subway sarin
attack in March 1995, the killing of Aum follower Toshio Tomita in July
1994 and the January 1994 lynching of errant cultist Kotaro Ochida.
