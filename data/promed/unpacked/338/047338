India has reported a record rise in coronavirus infections, becoming only the 2nd country after the United States to register more than 100 000 new cases in a day, as hospitals in its worst affected state are overrun by patients.

The country's daily COVID-19 cases soared by 103 558 on [Mon 5 Apr 2021], the biggest such daily increase, data from the Health Ministry showed, taking the total to 12.6 million, the highest after the US and Brazil.

Deaths jumped by 478, still one of the lowest death rates in the world, raising the total to 165 101.

India has recorded the most number of infections in the past week anywhere in the world. The country's daily infections have leapt about 12-fold since hitting a multi-month low in early [February 2021] when authorities eased most restrictions and people largely stopped wearing masks and practising social distancing.

India reported more than 90 000 cases every day in September last year [2020] - hitting a high of 97 894 cases on [16 Sep 2020] - after which infections came down sharply, only to rise again starting late [February 2021] as the economy reopened fully and new virus mutants spread.

The western state of Maharashtra, home to India's financial capital, Mumbai, reported a record 57 074 new cases overnight. The state has contributed more than 55% of total cases in the country in the last 2 weeks.

On [Sun 4 Apr 2021] the Maharashtra government announced new restrictions, including a night curfew and a weekend lockdown, to prevent the further spread of the virus. The state will start shutting shopping malls, cinemas, bars, restaurants and places of worship from [Mon 5 Apr 2021] evening. Authorities will also impose a complete lockdown at weekends, as experts worried about a shortage of critical-care beds in hospitals, especially in its smaller cities.

More infectious variants of the virus may have played a role in the 2nd surge, some epidemiologists say, but officials have cautioned against linking that to the surge. Experts say the surge is blamed in part on growing disregard for social distancing and mask-wearing in public spaces, including public gatherings.

However, some say the Indian government has been sending mixed messages. As health officials continue to warn of gatherings in public places, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party leaders continue to hold mammoth rallies in several states where local elections are underway. The government has also allowed a huge month-long Hindu festival to go ahead on the banks of the Ganges River in northern Uttarakhand state. The festival draws tens of thousands of devotees daily.

India has intensified its vaccination drive in recent weeks, now administering over 3 million jabs a day. But the shots have been slow to reach India's nearly 1.4 billion people.

More than 76 million Indians have received at least one shot, but only 9.5 million of them have received both. Health officials want to cover 300 million people by [August 2021], but experts say the vaccinations need to move faster to stop the spread.

The country has launched the 3rd phase of its coronavirus vaccination drive with those older than 45 eligible for the jab. In the 1st 2 phases, front-line workers and people above the age of 60 were eligible.

[The sharp increase in cases and deaths is extremely concerning. One hopes the lockdown being imposed in the western states, where virus activity is most intense, will dampen transmission. The death rate had been lower than other countries possibly because of the younger population in India. But variants now may be leading to a higher death rate. Genome sequencing and analysis of samples from Maharashtra state found mutations in the virus that do not match previously reported "variants of concern", i.e., a double mutant. But India has already reported several cases of the variant 1st detected in Britain, as well as ones 1st found in South Africa and Brazil.

The population of India is 1.38B people, clearly a challenge to get everyone vaccinated. Total vaccinations in India rank as the world's 3rd-highest, behind the US and China, but its ranking is lower on a per-capita basis (see Our World in Data, an excellent source - https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/india) -Mod.LK]

[1b]. Indian variant: E484Q mutant
Date: Mon 5 Apr 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/4/5/should-we-be-worried-about-indias-double-mutant-covid-19-strain


It is beginning to feel as though not a week can go by without scientists identifying a new variant of the coronavirus. Each time a new strain is announced, I feel myself becoming increasingly numb to the shock factor that the headline is supposed to trigger.

I have written extensively about variants originating in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and New York; this week, it is the turn of India.

In late [March 2021], India's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), a division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, announced that a new variant - dubbed a "double mutant" - had been identified in samples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. This comes on the back of a month that has seen a surge in cases of COVID-19 across India, with many states re-imposing curfews, restrictions and lockdown measures.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare says this new "double mutant" variant has not been found in sufficient numbers to account for the increase in COVID-19 cases across the country. That, rather, is thought to be due to large public gatherings such as weddings, the opening of cinema halls and gyms, as well as large political rallies in West Bengal where elections are due to be held soon.

Nevertheless, it is a "variant of concern" (VOC) and is being closely monitored. The genome sequencing carried out by a consortium of 10 labs in India, called the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), has identified 2 important mutations in the new variant, giving it the unfortunate title of "double mutant".

First, the E484Q mutation, which is similar to the E484K mutation identified on the Brazilian and South African variants, can change parts of the coronavirus spike protein. The spike protein forms part of the coronavirus outer layer and is what the virus uses to make contact with human cells, bind to them, then enter and infect them.

The vaccines have been designed to create antibodies which target the spike protein of the virus specifically. The worry is that if a mutation changes the shape of the spike protein significantly then the antibodies may not be able to recognise and neutralise the virus effectively. Scientists are investigating whether this may be the case for the E484Q mutation.

The 2nd is the L452R mutation, which has also been found in a variant thought to be responsible for outbreaks in California. Scientists believe this mutation increases the spike protein's ability to bind to human host cells, thereby increasing its infectivity. The study also suggests this mutation may aid the virus in evading the neutralising antibodies that both the vaccine and previous infection can produce, though this is still being investigated.

The combination of these 2 mutations would indeed make the variant a concern if it was to become the dominant variant across India.

Right now, however, all eyes are on the UK B117 variant, which possesses the N501Y mutation making it up to 60% more infective, and which has been found extensively in India as well. It has been identified in 125 countries worldwide and is now the dominant variant in the UK.

The NCDC said 81% of 401 samples sent for genome sequencing from Punjab were found to have the UK variant and there is real concern among scientists that this variant may not only become the dominant variant in India, but may be contributing to the increasing number of infections.

They are urging the Indian authorities to scale up genome sequencing to quickly identify new variants that can potentially be more dangerous, and then isolate individuals who are known to be infected as well as their close contacts. Although the situation in India's hospitals is much better now, memories of the intensity of the first wave loom large among healthcare workers. The country is at an important point in the pandemic - one that will require decisive action by the government and a willingness by the Indian population to prevent a national surge in new cases.

While it is important that we keep analysing the virus for new mutations, especially those that may allow it to evade the vaccines, it is also important to know that mutations are common during viral replication and new variants are to be expected.

It is also good to know that the companies which make the vaccines will be able to "tweak" their vaccines to adjust for new variants, a process that will take a relatively short amount of time.

In fact, the UK has already announced potential booster shots for the autumn using vaccines that have been tweaked to be more effective against new variants, and this is likely to happen worldwide. We do it for the flu vaccine every year; it may become customary to do the same for the COVID-19 vaccine.

[This variant was reported today (5 Apr 2021) to have been detected by Stanford Health Care in California (https://deadline.com/2021/04/double-mutant-coronavirus-variation-india-discovered-in-california-1234727857/). "Just as California seemed to be on the verge of truly turning the Covid-19 corner, the Stanford Clinical Virology Lab confirmed a case of an emerging variant that originated in India.(...) According to Lisa Kim, Senior Manager of Media Relations for Stanford Health Care, "The Clinical Virology Lab at Stanford Health Care identified and confirmed the newly described 'India' variant [double mutant strain] last week. This variant has the L452R mutation found in the CA variant, as well as another significant spike mutation, E484Q. This same position is mutated to a different amino acid (K) in both the South Africa and Brazil (P.1 and P.2) variants." - Mod.LK]

[According to another report, as of 31 Mar 2021 there have been 10 cases of the E484Q/L452R variant detected in California, and the first U.S. case was detected in a sample collected in Los Angeles on 8 Jan 2021.

The coronavirus has reached Kumbh Mela 2021 with as many as 7 saints at Krishna Ashram located in Shankaracharya Chowk testing positive for the infection.

Around 300 cases of COVID-19 infection have been found in Haridwar in the last 4 days, confirmed Kumbh Mela Health Officer Dr. Sanger. This could adversely affect the Kumbh Mela which commenced on [Thu 1 Apr 2021] in Uttarakhand's Haridwar.

Due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, the state government had issued a new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to contain the spread of the virus. Uttarakhand has mandated a negative RT-PCR test report for the devotees visiting Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela will be held for only 30 days this year, from [1 Apr to 30 Apr 2021], in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Devotees will participate in 3 shahi snans which are slated for [12 Apr, 14 Apr and 27 Apr 2021].

[According to Dr. Ziad Memish, Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Mass Gathering Medicine, the Kumbh Mela, the Hindu religious pilgramage, is the world largest mass gathering event, attracting more than 120 million piligrims for up to 2 months, and is held every 3 years in 4 alternating sites along the banks of the 4 holy rivers of India https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159069/. This year (2021) the event is being held along the Ganges River in Haridwar district, and even though the event has been limited to "only" 30 days this year, the sheer scale of this massive human gathering - more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than the notorious Sturgis (South Dakota) motorcycle rally in the U.S.A. - raises the spectre of a super-superspreading event that will subsequently fan out to the rest of India and possibly other countries. - Mod.LXL]

[2] Vaccine and pregnancy: progress report

Progress Report: Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers can pass vaccine antibodies to babies

Pregnant and lactating women were not included as a group in the trials for any of the vaccines (although some women became pregnant after the trials commenced). However, since vaccination programmes have begun, scientists have been able to determine that the vaccines are most likely safe for both pregnant and lactating women. The general advice to pregnant women is to take up the vaccine, especially if they work in a role that is public-facing or have an underlying health condition that puts them at risk of developing complications should they contract the coronavirus.

There has been some debate about how a pregnant woman's body might respond to having the vaccine at a time when their immune systems may be suppressed to stop it "rejecting" the baby.

A study by Harvard University, published in the _American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology_, examined responses to vaccines in 131 women (84 pregnant, 31 lactating and 16 non-pregnant). They were given the full 2 doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines and antibody levels were checked in maternal blood and breast milk before the study, at the time of the 2nd dose and then again 2 to 6 weeks after the 2nd dose.

In those women who were pregnant, baby umbilical cord blood was also tested after delivery for the presence of maternal antibodies triggered by the vaccine. The study also compared these antibody levels with a group of women who had previously been infected by COVID-19.

The results showed that women - whether they were pregnant, breastfeeding or neither - had similar levels of antibodies after the 2 vaccine doses.

Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breast milk samples. The 2nd dose increased specific antibodies, called immunoglobulin G (IgG). These form the basis of long-term protection against the virus; they are retained and reproduce rapidly when exposed to the real virus, neutralising it before it has a chance to take hold and cause a full-blown infection. Importantly, side effects from the vaccines were rare and equally reported in all 3 groups of women.

When vaccine-induced antibody levels were compared with those of women who had antibodies because of a previous infection of COVID-19, they were found to be higher. This means the vaccines are more likely to provide more robust and longer-lasting protection against coronavirus in the future compared with any protection gained through a previous infection.

The study does provide some reassurance to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and worried about getting the vaccine. The sample size is relatively small and more research will be needed to back this study up, but it adds to the growing data proving the safety of the vaccines.

[This small study suggests vaccination is safe in pregnant women and may provide some protection to the newborn infant. The risk of severe disease or even death from COVID-19 is higher during pregnancy, according to an NPR report (https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/02/983666339/study-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-during-pregnancy-and-may-protect-baby-too). More than 82 000 coronavirus infections among pregnant individuals and 90 maternal deaths from the disease have been reported in the U.S. as of last month (March 2021). Therefore, the risk of severe outcome following natural infection seems higher than risk of adverse effects from the vaccine. Antibody response was also higher in vaccinated pregnant women than naturally infected. Both appear to allow transfer of IgG across the placenta. See ProMED-mail COVID-19 update (125): variant analysis, maternal antibodies, WHO, global 20210405.8289796 for report on COVID-19 maternal antibodies following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.] What is not clear without having access to the pdf of the publication reported here is what trimester the women were in at the time of vaccination.

[3] P.1 Variant Clusters
[3a] USA - Massachusetts
Date: Sat 3 Apr 2021

https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/03/metro/mass-becomes-state-with-most-cases-new-covid-19-variant-after-cape-cod-outbreaks/


The new P.1 variant of COVID-19 1st found in travelers from Brazil has been detected in Massachusetts more than anywhere else in the country, and the lion's share of those cases are part of a cluster on Cape Cod, according to researchers.

New data from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard showed 54 cases of the P.1 variant were reported in Massachusetts - mostly on Cape Cod - during the month following the 1st reported case of the variant in the state in late February [2021].

"When you see that there are a lot of [P.1] cases in Massachusetts, that's partially because we're looking for it," said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. "It's been expected to happen at some point and it's certainly happened now."

The research suggests that 43 of these cases form a single cluster that is likely linked to an introduction from Brazil, with the remaining cases of P.1 possibly stemming from Nebraska, Italy, and other areas, he said.

"The majority of [the 54 total cases] are associated with a single cluster because as we know ... the majority of cases do not transmit," Hanage said. "The ones that do transmit, however, make up for it."

P.1 cases haven't continued to climb in the state, but Hanage expects more to emerge. Research shows the variant spreads faster than the original COVID-19 strain, but scientists have yet to learn if it is more deadly or more likely to reinfect those who have already recovered from the virus.

The variant's introduction is a new source of concern on Cape Cod. About half of all municipalities in Barnstable County are at high risk for transmission, according to the state's weekly COVID-19 public health report. Most have also seen an increase in cases and positivity rates over the last few weeks, a sign that a new surge could hit the area if these numbers continue to grow.

At the same time, more residents on the Cape have been vaccinated than in any other region in Massachusetts. The state's weekly vaccination report shows 44% of Barnstable County residents had received at least one does of a vaccine as of [30 Mar 2021] -- the highest percentage in the state. The county also had 27% of its population fully vaccinated at that point, coming in 2nd only to Martha's Vineyard.

Hanage said the variant cases on Cape Cod were detected when fewer people in the state had been vaccinated. While vaccines are likely effective against this new strain, he said Massachusetts still has a long way to go before it can ward off the virus's variants.

"To completely exclude this virus, we need to vaccinate a lot more people than we have already," Hanage said. "The high vaccination rates [right now] are not themselves sufficient to be protective, and if we allow more transmission, then we're going to get more cases."

Massachusetts has more reported cases of the new P.1 variant of COVID-19 than any other state in the country, and researchers said over the weekend most of those cases stem from a cluster on Cape Cod.

A report from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard found 54 such cases in Massachusetts, and said 43 of them stem from the Cape cluster. The variant, which originated in Brazil, spreads faster, but researchers still don't know if it is deadlier or if it can reinfect people who have already had the virus.

Detection of a large cluster and multiple introductions of the P.1 SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern in Massachusetts

Background
The P.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, recognized as a Variant of Concern (VoC) by the US CDC and WHO 1, is characterized by 17 mutations including several known or suspected to have functional consequences. P.1 lineage viruses are associated with marked reductions in neutralizing antibodies from convalescent and vaccinated patients (2) and have been found in reinfection cases (3).

This lineage is also reported to be more transmissible (4). Consequently, P.1 may pose significant risks to both individual and public health. P.1 is currently the least documented VoC in the United States, possibly a result of restricted travel from areas where the lineage is prevalent; however, an increasing number of states are now reporting P.1 cases (5).

To support state public health investigations, we have been sequencing SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from cases in Massachusetts (MA) and New England more broadly, with a recent focus on the Cape Cod area following a notable increase in cases and the presence of a putative cluster there. Several of these recent genomes were found to be P.1. In parallel, a combination of routine state-wide genomic surveillance (by the CDC Baseline Surveillance program's contract labs), and focal sequencing around the suspected cluster (by the MA State Public Health Laboratory (MASPHL)), has identified additional P.1 cases in Cape Cod and across the state. Here we describe a dataset of 54 high-quality genomes of the P.1 VoC lineage from unique patient samples obtained through these combined efforts (see Table 1).

Results
-------
All 3 global VoCs (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) have now been detected in MA. However, unlike B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, P.1 has shown a rapid rise in frequency in the few weeks following its first detection on [16 Mar 2021] (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis of these 54 P.1 genomes from MA, alongside four additional P.1 genomes from neighbouring states (2 from Connecticut (CT) and one each from Maine (ME) and Rhode Island (RI)) and 895 other global P.1 sequences from GISAID (6), suggests at least 6 introductions of P.1 into MA and at least 8 introductions of P.1 into the New England region, likely from both international and domestic sources (Figure 2).

Discussion
----------
The detection of over 50 cases of the P.1 variant, a VoC that has been associated with increased transmissibility and reinfection, in less than a month in MA is concerning.

That many of these genomes appear to reflect multiple independent introductions of P.1 into New England, and transportation of this variant between several US states, points to likely widespread circulation of this VoC across the country. While our understanding of the increased transmissibility of the P.1 variant is still unfolding, the large cluster of identical and nearly identical genomes -a pattern of genetic diversity consistent with superspreading-, highlights the ongoing risk of rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, and in particular for more transmissible lineages. The extent of community transmission of P.1 in Massachusetts and across the US is currently unknown, however, it is likely that the P.1 variant is already or will soon be circulating in communities and ongoing surveillance will be critical to understanding the trajectory and impact of the P.1 variant.

[3d] P.1: Canada - Alberta
Date: Sat 3 Apr 2021
Source: Global News [edited]
https://globalnews.ca/news/7737268/covid-19-alberta-outbreak-P.1-variant/


Alberta Health is investigating a significant COVID-19 outbreak in the province relating to the P.1 variant, which was first discovered in Brazil.

Alberta chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw tweeted on [Sat 3 Apr 2021] the outbreak was linked to someone returning to the province from a trip.

Hinshaw said health officials are contacting individuals who are at risk of exposure to ensure they are isolated and offered testing. Health officials are working hard to limit future spread and reaching out directly to those at risk of exposure. AHS will ensure that anyone at risk is isolated, offered testing twice and connected with supports if needed. (2/4)

As of [31 Mar 2021], there were 2820 active variants of concern cases in Alberta, which made up 33% of all active cases in the province.

The Calgary zone had 1292 active variant cases, the Edmonton zone had 792, the Central zone had 283, the South zone had 223, the North zone had 219 and 11 cases were in an unknown zone. Alberta Health provided no other details about the outbreak except that officials were continuing to investigate and would provide an update on [Mon 5 Apr 2021].

On [Fri 2 Mar 2021], Alberta reported 1100 new COVID-19 cases with a positivity rate of 8%. It was the 1st time since early [January 2021] the province reported over 1000 cases in one day. Out of the 1100 new cases identified, 300 were variants of concern.

[Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating globally. Several new variants emerged in the fall of 2020, including the variant discussed in this set of reports, P.1 lineage (a.k.a. 20J/501Y.V3), which is increasing rapidly and globally, raising concern.

"The P.1 variant is a branch off the B.1.1.28 lineage that was 1st reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan in 4 travelers from Brazil, sampled during routine screening at Haneda airport outside Tokyo. [This variant was 1st detected in the US at the end of January 2021.]

The P.1 lineage contains 3 mutations in the spike protein receptor binding domain: K417T, E484K, and N501Y [with a total of 17 unique mutations in the whole genome].

There is evidence to suggest that some of the mutations in the P.1 variant may affect its transmissibility and antigenic profile, which may affect the ability of antibodies generated through a previous natural infection or through vaccination to recognize and neutralize the virus.

A recent study reported on a cluster of cases in Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon region, in which the P.1 variant was identified in 42% of the specimens sequenced from late December 2020.[5] In this region, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV2 as of October 2020. However, since mid-December 2020, the region has observed a surge in cases. The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals." (See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html.)

"The P.1 variant (also known as B.1.1.248) concerns scientists for a few reasons, starting with how it has 2 notable mutations that may make it more dangerous.

1st, it has a spike protein mutation that may make the variant more infectious. This mutation, known as N501Y (or "Nelly"), is also present in the B.1.1.7 variant, which is fast overtaking the U.K., as well as the B.1.351 (also known as 501.V2, or N501Y.V2) variant that has emerged in South Africa. The mutation enables the virus's spike proteins to more easily bind with human cells, which may make it more infectious. Research has suggested that the B.1.1.7 variant may be more than 50 percent more transmissible than previously dominant strains, which is why scientists and public-health officials are so worried about it.

The P.1 variant also has an "escape mutation" known as E484K, which also exists in the B.1.351 variant from South Africa and which in lab experiments has been found to help the coronavirus evade protective antibodies generated by earlier infections, as well as less susceptible to antibody drugs. In other words, it's possible that someone who has already been infected with an earlier strain of the coronavirus could be reinfected by a variant with this mutation and that the mutation may enable the coronavirus to evade antibodies generated by COVID vaccines.

This does not mean that the currently available coronavirus vaccines will not work against variants with the E484K mutation. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have found that in lab tests, their mRNA vaccines were only slightly less effective against the B.1.135 variant from South Africa, and the companies are already working to update the vaccines to address the issue. Elsewhere, many coronavirus experts expect that the vaccines will offer comparable protection against these new strains with the E484K mutation. More research is needed, but for now it seems like the worst-case real-world scenario would be that the vaccines would still prevent serious illness from the variants but might be less effective at preventing a mild or asymptomatic infection from them.

And again, the vaccines can and will be updated to account for this and other mutations over time.

P.1 and the B.1.351 variant also share another mutation, K417, but less is understood about how that benefits the virus.

When variants of concern evolve with the same advantageous mutation(s) in separate geographically distinct locations at the same time, it suggests those mutations are significant evolutionary leaps for the virus. But it also remains unclear whether or not these mutations and their effects are tied to other mutations in the variants in ways scientists don't yet understand." [Excerpted from: https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-we-know-about-the-p1-variant-of-the-coronavirus.html].

But as discussed in Faria NR et al., 12 Jan 2021 (https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manaus-preliminary-findings/586): "The set of mutations/deletions shared between P.1, B.1.1.7, and the B.1.351 lineages appear to have arisen entirely independently. Further, both mutations shared between P1 and B.1.351 seem to be associated with a rapid increase in cases in locations where previous attack rates are thought to be very high. Therefore, it is essential to rapidly investigate whether there is an increased rate of re-infection in previously exposed individuals." - Mod.LK]
