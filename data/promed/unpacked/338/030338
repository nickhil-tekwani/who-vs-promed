A deer in Berrien County [Michigan] has died from epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), a sometimes-fatal viral disease that, in 2012, claimed more than 12 000 Michigan deer, according to a news release from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

The Wildlife Disease Lab and the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for Animal Health announced the finding [Thu 29 Sep 2016], on the state website.

No cases of EHD were confirmed in the state in either 2014 or 2015.

Signs of illness shown by infected animals are highly variable, and range from no clinical signs at all to extensive internal bleeding and fluid accumulation, authorities said.

The disease is transmitted by a type of biting fly called a midge.

Illness can come on suddenly and severely, but also can linger for weeks or months in a low-grade state. In severe forms of the disease, deer lose their appetites and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, salivate excessively and finally become unconscious.

Due to a high fever and dehydration, infected deer often seek water and are found sick or dead along or in bodies of water.

There is no evidence that humans can contract the EHD virus.

[EHD is most commonly found in cervids. However, several cases have occurred finding EHD or EHD2 viruses in cattle.

"The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family _Reoviridae_. 10 serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide. The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV. Infected deer can be viremic for up to 2 months. The incubation period for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer is 5 to 10 days.

Disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical.

Typical signs include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic.

Preferred tissues in deer are spleen, lymph node, and unclotted whole blood in EDTA or heparin. Other useful samples may include serum (for serology), liver, and lung. Both fresh and fixed tissues should be collected if possible. Samples for virus isolation should be transported under refrigeration. For suspect cases in cattle, blood should be collected into anticoagulant (calcium citrate, EDTA, or heparin) and sent chilled for virus isolation or RT-PCR. Paired serum samples should also be collected if possible. Additionally, because of other differentials, involved fluid from intact vesicles as well as aggressive swabs or biopsy samples near lesions are also suggested."
