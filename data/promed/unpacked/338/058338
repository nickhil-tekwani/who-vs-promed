Minnesota tracking 2 cases of measles
-------------------------------------
Measles is back in Minnesota. For the 1st time since 2001, a child in
the state has picked up the infectious disease from someone in the
community, adding one more case to what federal health officials say
is a worrisome number nationally.

The Minnesota child, who lives in Hennepin County but who has not
been identified, is 10 months old -- too young to have received a
measles vaccine that is typically given at 12 months. The child
contracted it from an unidentified person in the community, said Ruth
Lynfield, state epidemiologist. That's a rare way for the disease to
spread in Minnesota, where the handful of cases in recent years have
resulted after travel to areas where measles is more common.

But it fits a concerning trend nationally. Between January and July
[2008], 127 measles cases in 15 states were reported to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the largest number in the
past 7 years. So far, no child has died. Most cases have occurred in
children whose parents decided against having them vaccinated for
religious reasons or because of concerns about the safety of
vaccines. If vaccination rates drop significantly, the US population
could lose what is called "herd immunity," meaning an infection cannot spread.

State and Hennepin County health officials are investigating who
might have infected the child as well as whom the child might have
infected. The child became ill on 29 Jul [2008] and was in 2 clinics,
an emergency room, and around the community before being diagnosed.
Health officials are warning doctors and clinics that measles is
present in the community and to watch out for it. "Measles is a
significant infection," Lynfield said. "The best way to protect
against getting measles is vaccination. It's important that people be
up to date on their vaccine."

[Although still only a single case, this pre-vaccination infant is
serving as a sentinel indicating the presence of a cryptic source of
measles in the local community.
