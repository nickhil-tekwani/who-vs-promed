MYCOPLASMA MORTALITY, CAPTIVE ALLIGATORS - USA (FLORIDA)
========================================================

From: Steve Grenard <grenard@con2.com>

UPI reports:
A University of Florida biologist says a mysterious infectious disease is
killing captive alligators and may threaten their estimated 1.5 million
counterparts in the wild." Necropsies have revealed a new strain of
Mycoplasma bacteria. Kent Vliet says although the only other documented
case of Mycoplasma infection among crocodilians affected Nile crocodiles at
a Zimbabwe farm, there easily could be others among some of the isolated
cases of alligator die-offs
in farms and in the wild.
Kent Vliet, was quoted as saying even the largest of the ancient reptiles
at
the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park. It killed more than
three-quarters of the alligators that have been exposed to the disease.
Vliet says researchers "thought alligators were incredibly resilient
animals, with surprisingly few cases of disease." . Many were more than 60
years old, 11 or
12 feet long and weighed 700 or 800 pounds.
