Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda - WHO Update 2
-------------------------------------------------
As of 18 Oct 2000, the Ministry of Health has reported 94 cases, including
39 deaths. The cases are focused on Aswa county and Gulu municipality in
Gulu district. Unconfirmed reports of cases in a neighbouring district of
Kitgum are being investigated by the operational task force.
A National Task Force for the Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers has been
established under the authority of the Ministry of Health, with WHO
coordinating the international response to the outbreak. Teams from Medecins
sans Frontieres (MSF) International, Epicentre (France) and WHO
Collaborating Centre at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(United States) are participating in the response.

Ebola hemorrhagic Fever Spreads to Soroti, Lira, and Atiak
-----------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Ebola virus has hit displaced persons camps in Gulu district as the
death toll and hospitalised cases continue to rise. Affected camps were
identified as Pabbo, Parabongo and Atiak, all in Kilak county west of Gulu
town. The death toll has reached 37 and at least 82 patients have been
admitted. The BBC yesterday also reported that cases of Ebola fever had been
reported in Amoru and Atiak refugee camps. All day primary and secondary
schools in Gulu municipality have closed after a Senior Five student at Gulu
Senior Secondary School reportedly died of Ebola on Mon 16 Oct 2000.
Yesterday, 4 people were reported to be in critical condition. At least 6
cases were reported from the displaced persons camps.
The district has placed three sub-counties - Bugantira (Aswa county) and
Pece and Bardege (Gulu municipality) - under quarantine, according to a
directive broadcast on Gulu FM radio. All Ebola victims who die are to be
buried by the police, army and prison officers, according to a new directive
also announced over Gulu FM yesterday. Other cases of Ebola fever had been
identified in Amuru and Atiak sub-counties in Kilak county, Gulu and one
case in Agoro in Lamuru county near the Sudan-Uganda border.
Meanwhile, one man has died in Soroti and 5 others were hospitalised in
critical condition following an attack of a haemorrhagic fever believed to
be Ebola fever. A nurse in charge of Alwa health centre, Anayo Maselina,
said she has admitted 4 patients in critical condition. "The 4 are urinating
blood. At first we thought they had cholera but in spite of frantic efforts
to treat them for cholera, the haemorrhage has persisted," she told The
Monitor. In Lira district, a man was left to die at Lira bus park after
passengers feared to touch him believing that he had Ebola fever. The man
reportedly collapsed at about 10:00 am and died at 1:00 pm. The body was
taken to Lira Hospital mortuary, causing a stampede among staff and
patients, and prompting authorities to order the body's immediate burial.
Yesterday's district emergency meeting also learnt that 2 suspected cases of
Ebola fever had been isolated in Lira Hospital.

Local Concern about Kenyan Response
-----------------------------------
NAIROBI: As international health experts arrive in Uganda to help stem the
spread of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, it is disheartening that Kenya's
response to the fever outbreak seems to be [inadequate. At least one
busload of travellers from Uganda [is reported to have entered the country
without [either an inspection, [or the promised screening against the
virus. Despite assurances that the outbreak has not spilled out of northern
Uganda's Gulu District, where it has killed at least 37 people, it is
imperative that Kenya be on full alert.
Although the World Health Organisation says there is no need to slap travel
restrictions on Uganda, it needs must be noted that Kenya shares a highly
porous border with Uganda. In recent weeks, some 15 000 herders driven out
of their homes by the current drought crossed into northern Uganda and were
reportedly welcomed. Add to these unofficial and even temporary movements
across the border the traffic through the formal border points, and a need
becomes apparent for the country to be vigilant in the event of any
outbreak. However remote the danger of Ebola fever spreading to Kenya, it is
imperative that the country's health authorities put in place a coordinated
strategy for responding to the current crisis.

Description of the Earliest Known Ebola Fever Case in Uganda
------------------------------------------------------------
KABEDE OPONG, (Uganda): [A woman was found dead 6 weeks ago in her
round, gray mud hut by her mother and sisters 5 days after she fell ill with
a fever. In keeping with custom, her body was kept in her hut for 2 days to
allow friends and family to take part in the funeral. [The woman's family and
closest friends ritually bathed her body, buried her less than 10 metres
from where she died and then washed their hands in a communal basin as a
sign of unity.
What they did not know was that [the woman was carrying the deadly Ebola
virus. That was on Thu 7 Sep 200. Now, her mother, 3 sisters and 3 other
relatives are dead and the virus has spread across a 25-kilometre radius,
killing at least 39 people and infecting as many as 63 others. How [the woman,
so far the first person known to have contracted Ebola fever in Uganda,
became infected is a mystery. One of [her two children, a 9 month old
boy, died of Ebola fever within days of her funeral, although her 8 year old
son who did not take part in the funeral has so far survived. [The woman, 36,
lived with her mother and sisters in a small compound of 6 thatched huts and
a dilapidated house surrounded by banana trees and rows of corn. She made
her living selling home-brewed cassava beer and corn she ground by hand
inside her 3 metres wide, windowless hut.
Kabede Opong is 7 kilometres from Gulu, a town of 150 000 inhabitants about
360 kilometres north of the capital Kampala. People here do not eat wild
animals, which has been suspected as the source of some past Ebola fever
outbreaks, and [the woman did nothing unusual before she died, except for a
trip to another village to get cassava leaves for brewing. At first,
neighbors thought [she died of dysentery, cholera or any of a number of
illnesses common to the area. "People had fears after the second victim,"
said Justin Okot, a police officer who lived in the compound next to [the
woman.
"It was after the [death of the eighth victim, that we suspected this [to
be a new disease."
More help has arrived today when a team from the World Health Organisation
brought in boxes of protective garments, gloves and a washing machine, as
well as the expertise needed to fight Ebola. "Containment of the outbreak
should not be a problem," said Dr Guenael Rodier, a senior WHO official and
veteran of [several Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. "Simple measures will
avoid the spread of the disease from person to person and that is what we
are going to work on." Rumors abound of cases in other districts of Uganda,
which could either signify a dramatic spread of the disease or just panic.
"There are many rumors that need to be checked," said Dr Rodier. "But it is
clear that if you have no contact with Gulu, then you are unlikely to have
Ebola."
Professor Francis Omaswa, director general of Uganda's medical services,
said reports that two people had died of Ebola in neighboring Kitgum were
false and that the virus was being contained in Gulu district.

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[Ebola virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as
mucus, saliva and blood, and can be passed through a simple handshake. Four
days after exposure, flu-like symptoms set in, followed by bloody diarrhoea
and vomiting. About 10 to 15 days later, the victims bleed out through the
nose, mouth and eyes. Blood and other bodily fluids also begin seeping
through the skin, producing painful blisters. Mortality rates of up to 80%
have been recorded in past outbreaks, but the epidemiological data indicate
that close contact is necessary for efficient transmission of the virus from
one person to another. There is little evidence of aerosol transmission.
Dr. Martin Haditsch <martin.haditsch@travel-clinic.at> has pointed out that
a previous report containing the phrase that Ebola virus is a "highly
contagious virus" is misleading. He says that taking into account all the
factors that might contribute to ongoing infections and measures proven to
prohibit infection most cases might be avoided by practising basic hygiene.
It is also important to point out that the host species acting as the
natural reservoir of Ebola virus is unknown. Non-human primates have been
implicated in the origin of some past outbreaks, but susceptibility to
hemorrhagic illness and high mortality suggests that they are not the
primary reservoir host. - Mod.CP
