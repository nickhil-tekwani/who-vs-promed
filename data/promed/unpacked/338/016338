China's Ministry of Health has confirmed a new human case of bird
flu, the Ministry announced on its website Saturday [26 May 2007]. A
19-year-old soldier in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is now
receiving treatment at an army hospital, the Ministry said. A
[Ministry] spokesman declined to say in which part of the country
[the soldier] was stationed or how he may have come in contact with the virus.
The man developed symptoms of fever, cough, and pneumonia on 9 May
2007. He was sent to an army hospital on 14 May 2007, [where he
remains hospitalized]. Tests [performed] by the local Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 18 May 2007, showed that he
had been infected with bird flu virus serotype H5N1. The result was
confirmed by Chinese and PLA CDCs on Wednesday [23 May 2007]. The
website did not indicate Cheng's current condition.
The ministry said leaders of the State Council and the Central
Committee of PLA were "highly concerned" by the case. They have
ordered the army to cooperate with the local health bureau to closely
monitor those who have had close contact with the patient. So far,
none have shown symptoms of the disease.
According to the website, China's Health Ministry has conveyed the
information to the World Health Organization (WHO), health agencies
in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and some countries.
China has reported a total of 25 human cases of bird flu since 2003,
which have caused 15 deaths. On 27 Mar 2007, a 16-year-old boy in
eastern Anhui Province died from the deadly virus. The [source] of
his infection is still unknown.
The Ministry of Health confirmed last August [2006] that the
country's 1st human case of H5N1 bird flu virus occurred in November
2003. A 24-year-old man who died in Beijing in 2003, was initially
thought to be suffering from SARS. Further laboratory tests confirmed
he died of human avian influenza.
