East African Community Strategies to Contain Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: The East African Community (EAC) member States of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania are stepping up plans for a harmonization of their public
health laws to deal with the deadly Ebola disease. At a meeting of working
groups and experts on communicable disease control in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha from 30 Nov to 1 Dec 2000, joint EAC regional
strategies were outlined to contain future outbreaks of the viral disease,
which has killed over 140 people in Gulu, northern Uganda, in the past few
weeks. A statement released on Tue 5 Dec 2000 stated that the group
recommended the strengthening of the surveillance on Ebola fever and other
communicable diseases in the region. This would entail enhanced human
resources development, improved laboratory facilities and community-based
surveillance systems.
The meeting also addressed the status of the Ebola fever epidemic in
Uganda, its possible sources, public health regulations and the movement of
people across the EAC borders. It recommended, however, that people's
movement should not be restricted, arguing that this would not be easy to
monitor and enforce within the partner States.
Kenya's Public Health Minister warned that the Ebola fever threat to his
country was [the greatest, because of its proximity to the Ugandan
epicenter and because Kenya is a regional trade and communications center.
He said Kenya is more at risk that Uganda's other neighbors, but added that
the government was stepping up efforts to forestall an outbreak of the
disease in the country, despite the social interaction between peoples of
the 2 countries.
