Information received on [and dated] 9 Dec 2020 from Dr Jaspinder Komal, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 26 Nov 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 8 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1%
Mortality: 1%
Zoonotic impact: zoonotic disease
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (1)
Total outbreaks: 1
Total affected animals:
Outbreak location (BC-2020-001): Fraser Valley, British Columbia
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Nov 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Mustelidae / 15 000 / 200 / 200 / 0 / 0
Affected population: BC-2020-001 domestic American mink (_Neovison vison_) commercial farm

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Mustelidae / 1.33 / 1.33 / 100 / 1.33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: suspected human transmission

Epidemiological comments: COVID-19-positive mink farm workers were diagnosed on 3 Dec 2020. Minks did not display clinical signs at that time. Minks sampled from the farm on 4 Dec [2020] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the provincial laboratory (E_Sarbeco PCR) and were confirmed to be positive at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease by PCR (SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR for E and RdRp). In the days following sampling, there was an increase in mortality (1%).

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, quarantine, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: screening

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (national laboratory) / Mustelidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 8 Dec 2020 / positive
Animal Health Center (regional laboratory) / Mustelidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 Dec 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This immediate notification report officially confirms the information published by different media sources. According to this report, the source of infection is suspected to be human transmission.

"Farmed mink are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, in some cases, they have transmitted the virus back to humans. Surveillance findings in Denmark show that SARS-CoV-2 introduced into mink populations continues to evolve through viral mutation. Viral mutation also happens in human infections, but new mutations may be seen as the virus adapts to a new species. Scientific investigations have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reintroduced from mink to humans.

The OIE acknowledges that such events could have important public health implications. There are concerns that the introduction and circulation of new virus strains in humans could result in modifications of transmissibility or virulence and in decreased treatment and vaccine efficacy. Yet, the full consequences remain unknown, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the impact of these mutations."
