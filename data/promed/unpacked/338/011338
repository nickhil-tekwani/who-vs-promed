2 persons were found to have been affected by leptospirosis at P.
Tottiyankulam in Tiruchuzhi block of the district on Fri, 20 Feb 2004. A.
Mohammed Aslam ordered the Health department to take preventive steps so as
to keep the disease under control.
A total of 44 persons in the village have developed fever, body ache, and
eye congestion over 4 days. 2 persons, a male and a female, tested positive
during a serum test conducted on 5 patients.
All precautionary measures were taken to control the zoonatic disease from
affecting more people in the village, where the cattle population exceeded
the human population, the Deputy Director (Health), S. Balasubramanian,
said. "The [bacterial] disease damages liver and kidney, leading to death.
However, timely medical intervention prevents death," Dr. Balasubramanian
said. A medical team, led by the Reddiayapatti Medical Officer,
Malarvannan, and the District Malaria Officer, Kathiresan, was camping at
the health subcenter in the village.
All the affected persons are being treated, and their contacts (family
members not affected) were given preventive treatment. Blood samples would
be taken from all fresh cases of fever until it was completely brought
under control, he added. The people were advised to use boiled water, and
the local authorities were instructed to chlorinate drinking water properly.
Health inspectors and village health nurses started surveying 11
neighboring villages within a radius of 5 km for fever cases. The
Department of Animal Husbandry was advised to [test and treat affected]
cattle. Dusting of bleaching powder was also undertaken to sanitize cattle
sheds.

[The spirochete _Leptospira_ is usually spread by water contaminated by the
urine of infected rodents. During rainy seasons, the number of cases
increases dramatically. In its most severe manifestation -- Weil's
disease, with hepatic and renal failure -- early treatment can diminish
morbidity and mortality. Most cases are relatively mild and can present
fever of unclear etiology, hepatitis, and aseptic meningitis. Many cases
are subclinical. - Mod.LL]
