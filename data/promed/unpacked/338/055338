Failure of malaria chemoprophylaxis in US troops in Liberia
--------------------------------------------------
10 more U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune as well as sailors who were in
Liberia during August 2003 are being hospitalized with symptoms of malaria,
bringing to 43 the number of suspected cases among those who participated
in the mission, defense officials said Tuesday.
The 43 represent nearly a third of the 150 who went ashore to assist West
African peacekeepers. Doctors are investigating to find out why that rate
is so high, said Air Force Capt. Sarah Kerwin, a spokeswoman for European
Command. Malaria was confirmed in 12 of the 43 cases on Monday, and
testing continues on the other 31, who have exhibited symptoms of the
mosquito-borne disease, a Pentagon official said Tuesday.
Normally, troops are given a drug regimen requiring them to begin taking
preventive medicine before deploying. Doctors were questioning the patients
to find out whether they took the medication and if so, when, Kerwin said.
The 40 Marines and 3 Navy officers who fell ill all went ashore from the
amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima and the amphibious landing dock USS
Carter Hall, said Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler, a spokesman at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. 2 Marines who exhibited more
severe symptoms than the others were flown Saturday from the USS Iwo Jima
warship off the coast of Liberia to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in
Germany. 30 other Marines, plus one sailor, were flown Sunday to Bethesda.
The 10 new patients were flown overnight Monday to Bethesda, Maryland,
officials said.
Col. Jay DeFrank, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Marines, members
of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based, were in Liberia in mid-August
as part of a U.S. quick-reaction force of about 150 U.S. troops. They
operated from an airport outside Monrovia, the capital.
European Command said it was unlikely that the illness presented a
communicable disease risk to the other Marines and sailors aboard the
ships. Other officials said that as a precaution, movements of Marines
ashore in Liberia from the Iwo Jima and 2 other U.S. Navy ships off the
Liberian coast were being limited for the time being.
There are about 136 U.S. troops still ashore in Liberia, mostly Marines
providing security at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. The Iwo Jima and 2
other ships off the coast have about 2200 Marines and about 2500 sailors
aboard.
Malaria is transmitted by mosquitos that breed in stagnant water and tall
grass. The disease kills 3000 children a day in Africa and robs the
continent of millions of dollars in lost productivity, the United Nations
said in a report early in 2003. The disease infects 300 million people a
year in Africa and has become increasingly resistant to drugs, said the
World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF.

[West Africa -- including Liberia -- has the highest transmission rates of
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in the world, and inoculation rates
approaching 0.5 infected bites per night is not unusual. Falciparum malaria
in Liberia should be fully susceptible to mefloquine (Lariam),
atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), and doxycycline. Malarone and doxycycline
can be started immediately before entering a malarious areas, and so can
Lariam if a loading dose is given. The very high rate of infection reported
here therefore reflects failure of prophylaxis. If proper prophylaxis was
prescribed, drug levels at the time of diagnosis should be documented. -

[Dr. Goehle is a physician who was working in a hospital in central Liberia
prior to returning to the USA in March 2003. She included the following
comments with this submission:
"I know that malaria is not a routine posting, but I am interested to know
what happened to the prophylaxis, or accuracy of the [above newswire]. I
also have read reports that CDC is in Monrovia using new treatment regimes,
at least, new for Liberia. I suspect some are oral/rectal regimes which
would obviate the need for the IV Quinine."
The observed attack rate of approximately 30 percent among the military
personnel stationed in the region begs the question of what type of
chemoprophylaxis failure occurred -- failure to take the recommended
chemoprophylaxis, or failure of the recommended
chemoprophylaxis. ProMED-mail has carried reports of mefloquine resistance
in East Africa, and malarone resistance in Nigeria and Ivory Coast (see
ProMED-mail posting Malaria, malarone resistant - Africa
20020118.3300). More information on this current situation from
authoritative sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
