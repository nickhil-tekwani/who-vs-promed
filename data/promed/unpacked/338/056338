[1 There were 3 cases of salmonellosis in 1 family in one of the tables in
the paper:
David L. Woodward, Rasik Khakhria and Wendy M. Johnson. Human Salmonellosis
Associated with Exotic Pets, JCM, Vol. 35, No. 11, Nov. 1997, 2786 - 2790.
[2 For those who want to see a case report of another marsupial-associated
case of salmonellosis, please see:

Iveson JB, Bradshaw SD. Salmonella javiana infection in an infant
associated with a marsupial, the quokka, Setonix brachyurus, in Western
Australia. J Hyg (Lond) 1973 Sep;71(3):423-32.
If you are interested in zoonotic infections, please look at my web site
(which I do need to update) <http://medicine.bu.edu/dshapiro/zoo1.htm> and
give me feedback on diseases that I have not included (with a relevant
journal citation). Thank you.

I would refer you to a paper published by Anand, C.M. and ourselves in the
Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases, Vol 8 No.6 pp.318-322
"Epidemiological investigation of _Salmonella tilene_ by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction". One of the several cases
reported in this paper was a child whose family kept sugar gliders as pets.
Both the child and the sugar gliders were infected with this organism.
In addition, the same strain of Salmonella was isolated from African pygmy
hedgehogs imported into Alberta as were the sugar gliders. It raises some
important questions about whether such animals should be permitted to be
imported from one country to another without adequate examination for
enteric and other potential pathogens. In any event I hope this paper might
be useful to you.

[If the Australian Sugar Gliders and the African Pigmy Hedgehogs shared the
same salmonella serotype, it is most likely that it was because they came
through the same retail chain &/or Canadian/USA wholesaler. If so and
presumably these people carry a range of exotic and domestic species the
problem is somewhat different than posed above. I believe that the
importation of pigmy hedgehogs may have been stopped, at least by USDA.
Maybe someone more experienced in the inspection of imported exotic species
would care to enlighten us on the inspection procedures. - Mod.MHJ
