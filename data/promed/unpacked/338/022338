[Krasnoyarsk is 856 kilometers to the west of Irkutsk in the Eastern
Siberian Region of the Russian Federation. Cases of tick-borne
encephalitis were reported in Irkutsk two weeks ago. In early May an alert
for tick-borne encephalitis was issued for the Russian Far East due to an
unusually high number of ticks noted early in the season. They are most
probably referring to Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis caused by a
flavovirus of the same name. - MPP
About 100 people, among them 13 children, have been hospitalised here this
year with the diagnosis of a tick-borne encephalitis [probably Russian
Spring-Summer encephalitis - MPP . This is twice as many as in the
corresponding period of 1998, an official at the city centre for sanitary
and epidemiological supervision told Itar-Tass on Friday.

[I wonder whether this increase is due to greater disease recognition,
poorer tick control, or other causes. Anyone know? - Mod.CHC
