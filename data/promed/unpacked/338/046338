Update since 30 Jun 2011
------------------------
In the EU/EEA, 892 HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] cases, including
32 deaths, and 3233 non-HUS cases, including 17 deaths, have so far
been reported. Since the last update, Germany reports 4 additional HUS
cases, 44 additional non-HUS STEC [Shiga toxin producing _Escherichia
coli_] cases and a new HUS fatality. The latest known date of onset of
diarrhea for cases is 26 Jun 2011 in Germany.

With regards to the outbreak in France (Bordeaux Region), 8 cases of
bloody diarrhea and a further 8 HUS cases have been identified as of
30 Jun 2011. Infection with _E. coli_ O104:H4 has been confirmed for 6
patients with HUS. 11 of the patients had attended the event in
Begles, where 9 reported having eaten sprouts; it concerns 7 women and
4 men, between 31 and 64 years of age.

Thorough investigations are ongoing. Strains from 3 patients tested
by the French authorities were compared to strains from patients
linked to the outbreak in Germany. The comparison showed that the 2
strains were indistinguishable. This suggests that these 2 events are
related to a common source.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)/ECDC joint rapid risk
assessment
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in Bordeaux, France:

On Fri 24 Jun 2011, France reported a cluster of 8 patients
presenting with bloody diarrhea or HUS in the Bordeaux area. By 28 Jun
2011, 15 cases of HUS or bloody diarrhea had been identified in this
area.

11 of them participated in an event in the commune of Begles, in
Bordeaux, on 8 Jun 2011. Of these, 8 have developed HUS, a severe
complication of _E. coli_ infection. 7 of the patients are women
between 31 and 64 years of age, and 4 are men between 34 and 41 years
of age. The date of onset of disease for these 11 patients was between
15 and 20 Jun 2011. In 3 of the patients, infection with _E. coli_
O104:H4 has been confirmed. The isolated strain characteristics are
similar to that of the strain isolated in the German outbreak with a
similar antibiotic resistance profile.

9 of the cases reported having eaten sprouts (fenugreek, mustard, and
rucola [arugula or rocket]) at the event on 8 Jun 2011, and for 2 the
information is not yet available. Leftover seeds of the sprouts are
currently being analyzed. These suspected sprouts were locally
produced, and were not imported from the farm implicated in the
outbreak in Germany (1). Initial investigations suggested that the
seeds used for the sprouts in France were distributed by a UK-based
company. Further investigations are now being carried out to determine
the origin of the suspected sprout seeds from this French cluster and
to establish if there is any link between that cluster and the large
outbreak reported from Germany. An analytical epidemiological study is
under way with the persons that attended the event on 8 Jun 2011.

On 28 Jun 2011, Sweden reported the existence of a confirmed case of
_E. coli_ O104:H4 in southern Sweden in an adult male who had no
history of recent travel to Germany and did not immediately recall the
consumption of sprouts during his incubation period, but this is being
further investigated.

There is no link between this current cluster in Bordeaux and a
cluster of HUS in children in northern France reported earlier in June
2011, caused by a different serotype of STEC and linked to the
consumption of beef burgers (2).

ECDC threat assessment for the EU
---------------------------------
_E. coli_ O104:H4 is a very rarely isolated pathotype from humans.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the French HUS cluster is an isolated
event unrelated to the recent German outbreak. The currently available
information on the French cluster is in favor of a link between these
2 health events for several reasons. The clinical picture of the
French HUS cases in Bordeaux is similar to that of the cases reported
from Germany: the cases are adults, the majority are women, and the
majority are presenting with HUS. The microbiological characteristics
of the isolated strain of _E. coli_ O104:H4 from 3 of the French HUS
patients seem similar to the isolated strain in the German outbreak,
including the antibiotic resistance profile. Finally, preliminary
investigations in Bordeaux show that all cases with microbiological
evidence of _E. coli_ O104:H4 infection attended the same social event
on 8 Jun 2011, consuming sprouts (fenugreek, mustard, and rucola) as
part of several of the dishes offered at that event.

Therefore, the occurrence of the French cluster, considering the
elements outlined above, might support one of the initial hypotheses
on the cause of the German outbreak, that is, that the seeds used for
sprouting and distributed to local producers or retail outlets
contained a level of _E. coli_ O104:H4 contamination, ultimately
leading to contaminated sprouts destined for human consumption.

Following this hypothesis, contamination of the seeds could have
occurred at any stage in the long and complex supply chain between
seed production, transport, packaging, and distribution. This would
also mean that other batches of potentially contaminated seeds are
still available within the EU and perhaps outside. Currently ongoing
intensive epidemiological, microbiological, and food trace-back and
trace-forward investigations will therefore be vital to further
confirm (or discard) this current hypothesis.

Based on the available information, the French HUS cluster is limited
to people who attended a social event on 8 Jun 2011. A recent study by
the German outbreak team shows that the median incubation period of
_E. coli_ O104:H4 is 8 days with a maximum duration of 15 days (3).
Therefore, it would seem unlikely that new cases would appear as a
direct result of exposure of the event. However, as with other _E.
coli_ infections, person-to-person transmission is possible, and
therefore new cases can also be expected in people who had close
contact with already identified cases in this part of Bordeaux.

However, pending the confirmation of the source of this cluster and
whether it is linked to contaminated seeds or sprouts, new cases, or
clusters might still be identified in the near future both in France
and elsewhere in the EU, such as the case in Sweden, or beyond.

Current efforts are targeted to 4 main areas:
Food source identification
--------------------------
Preliminary information on the French HUS cluster and detailed
information from the German outbreak investigations suggest that the
consumption of sprouts is the source of infection of in both
countries. The planned analytical epidemiological studies in Bordeaux
and the microbiological studies on leftover seeds and food items, and
on seeds from the retail outlet, may provide further evidence for this
hypothesis of infection. However, contamination is difficult to
identify in food items, including seeds, and it is possible that
microbiological evidence cannot be established.

Food trace-back investigations at the EU level
----------------------------------------------
The consumption of sprouts is the suspected vehicle of infection in
both the French cluster and the German outbreak, and the isolated _E.
coli_ O104:H4 strain in human cases in both countries is the same,
indicating a potential link between these 2 public health events.
Therefore, it is opportune to strengthen trace-back and trace-forward
investigations at national and EU level to identify what commonalities
exist between the sprout production chains (distributor chains,
distributors, retail outlets, and suppliers) in Germany and France,
and to identify any potentially contaminated batches of sprout seeds,
so as to implement recall notifications in order to remove the vehicle
of transmission quickly. Such trace-back investigations require close
collaboration between national level, EU level and international
public health and food safety institutions. They are currently being
coordinated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) taskforce
established for this purpose, following a request from the European
Commission.

The tracing back is progressing and has thus far shown that fenugreek
seeds imported from Egypt either in 2009 and/or 2010 are implicated in
both outbreaks. There is still much uncertainty about whether this is
truly the common cause of all the infections as there are currently no
positive bacteriological results. In particular, the 2009 lot appears
to be implicated in the outbreak in France and the 2010 has been
considered to be implicated in the German outbreak. Furthermore, this
link does not explain the most recent case in Sweden, currently under
investigation and in which, thus far, no consumption of sprouts has
been implicated.

All this is being further investigated. In particular, an
investigation on the distribution of seeds from these lots throughout
Germany and Europe has been urgently requested. The export of some of
the seeds imported from Egypt to another company in the UK (from where
seeds were exported to France) demonstrates the necessity of this
information.

It is also noted that seeds sold for sprouting are often sold as seed
mixes and that during re-packaging cross-contamination can not be
excluded. Therefore, any advice to consumers should at this time cover
all seeds and raw sprouts derived thereof.

Strengthening surveillance
--------------------------
If it is confirmed that there is a link between the HUS cases from
France and the recent outbreak in Germany, further cases or clusters
of might be expected elsewhere in the EU or beyond. For this reason,
increased awareness among clinical practitioners throughout the EU is
encouraged to quickly identify new cases of HUS and of STEC infections
that may be part of the existing outbreak in Germany and the cluster
in France or potentially signal the identification of new clusters of
infection. Such information should be communicated in a timely manner
to public health authorities in order to timely initiate
epidemiological and microbiological investigations and alert food
safety authorities. In addition, strengthening the capacity of
national reference laboratories to confirm this serotype rapidly would
be crucial.

Public communication
--------------------
Epidemiological, microbiological, and trace-back investigations are
currently ongoing to identify the origin of the contamination
responsible for these outbreaks. Consumption of sprouts has been
implicated as a possible source of the recent _E. coli_ O104:H4
outbreaks in Germany and France. Until the investigation has been
finalised, EFSA advises consumers not to grow sprouts for their own
consumption and not to eat bean sprouts or other sprouted seeds unless
they have been cooked thoroughly. Further preventative measures have
been highlighted in the previous ECDC/EFSA joint statement: Public
health advice on prevention of diarrheal illness with special focus on
Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC), also called
verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_
(EHEC) (available from
http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/escherichia_coli/prevention_measures/Pages/prevention_measures.aspx).

Conclusions
-----------
Based on the available information, this HUS cluster is limited to
people who attended a social event in Bordeaux, France on 8 Jun 2011.
However, a potential link to the outbreak of _E. coli_ O104:H4
reported from Germany between May and June [2011] is currently being
investigated, including the vehicle of transmission (germinated
sprouts, sprout seeds, or other food items). For the French cluster,
the suspicion of sprouts as the likely vehicle of transmission, as
well as the origin of the sprout contamination, will also need to be
established through further microbiological and trace-back
investigations. Pending the confirmation of the source of this
outbreak, new cases might still be identified in the near future.

Thus far, the consumption of fenugreek sprouts has been implicated as
a possible source of the recent _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in Germany
and France. Until the investigation has been finalized, ECDC and EFSA
strongly recommend advising consumers not to grow sprouts for their
own consumption and not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they
have been cooked thoroughly.

ECDC and EFSA will continue to closely monitor this event in
collaboration with the French and other national authorities, the
European Commission and the WHO. ECDC will update this rapid risk
assessment as necessary.

Outbreak of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and bloody diarrhoea die to
_Escherichia coli_ O104:H4; south west France, June 2011
--------------------------------------------------
[authors: Gault G, Weill FX, Mariani-Kurkdjian P, et al]

As of 12:00 28 Jun 2011, 15 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
or bloody diarrhea have been identified in the Gironde, south west
France. Investigations suggest the vehicle of transmission was
sprouts, served at an event in Begles on 8 Jun 2011. A strain of shiga
toxin-producing _E. coli_ O104:H4 has been isolated from 5 cases. This
strain is genetically related to the strain identified in the recent
O104:H4 outbreak in Germany, and shares the same virulence and
antimicrobial resistance characteristics.

Outbreak description
--------------------
On 22 Jun 2011, the Cellule interrrgionale d'epidemiologie (CIRE)
Aquitaine, the regional office of the French Institute for Public
Health Surveillance, was notified by the Robert Picque Hospital in
Bordeaux, south west France, of 8 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS) or bloody diarrhea. 6 of the cases lived in close proximity to
one another in the commune of Begles, in Bordeaux. Of these 6 cases, 4
were women (aged 41-78 years) and 2 were men (aged 34-41 years). Dates
of symptom onset were between 15 and 20 Jun 2011.

A case of HUS was defined as a person with acute renal failure and
either microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia and/or thrombocytopaenia. A
possible outbreak case was defined as a case of HUS or a case of
bloody diarrhea without an alternative diagnosis in the French
department (administrative region) of Gironde with a date of symptom
onset since 10 Jun 2011. Active case finding has been carried out
through contact with emergency, nephrology, and intensive care
departments of local hospitals, and general practitioners and
out-of-hours doctors, and through the existing paediatric HUS
surveillance network. Enhanced surveillance for cases of HUS or bloody
diarrhea in the rest of France has been implemented.

As of 1200 28 Jun 2011, a further 7 cases have been identified and
investigated, bringing the total number of cases investigated to date
to 15 cases of bloody diarrhea, 8 of whom have developed HUS.

Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
The initial 8 cases were interviewed using a standardized
semi-structured questionnaire exploring food consumption, travel
history and contact with other people with diarrhea in the 7 days
before symptom onset. Initially no common food, visits to markets,
restaurants, or events, animal contact, or leisure activity was
identified. None of the cases reported eating sprouts. Only 3 of the
cases shared the same municipal tap water network. One of the cases
had traveled away from home in France during the 7 days before symptom
onset and none had traveled abroad.

Given that a common exposure had not been identified, the
predominance of adult women among the cases and the recent experience
of the German sprout-related _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in Germany
(1,2), a 2nd questionnaire was developed that included an in-depth
exploration of vegetable consumption in the 2 weeks before illness.

Further questioning of the initial 8 cases and 7 newly identified
cases indicated that 11 of these 15 cases had attended an open day at
a children's community centre on 8 Jun 2011, at which a cold buffet
was served consisting of crudites (raw vegetables), 3 dips,
industrially produced gazpacho, a choice of 2 cold soups (carrot and
cumin, and courgette [zucchini]), pasteurized fruit juices, and
individual dishes composed of white grapes, tomatoes, sesame seeds,
chives, industrially produced soft cheese, and fresh fruit. The soups
were served with fenugreek sprouts, a small amount of which were also
placed on the crudite dishes. Mustard and rocket sprouts, still
growing on cotton wool, were used to decorate the crudite dishes. One
of the 11 cases has not yet been fully questioned because of a
deteriorating clinical condition, but is known to collect their
grandchildren from the centre and may have attended the event. The
remaining 4 cases had no obvious links to the centre.

Among the 11 cases with links to the centre, 9 reported consuming
sprouts at the event on 8 Jun 2011; 2 cannot yet be fully questioned.
Of these 11 cases, 8 have HUS and 3 bloody diarrhea. 7 are women aged
31-64 years and 4 are men aged 34-41 years. Dates of symptom onset are
between 15 and 20 Jun 2011. For the 8 cases with a well-defined date
of symptom onset, the incubation period ranges from 7 to 12 days
(median: 9 days).

Microbiological investigations
------------------------------
A strain of _E. coli_ O104:H4 possessing the stx2 gene, encoding
Shiga toxin, has been isolated from 5 HUS cases, all of whom consumed
sprouts at the event at the children's community centre. The strain is
negative for the genes coding for intimin (eae), haemolysin A (hlyA),
and EAST1 toxin (astA) and positive for the aggR gene, which regulates
the expression of aggregative adherence fimbriae. The antimicrobial
resistance pattern of the strain is similar to that seen in the
outbreak strain in recent _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in Germany (3)
(ampicillin resistant (R), cefotaxime R, ceftazidime R, imipenem
sensitive (S), streptomycin R, kanamycin S, gentamicin S,
sulfamethoxazole R, trimethoprim R, cotrimoxazole R, tetracycline R,
chloramphenicol S, nalidixic acid R and ciprofloxacin S). Our PCR
analysis indicates the presence of the extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase (ESBL) blaCTX-M-15 (group 1) gene and the penicillinase
blaTEM gene.

Strains of _E. coli_ O104:H4 isolated from 2 imported cases in France
linked to the O104:H4 outbreak in Germany in May and June 2011 were
compared by 2 molecular techniques (Rep-PCR (4,5) and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), using a standardized PFGE using either XbaI or
NotI (6)) with strains of O104:H4 isolated from 3 patients in the
Bordeaux outbreak. The results of these analyses show the genetic
relatedness of the outbreak strains in France and Germany. The profile
of the outbreak strains in the 2 countries differs from the profiles
of 2 _E. coli_ O104:H4 stx2 strains isolated in 2004 and 2009 and from
2 other strains of serotypes _E. coli_ O104:H21 and O104:H12.
Comparison by whole-genome sequencing and optical maps will be
performed in the coming days.

Food trace-back investigations
------------------------------
Food trace-back investigations were initiated on 24 Jun 2011. The
sprouts served at the event on 8 Jun 2011 had been grown from rocket,
mustard, and fenugreek seeds planted at the centre during 2 to 5 Jun
2011. The fenugreek seeds were first soaked in tap water for 24 hours
then placed in a jam jar topped with gauze and then rinsed with tap
water 2-3 times a day. The mustard and rocket seeds were germinated on
cotton wool moistened with tap water. They were harvested on 8 Jun
2011 to be served at the buffet. The seeds were purchased from a
branch of a national chain of gardening retailers, having been
supplied by a distributor in the UK. Leftover mustard and rocket
seeds, gazpacho, and tap water samples from the community centre have
been sent for microbiological analysis, as have samples of rocket,
mustard, fenugreek, and other seeds from the French gardening
retailer. Preliminary results are currently being analyzed.

Control measures
----------------
Consumers have been advised by the French authorities not to eat raw
sprouts, to thoroughly clean utensils used for germination, and
cooking, and to wash their hands thoroughly after contact with seeds
and sprouts. Colleagues in other European countries were informed of
this outbreak on 24 Jun 2011 via the Epidemic Intelligence Information
System (EPIS) and Early Warning Response System (EWRS) of the European
Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). A European Food
Standards Agency (EFSA) and ECDC joint rapid risk assessment has been
carried out (7) [see item 2 above]. This assessment strongly
recommends that consumers do not grow sprouts for their own
consumption and do not eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless thoroughly
cooked.

Conclusions
-----------
Preliminary data indicate that this outbreak shares the same novel
epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features identified in
the _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in Germany (8), including a
predominance of adult women among the cases, an unusually high
proportion of HUS cases among identified possible outbreak cases, a
longer median incubation period than expected for cases of Shiga
toxin-producing _E. coli_ infection, and a genetically related _E.
coli_ O104:H4 producing a CTX-M ESBL. The 2 outbreaks may share the
same vehicle of transmission. A cohort study of those attending the
event at the community centre and further epidemiological,
microbiological, and food trace-back investigations are underway. The
possibility of similar outbreaks in France or elsewhere in Europe
cannot be excluded.
