[As of 26 Mar 2014, the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by WHO in the latest MERS-CoV update was 200, including 85 deaths. This tally did not include the 3 cases (including one death) reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (17): Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20140320.2345849, nor did it include the 3 cases reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (18): Saudi Arabia 20140321.2347610. The addition of these prior 6 cases (including one death) and the current case reported on the Saudi MOH website today (28 Mar 2014) will raise the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 207 including 86 deaths.

Of note, according tweets from WHO on 26 Mar 2014, @WHO stated: "On [20 and 21 Mar 2014], #SaudiArabia announced 6 additional lab-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome #MERS" and @WHO stated that "Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of 206 lab-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, [including] 86 deaths." @WHO also stated: "Three of the latest lab-confirmed #MERS case[s] in #SaudiArabia (20, 21 Mar 2014) have histories of exposure to animals, [including] camels."
