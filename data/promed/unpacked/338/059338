44 year old Staten Island man positive for WNV; spray schedule updated
----------------------------------------------
New York City health commissioner, Neal L Cohen MD, joined Mayor Rudolph W
Giuliani to announce today that a 44 year old man from central Staten
Island who has viral meningitis has tested positive for West Nile virus.
The patient developed fever, headache, and joint and muscle pain on 5
August and remained ill for the next ten days, when he was admitted to a
local hospital on 16 August. He was treated in the hospital for 4 days,
discharged, and is now recovering at home. He works outdoors throughout
Staten Island, so the exact location of his exposure to the virus is
unknown. This is the third human case of West Nile virus in New York City
this year: one of the other cases was in Staten Island and the other in Queens.
In the past two weeks, 18 mosquito pools testing positive for West Nile
virus have been identified in Staten Island. Targeted, ground based
spraying is to be carried out overnight on Sat 1 Sept in western and
central residential areas and in non-residential areas south of the Staten
Island Expressway .
