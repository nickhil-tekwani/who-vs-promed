The number of animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
Sulaibiya has increased lately due to the failure of the Public
Authority for Agricultural Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAAFR) to
inoculate these animals, deputy chairman of Kuwait Animal Resources
Society (KARS) Mud'hi Al-Basman told Al-Anba. Al-Basman also blamed
the livestock traders who offloaded imported cows at the ports
without giving proper vaccination to the animals in addition to the
absence of a veterinary clinic in the area.

On the other hand, sources said PAAAFR will inspect farms and animal
pens in Kabad, Sulaibiya on Sunday [3 Feb 2008] to check on the
health of animals particularly the cows in view of reports on the
incidence of [FMD] in the area. Sources, disclosed the authority,
will form a team of experts with specializations on the disease to
inspect the area.

State minister for Municipality Affairs and Public Works, Mussa
Al-Sarraf, has asked PAAAFR chairman Eng Jassem Al-Bader to clarify
reports on the alleged FMD outbreak in the area and submit a list of
measures the authority has, so far, taken to control the outbreak.

In response to Al-Sarraf, Al-Bader confirmed the reported cases were
isolated and the authority took the necessary precautionary measures
to put the situation under control.

[Kuwait, a country dependent upon import of live ruminants for
slaughter -- similar to other Gulf states -- has been plagued with
multiple FMDV serotypes throughout the years, demonstrating that its
trade connections include infected countries in Asia and Africa.
Such trade connections may have, at times, further ramifications with
consequent spread further within the Middle East.

According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD,
Pirbright (WRLFMD), the following serotypes were recorded in Kuwait as
follows: serotype O (2006), A (1981?), SAT1 (1970), C (1982?), Asia 1
(1981?), SAT2 (2000). In 2006, WRLFMD isolated and identified 2 virus
strains from samples received. The strains were registered as O
KUW/2/2006 and O KUW/3/2006. Both belonged to the ME-SA topotype, and
the PanAsia strain. See
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/kuw.htm>.

Further information on the current suspected outbreaks is requested.
If affirmative, samples should be sent the soonest to a reference
laboratory for serotyping, and official notification submitted. - Mod.AS
