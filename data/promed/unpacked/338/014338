SINGAPORE (AP)--An elderly woman has died and 2 other people are
in hospital after contracting malaria, Singapore's environment ministry
said Wednesday. The 71-year-old woman died Monday in a hospital
after contracting a strain of the disease, the ministry said in a statement.
All cases of malaria must be reported to the authorities in Singapore,
where the government carries out regular fogging of areas where
mosquitoes, which carry the disease, are found.
A 45-year-old man and his 8-year-old daughter -- who lived in the
same condominium as the dead woman -- are both in stable condition
in hospital after contracting the same strain of the disease, the statement
said.
The ministry said it would screen all foreign workers who live near the
victims for the disease, though it could not immediately confirm if the
3 people who contracted malaria are from Singapore or elsewhere.
Latest figures from the ministry show that 63 cases of malaria were
reported to authorities by the end of April [2001, 32 less than at the
same time last year.
Symptoms of malaria include fever, shivering, pain in the joints,
headache, repeated vomiting, generalized convulsions and coma. If left
untreated, it can lead to death.
In the wake of the latest cases, the ministry has warned that anyone in
Singapore who develops a fever should seek medical advice.

[Malaria transmission is perfectly possible in Singapore and
asymptomatic carriers visiting Singapore could be the source of
infection. With prompt case recognition and treatment and the rigorous
vector control in Singapore it is unlikely that there will be a larger
outbreak. - Mod.EP
