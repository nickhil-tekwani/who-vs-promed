Tomato blight caused by wet Alabama weather
-------------------------------------------
The cool, wet weather conditions we've been experiencing across
Alabama this spring [2009] are very favorable to a fungal disease we
don't see every year, but it is a problem this year. The disease is
called "late blight." This is a fungus that likes wet conditions that
is, frequent rainfall and/or overhead irrigation), overcast skies,
and cool temperatures.

The disease can destroy a patch of tomatoes or potatoes in a matter
of days. One of the best controls for late blight is an extended
period of hot, dry weather. The last time I recall a significant late
blight outbreak was back in 1995. That year we had weather patterns
similar to what we are currently experiencing. In 1995, we basically
had a late blight epidemic in home gardens and in low-acreage farms
across the state. The disease was not a significant problem in large
commercial fields that year because most commercial growers follow a
weekly fungicide spray program.

Control options include avoiding overhead irrigation and a fungicide
spray program. This disease spreads very quickly so don't wait too
long to start spraying. Try to treat when the product will have a few
hours of drying time.

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like
organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop
loss. To a lesser extent, it can also affect other solanaceous crops
such as eggplant and capsicum. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems,
and fruit of tomato, causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in
potato it affects leaves as well as tubers. The disease can spread
rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. It is spread
by contaminated plant and other material, wind and water. Under
favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid
than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and includes
phytosanitary measures, removal of solanaceous weeds and volunteer
crop plants serving as pathogen reservoirs, limiting free moisture in
the crop, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material
(tomato transplants, potato seed tubers), and fungicide sprays of
crops. Crop rotation with non-hosts may reduce available inoculum.
While commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late
blight, development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by
the adaptability of the pathogen, with new strains evolving all the time.
