2 buck deer taken during this year's Utah muzzleloader hunt have tested
positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), the Division of Wildlife
Resources announced on 17 Oct 2005.
The 1st deer was a yearling buck taken near the south end of Flaming Gorge
Reservoir. This is the 1st CWD positive deer found in Daggett County. Other
CWD positive deer have been found in the past just 20 miles to the south,
near Vernal. The 2nd deer to test positive was a mature buck taken on the
LaSal Mountains in south eastern Utah.
Both of the hunters who took the deer have been notified that their animals
tested positive for CWD. "We've tested approximately 450 deer and elk so
far this year, and these are the only animals that have tested positive for
CWD," said Leslie McFarlane, wildlife disease specialist for the DWR.
"Nearly all of the testing has been completed on samples collected during
the archery and muzzleloader hunts. We expect to collect nearly 2000
samples during the rifle deer hunt that starts this weekend."
The Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Logan is testing the samples
for the DWR. The latest finds bring to 20 the number of deer that have
tested positive for CWD since the disease was first found in Utah in
February 2003. 14 of the 20 deer have come from the LaSal Mountain area,
where DWR biologists estimate about 2 per cent of the deer have the disease.
Of the remaining deer, 4 came from the Vernal area, 1 was taken near the
south end of Flaming Gorge, and one was killed near Fountain Green in
central Utah.
CWD is fatal to deer and elk that contract it. However, according to the
World Health Organization, "There is currently no evidence that CWD in
cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans."

Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) personnel are in the process of
monitoring the presence and prevalence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in
the State of Utah. A small number of deer harvested in the state have
tested positive for CWD during the past 4 years. Sportsmen participating in
the general season rifle hunt, which opens 22 Oct 2005, are encouraged to
participate in this disease monitoring effort.
Testing for the disease is done by removing the lymph nodes from the throat
of the deer. The abnormal prions (proteins) indicative of CWD tend to
accumulate in these lymph node tissues. Lymph node samples from each deer
sampled are sent to a laboratory in Logan and hunters can learn whether the
deer has tested positive for CWD within 4 weeks.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the disease can be
transmitted to humans by eating or handling meat of infected animals.
However, it is advised that hunters avoid consumption and direct contact
with brain tissues, spinal fluids, and lymph nodes.
DWR personnel will be taking disease samples from deer harvested throughout
the south eastern region. Hunters may encounter officers in the field or at
check stations. Hunters who are not contacted and have questions regarding
CWD can contact the Price DWR office at (435) 636-0260 during business
hours, or (435) 820-8921 during non-business hours.

Officials from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department announced today
that 2 hunters have been cited for illegally importing whole deer from New
York State, a state where chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected.
The 2 deer were confiscated and destroyed as part of ongoing attempts to
protect New Hampshire's deer and moose populations from the threat of CWD,
a disease -- fatal to some members of the deer family -- that is found in
16 US states and Canadian provinces.
"The threat posed by CWD to New Hampshire's deer herd is of serious concern
to us," said Lee Perry, Fish and Game's executive director. "Hunters who
hunt out of state need to abide by the rules, which are designed to allow
people to bring their deer back to New Hampshire without putting the
state's herd at risk." The confiscated deer from New York, not yet
butchered, were incinerated to destroy any potentially contagious material.
Current NH regulations allow for the importation into New Hampshire of only
deboned meat, antlers, upper canine teeth, and/or hides or capes with no
part of the head attached of deer and elk, from the 16 states and provinces
where CWD has been confirmed. These include Alberta, Canada; Colorado;
Illinois; Kansas; Minnesota; Montana; Nebraska; New Mexico; New York;
Oklahoma; Saskatchewan, Canada; South Dakota; Utah; Wisconsin; West
Virginia (the newest addition to the list), and Wyoming.
Antlers attached to skull caps or canine teeth must have all soft tissue
removed. More information on CWD is found on pages 6 and 60 of the current
New Hampshire Hunting Digest or [go to the URL above and click here] for
New Hampshire-related questions and answers about CWD.
A CWD monitoring and testing program for wild deer has been conducted in
New Hampshire by Fish and Game biologists since 2002. There is no evidence
that this disease exists in the New Hampshire deer herd, and the rules and
testing program are designed to prevent exposure via infected animals being
imported from other areas.
CWD is a contagious neurological disease that is fatal to deer, moose, elk,
and other members of the cervid (deer) family. It is classified as a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or TSE, and it attacks the brains
of infected animals, resulting in their becoming emaciated, exhibiting
abnormal behavior and eventually dying.
State officials remind hunters and others who enjoy eating venison that CWD
is a wildlife management issue, not a public health issue. There is no
evidence that CWD is linked to disease in humans.

[In states where CWD is present, it would not be unexpected to find it
during the hunting season. Many states have a hunter surveillance program.
Most often the harvested animal is taken to a station where samples are
collected for testing for CWD.
Clearly NH is being very diligent in its efforts to keep CWD out of the
state. However, there is no mention that these animals were tested for the
disease.
It is believed that infected deer from other states transported into NY for
taxidermy work introduced the disease into NY. The taxidermist in NY did
not dispose of the deer offal in the recommended manner, but rather spread
it around the fence line, thus giving curious captive and wild deer
opportunity to come into contact with the intestines of the infected deer.
Since prions are believed to be presented to the neurological system
through the intestines, and cervidae are curious animals that taste what is
new in their environment, it is possible this was the method of
introduction of the disease to NY.
For hunters hunting outside of their home state, it appropriate to know the
regulations regarding bringing carcasses home. - Mod.TG]
