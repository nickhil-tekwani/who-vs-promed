Swine flu confirmed in Wairarapa
--------------------------------
Test results have confirmed a highly infectious strain of flu
[influenza virus] affecting the community in Wairarapa is definitely
swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus infection]. Hundreds of
Wairarapa children are off school this week as the flu sweeps through
the community. Up to 45 percent of students in the Wairarapa are at
home sick at the moment.

Dr Annette Nesdale from Wellington's Regional Public Health service
says it's a particularly severe outbreak and is spreading very
quickly. She says children are presenting with coughs, headaches, a
temperature, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Dr Nesdale says anyone with flu-like symptoms should stay home, and
keep up their fluids.

[According to the WHO update number 111 of 25 Jul 2010, rates of
influenza-like illness in New Zealand have been below the seasonal
baseline but have increased steadily over the past month. Recent
reports suggest that more significant, but geographically uneven
increases may have occurred during the 3rd week of July 2010.
Although the number of influenza virus detections remains low, the
majority of virus isolates in New Zealand have been influenza
pandemic (H1N1) virus. According to the above report the outbreak in
Wairarapa appears to be affecting school-age children predominantly.

Wairarapa is a region in the south-eastern corner of the North Island
of New Zealand, east of metropolitan Wellington and south-west of the
Hawke's Bay region. It can be located using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
