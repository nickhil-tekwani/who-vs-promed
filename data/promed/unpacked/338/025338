Two horses in Sonoma County tested positive for equine influenza, and others in the barn are showing clinical signs consistent with the same disease. An attending veterinarian has reported 2 cases of equine influenza have been confirmed in Sonoma County, California, as of [Tue 29 Jan 2019].

The 1st was a 2-year-old Lusitano gelding with onset of clinical signs on [Sat 12 Jan 2019], including cough and nasal discharge. The horse is still alive.

The 2nd was a 10-year-old Warmblood gelding with onset of clinical signs on [Tue 15 Jan 2019], including cough, nasal discharge and fever. The horse is still alive.

The veterinarian noted several other horses in the barn with respiratory signs of cough, nasal discharge and fever are being monitored, but they have not been confirmed with equine influenza.

This information was provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center.

[Hopefully these horses will recover. Owners of horses should vaccinate their animals prior to show or if they are housed in a public barn. It is a good idea to keep your horse current on all vaccinations at all times.

Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among naive horses. Horses 1 to 5 years old are the most susceptible to infection. Orthomyxovirus A/equine-2 was first recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries, except for New Zealand and Iceland. China, Japan, and Australia experienced devastating epidemics of equine influenza affecting tens of thousands of horses in 2007. Before that, equine influenza had not been reported in China since 1993, in Japan since 1972, and had never been reported in Australia.

Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild, inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift seen with specific strains of A/equine-2 virus in some parts of the world.
