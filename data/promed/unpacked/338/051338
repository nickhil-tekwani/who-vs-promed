[1] Guinea pig-adapted Ebola
Date: Sat 12 Nov 2014

We established a gp-adapted Ebola transmission model in guinea pigs to determine the mechanisms behind virus spread. Mucosal infection of guinea pigs is an efficient model for gp-adapted Ebola transmission. Ebola Zaire virus (EBOV) transmission is currently thought to occur primarily by direct contact with infectious material. To establish an EBOV transmission model, groups of 6 guinea pigs (gps) were challenged intranasally (i.n.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 000 times the 50 percent lethal dose (LD50) of gp-adapted EBOV, and naive gps were then introduced as cage mates for contact exposure at one day postinfection (p.i.).

Transmission was more efficient from i.n.- than from i.p.-challenged gps, with 17 percent versus 83 percent of naive gps surviving exposure, respectively. Virus shedding was detected beginning at 3 days p.i. from both i.n.- and i.p.-challenged animals. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings show that i.n.-infected gps display enhanced lung pathology and EBOV antigen in the trachea.

The results suggest that i.n.-challenged gps are more infectious to naive animals than their systemically infected counterparts and that transmission occurs through direct contact with infectious materials, including those transported through air movement over short distances. ... - more

[Roger Feldman: "I wonder whether any autopsies are being done on Ebola cases. If they are, what pathology is found in the trachea, and lungs? Are respiratory symptoms commonly observed? Is there human pathology to suggest that late transmission might be respiratory, even though respiratory transmission could not be common. Occam's razor might suggest that multiple routes of infection are uncommon, but we have food-borne cases, though it seems uncommon, and water-borne cases perhaps associated with funeral washing."]

[2] Orphan care

HUJ has not left the room and cordoned-off porch for 3 weeks. She eats bowls of rice and sauce, slid underneath a nylon rope she cannot cross. She has lost her family: her parents, her aunt and uncle, her one-year-old son. But the 17-year-old says defiantly, "I feel happy because I am protecting others."

HUJ defends some 40 orphans at the St. George Foundation Interim Care Center ICC) from an invisible enemy, Ebola, which continues to ravage her country. Because of uncertainty about who, among a flood of children orphaned by Ebola, might carry the disease, she has been hired to stand guard just in case. She cares for every new arrival in the roped-off room. As an Ebola survivor, she is considered immune to the disease.

Around the time she checked in, an incident at St. George shook the orphanage's director, Justina Conteh, to the bone. A 9-year-old had been released to her care from a nearby clinic, the Jui Holding Center, after the child's mother died of Ebola. Doctors issued the girl a certificate declaring her Ebola-free. Yet within days of the child's arrival, Conteh noticed that she ran a fever. The girl was rushed to Hastings hospital, where she was diagnosed with the disease.

Conteh, a social worker, co-founded this interim care center (ICC) a decade ago. She has cared for children who lost their parents in Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war, who were abandoned on the street and who were severely abused. Now she's handling an influx of kids orphaned by Ebola. But this -- the possibility that a single child might wipe out her entire center -- worries her more than any previous challenge. Since Ebola spreads through bodily fluids, the central message from the government is to avoid touching. Yet no matter what, Conteh says, young children cannot be prevented from playing with one another and from hugging the aides who care for them. "They're children," she says. "We all touch each other. We have to."

But she needed someone to tend to the newly orphaned quarantined kids. She asked Jalloh if she might be interested in the job of collecting and caring for new arrivals. Sierra Leone's government, with support from GOAL [Global Overseas Adoptees Link], UNICEF and others, has begun to construct observation interim care centers (OICCs), where children suspected of Ebola can be quarantined for 21 days before they move on to places like St. George. At least 6 OICCs have been constructed in the country thus far.

According to the plan, children in OICCs will be divided into cohorts by age and tended to by trained nurses wearing personal protective equipment. Although Ebola survivors seem immune, Kirk says they should still don gloves and rubber boots to minimize risk, however unlikely it may seem. After the Ebola outbreak ends and schools reopen, she intends to become a nurse. ... - more

[3] Epidemiologists
Date: Mon 5 Jan 2015

http://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-epidemiologists-5jan15/2586125.html


The World Health Organization recently called for 900 more epidemiologists to join the battle against Ebola in West Africa. That's triple the current number. Epidemiologists study the patterns of disease outbreaks to determine how they spread and where they may go next.

Upon hearing the WHO announcement regarding epidemiologists, Dr. Rossi Hassad said it's about time. Hassad is an epidemiologist himself and a professor at Mercy College in New York. "An epidemiologist is a health care professional who is concerned with the distribution and determinants of diseases in a community. They operate at the population level rather than the individual or clinical level. They are investigators, or what we called detectives of medicine. And they focus largely on intelligence -- data about morbidity and mortality -- meaning illness, death and symptoms," he said. The information they gather is used to create a geographical map and timeline of the outbreak. Epidemiologists, though, do not treat patients.

"So an epidemiologist will be analyzing data, would be presenting data, will be using various algorithms to help to explain and predict where symptoms are occurring and what we might see next. So it's largely analytical work that an epidemiologist does," he said. An algorithm is used in math and computer science. It's described as a step-by-step procedure for calculations.

Hassad said epidemiologists are a necessity in the fight against Ebola. He said there's a saying regarding infectious diseases: "A case anywhere is a risk everywhere. With Ebola, a single case can reignite an epidemic. And you need every contact from every case. And it's good, old-fashioned epidemiology that helps us to find those contacts and properly assess them," he said.

He said epidemiologists pay "strict attention to psychosocial and sociocultural factors and dynamics." One of the most important things they will do, he said, is set up a comprehensive surveillance system.

"We have had a huge focus on the clinical component of this epidemic. And that doesn't interrupt the chain of transmission. So you have a steady flow of cases with a huge focus on treatment," he said. Besides being critical of the initial slow response to the outbreak, Hassad said there has been a lack of collaboration between the clinical and public health arms of medicine. "At times, the information and narrative that we have heard and seen suggested one of competition -- protection of turf -- rather than collaboration and cooperation. And I hope that for 2015 and beyond we could improve on that."

Similar complaints of a lack of cooperation and openness were heard during the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. ... - more

Schools in Ebola-ravaged Liberia will reopen in February 2015, 6 months after they were closed in a bid to contain the spread of the killer virus, the education ministry has said. "We ask all schools to take the necessary measures for the reopening of schools next semester, which is February 2015," the ministry said in a statement read out on Mon [5 Jan 2015].

"All schools have to get equipped with chlorine water, thermometers, and all have to put in place all measures recommended by the health ministry for the prevention of the virus," the statement added. The move comes as Liberia, one of 3 West African countries at the epicentre of the current Ebola outbreak, has seen a steady decrease in new cases in recent weeks.

[5] Ebola and pregnancy
Date: Sun 4 Jan 2015
Source: Washington Post [edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/could-a-pregnant-woman-change-the-way-we-think-about-ebola/2015/01/04/a5ed5a7f-73a6-427b-b515-6f8f7e77801e_story.html


Pregnant Ebola patients rarely survive. And their babies never do. Even as doctors watched a succession of Ebola-stricken pregnant women die or lose their babies in recent months, they weren't entirely sure why it was happening. Perhaps the mothers' immune systems were weakened, making them more susceptible to the incapacitating fever that accompanies the disease, or maybe the virus pooled in fetal fluid. Some of the babies died early in pregnancy, others closer to term.

"There have been no neonatal survivors" is how Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician with the Division of Reproductive Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, put it flatly.

When [a woman from Sierra Leone] came down with [Ebola], already [7] weeks pregnant, everything was working against her. Maternity wards had started closing amid fears that pregnant women with the virus would infect anyone who attempted to assist their deliveries. Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, which gush during childbirth. She [improved with treatment and] was released in mid-October [2014] with a certificate declaring her a survivor. [But the outcome for the baby was still unknown.] Her pregnancy is entering its 5th month, and the fetus appears healthy.

Although the research is in the early stages, many obstetricians have suggested that Ebola might pool in a woman's placenta even after it has disappeared from the rest of her body. The same is true of other diseases, such as malaria. In other words, Kabia could test negative for Ebola but her baby could still have it.

Some doctors and nurses have begun testing the fetuses of the miscarried infants of Ebola victims. The research isn't formal, and it's still in an early stage, but the results have been startling. Grazia Caleo, an epidemiologist for Doctors Without Borders [MSF], remembers the 1st fetus she tested last year [2014]. "It was the highest viral load we've ever seen. Just off the charts," said [Jamieson, the CDC specialist].

Doctors and scientists at the CDC are trying to create a registry of Ebola survivors, with each of their cases documented in as much detail as possible. The hope is that patterns will emerge and anomalies can be studied so the world's understanding of the disease will improve.

For scientists, this Ebola outbreak is more than just a horrible tragedy. It's a once-in-a-lifetime research opportunity that could help prevent, or contain, the next epidemic. The last study on pregnant Ebola patients was conducted in 1995, during an outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, where a total of 315 people came down with the disease, just a handful of them expectant mothers. This outbreak has infected more than 20 000 people.

At the beginning of the HIV outbreak, nearly half of all pregnant HIV patients passed the virus on to their babies. It took years, but scientists learned that by using anti-retroviral drugs, they could cut the mother-to-child transmission rate to less than 5 percent. For now, in every recorded case, mothers with Ebola pass the disease to their children.

[The study to which the report refers was conducted in 1995 during an outbreak of Ebola in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): Mupapa K et al., Ebola hemorrhagic fever and pregnancy. J Infect Dis._ 1999 Feb;179 Suppl 1:S11-2 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S11.long.

Abstract:
"15 (14 percent) of 105 women with Ebola hemorrhagic fever hospitalized in the isolation unit of the Kikwit General Hospital (Democratic Republic of the Congo) were pregnant. In 10 women (66 percent), the pregnancy ended with an abortion. In 3 of them, a curettage was performed, and all 3 received a blood transfusion from an apparently healthy person. One woman was prematurely delivered of a stillbirth. Four pregnant women died during the 3rd trimester of their pregnancy. All women presented with severe bleeding. Only one survived; she had a curettage because of an incomplete abortion after 8 months of amenorrhea. The mortality among pregnant women with Ebola hemorrhagic fever (95.5 percent) was slightly but not significantly higher than the overall mortality observed during the Ebola epidemic in Kikwit (77 percent; 245/316 infected persons)."

CDC has issued a document: "Guidance for Screening and Caring for Pregnant Women with Ebola in U.S. Hospitals," since obstetric management of pregnant women with Ebola, particularly decisions about modes of delivery for women in labor, needs to consider risks to the woman, risks of exposure for healthcare providers, and potential benefits to the neonate. http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/guidance-maternal-health.html. - Mod.LK]

6 Jan 2015: Clinical trial in Liberia starts for Ebola anti-viral drug
http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/clinical-trial-in-liberia-starts-for-ebola-anti-viral-drug-1.2174655

A clinical drug trial is now underway at a major health centre in Liberia's capital to determine whether a medication already used to treat other viruses could help those suffering from Ebola.

The drug called brincidofovir is being tested in patients at the ELWA 3 centre operated by Doctors Without Borders [MSF], the group said. Ebola, which has no licensed treatment or cure, has killed more than 8000 people in West Africa over the past year. "It must be stressed that it is not a miracle cure, and it is still not known whether it will help patients survive the virus," the medical charity said in announcing the start of the drug trial this week.

Brincidofovir is an antiviral drug being developed to treat several types of viruses, including one that infects patients undergoing bone marrow transplants. All new patients confirmed to be Ebola positive by blood test at the charity's ELWA 3 centre will be informed about the trial and can decide whether they would like to participate, the group said. Those who opt out will receive the usual supportive care.

Brincidofovir is not the only drug being considered for use in treating Ebola. Another drug -- ZMapp -- healed all 18 monkeys infected with the deadly virus in one recent study. Experimental doses of ZMapp also were given to several humans who suffered from Ebola before the manufacturer's supply ran out months ago. It was not known whether the doses of ZMapp helped the patients who recovered.

A 3rd drug -- The TKM-Ebola injection, by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals of Canada -- works by blocking genes that help the Ebola virus reproduce and spread. It has been used in at least one patient and is said to be in limited supply. Other patients have received blood donations from Ebola survivors who had developed antibodies to the virus.

5 Jan 2015 Merck-NewLink Ebola Vaccine Tests Resume at Lower Dose
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/05/us-health-ebola-vaccine-idUSKBN0KE0XP20150105

The clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck and NewLink resumed on Mon 5 Jan 2014, at a lower dose after a pause to assess complaints of joint pains in some volunteers, the University of Geneva hospital said. The Geneva hospital had announced on Fri 11 Dec 2014 that its vaccine trial had been suspended as a precautionary measure after 4 patients complained of joint pains. On Mon 5 Dec 2014, the hospital said 10 of 59 volunteers who received the vaccine had felt pains in their joints "similar to rheumatism" after some 2 weeks, but these symptoms had disappeared rapidly without any treatment.

Swissmedic, the Swiss regulatory agency, and ethics and safety committees have approved the resumption of the trial at a lower dose, the hospital said in a statement. "The 2nd part of this clinical trial will now test a dose of 0.3 million vaccine particles, which should be better tolerated by volunteers and will hopefully trigger the production of enough antibodies," it said, noting that the initial phase had 10 million to 50 million vaccine particles. "Fortunately," it said, the Merck-NewLink candidate vaccine "seems able to induce the production of antibodies at lower doses than those previously used" in the Geneva trial.

Vaccinations have now resumed for the last 56 volunteers, who will receive either a low dose of the vaccine or a placebo by groups of 15 each week through January 2015, it said. Geneva researchers are constantly exchanging information with teams carrying out similar studies in Canada, Gabon, Germany and the United States, the hospital said. Final results are expected in March 2015.

A separate trial of a GlaxoSmithKline Ebola vaccine on 120 volunteers has proved "satisfactory," the University of Lausanne Hospital said on Mon 11 Dec 2014. [Byline: Stephanie Nebehay]

5 Jan 2015 Blood Filter Trial Cleared
http://www.hcplive.com/articles/Ebola-Blood-Filter-Trial-Cleared

Aethlon Medical, a San Diego, CA device manufacturer, has FDA approval for a new clinical protocol to test a blood filtering device for use in treating Ebola patients. The device, called the Hemopurifier, can be connected to a dialysis machine for one-use filtering of the blood to remove virus particles. The 2 Jan [2015] FDA approval clears the way for a planned US clinical trial of the device. The company also has an ongoing trial to test the Hemopurifier's use in reducing the viral load in patients infected with Hepatitis C. The company's hope is that the device could be used to treat patients with many life-threatening viral infections, including HIV.

The filter made headlines late last year [2014] when Helmut Geiger, MD, head of nephrology at Goethe University, Frankfurt Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany reported at a major medical meeting that he treated a Ugandan Ebola patient in Frankfurt with the device and cured him. The patient was seriously ill at the time, unconscious and going into multiple organ failure. His treatment included mechanical ventilation, continuous dialysis and vasopressor medications. He has fully recovered.

Treatment involves a 6-8 hour therapy continued until the viral load drops below 1000 copies/ml. Geiger's patient had 400 000 virus copies in his blood, but after a 6.5-hour treatment, that load dropped to under 1000, the doctor reported at the annual American Society of Nephrology meeting last year [2014].
