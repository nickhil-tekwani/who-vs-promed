[Please note that the moderator comment on the 13 Jun 2000 posting was
awaiting confirmation of the report from Ulan Bator. This article confirms
the report and adds an additional case. There was also a debate as to
whether the anthrax activity was in Inner Mongolia or the country. As this
press release comes from Ulan Bator, this also confirms that the activity
occurred in the country of Mongolia. -Mod.MPP
Mongolia Says Anthrax Outbreaks Under Control
----------------------------------------------
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (Reuters) - Mongolia has brought under control a
series of anthrax outbreaks in which 2 people were infected with the highly
contagious disease, civil defense officials said Wednesday. "We have
stopped the spread of the disease and thousands of animals are being
vaccinated," senior civil defense official Ikhbayar told Reuters.
"Urgent measures are being taken because anthrax can be transferred to
people," he said. "Officials are paying a lot of attention to this."
Two people, a man and a woman, were treated for the disease in Lun county,
some 80 miles from Ulan Bator. One was in satisfactory condition, but the
state of the other was not immediately known, officials said. The disease
had also erupted in 4 other areas and tens of thousands of animals had been
vaccinated, Ikhbayar said. The movement of animals in and out of the
affected areas had been banned until all livestock, on which many
Mongolians depend, were vaccinated, he said.
Mongolia's herds have been devastated over the last year by drought
followed by an unusually harsh winter which buried under snow the
grasslands on which they usually feed.
