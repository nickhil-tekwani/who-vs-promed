The Austrian Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Hubert Hrabcik
<Hubert.Hrabcik@bmgf.gv.at> wants to clarify that the rabies-infected dog was
not brought from Austria to Morocco.
The dog joined the Austrian travellers during their trip in Morocco.

[Dr Strauss is gratefully acknowledged for this important clarification.
Confirmation of the suspected rabies case in the Austrian citizen currently
hospitalised in Morocco is anticipated.
If confirmed, this tragic event will become another example underlining the
warning to visitors never to engage with local canines during visits to
rabies-endemic territories. - Mod.AS]
