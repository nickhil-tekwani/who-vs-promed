Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report 15 Oct 2014 [data as of end of 12 Oct 2014]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 8997 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 7 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the USA) up to the end of 12 Oct [2014]. There have been 4493 deaths.

Data for epidemiological week 41 are incomplete, with missing data for 12 Oct [2014] from Liberia. This reflects the challenging nature of data gathering in countries with widespread and intense EVD transmission. These challenges remain particularly acute in Liberia, where there continues to be a mismatch between the relatively low numbers of new cases reported through official clinical surveillance systems on one hand, and reports from laboratory staff and 1st responders of large numbers of new cases on the other. Efforts are ongoing to reconcile different sources of data, and to rapidly scale-up capacity for epidemiological data gathering throughout each country with widespread and intense transmission.

It is clear, however, that the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is deteriorating, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD. An increase in new cases in Guinea is being driven by a spike in confirmed and suspected cases in the capital, Conakry, and the nearby district of Coyah. In Liberia, problems with data gathering make it hard to draw any firm conclusions from recent data. There is almost certainly significant under-reporting of cases from the capital Monrovia. There does appear to have been a genuine fall in the number of cases in Lofa district, but a concerted effort will be required to sustain that drop in cases and translate it into an elimination of EVD in that area. In Sierra Leone, intense transmission is still occurring in the capital Freetown and the surrounding districts.

Of the countries with localized transmission, Nigeria and Senegal are now approaching 42 days since the date of last potential contact with a probable or confirmed case. Both Spain and the United States continue to monitor potential contacts... -- more

[This report is full of very detailed tables and graphs, but they are built on admittedly uncertain data; for example, Sierra Leone has officially reported 120 more probable deaths than probable cases, and Liberia does not provide official data breaking down its 2458 deaths into confirmed, probable, and suspected deaths. - Mod.JW]

Are the Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal over?
----------------------------------------------------
Not quite yet.
If the active surveillance for new cases that is currently in place continues, and no new cases are detected, WHO will declare the end of the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Senegal on Fri 17 Oct [2014]. Likewise, Nigeria is expected to have passed through the requisite 42 days, with active surveillance for new cases in place and none detected, on Mon 20 Oct [2014]... -- more

[3] Sierra Leone: soldier positive; other contacts self-quarantined
Date: Tue 14 Oct 2014

A Sierra Leone soldier has tested positive for Ebola but he is not a member of, and had no contact with, a battalion of peacekeepers waiting to deploy to Somalia, a government spokesman said Tue 14 Oct 2014]. Meanwhile, Liberia's transport minister said she was voluntarily isolating herself inside her home after her driver died of Ebola. The 2 situations underscore the precautions being taken to minimize the spread of the deadly disease, and the risks inherent in the movement of people.

In another example of the disease's relentless march, Doctors Without Borders [MSF] said Tue [14 Oct 2014] that 16 of its staff members have been infected with Ebola and that 9 have died [2 were internationals, both under treatment overseas. - Mod.JW] The toll highlights the high risk of caring for Ebola patients even at well-equipped and properly staffed treatment centers.

Angela Bush, Liberia's transport minister, said her last contact with her driver, who died over the weekend [11-12 Oct 2014] of the disease, was on 3 Oct 2014. She did not know he was sick with Ebola until after his death, she said. She is not showing any symptoms of the disease, but Liberia's government has asked people to keep themselves isolated for 21 days if they think they have been exposed. The country's chief medical officer put herself under quarantine about 2 weeks ago, after her office assistant died of Ebola.

Fear of Ebola's spread has already slowed the deployment of a battalion of Sierra Leone troops, who were supposed to relieve soldiers serving with an African Union [AU] mission to protect the Somali government and fight al-Shabab militants. The replacements' deployment was put on hold this summer [2014] when the Ebola outbreak in West Africa spiraled out of control. Earlier this month [October 2014], Osman Keh Kamara, Sierra Leone's ambassador to Ethiopia, where the AU has its headquarters, pleaded for the new battalion be allowed to rotate in and relieve their compatriots, saying the troops in Sierra Leone had been held in isolation for 4 months and screened for Ebola.

[4] MSF reaching limit

Medecins Sans Frontieres, a medical charity that has been at the forefront in the fight against Ebola in West Africa, said it was reaching its limit and urgently needed other organizations to step up the efforts against the deadly disease.

The organization currently operates 6 centers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with a total of 600 beds. Its personnel on the ground have grown from about 650 at the start of August [2014] to about 3000 currently. "We have increased our capacity a lot," said Brice de le Vigne, director of operations for MSF, which is also known as Doctors Without Borders. "Now we have reached our ceiling." De le Vigne called on other actors, such as governments and international organizations, to up their game... -- more

[5] China: new drug

China has sent thousands of doses of an experimental anti-Ebola drug developed by the military to Africa. The company manufacturing the drug said it plans to start human clinical trials there soon.

Sihuan Pharmaceutical, the private Chinese company that last week [week of 6 Oct 2014] purchased the rights to commercialise jk-05 from a branch of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), said it began manufacturing the drug after it was approved in August [2014] as a "special drug for military needs."

The Chinese military has already sent enough of the drug to treat 10 000 people to West Africa, according to Dr Huo Caixia, associate president of research and development for Sihuan and head of its Beijing Aohe Drug Research Institute. Sihuan, whose founders are former military doctors, is part owned by Morgan Stanley private equity funds... The drug is being developed to treat Ebola and is not a vaccine. But it also has preventive uses, according to Dr Huo. She said it had passed cell and animal tests, but not human testing... -- more

[6] Prevention & false alarms
China: Guangdong designates 27 hospitals to treat Ebola patients
----------------------------------------------------------------
16 Oct 2014: (Guangzhou Daily) Guangdong Province has designated 27 hospitals including Guangdong People's Hospital and 3 case screening and detection labs including Guangdong Province CDC. It has set up clinical therapy, prevention and pathology expert groups, and established contingency plans and guidance on hospital infection prevention and control. It has coordinated with hospitals to prepare negative pressure/laminar flow beds, respirators, negative pressure ambulances, personal protective equipment, masks, and other protective items. At the border, in hospitals, areas where Africans reside, police stations, and hotels it has placed nearly 200 000 Chinese-English-French language flyers and health information.

[This all sounds exemplary. Guangdong province is currently suffering a huge epidemic of dengue (see ProMED reports), with 3 deaths from hemorrhagic fever, which could have been confused with Ebola if not lab confirmed as dengue (see http://paper.people.com.cn/smsb/html/2014-10/03/content_1484434.htm [in Chinese]. See below. - Mod.JW]

China: fatal hemorrhagic fever, Guangzhou
-----------------------------------------
16 Sep 2014: (Southern Metropolis Daily) A 43-year-old woman from Yuexiu District [Guangzhou] was diagnosed with DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe dengue]. When she arrived at People's Number 8 Hospital on 4 Sep 2014, her lower body had already started hemorrhaging and her liver, kidney, and heart function were seriously compromised.

[Sounds like Ebola, doesn't it -- but presumably it was lab confirmed to be dengue. - Mod.JW]

China: false alarms as of October 2014
--------------------------------------
14 Oct 2014: (Jinghua) Yesterday morning [13 Oct 2014], Beijing CDC reported public health information for September [2014]. Up to now, the city has ruled out Ebola in 30 patients placed under observation... [Those] who return from Africa with temperatures reaching 37.3 deg C [99.1 deg F] can be placed under observation with tests then carried out in laboratories... Test results in all patients placed under observation for Ebola have been negative.

China: travel history suppressed (August 2014)
----------------------------------------------
A case of malaria was reported in a Wuhan patient who had returned from a tour in Africa (Niger) [NOT Nigeria], in mid-August [2014]. He was fearful that he might have contracted Ebola and would be placed in isolation. He withheld his travel history for 5 days while being treated for cold/flu. After revealing that he was in Africa, he was tested and found to have malaria.
http://roll.sohu.com/20140911/n404222113.shtml [in Chinese, trans. & summ. Rappt.DS]

[The patient appears not to have understood that Niger and Nigeria are different countries. But if he had in fact been in Nigeria, this was a potentially dangerous suppression of travel history, both from the treatment and contact point of view.

A map showing Niger across the northern border of Nigeria can be seen at http://www.african-politics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/map-of-niger.jpg. - Mod.JW]

China: 4 being monitored
------------------------
15 Oct 2014: (Nanhai Network) The Health & Family Planning Commission and the Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province are conducting health monitoring of 4 people who entered China from countries with Ebola outbreaks. 2 dedicated personnel are responsible for health monitoring. At this time, Hainan has no suspected or confirmed Ebola cases.

[This presumably means they are having their temperatures checked twice daily. China's official threshold for triggering testing is 37.3 deg C [99.1 deg F], see above -- much lower than in the USA. - Mod.JW]
