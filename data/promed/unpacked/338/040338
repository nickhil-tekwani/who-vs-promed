Soaring numbers of people sickened with measles in Gloucestershire have led health experts to urge people to check their vaccination history. The latest advice follows 62 confirmed cases in Gloucestershire between October [2012] and January [2013]. The number is a significant spike compared to previous years. Less than 5 confirmed cases of measles were reported in 2011. More people are being hospitalised because of the illness.

The message from the Health Protection Agency [HPA] is for anyone born after 1988 -- when the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine was 1st introduced -- to check whether they have received the required 2 doses to make the vaccine effective. Dr David Hunt, from the South West Health Protection Unit, said: "It is important to remember that measles isn't a "harmless" childhood disease for some, and this is why we have seen hospitalisations in Gloucestershire. "Thankfully, all have now fully recovered and have been discharged. However, these hospitalisations reinforce how important it is to make sure that you and your children are protected. That is why we are urging the community to make sure children are fully immunised and have had both doses of the MMR vaccine."

Measles is caused by a very infectious virus which typically causes rash, cold-like symptoms, cough, red eyes, and high fever. About one in every 15 children with measles will develop more serious complications. These can include ear and chest infections, fits, diarrhoea, encephalitis (an infection of the brain), and brain damage.

MMR vaccination is part of the routine child immunisation programme; one dose is given at 13 months, and a 2nd, pre-school booster is given before school. Dr Jeremy Welch, Tewkesbury GP and member of the Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group Shadow Board, said people should be vigilant if they recognise the symptoms, as the disease can spread quickly.

"Measles is a highly infectious and potentially dangerous illness which spreads very easily," he said.

The death toll of people who have died of measles in Hoima district has risen to 6 after the disease claimed a 2-year-old at the weekend. The last fatal case occurred on 8 Feb 2013 following the death of a 3-year-old in Nyanseke village. The District Health Inspector, Mr Fredrick Byenume, said his office had registered 159 cases by Saturday [16 Feb 2013], up from 141 cases on 8 Feb 2013.

The disease, which broke out in Kaseeta Parish, Kabwooya Sub-county in January 2013 has created fear and anxiety among residents, as there are reports that it could be spreading to the neighbouring areas of Kiziranfumbi and Kyangwali. To avert the situation, a team of health experts led by the District Health Officer, Dr Joseph Ruyonga, began a mass immunisation campaign in Kabwooya on Saturday [16 Feb 2013] where at least 10 000 children were immunised.

Mr Byenume said the district registered an overwhelming turn out, causing shortages in vaccines. "The massive turn out caused a [shortage] of vaccines, but we replenished them, and the exercise is still ongoing. We are targeting 3000 more children," he said. The campaign targets children under 5 years of age and people who have never been immunised or did not complete their vaccine schedules. The World Health Organisation, Uganda Red Cross Society, World Vision Uganda, among other partners, participated in the exercise.

The villages worst affected by measles include Sayuni, Kabegaramire, Nyairongo, Rwenkobe, Ibahura, Karokarungi, Dongo, Rwengabi, and Nyakabaale. Three patients were admitted to Kaseeta Health Centre at the weekend with signs similar to those of measles.

Records at the health office indicate that the district has never registered such a serious measles outbreak in the last 10 years.
