Measles outbreak kills more than 700 in Africa
----------------------------------------------
A recent measles outbreak in eastern and southern Africa has killed more
than 700 people, threatening to reverse gains made over several years to
stem the disease, the United Nations said on Friday [18 Jun 2010]. "As of
mid-June 2010, the outbreak has affected more than 47 907 children in 14
countries, resulting in 731 deaths. The most recent confirmed measles
outbreaks were reported from Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia," the statement
said. The worst affected country is Zimbabwe with 517 reported deaths.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization warned
that the outbreak "has put recent gains in reducing mortality due to this
highly contagious disease at risk of being reversed."

The statement said that control strategies, including routine
immunisations, recommended by the 2 UN agencies in recent years needed to
be more rigorously implemented. "The current wave of measles outbreaks
comes as a result of gaps in the implementation of the control strategies.
These gaps have been caused by inadequate financial commitments from
governments and partners," it said. "Measles is easily preventable. In
order to sustain our efforts and successes in combating the disease, we
urgently need to fill the funding gaps. Otherwise, we will again see more
measles deaths in the near future," said Elhadj As Sy the UNICEF regional
director for Eastern and Southern Africa. Measles can cause severe
complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea and encephalitis.

[According to the United Nations Foundation
(<http://www.unfoundation.org/our-solutions/campaigns/measles-initiative/>)
since 2001, the Measles Initiative -- a partnership led by the American Red
Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization -- has helped
reduce measles deaths by 78 per cent globally and 89 per cent in Africa
(compared to 2000). Working closely with national governments and local
communities, the partnership has supported the vaccination of more than 700
million children in more than 60 countries. In response to an expected
funding gap in 2009, [the Measles Initiative is] jointly committing with
the Vodafone Foundation USD 6 million over 3 years to support continued
vaccination efforts. The funding will bolster childhood immunizations
worldwide, helping the Initiative to reach the United Nations' goal of
reducing measles deaths globally by 90 per cent by 2010.

The African Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) had attained 92
per cent reduction in measles mortality between 2000 and 2008 through the
implementation of these strategies, with the support from the Measles
Initiative. However this success is now imperiled by a funding gap,
changing priorities, and local maladministration and political strife. -
