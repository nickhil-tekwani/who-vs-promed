Rabies virus is widespread in the skunk population of Manitoba and
occasionally is seen in bats. Skunk rabies incidence fluctuates over time
and 1998 was a year of very high prevalence. When skunk rabies is high
there is increased spill over into the domestic animal population.
In 1998 there were 17 cattle diagnosed with rabies in Manitoba. This is 4
times as high as the running 5-year average of 4 cattle per year. Farmers
should be aware of rabies and manage domestic animals to minimize the risk
to people.
We believe the reporting of rabies in cattle to be quite high. In Manitoba,
farmers may recover part or all of the value of domestic animals diagnosed
with rabies. The program has been operating for many years and encourages
the reporting of suspected animals. The program pays up to $1000.00 for
cattle and $500.00 for horses. The funding for the program is 60% from
Manitoba Agriculture and 40% Agriculture Canada.

Number of rabies cases in Manitoba per year 1993-1998 for skunk and the
major animals that come into contact with man. The domestic animals die
from the "skunk strain" of rabies. Risk for spill-over increases with the
prevalence in the skunk population. Rabies in bats is a separate strain and
occurs independently of rabies in skunks.
In Manitoba, rabies follows a long-term time line with upswings in skunk
rabies seen every 6 or 7 years. The year 1998 had the highest incidents of
rabies in wildlife for the past decade.
