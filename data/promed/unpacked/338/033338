Legionnaires' cases hit 26
--------------------------
2 more people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease after an
outbreak of the bug centered on a cider-making plant, health
officials have announced.
The Herefordshire Primary Care Trust said the latest victims, a man
in his 40s and another in his 50s, were both in stable condition.
The new cases bring the total number of people affected during the
outbreak -- which has claimed the life of a man in his 70s -- to 26.
Health experts confirmed that samples taken from patients matched
legionella found during tests on a cooling tower at the HP Bulmer
site at Plough Lane, Hereford.
Dr Mike Deakin, Herefordshire's Director of Public Health, said: "We
have been expecting to see new cases, as the incubation period is up
to 14 days. One of these cases was detected by a GP, the other
following admission to hospital. The fact they have been detected
reassures us the heightened state of awareness among local GPs and
hospital staff is continuing."
