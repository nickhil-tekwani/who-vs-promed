Cholera Kills 27 in Hoima Village
---------------------------------
About 10 people have died and over 50 others were admitted to health
centers in the district, following an outbreak of cholera at Kaiso landing
site in Buseruka sub-county, reports Amlan Tumusiime.
The Director of Health Services, Dr. Mathew Emel, said the epidemic first
broke out in May 2002 and since then over 200 people have been affected
with 27 deaths recorded. He described the situation at the lake shores,
about 30 miles from Hoima town, as "very worrying" and said that the
Congolese who are fleeing ethnic clashes in their country were worst hit.
Emel said 3 treatment centers had been established in the area. On Tuesday
11 Jun 2002, the acting Resident District Commissioner, a representative
from the office of the district council chairman and the medical office
rushed to the lakeshore to sensitize the residents to preventive measures.
Emel said they were considering the use of the police and local advisors to
force the residents to construct pit-latrines.

Cholera Outbreak At Cape Coast
----------------------
Since 1 Jun 2002, 52 new cases of cholera have been reported at the
Isolation Unit of the Cape Coast District Hospital, 20 of which were
reported between 14 Jun and 15 June 2002, but no deaths have been
recorded. Dr. Yaw Ofori Yeboah, Municipal Director of Health Services, who
disclosed this in an interview with the GNA (Ghana News Agency) on Sat 15
Jun 2002, said all the cases came from the municipality.
He mentioned the affected areas as Ola, Kotokoraba, Pedu, Brimsu and
communities along the beach. Yeboah said with the rains setting in, human
waste and other materials had been washed into existing water bodies
leading to widespread contamination and environmental pollution.
He said 34 cases were recorded at the unit between January and May 2002,
adding that adequate measures were being put in place to contain the
situation. Yeboah advised the people to improve upon their personal and
environmental hygiene and avoid eating cold and uncovered foods.
Last year a total of 832 cases with 7 deaths were recorded at the unit,
with 392 of the cases coming from Komenda.
