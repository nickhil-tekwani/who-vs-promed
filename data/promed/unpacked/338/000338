[3] USA: disproportionate case and vaccination numbers
Date: Thu 6 Oct 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/10/report-monkeypox-case-rates-5-times-higher-black-americans


A new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) based on Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data reveals that monkeypox case rates in the US disproportionately affect Black and Latino Americans, with Black Americans having case rates 5 times those found among White peers (14.4 cases vs. 2.6 per 100 000).

"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) and Hispanic people also have significantly higher rates of reported MPX cases at 10.0 and 8.3 per 100 000, respectively. Rates are lower and similar for Asian (3.0 per 100 000), American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) (2.8 per 100,000), and White (2.6 per 100 000) people," the report reads.

The statistics are based on CDC data on 68% of cases reported in the United States as of 23 Sep [2022]. The monkeypox outbreak in the US has slowed considerably since its peak activity in July [2022], but new cases are still disproportionality seen in minorities. Of cases with known race or ethnicity, 70% are among people of color, despite representing only 40% of the population. White people account for 30% of cases and 60% of the US population.

Racial inequity is also at play in monkeypox vaccine distribution. "As of 27 Sep [2022], over half (51%) of MPX 1st doses of vaccinations have gone to White people, although they represent 30% of reported cases," KFF said. "In contrast, despite accounting for more than 1/3 of cases (35%), only 13% of 1st doses administered went to Black people."

Yesterday [5 Oct 2022] the CDC reported 117 more monkeypox cases, putting the national total at 26 311.

More states, cities expand vaccine access
-----------------------------------------
As the pace of the monkeypox outbreak slows across the country, more states and cities are expanding monkeypox vaccine eligibility to include more people at risk, such as sex partners of anyone previously eligible.

In Las Vegas, the Southern Nevada Health District has opened access to sex partners of anyone previously eligible for the vaccine or who anticipates experiencing other risk factors.

In Wisconsin, access has opened to men who have sex with men who have a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection in the past year, or people who have attended a commercial sex venue in the past year.

Abstract
--------
Mankind has recently had to deal with a series of virus-mediated pandemics, resulting in extensive morbidity and mortality rates that have severely strained healthcare systems. While dealing with viral infections as a healthcare concern is not new, our exceptionally mobile society has added to the critical challenge of limiting pathogen spread of a highly transmissible virus prior to the generation, testing, and distribution of safe and effective vaccines. The tremendous global effort put forth to address the recent pandemic induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection has highlighted many of the strengths and weaknesses of how vaccines are identified, tested, and used to provide protection. These uncertainties are exacerbated by the lack of clear and consistent messaging that can occur when the processes of research, development, and clinical testing that normally require years of study and consideration are compressed into a few months. In this commentary, I will provide some background on the intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), and intradermal (ID) administration routes used for injectable vaccines and some information on potential immunological outcomes. With this background, I will address the recent FDA decision to allow an approved vaccine against monkeypox virus to be administered by ID, as well as its initial approval route via SC, injection as a dose-sparing strategy to maximize immunization numbers using current stockpiles.

Summary
There is a rich milieu of immune-related cell types that reside in or circulate through the dermis that can generate both adaptive and innate responses: macrophages, mast cells, Langerhans cells, and dermal dendritic cells [13]. Indeed, the antigen-presenting capabilities of this repertoire of cells in the dermis can result in immune responses that are superior to other anatomical sites, with less vaccine material [14]. As ID injections are well-known for a robust immune response, this delivery strategy has been proposed for a number of vaccines, including those targeting influenza [15] and SARS-CoV-2 [16] viruses. With the promise of ID vaccination but with the challenges of efficient immunization expertise by healthcare personnel, it is not surprising that great efforts have been made to develop systems and devices to simplify and standardize these administrations [17]. Using such approaches to make ID immunization as simple as current IM or SC injections would dramatically benefit the global effort to address pathogen outbreaks to maximize the number of patients reached while minimizing the burden of vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling. Most of these approaches would also address the concern that, despite the reduced volume required for injection, the relative proportion of vaccine wastage in the dead space of the needle and syringe is increased for ID compared to the larger volumes of SC or IM injection [18].

While guidance changes issued by the FDA are frequently based upon more than a single clinical trial outcome, changing the route of the JYNNEOS vaccine from SC to an ID injection as a dose-sparing strategy is supported by robust, well-controlled clinical data and sound immunological principles. The challenge, however, will be to ensure that patients receiving these ID vaccines have a positive experience during the administration process and benefit from a properly performed injection. To successfully meet this challenge, we will need to carry out a mass immunization program where healthcare professionals who are sufficiently trained in the Mantoux technique administer these vaccines. As ID vaccines gain acceptance by patients following positive vaccination experiences, advantages to this approach for global immunization programs will lead to clinical testing and acceptance for ID injection systems and devices. Both outcomes would hopefully limit monkeypox vaccine skepticism and disinformation like that recently seen for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Healthcare approaches to address the COVID-19 disease induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have provided a good example of how an insufficient understanding of viral pathogenicity and the requirements for mechanism(s) of immune-induced protection can result in skepticism and disinformation that suppressed vaccine acceptance by the public.
