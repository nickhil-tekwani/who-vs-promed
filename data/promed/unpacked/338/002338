[Re: ProMED-mail Tick-borne borreliosis - USA: (MA) B. miyamotoi 20150724.3532090]

In the [24 Jul 2015] post on _Borrelia miyamotoi_ infection of humans, the disease was called "tick-borne borreliosis". This is not a very informative name for _B. miyamotoi_ infection, even as a provisional one or a more general classification. The only "borreliosis" that is not tick-borne is infection with _Borrelia recurrentis_, which is transmitted by the human louse. All the other known _Borrelia_ species are transmitted by either hard (ixodid) ticks, like _Ixodes scapularis_, or soft (argasid) ticks, usually species of the genus _Ornithodoros_. On phylogenetic grounds, _B. miyamotoi_ is unambiguously in the relapsing fever group of _Borrelia_ species and not the Lyme disease group of species [1-3]. Moreover, there is evidence from clinical reports of a relapsing fever-like disease course in some patients infected with _B. miyamotoi_ [4, 5]. My colleagues and I have recommended calling the infection "hard tick-borne relapsing fever" to distinguish it from the several varieties of "soft tick-borne relapsing fever", such as _B. hermsii_ in North America and _B. duttonii_ in Africa, and the aforementioned "louse-borne relapsing fever" [6, 7]. The name "hard tick-borne relapsing fever" indicates the type of vector, which has a different life-cycle and ecology than soft ticks, and refers to the class of organisms to which the etiologic agent belongs.

Note: The URL provided in the post was to Peter Krause and my editorial (reference 7) and not the intended paper by Molloy et al. (reference 5) in the same issue. Also, the volume of the journal was "163" and not "63".
