Ohio: Raptor Death - Clarification of Evidence Available
-------------------------------------------------
I just want to clarify some statements in the Cincinnati Enquirer article
about raptors evaluated at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC)
as posted on ProMED-mail on 24 Oct 2002 [see: "Part [3] of West Nile virus
update 2002 - (USA) (27) 20021024.5633].

The NWHC tests for West Nile virus (WNV) by virus isolation followed by
PCR-confirmation of organ tissue specimens (kidney, spleen, brain), not blood.

In the 7 Ohio cases mentioned, other potential causes of death that were
ruled out included toxin exposure, and bacterial, fungal and viral
infections. Of the cases evaluated, 2 were confirmed with WNV as the cause
of death, based on WNV tests and microscopic changes in tissues. The other
5 cases were considered only presumptive West Nile virus infections based
on the following: 2 of the birds were positive for WNV, but the
encephalitis was not considered severe enough to explain the clinical signs
and death; 3 of the birds tested negative for WNV, but had enough brain
changes to suggest viral encephalitis as cause of the clinical signs and
death. Since not enough is known about the natural history of infection in
raptors, we could only conclude that these 5 birds likely died due to WNV
infection.

Thus far, we have completed diagnostic evaluations on 8 raptors. However,
these are 8 out of a total of 53 raptor submissions from several states
that are currently being evaluated.

The conclusions drawn in the Cincinnati Enquirer article, that WNV caused
the deaths of numerous raptors in Ohio, was based on the findings in only 7
birds. Until we have the results back on the 45 pending cases from several
states, our findings should remain an indication that WNV could be the
cause of the recent increase in mortality in raptors. However, these
findings do not rule out all other causes of raptor morbidity and mortality.

New Jersey: Aquarium Seal Dies from West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A harbor seal at the New Jersey State Aquarium died from West Nile virus
infection, the first recorded case in the United States of a marine mammal
succumbing to the disease.

Frank Steslow, vice president of biological programs at the aquarium, said
the 12-year-old seal had been ill for 10 days before it died on 22 Sep
2002. Officials were not able to confirm the cause of death until last
week. The seal, named Sirrus, had lived at the aquarium's outdoor saltwater
exhibit since it opened 10 years ago. Aquarium officials said he had no
health problems and it wasn't clear how he got the disease.

Experts said there were no records of other marine mammals dying from the
disease in the United States. However, officials at the National Zoo in
Washington are awaiting test results to see if a 23-year-old gray seal that
died on 2 Sep 2002 had the virus.

Earlier this month, concerns deepened about the disease becoming more
widespread in animals when Louisiana officials said 4 dogs with
encephalitis symptoms had West Nile. More than 100 species of birds also
have been infected.

Texas: Some Horses Need Vaccine 'Booster' Shot
----------------------------------------------
Cooler temperatures will bring a welcome break from mosquitoes, which this
summer have transmitted West Nile virus (WNV) to more than 800 of Texas'
nearly one million horses. Few areas of the state have been spared from the
spread of this disease that was introduced into the U.S. in l999 and made
its way to Texas in June 2002. Laboratory tests, most run at the Texas
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) have confirmed infection
in horses in 149 Texas counties. WNV infection, a "sleeping sickness"
disease, can be harbored by more than 70 species of birds, and mosquitoes
are responsible for spreading the disease from an infected birds to a horse
or human. "For more than 14 months, we've urged owners to get their equids
(horses, donkeys, and mules) vaccinated against WNV," said Dr. Linda Logan,
state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency. Although
WNV is not a regulatory disease, TAHC veterinarians and animal health
inspectors have worked to increase awareness about the disease, which can
cause equids to suffer swelling of the brain, high fever and muscle
tremors, or become unable to rise. According to national statistics, WNV
infection can lead to death in up to a third of infected equids, Dr. Logan
noted.

"Now owners should talk with the private veterinarian about a 'booster'
shot for equids that were vaccinated at least 6 months ago. This is
particularly important if the animals reside in or will be traveling to
areas where temperatures are warm enough to support mosquitoes through the
winter," said Dr. Logan. "This booster shot can strengthen the animal's
immunity, enabling it to fight off development of clinical disease." WNV
vaccine is produced by Fort Dodge Animal Health and is conditionally
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), explained veterinarian
Terry Conger, TAHC's state epidemiologist. Aside from mosquito repellents,
he said the vaccine, available through veterinarians, is the only
protection available against the disease that has affected nearly 12 000
horses in 38 states in 2002. "Studies on the effectiveness of the vaccine
must be completed before the vaccine gains final approval," said
veterinarian Terry Conger, TAHC's state epidemiologist. "However,
preliminary reports on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness looks good.
Of the 20 000 equine animals vaccinated properly in 2001 in Florida, only
one was known to have developed WNV infection." "Adequate supplies of WNV
vaccine are available from the maker, but many owners have procrastinated
about getting their horses immunized," said Dr. Conger. "On 28 Oct 2002, we
talked with representatives of Fort Dodge Animal Health and were told only
750 000 doses of the vaccine have been ordered by Texas private
practitioners. That's enough vaccine for only 325 000 of the state's 1
million horses, because the immunization process requires 2 doses of the
vaccine, with the second administered 3 to 6 weeks after the first
injection. Maximum disease immunity doesn't occur until 3 or 4 weeks after
the second shot. To maintain disease protection, the animal needs a
'booster' shot yearly, or in warmer climates, every 6 months."

"In all likelihood, WNV will continue to spread, but in making a diagnosis
in equids, we need always to consider rabies or other diseases that can
cause animals to be disoriented," explained Dr. Logan. "Although fairly
rare, rabies can strike livestock, and owners who handle an animal stricken
with rabies should contact their physician immediately. It's important to
follow through with your veterinary practitioner to get a diagnosis
confirmed when livestock become extremely sick or die, especially if they
exhibit signs of neurological distress, such as inability to rise,
stumbling, head swinging, or disorientation.

West Nile Virus Latest News - as of Tue 29 Oct 2002
-------------------------------------------------
In 2002 West Nile virus (WNV) has been detected in 43 states across the US
and 5 provinces in Canada, from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia. In the US the
only states where it has not been detected are Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii,
Idaho (though it has been detected in raven in a bordering county in
Washington), Nevada, Oregon and Utah. In many states WNV has been detected
in all, or nearly all, counties, including several on the Mexican border.

As of Mon 28 Oct 2002, CDC reports 3391 human cases (188 fatalities) in 38
states and Washington DC. During the week 10 to 16 Oct, 256 new
lab-positive human cases were reported, with largest numbers of new cases
from Indiana and Nebraska. The number of human cases and fatalities
continues to increase, while the rate of increase has slowed to about half
that of mid-September (256 new cases last week compared with 487 during a
week one month ago).

The BBC reported on Mon 28 Oct 2002 that researchers at the [NERC] Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology at Oxford University have found WNV antibodies in
non-migratory birds in the UK. These findings suggest presence of WNV in
the UK.

The Israel Health Ministry announced on 16 Oxt 2002 that there have been 26
human cases of WNV in 2002 (2 fatalities), which is comparable to the case
load in 2001 and about 5 percent the number of human cases in 2000.
WNV-positive mosquitoes were detected as early as May in 2002, as compared
with first detections in August of previous years.
