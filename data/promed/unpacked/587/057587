Lakhs [100s of 1000s] of people in 5 districts of Kerala, especially
the northern regions, are suffering from viral fever mainly caused
[transmitted] by mosquito bite during monsoon season. [A lakh is a
unit in the Indian numbering system equal to 100 000. - Mod.TY]
Nearly, 10 people have died so far in these regions. According to the
health reports, more than 1.5 lakh [150 000] people in 5 regions are
affected in just few days and the government is taking all necessary
steps to check the spread of the disease. Special camps have been
arranged and extra doctors have been deputed to these regions. The
severely affected districts of Kerala are Malappuram, Kozhikode,
Wayand, Kannur, and Kasaragod.

Many cases of dengue fever, chikungunya, and hepatitis have also been reported.

The symptoms differ as per the region and the doctors say that this
can be attributed as mosquito borne communicable diseases or viral
fever with severe body pain. Dr Abdul Samad, superintendent of
District Hospital in Malappuram, said "after monsoon the number of
people affected from fever is fast increasing specially in June and
July. Compared to last month [June 2009], a 100 times increase has
been reported; it is not a usual viral fever, the afflicted are
showing symptoms of heavy pain and swelling with rashes. We can
attribute that its chikungunya and like viral diseases, which are
spreading in these regions," he said.

Till 28 Jul [2009], the number of patients had crossed 11 lakh [1 100
000] starting from January this year [2009]. Hundreds of people
afflicted with fever and acute joint pains, belong mostly from hilly
hamlets and tribal areas throng in huge numbers to nearby hospitals
for faster relief. Patients complain of headache and joint pain and
have not experienced such fever earlier.

[There has been a spreading outbreak of chikungunya virus infection
in western India in 2009, beginning in Gujarat state, then in the
southwest in Karnataka state, and appearing in Goa, and now possibly
in Kerala state.

This report suggests that there is a very significant chikungunya
virus outbreak going on in the reported areas of Kerala state. This
report does not provide specific numbers of confirmed chikungunya
virus infections nor the proportion that infection represents of the
estimated total of what are termed fever cases. It would be of
interest to know even approximate numbers of chikungunya, dengue, and
hepatitis cases that have occurred in this outbreak so far.
