Almost epidemic levels of light leaf spot [LLS] are being found in oilseed rape crops. The latest results from 160 samples evaluated in February [2020] have shown extremely high levels of infection compatible with an epidemic, said Philip Walker, ADAS [agricultural consultants]. The results are higher than normal, almost certainly as a consequence of the continued recent mild weather.

"With 88% of samples showing symptoms -- and, of those, 70% showing infection levels above 25%, -- I would expect this to carry on increasing and have a detrimental effect on yield, as we generally estimate that a 5% yield loss occurs when more than 15% of a crop is infected," pointed out Mr Walker. "Even if temperatures drop, the damage is done because - we have already got infection in the crop. While Yorkshire had the highest levels of infection, we are now starting to see LLS symptoms in the west side of the country as well." Applying a fungicide, if possible, has now become urgent.

Ella Crawford, Bayer, said, "Growers should continue to monitor crops carefully, keeping in mind the resistance scores of varieties and prioritising those with a weaker resistance rating for LLS."

LLS is the no. 1 threat to oilseed rape crops around the country, but it is still going undiagnosed on some farms - and the average annual losses exceeds GBP 80m [about USD 96.6 million]. Traditionally associated with Scotland and northern England, the incidence has increased over the last decade and the disease is now widespread. However, LLS remains hard to identify by the grower [and] has created an extremely challenging scenario.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. It is considered one of the main diseases of oilseed rape in northern Europe and is also a major diseases affecting vegetable brassicas in cool, humid climates. In oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless until lesions appear on older leaves. In severe cases, developing leaves and buds can be affected causing leaf distortion and stunting of plants. Stems may split and break off. Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. Different vegetable brassicas vary in susceptibility to the fungus, but generally show spots and discolourations on leaves and stems which reduce quality and may also affect yield.

LLS is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer oilseed rape, and vegetable brassicas. Spores are spread by wind, rain splash, and with infected plant material. Disease management may include varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, removal of infected stubble, disease monitoring and timely fungicide applications.

In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of oilseed rape in the past. Reduced sensitivity of the fungus to some of the fungicides used for LLS control has been observed. Research on host resistance genes and development of LLS resistant crop varieties is being carried out.
