Influenza Update 214
---------------------------
Summary
-----------
Globally influenza activity was low.
- In North America and Europe, overall influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity approached inter-seasonal levels in most countries. Influenza activity slightly increased, however, in the southern region of China, mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
- In southern and south-eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decline, except for Singapore where an increase was noticed, although the acute respiratory infections rate remained low.
- In northern Africa and western Asia, influenza activity remained low.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was still low, although some of the countries in the temperate zone of South America showed higher influenza-like illness (ILI) activity with an increase in influenza virus detections.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 26 Jun 2014, 12:35 UTC), during weeks 23 to 24 (1 Jun 2014 to 14 Jun 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 76 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 26 592 specimens. 1838 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1345 (73.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 493 (26.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 207 (18.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 888 (81.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 10 (71.4 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 4 (28.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Full influenza update

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------------

North America
In North America, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels in all countries with low circulation of influenza B virus within expected levels for this time of year.

Europe
In Europe, overall influenza activity is at inter-seasonal levels. The number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)-hospitalizations and proportion of influenza positive SARI specimens dropped further.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
In Northern Africa and Central and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in the majority of countries. In Egypt and Tunisia, the proportion of influenza positive specimens was higher than the previous weeks with most cases identified as influenza B viruses, although the number of samples tested were not high. Bahrain reported stable influenza activity mainly due to a low circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in recent weeks. The Islamic Republic of Iran continued to report an increase in influenza detections (mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B). Oman reported influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections since March 2014.

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity continued to decline. Influenza A(H3N2) and B were the main viruses in circulation, with low levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 also detected.

In Mongolia, ILI activity showed an overall decreasing trend. In northern China, the proportion of influenza positive specimens remained low with most cases identified as A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses. In southern China, ILI rates slightly increased and were higher than expected for this time of the year, with mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels.

Countries in the tropical zone
---------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
The overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical areas of South America was at low levels. The tropical areas of Bolivia, Brazil and the Dominican Republic reported a few detections of influenza, mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, overall influenza activity reported from western, middle, and eastern Africa was at low levels. However, Cameroon reported an increase in influenza activity with mainly influenza A(H3N2) virus detections.

Tropical Asia
---------
In most southern Asian and South-Eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low. In Lao People's Democratic republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, influenza activity decreased. Singapore reported higher numbers of influenza positive specimens (with mainly influenza B virus) but with an acute respiratory infection activity level below baseline levels.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained relatively low, with sporadic detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B virus.

In Chile, influenza continued to increase with ILI levels also rising within the expected levels. Among the positive influenza specimens, the majority were influenza A(H3N2). In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate increased above the expected levels for this time of the year.

The influenza positive specimens were all influenza B. In South Africa, although there was some influenza activity mainly due to influenza A(H3N2), detections were still sporadic.

Both Australia and New Zealand had low influenza activity and were below their seasonal thresholds. Nationally, influenza activity levels were stable in Australia, while in New Zealand, activity showed an increase, with influenza A as the predominant influenza virus type. Of those subtyped, the majority were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. However, in Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam and Tuvalu, ILI activity increased.

[Influenza activity, apart from sporadic outbreaks of human cases of avian influenza, remains at low levels throughout both hemispheres. No new serotypes have appear in either hemisphere.
