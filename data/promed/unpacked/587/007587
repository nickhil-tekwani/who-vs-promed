A duck farm near St. Catharines, Ontario has been quarantined after a case of avian flu was confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. All birds on the infected property will be euthanized and disposed of as outlined in provincial regulations.

CFIA officials will create a surveillance zone around the area to do further testing for H5 avian influenza, a news release from the federal agency said Thursday [7 Jul 2016]. "Once all birds have been removed, the CFIA will oversee the cleaning and disinfection of the barns, vehicles, equipment and tools to eliminate any infectious material that may remain," the news release said.

Industry contacts have been advised to beef up biological security measures. Public health authorities are ready to assist if needed, the release said. Further testing is underway to identify the exact type and strain of the virus. Results should be available in a few days, according to the news release.

Avian flu rarely affects humans and doesn't pose a risk to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked, the release said.

[Last year (2015), Ontario was severely afflicted with avian influenza. While they deserve some time off, instead they will be applying what they learned in 2015.

St. Catharines county is in western Ontario on the north shore of Lake Ontario and close to Niagara and the US border. - Mod.MHJ
