Angola: Marburg outbreak is deadliest on record
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever had killed at least 150 people in
Angola as of yesterday [Mon 4 Apr 2005], making it the deadliest outbreak
of the rare Marburg virus infection ever recorded. Scientists are puzzled
by the epidemic's remarkably high fatality rate. So far, the Angolan
Ministry of Health has reported 163 cases of the hemorrhagic fever, putting
the fatality rate at around 90 percent. In previous outbreaks, the disease
has had a fatality rate as low as 25 percent. This time, at least 75
percent of the victims have been children under the age of 5. "This is
something we haven't seen in previous Marburg outbreaks," said David
Daigle, a spokesperson for the infectious disease program at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.
There is no known cure for the virus, which spreads on contact with body
fluids such as blood, urine, excrement, vomit, and saliva. Symptoms include
diarrhea, stomach pains, nausea, and vomiting, which give way to bleeding.
Efforts at containing the Angolan epidemic have been complicated by the
country's poor health care system. Officials worry that the epidemic will
spread from its epicenter in the remote, northern Uige province to more
densely populated areas. So far, 2 deaths have been confirmed in Luanda,
the Angolan capital, according to Dick Thompson, the spokesperson for the
World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Marburg virus was named after the German town where it was 1st identified
in 1967, when monkeys, imported from Uganda, infected laboratory workers.
Before the current epidemic in Angola, the worst Marburg outbreak occurred
between 1998 and 2000 in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo,
where it killed 123 people. That was also the last known outbreak until the
latest flare-up.
Marburg is a relative of Ebola (both viruses are in the family
_Filoviridae_), and Marburg is believed to primarily inhabit countries in
East and Central Africa. The current outbreak marks the 1st time the virus
has struck Angola, which is in southwestern Africa. There are at least 4
different strains of Ebola virus, with different degrees of lethality,
ranging from 50 to 90 percent. Although no separate strains of Marburg
virus have been identified, experts speculate that a particularly virulent
strain of the virus could be behind the Angolan outbreak. "Indeed, there
could be different pathotypes [degrees of virulence] of Marburg virus,"
said Fred Murphy, a virologist at the University of California in Davis.
But, he added, "when you see the pathology of human infections caused by
Ebola virus or Marburg virus, the question becomes: How does anyone
survive? The infection is devastating and rapid with extreme damage to key
tissues."
But some scientists suggest that the lethality of the virus may be due to
the overreaction of the innate human immune system -- our 1st line of
defense -- rather than the virus itself. "Any virus worth its salt causes
as little damage as possible to its host," said David Sanders, a biologist
and Ebola virus expert at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. "We
run around with viruses all the time. [They are] adapted to us and in
equilibrium with our immune system, which doesn't get too aggressive about
trying to eliminate them." Sanders suggests that when a new virus, such as
Marburg virus, enters humans, it may provoke an overreaction of our innate
immune system, which in turn causes harm to the body. "Humans are not a
natural host of this virus, so [the virus] wouldn't have evolved to provoke
this response," he said. "Instead, it may be that the immune system
responds inappropriately."
The theory does not explain why most of the victims in the Angolan outbreak
have been children. While the innate immune system is, as the name implies,
present from an early age, the adaptive immune system develops slowly. "I
would hypothesize that an inappropriate response is responsible for the
pathology, while an appropriate response can allow one to survive," Sanders
said. "Stopping viral multiplication can reduce the triggering of the
harmful reaction."
There is also the possibility of a difference in the susceptibility of
individuals due to general health status and nutrition, scientists say.
Angola is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its infrastructure was
wrecked by a 2-decade civil war that ended in 2002. Sanitation facilities
are inadequate or non-existent, and hospitals are understaffed and poorly
equipped. The prospect of the virus gaining a foothold in Luanda -- almost
4 million people live in the Angolan capital -- is ominous. "The 1st thing
that comes to mind is the international airport," said Daigle, the CDC
spokesman. "We saw with SARS how fast it was able to spread to Canada and
other countries once people started getting on planes."
Containing an outbreak is more difficult in a densely populated area where
people are crowded together. The virus has the potential to rapidly spread
to other people, especially health-care staff and family members who care
for patients. At Americo Boa Vida, Angola's largest hospital on the
outskirts of Luanda, a special isolation ward has been created to treat
incoming cases from around the country. Volunteer workers have been
outfitted with special suits to work as cleaners and washers. "The
practices needed to contain the virus in the hospital setting are rather
simple and can be quickly introduced by international teams," Murphy, the
UC Davis virologist, said. A team of CDC scientists will arrive in Angola
this week [2nd week April 2005] to assist WHO officials already there with
outbreak investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis. "Our
guys are very anxious to get on the ground and start doing some testing and
contact-tracing to find out if this is a case of an unusually high fatality
rate, or if we're just not able to track all those who are sick," Daigle said.
The outbreak also presents a valuable opportunity for scientists to learn
more about the virus. Scientists don't know the environmental reservoir for
either Marburg virus or Ebola virus. (A reservoir is where a virus hides
between outbreaks.) But most experts believe the 2 viruses share the same
host. "We got some evidence, but not conclusive, that bats may have been
the source of the Marburg outbreak in the mining village of Durba in the
Congo," said Bob Swanepoel, who heads the Special Pathogens Unit at the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Sandringham, South Africa.
"Genetic evidence of the virus was found in cave-dwelling bats in the mine
where primary human cases arose, but we were not able to isolate live
viruses from bats, and the outbreak stopped when the mine flooded," he said.

Angola: new suspected Marburg case in township near Luanda
-----------------------------------------------
Angolan health workers in a slum outside Luanda were treating a new
suspected case of Marburg virus infection, as a senior United Nations
official warned that the outbreak of the Ebola-like epidemic was not yet
under control. Nurses at a clinic in the township of Cacuaco, some 18 km
north of the capital, were scrambling to help the 22-year-old woman, who,
they feared, may be the latest casualty of the hemorrhagic fever that has,
so far, claimed 156 lives in the biggest outbreak ever of the disease,
which has spread to a 5th province.
"We have a suspected case of Marburg virus infection; she arrived here an
hour ago complaining of a fever and anal bleeding," clinic administrator
Analdina Chivukuvuku said. "She is bleeding quite badly," she told Agence
France Presse (AFP) at the clinic, one of 3 that serve the township with a
population of some 613 000 residents on the Atlantic coast's Baia do Bengo.
"Maybe it's a case of typhoid or a parasitic illness, but, at the moment,
we don't know; we have alerted the authorities in Luanda," she said.
Nurses were putting a drip into the young woman, whose legs and feet were
covered in blood. They wore only face masks and rubber gloves and said they
feared the virus because of a lack of proper protection. "Before the
Marburg alert, we worked only in a simple blouse. Now we have received
paper face masks and rubber gloves, but it is not sufficient to protect the
149 staff working here," she said.
The Angolan government has started an awareness campaign featuring radio
broadcasts warning: "Alert, Marburg; don't touch any corpse; inform the
health authorities about any suspicious illnesses or death due to
bleeding." But, despite a dramatic rise in the death toll in the last 4
days -- some 29 people have died between Thursday and Monday [31 Mar - 4
Apr 2005] -- there has been almost no mention of the virus in the
state-controlled print media.

Angola: life goes on at epicenter of the Marburg outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Residents of Angola's northern Uige province, the epicenter of a
hemorrhagic fever outbreak that has killed more than 150 people, are trying
as best they can to get on with their lives, despite living under the
shadow of the epidemic. Teca Garcia, the resident program officer in Uige
for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), told IRIN that the horror that had
enveloped the provincial capital in the days after Marburg virus was
identified had eased, as the local population learned more about the
[virus]. "There is still a lot of fear among the people, but the panic has
to some extent passed, thanks to the social mobilization officers getting
information to the people," he said in a telephone interview from the
provincial capital, also called Uige.
"There are people in the streets, in shops and at work; they are walking
around; they are very quiet, but they are going about their daily lives,"
he said. Terrified that they might catch the disease just by breathing the
Uige air, some residents had taken to wearing masks, fueling the atmosphere
of panic. But Garcia said this alarmist behavior had stopped after
intensive campaigns to spell out the exact facts of the disease: how it is
spread, and how to prevent contamination. "The masks are now confined to
the hospital. People are not wandering around the streets wearing them;
this is not the situation," he said.
With the challenge now to actively survey the municipalities for cases of
the disease and corpses, it was common to see those in charge of
surveillance and removing bodies wearing masks, gloves and protective
suits. But these workers were moving discreetly from their vehicles to
hospitals and morgues and not parading through the town, Garcia said.
The Angolan epidemic, which has steadily escalated since October 2004, is
the world's worst, with 156 deaths from 181 cases. The previous record was
in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak in
1998-2000 claimed 123 lives. Garcia said the efforts to educate Uige's
population had proved effective, but much more needed to be done. Conveying
the hard facts of the disease, while remaining sensitive to traditional
customs, burial rights and even views on witchcraft, required a delicate
balance. "We need more people on the ground to talk to everyone; to provide
information to the people in all 16 municipalities of Uige," Garcia said.
UNICEF's country representative, Mario Ferrari, said earlier this week [2nd
week April 2005] that his agency was spearheading a nationwide poster,
pamphlet, TV and radio campaign to inform the Angolan public at large about
the virus, its symptoms and prevention methods. Garcia and his UNICEF
colleagues in Uige, who assist the social mobilization units by collecting
and providing information from various communities in the area, are also
taking their own personal precautions, in line with the stringent health
and hygiene guidelines laid down by the Angolan Ministry of Health and the
World Health Organization. "We are taking special care with the preparation
of food, and we are [chlorine-treating] our water for drinking, washing and
household cleaning. We're not wearing protective clothing, because we don't
go into the isolation ward, but we are doubling our hygiene efforts," he said.
UN staff in the province have also been told to avoid physical contact with
people in general, particularly those in health facilities. For Garcia, who
is still extremely concerned about the situation, working in Uige during
this difficult time is tough, tiring and stressful. "Personally speaking,
we [humanitarian workers] have all had to adapt to the situation, and we
also feel a lot better now that we are well-informed of the facts," he
said. "I'm coping now with the situation. Now is not the right time to
leave Uige; our work is crucial to helping other actors in the field."

[While it is useful to describe Marburg virus as "Ebola-like," because both
viruses are members of the family _Filoviridae_, it obscures the fact that
the 2 viruses are distinctly different in biological and physical terms and
that there is little if any antigenic cross-reactivity. The Ebola viruses
are a heterogenous group, such that the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses (ICTV) in its 7th Report, published as "Virus Taxonomy" by
Academic Press in 2000, recognized 13 distinct strains grouped into 4
distinct virus species. By contrast, the 6 isolates of Marburg virus that
have been characterized (Ratayczak, West Germany, 1967; Popp, West Germany
1967; Voege, Yugoslavia 1967; Ozolin, Zimbabwe, 1975; Musoke, Kenya, 1980;
Ravn, Kenya, 1987) show remarkably little variation and are grouped as a
single virus species. The Ebola virion is about 970 nm in length, whereas
the Marburg virion is about 790 nm in length. The genomes of the 2 virus
species differ slightly in size, and the Ebola virus genome has several
gene overlaps, in contrast to the single overlap of Marburg virus. - Mod.CP]
