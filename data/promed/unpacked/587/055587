Myanmar tests show 1st case of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Myanmar has found the H5N1 bird flu virus in chickens in what is
believed to be the secretive country's 1st case of the deadly
disease, but there was no sign of human infection, a U.N. official
said.
The case emerged on 8 Mar 2006 after 112 chickens died on a farm in Aung Myae
Thar Zan township near Mandalay, about 430 miles (700 km) north of [the
capital] Yangon [formerly known as Rangoon]. Officials destroyed a flock of
780 birds and sent samples for testing at government laboratories in Mandalay
and Yangon. "They have carried out some tests, and they believe that they have
identified H5N1," Laurence Gleeson, an FAO official in Bangkok, told Reuters.
The government reported its findings on the Mandalay outbreak to the
FAO and the OIE, the Paris-based international animal health body, on
Monday [13 Mar 2006].
Dr. Tang Zhengping, the FAO representative in Yangon, said samples
had also been sent to laboratories in Australia and Thailand. He said
vaccines were needed to protect poultry against the disease. He did
not know whether foreign experts would be allowed to visit the site,
but he said the military government had been cooperating with the FAO
on bird flu issues. "We have close cooperation. I am satisfied," he
said.
The country is seen by some international health experts as a
potential black hole in the global fight against the disease, which
has killed 97 people worldwide.
While neighboring China, Thailand and Laos have been battling a
disease which swept across much of Asia in late 2003, Myanmar had
insisted the country was bird-flu free.
Yangon said in December 2005 it would tell the world if bird flu were
detected in the country. It has also worked with U.N. agencies to
step up surveillance in the countryside, including monitoring of
prime stopover points for wild birds, which could bring the virus
from neighboring countries.

[An official alert message has been sent to the OIE by Dr. U Maung
Maung Nyunt, Director General, Livestock Breeding and Veterinary
Department, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Yangon on 13 Mar
2006; see
<http://www.oie.int/Messages/060313MMR.htm>.
The message indicates, among other things, that the outbreak, which
started on 8 Mar 2006 at Aung Myae Thar Zan Township, in Mandalay
Division, was confirmed on 12 Mar 2006 as H5N1 by the Central
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Yangon and the Regional Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory, in Mandalay. It involved 780 susceptible
animals, 113 cases, 112 deaths, 668 destroyed.
Though neighboring countries (Thailand, Laos, China) have been
affected by H5N1 since the earliest stages of the H5N1 panzootic,
Myanmar has persistently claimed freedom from the disease. On 16 Feb
2004, the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) in the
Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Government of the Union of
Myanmar, sent to the OIE an official report about the absence of HPAI
infection. Later rumors on the occurrence of the disease (see
20050322.0822, 20050324.0858) were denied. - Mod.AS]

1st case of bird flu detected in Afghanistan
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st case of bird flu has been detected in Afghanistan, and
there's a high risk that tests could prove it to be the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus, a U.N. agency said Monday [13 Mar 2006].
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said 5 swab samples from backyard
poultry farms in Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad [near the Pakistan
border] tested positive on Monday [13 Mar 2006] for H5 and that tests were
under way to discern the subtype. "There's a high risk that the virus detected
is H5N1, but other possibilities remain at this time," an FAO statement issued
in Kabul said.
Afghanistan has not reported a case of bird flu before. Last month
[February 2006], the FAO warned that an outbreak was virtually
unavoidable and chided the government and donor nations for being
slow to prevent it.
Dr. Azizullah Esmoni, director of the husbandry and veterinary
department of the Afghan Agriculture Ministry, said the tests on the
5 samples from Afghanistan were underway at an FAO laboratory in
Italy. He expected results within 48 hours to determine whether or
not H5N1 was present.
The FAO statement said the bird flu samples tested were "associated
with high mortality" and the results so far indicated "that a highly
pathogenic avian influenza has been detected at more than one site in
Afghanistan. At this time, the specific subtype of H5 influenza
cannot be determined," it said.
Abdul Habib Nowruz, FAO's director of migratory birds in Afghanistan,
said this was the 1st time bird flu had been detected in the country.
In its warning last month [February 2006], the FAO said Afghanistan
lies at a crossroads for migratory birds that are potential carriers
of the virus, which has already been detected in countries in the
region, such as Iran and India.
The public veterinary system in the war-battered country remains
weak, and there's still no quarantine system to check imported
poultry at borders.

Cameroon suspects wild fowl introduced bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Wild birds most likely spread the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain to
Cameroon, the country's livestock minister said on Monday [13 Mar
2006].
There was no contact between sick ducks in Cameroon and poultry in
neighboring Nigeria, where bird flu has been discovered, said
Livestock Minister Sarki Aboubakary.
Cameroon became Africa's 4th country to confirm an outbreak of the
disease at the weekend, when H5N1 was found in one of a number of
ducks that died in Far North province, which borders Nigeria.
"From information we have gathered in the field, there was no contact
between the farm in Maroua and birds from Nigeria. We suspect there
may have been some contact between the farm and wild birds,"
Aboubakary told reporters.
Nigeria, its northern neighbor Niger and Egypt have already confirmed
outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu, which the World Health Organization (WHO)
says has killed nearly 100 people since 2003, mostly in Asia.
Since the disease spread to Africa last month [February 2006], when
outbreaks were confirmed at several Nigerian poultry farms, African
countries and international human and animal health agencies have
scrambled to control its spread.
But with the poorest continent already battling malaria and HIV/AIDS,
many fear healthcare and veterinary systems that are already weak
will be inadequate to control the disease.
Cameroon has dispatched experts from the national veterinary
laboratory to kill and burn the ducks remaining on the infected farm
at Maroua, Far North province, Aboubakary said.
The team would also disinfect all poultry and pig farms in the
vicinity, he said. Farmers will receive 2000 CFA francs (USD 3.63)
per bird culled.
The Yaounde government has earmarked 8 billion CFA francs (USD 14.53
million) to tackle bird flu, and foreign donors have pledged
contributions.
U.N. children's fund UNICEF offered a grant of USD 50 000 when the
Nigerian outbreak was confirmed, and the WHO and Food and Agriculture
Administration have provided technical support.
Authorities have closed poultry markets in Maroua and banned birds,
pigs and related products from coming in or out. An ad hoc government
committee was meeting on Monday [13 Mar 2006] to decide whether any
other emergency action was necessary. Authorities are advising
citizens they are safe to continue eating poultry products so long as
they are cooked properly to least 70 C. But in the capital Yaounde
and commercial port center of Douala, poultry farmers and traders say
sales have slumped, forcing breeders to destroy large numbers of
chicks.

[We are grateful to Joe Dudley for providing additional media-derived
information indicating the involvement of ducks. This falls in line
with the official alert message, sent to the OIE by the Cameroon
authorities on 12 Mar 2006, accessible at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_urgences.htm>.
The message includes, among other things, the following data: "An
outbreak of avian influenza due to highly pathogenic virus subtype
H5N1 was reported in 3 domestic duck farms in Doualare area in
Maroua, Diamare department, northernmost province." - Mod.AS]

[4] Austria, cats, inconclusive
Date: Mon 13 Mar 2006
From: A.D.M.E. Osterhaus <a.osterhaus@erasmusmc.nl>

On Sat 11 Mar 2006, experts of the University of Veterinary Medicine,
the University of Medicine, the Austrian Agency of Health and Food
Safety, the Federal Ministry of Health and Women, and a leading
international expert in the field of influenza, A.D.M.E. Osterhaus,
Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, [held a discussion following] an invitation to
J.G. Thalhammer, Head of the Clinic for Small Animals and Infectious
Diseases, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.
In the discussions, the experts analyzed the report of the suspected
H5N1-positive cats from the animal shelter Arche Noah in Graz in the
light of the sole experimental infections of domestic cats with H5N1
so far available.
All precautions taken were considered meaningful and, for medical
reasons, justified/necessary.
The fact that 3 cats tested positive in a 1st screening could
indicate an infection in these cats. These findings, though, could
also result from a contamination (e.g. bird feces) of the animals
tested.
In the next few weeks, under the necessary quarantine conditions,
more diagnostic tests will be performed to see whether an infection
actually took place or whether there was a contamination at the
animal shelter.
These examinations are carried out in collaboration with
international reference laboratories.
The obtained and validated results will be discussed 1st in the
expert round and published accordingly.

[This timely, firsthand update, kindly forwarded by Prof. Osterhaus,
is appreciated.
Initial media-derived information (20060306.0724) indicated that "3
(out of 170) cats have tested positive for the strain of bird flu;"
it further referred to "sick cats." However, in a later message, the
media reported that the laboratory results were inconclusive; the 3
cats, which initially "tested positive for the virus in saliva"
[PCR?!] "did not show the virus" in probes sampled during the
subsequent week. For the (scanty) published details, see
20060308.0740. It was not clear whether and which clinical disease
symptoms were observed in the 3 cats.
Results of the ongoing investigations are anticipated with interest;
in the meantime, H5N1 infections in the Austrian cats remain
inconclusive. - Mod.AS]
