The Japanese Fisheries Agency reported 26 Nov 1998 that hundred of
thousands of ayu (sweetfish) have been killed by _Cytophaga psychrophila_,
a bacterial disease known as "cold water disease." It is so called because
the bacteria become increasingly virulent in water colder than 18 C.
The losses have occurred at fish farms and in wild stock in Japanese
rivers. In recent years, a nursery in Iwate Prefecture has lost 10 percent
of its stock of 1.8 million fish to the disease, resulting in losses
totaling millions of yen. Other nurseries have reported losses of up to 30
percent.
The bacteria first produce ulcers on the scales of the fish, and then works
its way into the tissues, eventually causing atrophy. Once infected by the
bacteria, fish become weak and highly susceptible to other diseases.
First detected in North American salmon and trout, cold water disease was
discovered in the nation's ayu at a fish farm in Tokushima Prefecture in
1987. The disease spread after ayu bred at the farms were introduced into
the nation's rivers.
Fish farms in Iwate, Kochi, Nagano, Oita, Shiga, Tochigi and Toyama
prefectures have been affected. In fiscal 1996, the disease was reported at
fish farms in 38 prefectures, according to research conducted by the
agency. This year, outbreaks have been confirmed at farms in 27 prefectures.
