Bird flu again detected in Romania
---------------------------------------
Bird flu was detected in poultry in a 3rd village in Romania's
southeastern department of Ialomita, and the birds were quickly
slaughtered.
After quick tests showed the poultry were positive for the H5 virus,
the infected birds were destroyed, and the village of Albesti was
disinfected, said Gabriel Predoi, head of the national authority of
veterinary health, according to the Mediafax news agency Saturday [24
Dec 2005].
It was the 3rd incident of bird flu discovered this week [4th week
December 2005] in the department of Ialomita, following outbreaks in
the villages of Stelnica and Traian. It was not yet known whether the
birds had the H5N1 strain of the virus, which can be lethal for
humans and has claimed about 70 lives in Asia since 2003.
The Romanian agriculture ministry said Thursday [22 Dec 2005] there
were 21 sites where bird flu has been detected in 4 departments to
the east and southeast of the country, close to the borders with
Ukraine and Bulgaria. There have also been isolated cases of the
virus among migratory birds found dead in unpopulated areas.
More than 100 000 head of poultry have been slaughtered in Romania
since the 1st case was discovered on 7 Oct 2005.
