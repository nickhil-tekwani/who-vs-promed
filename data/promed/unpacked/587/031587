---------
In Japan, a P4 laboratory consisting of 2 units was constructed in 1981 at
the
Murayama Branch of National Institute of Health (currently National
Institute
of Infectious Diseases) in Musashi-Murayama City in the suburb of Tokyo.
When designing this facility, I visited several P4 facilities including
those of
CDC, USAMRIID, NCI and MRE at Porton Down as a member of government invest-
igation group on P4 facilities &made a comprehensive survey. From the
safety
aspect, especially in countries where earthquakes occur frequently, we chose
a glove-box type facility instead of suit-type. Unfortunately, the use of
this facility for level 4 experiments was not accepted by local community,
and it is being used only for the level 3 experiments under the agreement
between the minister of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the mayor of
Musashi-Murayama City.
In 1987, we had experienced a patient of Lassa fever
in the hospital of Tokyo University where I had been working, and also some
other suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever thereafter. As we could not use
the P4 facility on these occasions, virological diagnosis was made by kind
help of researchers at CDC.
