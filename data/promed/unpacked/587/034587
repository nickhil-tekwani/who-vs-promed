Nurse dies of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
---------------------------------------------
A nurse who was diagnosed with Crimean-Congo fever (CCHF) without
being bitten by a tick died at the Ankara Numune Hospital yesterday
[24 Jul 2008], and could possibly be the 1st instance of
human-to-human passing of the infection in Turkey. Reports said it is
not yet known how the 27-year-old nurse contracted the disease and
officials are investigating the matter.

The nurse who worked at the orthopedics department in a state
hospital in the western province of Bolu was diagnosed with the
disease 6 days ago and was later transferred to the Ankara hospital.
It was reported that the nurse also worked at the infectious diseases
department at one time. The chief surgeon of Bolu hospital, Dr Hseyin
Ika, said they were looking into how the infection could have
occurred.

The deadly disease [CCHF] is usually associated with tick bites and
the nurse's case may be the 1st case of human-to-human infection in
Turkey. A total of 41 people have died in Turkey from the disease
this year [2008] alone.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever mainly affects animals. Ticks, which
live on sheep and cattle, can sometimes pass the virus onto people.
It is an Ebola-like [that is, hemorrhagic] fever where patients can
bleed to death if they are not treated quickly. Those infected can
transmit the virus through their blood or saliva. The disease is
endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe.

[The CCHF outbreak in Turkey continues to develop. Since the previous
report dated 10 Jul 2008 (see archive reference below), the death
toll has risen from 37 to 41.

While the precise circumstances of the infection of the deceased
nurse are unclear, nosocomial infection in hospital is a serious
concern.

According to the World Health Organisation Fact sheet
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/>):

"When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of
nosocomial [in-hospital] spread of infection. Serious outbreaks have
occurred in this way and it is imperative that adequate infection
control measures be observed to prevent this disastrous outcome.
Patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should be isolated and cared
for using barrier nursing techniques. Specimens of blood or tissues
taken for diagnostic purposes should be collected and handled using
universal precautions. Sharps (needles and other penetrating surgical
instruments) and body wastes should be safely disposed of using
appropriate decontamination procedures. Healthcare workers are at risk
of acquiring infection from sharps injuries during surgical procedures
and, in the past, infection has been transmitted to surgeons operating
on patients to determine the cause of the abdominal symptoms in the
early stages of (at that moment undiagnosed) infection. Healthcare
workers who have had contact with tissue or blood from patients with
suspected or confirmed CCHF should be followed up with daily
temperature and symptom monitoring for at least 14 days after the
putative [supposed] exposure."
