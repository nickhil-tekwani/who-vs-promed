Following the outbreak of norovirus infection in Ilirska Bistrica at the end of 2021, the health institutions have now issued an investigation report. This showed that the source of the infections was not food, but that it was most likely contact transmission through packaging. A total of 139 people were exposed to the infection. "The virus was probably brought into the facility by one of the infected customers, who spread it to the packaging in which the food was stored through contacts on the surfaces that customers touch," the NIJZ said. The authorities therefore proposed a stricter hygiene regimen in the butcher's shop in question, and new infections were not later reported.

[Norovirus can be transmitted by:

- Eating food or drink liquids that are contaminated with norovirus,
- Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your fingers in your mouth, or
- Having direct contact with someone who is infected with norovirus, such as by caring for them or sharing food or eating utensils with them.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection. - Mod.LL
