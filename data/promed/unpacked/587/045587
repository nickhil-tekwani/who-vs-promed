A case of African swine fever has been registered in Kharkiv region: quarantine restrictions are introduced.

Measures that will be implemented in the region to localize the outbreak were discussed at a meeting in KODA [Kharkiv Regional State Administration ] -- with the participation of law enforcement officials.

An outbreak of the disease was recorded on [1 Sep 2021] at the Sloboda National Nature Park in the Bohodukhiv district, where 9 dead wild boar were found.

According to Dmytro Voloshko, Chief State Veterinary Inspector, the selected animal samples were sent to the Regional State Laboratory of the State Food and Consumer Service in Poltava Oblast.

"On [2 Sep 2021] we received an examination to confirm the diagnosis of African swine fever. Therefore, an order was issued to establish temporary quarantine restrictions on ASF," Dmytro Voloshko said.

During the meeting, Oleksandr Skakun, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said that all measures should be taken in accordance with the instructions on the fight against ASF.

"This situation needs to be taken under control and to prevent the spread of the disease, as it is about the National Natural Park "Sloboda", -- said the acting head of the Kharkiv Regional Administration.

In particular, a temporary quarantine restriction for African swine fever in the epizootic zone for 72 years has been established. We have established a time protection zone with a radius of 3 km [1.8 mi] from the epizootic zone, which includes the territory of Sloboda National Nature Park, part of the settlements of Olenivske village, Murafa village, Lisne, and Krasnokutsk village council. They also determined the limits of the watchdog zone -- a radius of 10 km [6.2 mi] -- from the outer limits of the protection zone.

The accounting of all pigs in farms of all forms of ownership in the protection and surveillance zone will be carried out. In addition, it was decided to temporarily ban the movement of live pigs from quarantine zones. The police are now investigating the circumstances under which pigs became infected with African swine fever.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodorus_. The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. - Mod.PMB
