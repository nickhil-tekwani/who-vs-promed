A LaVale, Maryland woman is undergoing post exposure rabies treatments after a deer found in her yard tested positive for the disease.

According to Maryland DNR (Department of Natural Resources) Wildlife Biologist Jim Mullan the mature doe was found earlier this month [July 2012]. The deer suffered cuts and abrasions most likely from being hit by a car.

When Mullen arrived the deer was lying under the bumper of a parked car and made no attempt to escape. The deer was euthanized and samples were collected for Chronic Wasting Disease and since the deer reportedly chased a dog and kicked the homeowner they also tested for rabies. Those tests came back positive.

The last time a deer tested positive for rabies in Maryland was 3 or 4 years ago [2008/2009] in Frederick County. In Pennsylvania a rabid deer was found this past year[2011]. All mammals are capable of contacting rabies, but the incidence in deer is very low. Raccoons, skunks, foxes and bats are more frequently infected.

[As this article points out, any mammal can be susceptible to rabies. Some animals, such as skunks and bats seem to be more likely to have rabies, but any mammal is susceptible to this disease.

What is not entirely clear is if the home owner was only kicked, or if there was other contact with the deer.
