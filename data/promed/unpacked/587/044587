Die Volksblad reports that a sheep farmer from Namibia, age 40, died on Tuesday [16 Sep 2014] from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

CCHF is, like Ebola, a viral haemorrhagic fever and the symptoms are similar. In both cases the patient needs to be quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus.

The man was in Upington to attend a wedding when he started feeling ill and was taken to the emergency room at the local hospital. The doctor gave him an injection for tonsillitis and sent him home, Die Burger reported. By Friday [12 Sep 2014], during the wedding and feeling worse, he returned to the hospital where CCHF was dismissed since his blood platelet count was normal. That evening, Dirk Kok reports for OFM, the man was flown to Bloemfontein by air ambulance service Aerocare. The pilot and paramedic on board wore special medical suits to protect them from contracting the highly contagious disease. Despite the hospital staff's best efforts, the man passed away on Tuesday evening [16 Sep 2014].

According to the print edition of Die Burger (18 Sep 2014), family are now struggling to get his body back to Namibia as the corpse needs to be sealed to prevent transmission. Like with Ebola, human-to-human transmission can occur from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons, even after death.

People with CCHF suffer from flu-like symptoms and haemorrhaging. According to the WHO, CCHF [virus] is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals.

The virus is transmitted mainly by _Hyalomma_ ticks, which have distinctive brown and white bands on their legs and are known in South Africa as bont-legged ticks (Afrikaans: bontpootbosluise). _Hyalomma_ ticks are widely distributed in South Africa, but tend to be most numerous in the drier, north-western parts of the country in the Karoo, western Free State, Northern Cape and North-West Province, generally in the rural areas.

The WHO reports there are about 30 species of _Hyalomma_ and that CCHF [virus] is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia south of the 50 degree parallel north.

Congo fever is, like Ebola, a viral haemorrhagic disease and the symptoms and disease progression share many similarities.

CCHF virus can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying host. It is the commonest viral haemorrhagic fever occurring in South Africa, with between 5 and 25 cases reported annually.

There is no vaccine available for either people or animals. Up to 30 per cent of patients who contract CCHF will die, but the prognosis is favourable in the remaining 70 per cent.

[As noted above, CCHF virus is endemic in all of Africa. As Mod.CP noted (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100810.2732), CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, which is why the air ambulance pilot and paramedic on board wore personal protective gear to protect them from exposure to the virus. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
