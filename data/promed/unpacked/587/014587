A suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was reported
Thursday [8 Apr 2010] from a cattle farm on an island off the western
coast of South Korea, the farm ministry said.

Ten cattle on the farm on Ganghwa Island in Incheon, west of Seoul,
have developed blisters on the mouth, one of symptoms for the
disease, quarantine authorities said.
