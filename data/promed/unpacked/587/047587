[Minnesota] state health officials have confirmed 3 _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses linked to swimming in Lake Minnetonka [located in Hennepin and Carver counties], the state's 1st waterborne outbreak of the summer [2013]. The illnesses occurred in young adults who reported swimming and boating in the Big Island area of the lake on 4 Jul 2013. One person was hospitalized and has since recovered.

All public beaches on Lake Minnetonka remain open and have passed their regular water quality monitoring tests, the department added. The source of the outbreak is unknown. Lakes can be contaminated by animal waste, septic systems or sewage spills, improper boat waste disposal or ill swimmers, the department said.

Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist Trisha Robinson said the best way to prevent water illness is by keeping germs out of the water in the 1st place. Contamination of any size can cause problems in the water.

[This is the 2nd lake-related _E. coli_ cluster reported this week. EHEC can be spread in many ways in addition to the prototypical under-cooked hamburger scenario that functioned as this pathogen's initial entrance onto the enteric pathogen scene in the early 1980s. Contamination of vegetables that are eaten without cooking, such as those in a salad, is recognized as a major method, as are direct or indirect livestock contact at a petting zoo, and either drinking or recreational water contamination as occurred here. - Mod.LL
