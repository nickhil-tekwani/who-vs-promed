Kenya: More Rift Valley fever deaths in North Eastern Province
---------------------------------------------------------
Rift Valley fever has claimed 11 more lives in North Eastern Province
in the past week, raising the death toll from the region to 100. The
total cumulative cases so far recorded at various health facilities
in the region now stand at 357.
Provincial Medical Officer Dr. Ahmmed Omar said he has received 9
blood samples for screening from Isiolo and that results will be out
soon. He said only one patient is currently admitted at the Garissa
Provincial General hospital isolation ward. Dr. Omar said that most
of the deaths occurred in Bura, Sangailu, Hara & Ijara Divisions.
He appealed to local communities to adhere to the measures put in
place by the government to control the disease. Meanwhile, all
livestock slaughtering points in Meru north district have been closed
down indefinitely to control the spread of Rift valley fever from the
affected neighboring districts. The district veterinary officer, Dr.
Leonard Arithi, said the closure had been prompted by an influx of
livestock from neighboring districts, which have reported cases of
the disease. Dr. Arithi said some unscrupulous livestock traders have
continued delivering animals to slaughter points despite a ban placed
on livestock markets and the closure of livestock movement routes in
the area by the government.
