A Coconino County man is being treated in a New Mexico hospital for a
hantavirus infection, the third recognized case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS) reported in Arizona this year. The 43-year-old man arrived
at the hospital Wednesday. He was in serious but improving condition,
according to hospital spokesman Greg Johnston.
The man is the second Coconino County resident to contract [Sin Nombre
virus] this year. The other man, a Parks resident, recovered. The third
Arizona victim was an Apache County woman who died of the disease.
University Hospital has developed an expertise in treating hantavirus cases,
an often deadly respiratory illness that most often occurs in the Southwest.
"The hospital has treated more hantavirus patients than any other hospital
in the country," Johnston said. The hospital has used an experimental
treatment called ECMO [extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation] for many
patients, but the last 4 patients have not needed the procedure, he said.
ECMO is typically used for babies with respiratory problems. A machine
circulates and adds oxygen to a person's blood, doing what the heart and
lungs may be too crippled to handle.
The hospital has treated 11 hantavirus patients this year - 7 from New
Mexico, 3 from Arizona and one from Colorado. In all, there have been 14
cases of hantavirus this year in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.

[Make that 15 cases; there was another last week in the Durango, Colorado,
area, very near our study site. We are seeing many more deer mice than we
have ever seen there and, along with high prevalence of antibody to Sin
Nombre virus, this makes for a potentially dangerous situation. Two of the
recent cases have been quite mild and have not been classified as being HPS
but "hantavirus infections". - Mod CHC]
