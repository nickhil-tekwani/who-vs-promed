[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 198 513, with 80 894 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 117 619 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 165 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 15 895 cases when compared with the data on 16 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 3526 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1178 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 93 of the newly reported cases. Spain (1884), Germany (2095), France (1097), and the USA (1801) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 59.3% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. A global total of 7988 deaths have been reported, 4751 outside mainland China.

For the 20th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of Mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by Mainland China. And for the 4th day, the number of newly confirmed cases from South Korea was less than 100. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, a total of 80 894 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 13 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (16 Mar 2020) report was prepared.

It is now the 9th consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country. In addition, 11 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. 10 new cases were reported from Hong Kong. After more than 2.5 months of no newly confirmed cases, Macau has been confirming 1 new case a day for the past 3 days.

There were 12 imported cases into China confirmed, representing 92.3% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Hence, all but one of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases. Cases were reported by Guangdong (5), Beijing (3), Shanghai (3), and Sichuan (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 155. As I keep mentioning, a challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China. The 1 remaining case with local transmission, was from Wuhan in Hubei province. Interpretation: Wuhan is the location within China where the SARS-CoV-2 is still being transmitted. Albeit it appears to be approaching interruption of transmission. I remain interested in seeing a table of locations of origin of imported cases.

In the 18 Mar 2020 Mar 2020 English language webpage (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030): population rates per 100 000 by province were added.

Additional information from the 17 Mar 2020 English language webpage:

- Epidemiological links have been found for 80.6% of the total cases; 19.4% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 1 [at the URL above] on the next page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2 [source URL]. A graph of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1 [source URL].

- 5 additional confirmed cases have been reported from the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul, amounting to a current total of 134 confirmed cases from the call center since [8 Mar 2020]. Investigations of the confirmed cases who are onset of symptom at the end of February [2020] revealed that they are not Shincheonji members, have no recent history of overseas travel, and have no known link to other confirmed cases.

- A current total of 47 confirmed cases have been reported from a church (Grace River Church) in Gyeonggi Province since 9 March. Further investigation and contact tracing are underway.

- The KCDC released the data it has collected on the characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 cases (patients aged 18 years old or younger). A total of 352 confirmed pediatric cases have been reported, among whom 56 have been discharged and 296 are currently in isolation. Discharge rate for pediatric patients is 15.9%, compared to 16.8% for all ages. There has been no fatalities. No severe cases occurred. Further detailed analysis of pediatric cases is underway. More data will be made available as soon as the analysis is completed.

- In light of the recent rise in the number of confirmed cases from airport quarantine, the KCDC announced that the Special Entry Procedure will be extended to all travelers arriving at port beginning at 0:00 of [19 Mar 2020]. The Special Entry Procedure requires the traveler to be checked for fever, provide a confirmed contact information at port entry, and report their symptoms daily for the next 14 days via self-health check mobile app. Travel history of all travelers entering Korea will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System for reference.

- Travelers who have visited Europe, the US, or Asia in the past 14 days are advised to minimize movement, adhere to social distancing personal hygiene measures, since infected persons with mild symptoms in initial stages of the disease may unknowingly transmit the virus to other people.

- The KCDC will be having a conference meeting with WHO clinical team/COVID-19 advisors, representatives of relevant institutions, and domestic experts and researchers. This meeting, initiated by WHO who expressed interest in participating in the COVID-19 cohort research by domestic healthcare professionals, is expected to be helpful in developing future strategies for responding to the global pandemic.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 84 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (16-17 Mar 2020) when there were 84 newly confirmed cases. This is the 2nd consecutive day that the number of confirmed cases has increased. Looking at the number of cases per province, many of the provinces had an increase in number of newly confirmed cases. The epicenter of this outbreak is still Daegu province with 6144 reported cases and the surrounding province of Gyeongbuk with 1178 reported cases. Looking at the population based rates, Daegu 252.17 per 100 000 population and Gyeongbuk had a rate of 44.24 per 100 000 population, supporting the observation they are the epicenters of this outbreak in South Korea. There were 11 provinces not reporting any new cases in the previous update, but only 4 provinces not reporting any new cases in this current update. . Interestingly there are now 11 individuals in quarantine (up from 6 the day before), detected through airport screening, who have tested positive showing that imported cases may potentially lead to more chains of transmission if not identified early.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 31 506 cases, including 2503 deaths, up from 27 980 cases and 2158 deaths reported on 16 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 16 and 17 Mar 2020 was 3526 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3233 newly confirmed cases between 15 and 16 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (16 220), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (3931), and Venice (2704), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 62.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, down from 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, a single drop but it may signal increasing cases outside of this region. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 16 169 cases, 988 deaths

https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/coronavirus-iran-reports-135-new-virus-deaths-raising-total-to-988-1.1584444129451


Iran announced on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] another 135 deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the overall toll to 988 in one of the world's worst-hit countries. "Reports by more than 56 laboratories indicated that we have had 1178 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in the past 24 hours," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. "This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 16 169 as of today noon [17 Mar 2020]," he added.

Jahanpour also said 5389 people who were infected had been discharged from hospitals "with general good health."

Tehran province recorded the highest number of new infections with 273 fresh cases. Alborz, to the west of Tehran, was next with 116, followed by East Azerbaijan with 78.

"As of this morning [17 Mar 2020], more than 15 million of our countrymen have been screened" for symptoms, he said. The official reiterated calls for Iranians to stay at home during the outbreak and asked them to report possible symptoms on a ministry website.

The website identifies the individual using their national identity number and asks if they have symptoms such as coughing or fever. It also asks if anyone suspected of having the virus, under treatment or recently recovered lives with them. If the symptoms are not serious, it advises them to stay at home and tells them where the nearest healthcare centre is located.

[In the 24 hours from 16 to 17 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 14 991 to 16 169 an increase of 1178 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 853 to 988, an increase of 115 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among passengers and crew on a cruise ship led to quarantine of approximately 3700 passengers and crew that began on [3 Feb 2020], and lasted for nearly 4 weeks at the Port of Yokohama, Japan (1). By [9 Feb 2020] 20 cases had occurred among the ship's crew members. By the end of quarantine, approximately 700 cases of COVID-19 had been laboratory-confirmed among passengers and crew. This report describes findings from the initial phase of the cruise ship investigation into COVID-19 cases among crew members during [4-12 Feb 2020].

On [1 Feb 2020], a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was identified in a passenger who had developed symptoms on [23 Jan 2020] and disembarked on [25 Jan 2020], before the ship arrived in Yokohama. Another passenger with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 had developed symptoms on [22 Jan 2020] and was on the ship when it arrived in Yokohama on [3 Feb 2020]. All symptomatic passengers were tested upon arrival in Yokohama, and those with positive results were disembarked [4 and 5 Feb 2020]. The index patient for this outbreak could not be determined. On [5 Feb 2020], passengers remaining on the ship were requested to observe 14-day quarantine in their cabins. Approximately 2 thirds of the persons on board were passengers staying in cabins located on decks 5-12. The remainder (N = 1068) were crew members, greater than 80% of whose cabins were on decks 2-4. Crew members remained on board the ship at all times and had not disembarked during port calls. After quarantine began, crew members continued to perform their regular duties, delivered meals to passengers, and remained in their cabins when they were not working; symptomatic crew members were required to remain in their cabins.

Because the 1st detected cases occurred among passengers who became symptomatic on[ 22 and 23 Jan 2020], COVID-19 was likely transmitted 1st from passengers to crew members and subsequently spread among the crew, especially among food service workers. The 1st case detected in a crew member occurred in a food service worker who developed fever on [2 Feb 2020]. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test performed by the Yokohama quarantine office laboratory was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, and the crew member was permitted to disembark in Yokohama on [4 Feb 2020]. By [9 Feb 2020], a total of 20 cases* among crew members had been laboratory-confirmed, including 3 in those who reported close contact with other crew members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before implementation of quarantine. Seven ill crew members had symptom onset within 3 days of the start of quarantine, indicating that some SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely occurred before the implementation of quarantine.

The crew dining area was identified as the primary area of congregation for the crew; passengers did not have access to this part of the ship. The earliest laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in crew members occurred in food service workers; 15 of the 20 confirmed cases in crew members occurred among food service workers who prepared food for other crew members, and 16 of the 20 cases occurred among persons with cabins on deck 3, the deck on which the food service workers lived ([Table: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and fever status among crew members aboard a cruise ship (N = 1068) - Yokohama, Japan, February 2020; available at the source URL above]). Until [6 Feb 2020], no mechanism for systematic testing was implemented; only crew members who visited the medical clinic with symptoms were tested, and information on the total number of tests administered is not available.

The cruise ship company administered a questionnaire to all crew members on [3 Feb 2020], at which time 3 crew members reported subjective fever. A 2nd survey of crew members was conducted on [9 Feb 2020] at which time fever was reported by 31 crew members, 20 (65%) of whom were food service workers.

Interviews were conducted with 9 crew members with confirmed COVID-19 on [12 Feb 2020], just before their disembarkation; 3 of these patients reported close contact with other crew members with confirmed COVID-19 before their symptoms began. These interviews indicated that infection had apparently spread among persons whose cabins were on the same deck (deck 3) and who worked in the same occupational group (food service), probably through contact or droplet spread, which is consistent with current understanding of COVID-19 transmission (2). 8 of 20 crew members with confirmed COVID-19 had cabin mates; investigators later learned that following disembarkation, as of [4 Mar 2020], 5 of the 8 cabin mates had also developed COVID-19.

This investigation underscores the need for swift epidemiologic investigation as soon as a COVID-19 case is detected in an area or group where a large number of persons gather in a closed or crowded setting (such as a cruise ship, music club, health care setting, sports arena, or gymnasium). These settings have been previously associated with infections spread by contact or droplet, such as influenza (3). Close contacts of persons with confirmed COVID-19 should self-quarantine and monitor their symptoms; persons who develop COVID-19 symptoms while on board a ship should be isolated to limit transmission to other passengers and crew [https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/maritime/recommendations-for-ships.html].

[Cruise ships have been "front and center" as a part of this ongoing pandemic, as they have with prior ship-associated outbreaks related to foodborne pathogens. That being said, it is interesting that the highest number of crew-associated cases were among food handlers. What is not mentioned is whether the same food handlers rotated between passenger food preparation and crew food preparation. In addition, it would be interesting to see 2 epidemic curves, side by side, by date of onset of symptoms, one for the crew and one for the passengers. - Mod.MPP]

A. 17 year old develops an online COVID monitoring system
Date: Fri 13 Mar 2020

https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/13/meet_the_17_year_old_behind


A teenager's website tracking coronavirus has become one of the most vital resources for people seeking accurate and updated numbers on the pandemic. The URL is https://ncov2019.live/data. We speak with 17-year-old Avi Schiffmann, a high school junior from Mercer Island outside Seattle, who started the site in late December 2019, when coronavirus had not yet been detected outside of China. Now the site has been visited by tens of millions, from every country on Earth.

Amy Goodman [AG]...The site tracks deaths, numbers of cases locally and globally, and it talks about the number of people who have recovered. It also provides an interactive map, information on the disease, and a Twitter feed. The resource, which updates every minute or so, pulls information from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and elsewhere.

Avi Schiffman [AS] Yeah, I started this website around Christmas of last year [2019 -- probably means "during the Christmas break", as public domain news did not start carrying information on this outbreak until 30 Dec 2019]. And I mean, the main goal of it was to provide just an easy way to see the straight facts and the data, without having to make a website that was biased or full of ads or anything like that. So you can go on a phone and just instantly see the quick facts. You can see the total amount of cases, the total deaths and, all that kind of information. And you can get that for individual countries, and now US states, too. I didn't want to make it hard. You shouldn't have to go through government websites and download daily PDFs that are probably out of date by the time you read them, and have to go through all kinds of complicated things just to see the straight facts. So, that was the main reason why I wanted to make this website.

[AG] What first sparked your interest to do this?

[AS]................. when I started this website, there was less than [about] 1000 total cases, and they were all in the Wuhan area of China. So, I saw this on the news kind of a long time ago, and I noticed that it was really hard just to find the information. And there was a lot of misinformation spreading. So I decided it would be kind of cool to create a website and kind of make it like a central hub of information.

[AG] ...you have the number of people affected overall in the globe, and then by country, and then by region. You have the number of people who have died. And you have the number of people who have recovered. Talk about how that came into being.

[AS].... that wasn't there for quite a while. And I started to get a lot of emails saying that the site was kind of overly negative. And I decided that it would be really cool if I could show how many people were recovering, to give people a more positive outlook and maybe more hope. So I added that to the quick facts. In every single country, you can see how many people have recovered, which I think gives people a lot of hope, because you can see, in places like Korea, I think, they reported more people that recovered today than people that had been infected, which is really big. And I'm also working on things like a vaccine tracker to continue making it more positive, because it shouldn't have to be super negative and you only see the amount of people that have died.

B. Swiss surge capacity approaching challenge
Date: Tue 17 Mar 2020 8:02 AM CET
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-swiss/swiss-hospitals-face-collapse-in-10-days-if-virus-keeps-spreading-idUSKBN2140SM


Switzerland's health care system could collapse by the end of the month [March 2020] if the new coronavirus keeps spreading at current rates, a government official warned on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020]. Swiss authorities estimated that 2650 people had tested positive for the coronavirus and said 19 people had died, while predicting cases will likely soar in the weeks ahead. Exact figures were unavailable. Daniel Koch, head of the Federal Office of Health's communicable diseases division, said the rapid rise had outstripped the state's ability to record new cases in real time.

Koch urged residents to observe strict emergency measures ordered this week, including bans on events and gatherings, calling these critical in limiting the damage and protecting hospitals from a potential collapse.

"People who become infected today will only hit us in 10 days from now," Koch said at a news conference. "We have to make sure the infection rate goes down today, because otherwise, in 10 days (Swiss hospitals) won't be able to handle it."

Switzerland has mobilised up to 8000 military members to assist civil authorities and medical personnel. The country of 8.6 million can muster 1000 to 1200 intensive care beds, although Koch said there was only limited staff to operate life-saving equipment like ventilators now in desperate demand in neighbouring Italy, where more than 2100 have died.

This week the World Health Organization called on all countries to ramp up testing to slow the pandemic's advance, while urging companies to boost production of vital equipment to overcome shortages. In an attempt to deal with growing numbers of suspected cases, a large blue tent was erected overnight outside the University Hospital of Geneva to screen and test the sick. A Reuters witness saw a handful of people ushered inside by an official wearing a mask and gloves on Tuesday afternoon [17 Mar 2020].

The hospital said it was planning to double its intensive care capacity by adding more beds to existing rooms. Koch defended Switzerland's evolving policy to focus testing on people most at risk and those who might need hospitalisation, rather than trying to test every person with mild symptoms. The government is urging those individuals -- mostly younger, healthy people -- to isolate themselves at home and halt contact with older or immune-compromised people.

"Initially you test as broadly as possible," Koch said. "This phase is over in Europe. It is impossible at the moment ... to test everyone who might have been infected."

Subject in focus: update on partner coordination with international travel, transport, and tourism sectors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the on-going coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to develop, WHO is committed to working together with the travel, transport and tourism sectors on emergency preparedness and response.

In a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport, points of entry (PoEs) -- airports, ports, and ground crossings -- can play a key role in the international spread of diseases through travellers, conveyances, and goods. The travel and transport sectors are indispensable actors in public health emergency preparedness and response actions related to PoEs.

WHO has published three joint statements to remind all stakeholders of the importance of following International Health Regulations and guidance, existing regulations of partner organizations, and the need for cross-sector collaboration. The joint statements were released respectively, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Documents/Circular%20Letter%20No.4204-Add.2%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20Imo-Who%20On%20The%20Response%20To%20The%20Covid-19%20Outbreak%20(Secretariat).pdf), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/Pages/Statements.aspx) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2020-a-joint-statement-on-tourism-and-covid-19---unwto-and-who-call-for-responsibility-and-coordination)

With input from IMO, ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and UNWTO as well as major industry associations, WHO has produced and continues to develop comprehensive COVID-19 technical guidance on maritime and aviation traffic and ground crossings. These include:
- Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on board ships (Interim guidance); (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships)
- Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry -- international airports, seaports and ground crossings -- in the context of COVID-19 outbreak; (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/management-of-ill-travellers-at-points-of-entry-international-airports-seaports-and-ground-crossings-in-the-context-of-covid--19-outbreak)
- Public health preparedness and response for aviation sector; (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/handbook-for-the-management-of-public-health-events-in-air-transport-updated-with-information-on-ebola-virus-disease-and-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus)
- Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board ships; (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships) and the
- Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships. (https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241549462/en/)

Additionally, guidance on operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreak in aviation, scaling up preparedness for COVID-19 at ground crossings, and managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in hotels and other travel and tourism accommodations are under development and will be available soon.

WHO also regularly updates travel advice to support emergency preparedness, which is available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice). ICAO is also publishing a dedicated website with specific resources (https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx), and guidance for airlines industries and national authorities. Similarly, IMO (http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx) and UNWTO (https://www.unwto.org/tourism-covid-19-coronavirus) host dedicated websites with resources and guidance for their members and stakeholders.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 159. This includes 13 countries (including 2 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 56 countries (including 4 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 18 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 37 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 27 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 98 896, including 4191 deaths. The countries of the WHO/EURO region have reported a total of 64 189 cases (64.9% of total cases reported outside of China) and in the past 24 hours have reported 8506 newly confirmed cases representing 74.1% of the newly reported cases outside of China.

Figure 2 . Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [17 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
