As of 24 Nov 2005, the Ministry of Health in China has confirmed a further
case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which
was fatal, occurred in a 35-year-old woman who worked as a farmer in the
southeastern province of Anhui. She developed symptoms on 11 Nov 2005, was
hospitalized on 15 Nov 2005 and died on 22 Nov 2005.
This is the 3rd laboratory-confirmed case reported in China and the 2nd from
Anhui Province. Of these cases, 2 have been fatal.
The Chinese Ministry of Health has invited WHO to participate in a joint
mission to Anhui Province. The mission will review laboratory findings and
investigate the exposure histories of the 2 cases reported there.
Since mid-October 2005, China has reported a recurrence of poultry outbreaks
in several parts of the country.

[Contrary to the practice with other East Asian countries, it seems that the
WHO may not be requiring cases confirmed in laboratories in mainland China to
be confirmed independently by the WHO-designated laboratory in the Hong Kong
S.A.R. - Mod.CP]
