While there has been a marked increase in cases of blackleg in Zimbabwe due
to shortage of vaccine, caused by acute shortage of foreign currency to
purchase the vaccine, there seems to be an error in the number of cases in
the last [ProMED-mail] report.
Last year [2001] the whole country recorded 594 cases of blackleg. To date
[in 2002] 778 cases of blackleg have been recorded nationally.

[Indeed, in the initial posting of 28 Sep 2002 significantly higher number
of cases were quoted, followed by Dr Songer's questions about their
accuracy, and ProMED-mail's request for clarification from Zimbabwe. We are
grateful to Dr Gwarada for this swift and authoritative clarification. -
