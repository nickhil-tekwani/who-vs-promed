A "dangerous disease" has hit the country's tomato produce. The epidemic seems to have hit in the southeastern [province] of Al-Basra [and] has caused thousands of tonnes of tomatoes to turn rotten. The reason for the epidemic is still unknown.

[A number of tomato diseases have been reported from the region, many of them can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. Rotting of tomato fruits, both pre- and postharvest, can be due to a number of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Late blight (_Phytophthora infestans_) causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits and poses a risk wherever tomatoes and potatoes are grown; it can cause up to 100 per cent crop loss (for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Reliable molecular diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the reported problems.
