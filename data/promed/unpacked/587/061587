The lady from Torit turned out to be positive for HEV [hepatitis E
virus] IgM and IgG but negative for yellow fever markers, based on
laboratory results from the CDC Uganda Viral laboratory.

[The original report was of an imported yellow fever (YF) case from
the city of Torit, the capital of the state of Eastern Equatoria,
Republic of Southern Sudan, discovered in Palabek, Kitgum district,
Uganda (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110926.2922). The original
report indicated that the affected individual had YF. As noted above,
laboratory tests ruled out YF virus infection and diagnosed hepatitis
E virus infection, which can produce symptoms similar to YF virus
infection.

The US CDC states (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HEV/index.htm,
edited) "Hepatitis E is a serious liver disease caused by the
hepatitis E virus (HEV) that usually results in an acute infection. It
does not lead to a chronic infection. Hepatitis E is common in many
parts of the world. Transmission occurs through ingestion of fecal
matter, even in microscopic amounts. Outbreaks are usually associated
with contaminated water supply in countries with poor sanitation.
There is currently no FDA-approved vaccine for Hepatitis E."
