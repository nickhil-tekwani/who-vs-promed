Delayed Influenza Vaccine Availability for 2001/2002 Season
-----------------------------------------------------------
Manufacturer projections of vaccine distribution for the 2001/2002
influenza season suggest that 49.8 million doses will be available for
delivery by the end of Oct 2001.* This is approximately 26 million fewer
doses of influenza vaccine than were available by the end of October 1999
(75.8 million doses). Manufacturers also project distribution of 27.3
million doses in Nov and Dec 2001, bringing the cumulative projected total
to 77.1 million doses, which is greater than in 2000 (70.4) and comparable
with 1999 (76.8). Predictions of monthly vaccine distribution vary by
manufacturer, and providers will probably receive vaccine on different
schedules.
Because of the 2001/2002 influenza season vaccine delay and the large
number of doses projected for distribution in Nov and Dec, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has developed supplemental
recommendations. The goals of these recommendations are 1) to prioritize
and phase in the use of vaccine for the 2001/2002 influenza season to
ensure that persons at greatest risk for severe influenza and its
complications and their health-care providers receive vaccine early in the
influenza season, and 2) to increase overall protection of those at
greatest risk for severe influenza and its complications as targeted in the
Healthy People 2010 objectives (1).
Persons at high risk include those aged >65 years; nursing home and other
chronic-care facility residents; adults and children with chronic disorders
of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, including asthma; adults and
children who required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during
the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including
diabetes), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression,
including that caused by medications or human immunodeficiency virus;
children and teenagers (aged 6 months to 18 years) who receive long-term
aspirin therapy; and women who will be in the second or third trimester of
pregnancy during the influenza season (2). Achieving influenza vaccination
goals will require the combined actions of vaccine providers; the public;
manufacturers, distributors, and vendors; and health departments and other
organizations providing vaccine.

"Manufacturers predict vaccine production based on anticipated demand,
production capacity, historic and current experience with yield of vaccine,
and duration of production. Accuracy of predictions may be affected by
production problems such as strain yields, lot failure, or good
manufacturing practices (GMP) issues. One manufacturer that did not produce
vaccine in 2000 because of GMP problems has withdrawn from the market.
